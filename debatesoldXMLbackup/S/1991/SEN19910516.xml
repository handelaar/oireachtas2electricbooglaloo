      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take (a) items 2 and 3 on the Order Paper and, (b) subject to the Local Government Bill, 1991, being received from the Dáil &mdash; (i) motions regarding arrangements for the taking of business for the remainder of this week, and (ii) the Local Government Bill, 1991, itself. It is also proposed that the sitting be suspended from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.; that item 3 be taken at 2 p.m. and that the motions regarding the taking of business and the Local Government Bill, 1991, be taken at 6 p.m. if the Bill is received from the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an amazing Order of Business. If it did not deal with the Local Government Bill &mdash; perhaps one of the most important pieces of legislation awaited in this House &mdash; we would nearly let it go, given the obvious difficulties being experienced by the Leader of the House. What I have heard effectively is, if I understand the Leader of the House correctly &mdash; and please correct me if I am wrong &mdash; that if they are finished with the Local Government Bill in the Dáil, if nothing more comes out of reform, or if there are no changes on Report Stage, it will be here at 6 p.m. If there are changes, it will not, or it might be, or it may be <Col N="1970" /> here later, or it might be here tomorrow. I really think the Leader of the House deserves to tease out the situation a little more fully. As I understand it, even if we have the Bill at 6 p.m. it must be through all Stages by tomorrow evening, because the President must have it, we are told, by the weekend, if that is correct.</P>
      <P>Assuming we get the Bill today I would like an explanation why this House is being treated purely as a rubber stamp and as a nuisance to the Government. Really, we are getting in their way of proceeding with their business. That is a great discredit to the Government and to this House. The Leader owes it to this House, to the dignity of this House and to the constitutional reason why this House was formed, to explain why we are being treated in this way on this important legislation. I can assure you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader, those on the other side of the House that we, on this side, will not tolerate any bully-boy tactics. We will not let any Bill &mdash; particularly a Bill of the status of the Local Government Bill &mdash; be jackbooted through this House, be it this evening, tomorrow or next week. I await a full and detailed explanation from the Leader of the House as to exactly what will happen with the Local Government Bill in regard to its passage through this House, so that we may tease out in detail, as we are charged to do as Members of this House, the contents of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I would also ask the Leader of the House when we will be having the pleasure of the company of the Minister for Agriculture and Food to put on the record of this House the allegations made in the TV programme on Monday night, as I requested yesterday. As I felt I received a reasonably positive response from the Leader of the House I look forward to finding out today when we will have time for the Seanad to deliberate on this issue affecting a most important industry in our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are being reduced to the ranks of a Chamber-in-Waiting on the basis of the Leader's proposals for <Col N="1971" /> today's Order of Business. This is unprecedented. We will be determining the business on the basis of what might finish at a particular hour, or whatever hour, in the other House today. It brings the operation of this House into disrepute. It is an unacceptable way to do business. It reminds me of the way in which the Central Bank Bill and other Bills have been rushed through on previous occasions. This Bill may not come to this House today because of the way it is being dealt with. It is being presented as a most serious legislation by all parties on all sides. People may have reservations about certain aspects of it. Without a shadow of a doubt those of us who are neutral on this issue cannot accept that this is the way to do justice to what is being heralded and proposed as a most serious piece of legislation. It is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks as if 6 p.m. is a very dangerous hour in Irish political life. We are facing the guillotine at 6 p.m. this evening. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy, did his somersault yesterday evening at 6 p.m. The Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, fired Deputy Lenihan at around 6 p.m. earlier this year. It is a pity that this legislation is going to be handled in this manner. It is hotch-potch; it is instant legislation, and it is no way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he has any information in relation to the publication of the Payment of Wages Bill by the Department of Labour, and if he has any information could he inform the House if that Bill will be initiated in this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague, Senator Doyle, in asking the Leader of the House to reconsider his proposal. I found it extremely difficult to understand what he was proposing to do. Perhaps he might repeat it for our benefit. Is Senator Doyle's interpretation of what <Col N="1972" /> the Leader is purported to have said correct? If it is correct, I join with her completely. I would like the Leader of the House, on a point of order, to clarify that position. If she is correct and if Senator Upton is correct, I agree with them that it is terribly inadequate parliamentary behaviour. We had this previously concerning the Broadcasting Bill which was rushed into the Seanad, in which we had compelling reasons to seek amendments to a Bill which could not be agreed by the Government because of the urgency that weekend of the President signing the legislation. It is treating this Assembly like a rubber stamp. It is demeaning our status. On a point of order, I would like the Leader of the House to clarify if the interpretation of Senator Doyle is the correct interpretation. I would suggest that if she is correct we should review this Order of Business as it is highly unsatisfactory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have spent ten years in this House in about three months' time. I have never in that period heard such an extraordinary proposal for the Order of Business. It gives me particular pain to say it because the present Leader of the House has made a considerable effort to improve the operations of this House to the satisfaction of all of us. I say this more, in the words of the cliché, in sorrow than in anger, because I know it is probably not his fault. It is being foisted on him.</P>
      <P>The first thing one can say is that if a Government treat the second House of the Oireachtas with the sort of contempt we are now being treated with, how could they possibly take the devolution of power to other levels of government around the country the least bit seriously? All the reservations that have been expressed about this legislation, and the way it will be abused by Government, are quite clearly epitomised in the way the Government are abusing this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say, too, that I would have expected, from you, Sir, given the sensitivities that were displayed here yesterday for propriety and for ordering of business in accordance with the highest <Col N="1973" /> standards your defence of this House when we are being abused by the Government and by the Leader in this fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>My function rests in another area. I had enough unacceptable remarks from you yesterday. Regardless of what your judgments are, I want to tell you here and now that it is not my function to order business in this House. If you do not know that after ten years, then I cannot help you.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I also express concern at the way in which this House is being treated? It is all of a piece with the Government's attitude, who seem to be bothered by the existence of this House and merely want to use it as a rubber stamp? I would also say that although, you may well be correct in your ruling in terms of the rules of this House, in terms of logic there is a defect in what the Leader has proposed which would be excluded by the operation of the term known as Occam's razor which forbids, in logic, the hypothetical use of the nonexistent. The Bill does not exist until it is passed by the Dáil. Therefore, its proposed discussion in this House is complete and utter nonsense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the thought the learned philospher, Mr. Occam, addressed. It is one which appears to be lost on the Leader of the House.

      <P>On the Order of Business, I hope the Leader of the House can clarify the position in regard to what Senator Doyle, Senator O'Toole and others have said in relation to the either/or Order of Business and the two Orders of Business apparently touted by the Leader. In relation to the Bill arriving at 6 p.m., we can at least see a certain situation there. If it does not arrive here at 6 p.m., what arrangements will be made? Could I ask the Leader to inform Senators as to the time it might arrive at? Could I ask the Leader of the House, in that scenario, to say what is going to happen?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>What I said on the Order of Business was that I was ordering items Nos. 2 and 3 on the Order Paper, and, subject to the Local Government Bill, 1991, being received from the Dáil, motions regarding arrangements for the taking of business for the remainder of this week' that is, the Local Government Bill, 1991, that the sitting today be suspended from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m., and from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. I said I was ordering that item No. 3 be taken at 2 p.m. and that the motions regarding the taking of business and the Local Government Bill, 1991, be taken at 6 p.m., if the Bill is received from the Dáil.</P>
      <P>May I just explain, in reply to a number of queries from Senators Doyle, O'Toole, Staunton, B. Ryan, Norris, Cosgave and Upton, that the Bill is not at present before the House? Therefore, it would be inappropriate to circulate the allocation of time motion at this stage. However, I am advising the House of my intention, which is that Second Stage will conclude by 1 p.m. on Friday, that the remaining Stages and the earlier signature motion will conclude by 8 p.m. tomorrow night, that the sitting will be suspended from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. tomorrow, Friday, 17 May, and that matters under Standing Orders 28 and 29 may not be raised on that day. A number of Senators have raised the question of precedent, and so on. There is precendent for allocation of time motions on what will be, in effect, a supplementary Order Paper. There is precedent for Bills coming from the Dáil to the Seanad on the same day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A supplementary Order Paper will be issued this evening. That is the situation. I have explained it as well as I can. A lot of time will be given to this Bill. If it is debated for a full day and six hours tonight, that will repesent a <Col N="1976" /> substantial amount fo time give to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, we now know what will probably happen tomorrow, but I would like to know when the Local Government Bill, is likely to be circulated and how Senators, once we have a sos at 4 p.m., are to know that at some stage this evening we may be called back in to commence Second Stage of the Bill? The logistics are lost on me still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Bill as passed by the Dáil will be circulated immediately to Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is not passed by the Dáil, we are in a different ballgame, obviously. We must then consider many factors. Obviously, if it is not passed by the Dáil tonight those arrangements do not apply. The intention is that we start discussion on Second Stage at 6 p.m. this evening. That is the intention assuming the Bill comes from the Dáil this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a different situation. My apologies to Senator Doyle. She asked about the debate on the beef industry and yesterday I was very willing to have a debate on the meat industry. The Minister announced last night that he is going to set up a judicial public, inquiry. I would, therefore, see this as being very important. I see very little merit in us having a debate. It would be most inappropriate if we debated the matter. Therefore, I have decided that we should not have a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McKenna referred to the Payment of Wages Bill. The position on that Bill was mentioned previously by Senators. The intention is that this Bill will be published on Monday. The Bill is coming to this House for discussion on Wednesday next. I am very pleased with <Col N="1977" /> this. I do not accept the rubber stamping suggestion by the Senators on the other side of the House. The Environmental Protection Bill is a clear example of what we have done. There is no intention on the part of the Government that this should be the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That started in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it started in this <Col N="1978" /> House. I do not wish to sound political, but the way forward on local government reform should be that all parties get together and join in the preparation of the Bill. Regrettably &mdash; and I do not wish to be political &mdash; your party, for whatever reasons, did not see fit to do that. That was a pity. It was a chance lost, and I regret it.</P>

    <Title>Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill, 1991: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House gives effect to an agreement signed in Dublin on 27 October 1988 between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the United States of America to expand the programme of educational exchanges between the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This agreement arose from a commitment by former President Reagan during his visit to Ireland in 1984 to increase the level of academic exchanges between Ireland and the United States and to allocate additional American <Col N="1979" /> funding for this purpose under the Fulbright Hays Act of the US Congress. The new agreement replaces the original agreement on academic exchanges with the United States, signed on 16 March 1957, which brought Ireland into what has generally become known as the &ldquo;Fulbright Programme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Fulbright Programme is named after former Senator J. William Fulbright, who introduced into the US Congress the original legislation for the programme &mdash;&rdquo;the Fulbright Act&rdquo;&mdash; which was signed into law on 1 August 1946. Currently the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 provides the legislative authority for the programme, which aims &ldquo;to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries&rdquo;. Toward this end, grants are made to US citizens and nationals of other countries for university lecturing, advanced research, and graduate study.</P>
    <P>The programme is administered in the United States by the United States Information Agency (USIA) with the assistance of the Council for the International Exchange of Scholars (CIES) and the Institute for International Education (IIE). The Board of Foreign Scholarships, composed of 12 educational and public leaders appointed by the President of the United States, selects all Fulbright grantees and establishes the policies and procedures for the programme.</P>
    <P>In 1957, on the basis of our initial agreement with the United States for academic exchanges, the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act was passed, providing for the establishment here of a Scholarship Exchange Board to administer the exchanges with the United States and the setting up of a Scholarship Exchange Fund to finance them. Currently academic exchanges with the United States are administered within these structures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> The Scholarship Exchange Board consists of seven members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and three by the United States Ambassador to Ireland. The chairman of the board is appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs who also provides the board's secretariat and accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Scholarship Exchange Fund was set up with a capital sum of £500,000 taken from the American Grant Counterpart Fund of approximately US$18 million which the United States provided to Ireland in 1948. This sum of £500,000 has been invested in securities by successive Ministers for Finance, the annual income being used to fund the academic exchanges.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like again to avail of the opportunity to formally congratulate the members of the Scholarship Exchange Board &mdash; American and Irish, past and present &mdash; for the excellent manner in which they have discharged their duties over the years.</P>
    <P>However, in order to avail of the additional Fulbright funds being offered by the United States, it is necessary to replace the Scholarship Exchange Board and Fund by new structures, along the lines of the bi-national Fulbright structures which operate in other countries. It is, therefore, proposed to establish a new Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange and a new Ireland-United States Educational Fund.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange will be to increase educational exchanges, which are such important agents of cultural interchange, between our countries. The functions of the new commission will be to encourage studies, research, instruction and other educational activities for the benefit of citizens of both countries; to develop and encourage exchanges of students, research scholars and teachers; and to encourage other related educational and cultural programmes and activities.</P>
    <P>The commission will be larger and more autonomous in management and administration than the Scholarship Exchange Board. It will have eight <Col N="1981" /> members, four appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and four appointed by the United States Ambassador. In order to provide continuity, the present Chairman of the Scholarship Exchange Board will serve as the first Chairman of the Commission. Thereafer the chairman will be elected by commission members. Other office holders such as the deputy chairman, treasurer and assistant treasurer will be elected at the first meeting of the new commission from among its members. The commission will be empowered to provide its own accommodation and secretariat, by acquiring property and engaging an executive director and administrative staff.</P>
    <P>Detailed provisions are set out in sections 8 to 14 of the Bill before the House with regard to the new commission's obligations, commitments and expenditure as well as meetings and procedures, staff and expenses.</P>
    <P>The activities of the Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange will be financed by income from the Ireland-United States Educational Fund. This new fund will replace the Scholarship Exchange Fund, which will be wound up. At present the capital sum in the fund is in the region of £533,000. Upon the winding up of the Scholarship Exchange Fund the money available will be transferred to the credit of the new Ireland-United States Educational Fund and the annual income from investments of these moneys will again be used to fund the exchanges. However, in addition the commission will receive direct dollar appropriations voted by the United States Congress. In this regard, since the 1984 announcement, and pending the establishment of the new commission, an annual sum of approximately US $ 127,000 has been provided by the United States and administered on an <i>ad hoc</i> bases by the Scholarship Exchange Board. This allocation is expected to be increased once the commission has been established.</P>
    <P>Ireland has benefited since 1957 from its participation in the unique and prestigious Fulbright Programme. In the period 1957 to date nearly 800 persons <Col N="1982" /> from Ireland have been awarded grants to pursue further university study, to engage in advance research, to participate in teaching or educational seminar work in universities or simply to gain practical experience and training in the United States. Many of these grantees, have returned to eminent positions in Ireland, in all spheres of responsibility both in the private and the public sectors, applying the invaluable experience and training which they have acquired. In the same period almost 300 US citizens have been awarded grants for research and lecturing in Ireland and have contributed immensely to the work of our own universities and third level institutions.</P>
    <P>We are privileged to have been able to participate in this programme from an early date and to have the opportunity now by virtue of the additional funding being generously offered by the United States to further develop the educational exchanges between our two countries.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned at the outset, the provisions of this Bill are based on the international agreement signed between Ireland and the United States to expand our exchanges within the context of the Fulbright Programme. The Agreement itself reflects the policies and procedures which have been gradually developed by the United States down through the years to yet further refine and improve this programme, into the excellent vehicle it is today, for the fostering of educational and cultural links on a global basis.</P>
    <P>In accepting this Bill the House can be confident not only of helping to further cement the close ties of friendship and understanding which exist between Ireland and the United States but also of offering to our students and educational institutions a most valuable opportunity for the further broadening of intellectual and cultural horizons by expanded participation in the Fulbright Programme, whose traditional commitment to excellence in educational and cultural exchange is recognised and lauded worldwide.</P>
    <P>I, therefore, commend this Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my Fine Gael colleagues I warmly welcome this Bill which gives statutory effect to the agreement signed between the Government of the United States and the Irish Government some three years ago. More significantly, it heralds an improvement and an expansion on the legislation governing the scholarship exchange programme that has been in operation in this country since 1957. There is no doubt that that programme has had beneficial effects on many industries, educational establishments and hundreds of people who were lucky enough to participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Bill gives Irish citizens &mdash; academics, students or graduates &mdash; an opportunity to travel to America and learn something of the tremendous developments in American scholarship and technology but the American people who participate in this exchange programme have the opportunity of learning from our Irish culture and our Irish tradition. The high standards attained in our third level educational institutions must surely benefit people from the United States who come over and want to see something of our long tradition and culture and the approach the Irish people take to many problems technical, cultural and traditional.</P>
      <P>This legislation is yet another indication of the special generosity of the American people. We have had a long tradition of co-operation and help with the United States for many generations. Our people have looked westwards in hope and this country has benefited significantly from our close association with the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on his very full and precise explanation of this legislation to the House this morning, but I would like to ask him about the amount of funds that stand to be transferred from the existing scholarship exchange programme which was endowed in 1957 and how much can be transferred under section 6 of this Bill to this new scholarship exchange fund. Has the Minister any figures on the numbers of people who have been lucky enough to <Col N="1984" /> participate in the programme just ending and what has been the approximate average cost of participation in the fund over the years?</P>
    <P>There are a large number of areas where this kind of educational exchange programme is extremely important and I hope we will be in a position to ensure the maximum expansion of this scheme. It is important as we near 1 January 1993 that Irish management should be in a position to face the challenges we anticipate for our trade and commerce in the decade ahead. It must be useful for young graduates, people in management, people in industry and people in education to have an opportunity of seeing exactly what the situation is in the United States which, of course, is one of the big players whether in commerce or industry on the world scene.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will encourage the widest possible participation and that the contribution from the Government to this fund will be realistic, to endeavour to get to the people who will be the decision-makers in the next ten years and expose them to the kind of competition our companies will be facing in the crucial years ahead when we will be faced for the first time in recent years to very strict competition. We must avail of this generosity from the US to ensure that we are able to equip our people, especially our decision-makers, with the kind of information, to enable our companies to compete in the open economy from 1 January 1993.</P>
    <P>The Minister kindly circulated the agreement which was signed three years ago. The only criticism &mdash; if it could be described as such &mdash; I would have the original measure, in retrospect, is the fact that it was endowed and did not expand to meet the great demand that must have been there. Perhaps the Minister might have figures on how many applicants have been refused facilities under the 1957 legislation? It is important for people to see and experience the high technology and the new developments in the United States.</P>
    <P>I am happy to have the opportunity to pay a small tribute to the people of the United States and their Government, not <Col N="1985" /> just for introducing but for reorganising this scheme. I have met many people who have benefited from the old scholarship exchange programme. We can now see it being even better funded and I hope the Minister for Finance will ensure that practically every applicant will be accommodated.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Foreign Affairs have operated the old system for the past 30 years. I would ask the Minister if it would not be better if the Department of Education were to administer this fund. I note from the Bill the commission have autonomous powers but I hope there will be close co-operation between them, the Department of Education and the Department of Labour who are taking an ever closer hold on education through their participation in the FÁS schemes and the various training and retraining programmes. I urge close co-operation so that we can offer our young graduates, and to our teachers and professors every opportunity to equip themselves more fully for the important tasks they have undertaken in their careers in the service of our young population. I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill to the Seanad. I am glad it gives statutory powers to the new Ireland-United States Commission for Educational Exchange. It changes over from the system that has evolved since the visit by President Reagan whereby funds were transferred on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but without any statutory powers to do so. The United States Government sent over money each year but in actual fact it will not be until this Bill goes through that that money will come as a result of an agreement signed by the two governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that since William Fulbright set up his scheme of student exchanges throughout the world in 1946 the Fulbright scholarships have been of immense benefit to the relationship existing between the United States and countries throughout the world. Fulbright was a far-seeing man. The war was a catalyst for this scheme because pre-war America <Col N="1986" /> was very inward-looking. After the Second World War they began to realise that if they were to be more outward-looking they would have to have cultural, social and educational exchanges with other countries. Fulbright must be complimented on his thoughtfulness in bringing this Act through the United States Congress.</P>
    <P>The exchange programme between the United States and Ireland has been eminently successful. If one looks at educational establishments in Ireland, the United States and elsewhere, one will see that Fulbright scholars have taken their place in the academic world, in commerce, and in Government. The expertise they gained by being able to take part in exchange scholarships has been of immense benefit to them. In United States colleges Irish academics have taken their place at the very highest level, whether at the MIT, Stanford, or elsewhere. If one goes through the boards of management even of some of these colleges one will see that Irish Fulbright scholars are among those on the boards.</P>
    <P>It is stated that 800 Irish people have taken part in the exchanges since the foundation of the fund and that about 300 United States scholars have come here. However, what has not been stated in the Minister's speech or in the memorandum is the ratio between Irish scholars going to the United States and American scholars coming here. It seems to me the ratio is going to get into imbalance because of the difference in the cost of education here and in the United States. The cost of putting pupils through college in the United States, whether at post-graduate or under-graduate level, is enormous. I am not too sure whether under the Fulbright Programme scholars have to pay the full amount a student would have to pay in the American colleges. I suggest it is probably ten times more expensive to put a student through an American college than it is through an Irish college. There is bound to be an imbalance there and it appears that on current costings there would be many more American students able to participate here than in the United States. <Col N="1987" /> Of course, if it is a direct one-for-one exchange there should be an equal number, but I am not sure exactly whether it is a one-for-one exchange.</P>
    <P>In regard to members of the commission, I think it states that during the first two years the outgoing chairman of the previous scholarship exchange board will act as chairman of the commission and that after two years a new chairman will be elected. I would like to have it clarified if he is to be elected from among the members of the actual commission. There is a seven member commission at present which means that if there is a vote you have a reasonable chance of getting a result rather than now when it is going to four and four. I would have thought that an odd number would be better for this new commission rather than four and four.</P>
    <P>I do not know who the three members are who have been selected over the years by the United States side, but I know that from the Irish side there were very eminent professors, academics, who would obviously be <i>au fait</i> with the educational standards that would be needed for somebody to take a full part in the Fulbright programme. I see that under the new agreement at least two members of the new commission will be from the US foreign service establishment in Ireland. This would mean that at least two members of the staff of the United States Embassy will be members of the commission. I am not too sure what academic qualifications members of the United States foreign service have but, but I suggest that it may not be that they would be of such high academic standards that they would be able to adjudicate on Irish students who might be applying to go to the United States. I feel that may not be the right way to go about the appointment of members of the commission from the United States side. I am not criticising members of the United States foreign service here in Ireland but I feel that, if we have, as we had in the past, fully fledged academics on the Irish side, they should be matched by fully <Col N="1988" /> fledged academics from the American side.</P>
    <P>On the question of section 12 which deals with contributions to the commission, that is an excellent change in that funds can be got from outside the funding that will come through the Governments on either side. Perhaps some of the people who have in the past taken part in the Fulbright Programme and who have been very successful in business or in commerce may be enabled to make endowments which would be of enormous benefit to the funding of the new commission. We know that in the United States hardly a university would be able to exist without endowments from former students. We could make a plea here that former participants in the Fulbright Programme be allowed to contribute to the work of the commission and ensure that there will be adequate funding for the commission over the next number of years, because education is now becoming extremely expensive.</P>
    <P>I know that the United States have been giving on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis a sum of £127,000 per year for the past number of years and that they have agreed that that should be increased. I hope that amount will be increased substantially because it is of enormous benefit to the United States. The £500,000 put in initially in 1957 gives a reasonable amount in terms of the interest payable, but nevertheless the interest on £500,000 invested in Government funds is not going to yield much more than between £55,000 and £60,000 maximum. Those sums are not adequate and from the Irish side we might top up that £500,000. This would be of immense benefit to Ireland in the future.</P>
    <P>Looking at the boards of the NBA programme and the NBS programme we find that quite a number of the people involved in running masters programmes in colleges in Ireland at present are former Fulbright scholars. They have benefited and Ireland is benefiting because of that. It is of immense importance, therefore, that we increase the amount available from the £500,000 initially put in.</P>
    <P>I saw recently that an Irish educated <Col N="1989" /> girl in the US who was involved in very detailed studies on a post-graduate basis in MIT found out that her immediate superiors on the programme had been working on a false premise and consequently were producing false returns. She was sacked from the programme and it took five or six years for her to get a job in MIT. It shows that Irish people going to the US are educated to a level that they are able to take on the best academics in the United States.</P>
    <P>This educational programme, which was fostered first by Fulbright, has been of enormous benefit and will continue to be of enormous benefit to both countries. I hope that in the future we will see an expansion of this type of educational exchange between countries, not alone the United States but with other countries which have different backgrounds. I hope we may have exchanges with eastern Europe and with countries of the Third World; enormous benefits could derive to the Third World and indeed to our own State if these exchanges took place.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c) of the agreement says:</P>
    <P>As an organisation established for charitable purposes, the commission will be exempt from income tax and capital gains tax in relation to income and/or gains applied for charitable purposes. Transfers and leases of land made for charitable purposes will be exempt from stamp duty. Inheritance applied for public or charitable purposes shall be exempt from inheritance tax.</P>
    <P>If an individual were to endow this commission, would he or she be exempted from tax? It is important that that should be clarified. It is suggested in section 12 that contributions from outside Government sources will be acceptable but it only mentions inheritance and transferring leases of land. If an individual should endow this commission he should equally be exempt from whatever taxation might be due as a result of that endowment.</P>
    <P>Like Senator McDonald, I welcome this Bill. It is a Bill which is of enormous <Col N="1990" /> benefit both to the United States and to Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speakers I, too, would like to welcome this Bill. Anything that can help to foster increased exchange of students and academics should be very welcome particularly in an island and an almost insular country as we are. We have benefited enormously from it, as previous speakers have said. Roughly 800 academics and students have visited the United States and have gained from that experience. They are now working in almost every aspect of our lives &mdash; in universities, research institutes, in the Department of Agriculture and Food, the Department of Health and so on. It is, therefore, to our benefit and we should welcome, as I said, anything that will increase and foster these exchanges.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that nowhere in the Bill is the name Fulbright mentioned. Fulbright scholars enjoy a world status and standing. I would like to see Fulbright mentioned in the Bill; and, as one who availed of money from the counterpart fund to travel, I would like to enjoy the status of being regarded as a Fulbright scholar. However, I have to say that while I availed of the grant I did something rather unusual at the time. I requested that I be allowed to use the money to study in Europe rather than in the United States. That was before we applied for European Community membership. I felt what I could learn there would be more appropriate to our situation. That is not in any way to criticise the US, where I have been many times since. I just felt that it was more appropriate for what I wanted to do at the time and it was very generously agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then I have been in academic life for more than 30 years. Many of my past students have gone abroad to study in various universities and research institutes in the US. The general experience has been that Irish graduates at primary degree level are equal to, and in most cases superior to, the best they have <Col N="1991" /> to offer in the US. It is only at the post-graduate level that the United States students come into their own, largely because of the huge resources they have by comparison with Irish post-graduate students studying here. But we can take pride in the fact that, despite the very low cost by international standards of the production of our graduates, they are equal to the best the US can offer. The US is quite conscious of this and their colleges are very often actively canvassing post-graduate students from Ireland.</P>
    <P>I made the point that we have benefited enormously from this programme. It is equally true, and perhaps even more true, to say that the US, whether it was intended to do so or not, has also benefited enormously from foreign students. Today US research in their research institutes and universities could hardly survive without the huge numbers of foreign students and academics. In the early years of this programme it was dominated by European students and academics. Today in the United States their post-graduate schools, as far as foreigners are concerned, are dominated by Asians, particularly from the Pacific rim but also from India and Pakistan.</P>
    <P>A problem for poor countries, particularly Third World countries who send very bright students to the United States, is that they are very reluctant to return home. It is causing a serious brain drain for the poorer countries and, indeed, even for a country like Ireland. I have to confess that I suffer from this myself. My son-in-law and only daughter live in the United States as a direct result of this brain drain. While I am very pleased that they enjoy an excellent standard of living, one that they could not possibly afford in Ireland &mdash; they are doing very well there and all that &mdash; it is a strain on a family to have their loved ones so far away, although modern travel makes it much easier. But people from Third World countries who decide to stay in the US and are offered good jobs cannot get home to their loved ones as easily as people can get home to Ireland. Indeed, <Col N="1992" /> these Third World countries have a greater need for the brain power that is creamed off and stays in the US. I do not want to criticise the US for this. I am merely making the point that while it offers opportunity there is a cost involved for poor countries that avail of it. We, as I said, have benefited enormously from it. On balance, despite the fact that many of our people stay there, I am totally in favour of it and I wish to see it expanded.</P>
    <P>I wish to know to whom does the board report? There is no mention made of reporting to the Dáil or the Seanad. It probably reports to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Like my colleague, Senator McDonald, I think it would be more appropriate now for this commission to be attached to the Department of Education rather than the Department of Foreign Affairs. I can understand the historical reasons for having it in the first instance attached to Foreign Affairs, but today it would appear to be more appropriate to be attached to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There is little else I want to say on the issue other than to point out that for a relatively poor country like Ireland, in a peripheral area, depending upon exports for its wealth, it must depend, I believe, on the production of low volume, high value products &mdash; in other words, hi-tech products. That is all the more reason why we should encourage exchange of students and academics with the US. The US strength is in science and technology. Having said that, I would like to see the balance a little more the other way &mdash; in other words, I would like to see more people coming from the US. The ratio at present is more than 2:1 in our favour. While we are not in the same league as the US in terms of science and technology and resources in that area, I am sure we can claim to be quite strong in the area of culture, the arts, and so on. No doubt subsequent speakers will talk about that.</P>
    <P>We certainly could do more to attract scholars here, particularly scholars of literature. Given our extraordinary record for a small country whose first language is Irish, we have produced, I <Col N="1993" /> think, in this city more Nobel Prize winners in the English language than probably any other city in the world. Perhaps Senator Norris, who will be talking after me, might like to enlarge on that or contradict me; but I certainly would welcome a move on our part to attract more Americans to come here and to study here. We could provide, as it were, more of a service-type industry in that regard.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House. I am sure there are other speakers anxious to get in. I welcome this Bill and I look forward to it giving us even more benefits than the scholarship exchange scheme gave us in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very supportive of this new Bill. It formalises the exchange of students between Ireland and the US that started without funding and recognition. It has been a very natural development. I am pleased to tell the Minister that my county has been very much involved as the regional college in Letterkenny has exchanged 20 students with Pittsburg in the US. I was one of those from the board of management of the college who went out to Pittsburg to see the success of the scheme and progress by our students there. I can tell the House and the Minister that the results from that student exchange have been excellent. It has been so successful that part of the course for the students placed in America was extended to include the completion of the practical, hands-on side of the course with industry. The industrialists with whom the students from Donegal were placed were so delighted they decided to organise a trip to Donegal to investigate the students' background, to meet the parents and the head of the college and to further develop the student exchange programme. The scheme has been such a fantastic success that this year we have 20 students coming from America to Donegal. We are boarding them in the hotel and catering college at Killybegs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted with the introduction of this legislation. It will be a tremendous help and encouragement. We could sit back and be negative about our approach <Col N="1994" /> and say it is said to see our young students going away but communications and travel are now very rapid. We have to give our students the best possible knowledge of the world and of world affairs. Certainly, America is a world leader in technology. It is a great experience for students to go there. It broadens their outlook; it helps their development. We will have better people and better students when the exchange programme is fully developed.</P>
    <P>I hope that, along with the provision and support for the exchange of students, we will also have recognised diplomas. I hope that under this legislation there would be a section within the Department to administer the granting of credits and diplomas and that students would be encouraged to look at that as a possibility for their further education. I see this as very encouraging development. The Minister present comes from the west. The young people of his area and of Donegal have not had this opportunity of broadening their knowledge and this is now a welcome possibility. I hope that when the students and the head of the colleges come to Ireland in the near future they will meet the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary. We had the head of one of the colleges in Pittsburg in here last week and I was pleased to introduce him to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and to the Minister for Education. He was delighted and pleased. All in all, there is a lot of goodwill.</P>
    <P>It was a great honour for me to go to America and see the work on the ground because down the years we were exporting our people, especially from rural Ireland, to do very unattractive jobs in America, England and all over the world. I felt, as other Irish people would feel, that it was great to see our students bringing the best of Ireland to the centre of the technology world in America. It was a marvellous change and a great opportunity for our young people. They fully understood the value of what they were getting.</P>
    <P>While this Bill provides for the exchange of students with the United Statges of America &mdash; and I fully support <Col N="1995" /> that &mdash; we have to be aware of the value of exchanging students with Germany and all other European countries. We have go give that a high priority and encourage our students to go to those countries. As a result they will then see the value of our own country and the possibilities that are here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that part of our unemployment problem here stems from the fact that the people who are in a position to provide jobs and to start up industry have never had the opportunity of seeing Ireland from a distance. All too often we see people coming here from a poor background; they see opportunities in Ireland, start up industries here and do very well. The new legislation is a very commendable development by the Government and the Minister. I hope it is the first step to a great new organisation that will support and encourage students to go abroad. By introducing the legislation the Department show that they also are aware of the potential here. I commend the Bill. I look forward to its success in providing opportunity, support and encouragement for many students who would not have thought of going on a student exchange programme in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, first, to give a cordial welcome to this Bill which confirms the situation that has existed for a number of years. In fact, in terms of my own college, Trinity College, Dublin, we can claim a particularly early involvement in third level education in the United States of America. You, Sir, as a distinguished academic and Senator Raftery will, I am sure, recall that one of our graduates, Bishop Berkeley, Bishop of Cloyne, who was a very distinguished philosopher, travelled to the United States of America and it is in recognition of Bishop Berkeley that the University of California &mdash; Berkeley, as they call it, giving it a slightly different pronunciation &mdash; was established. That was in the 17th century and there has been a very profitable exchange intellectually between the two parts of the world. We were joined, <Col N="1996" /> although sometimes people humorously suggested separated, by sharing a common language. We have common traditions and similar educational institutions. Professor Raftery spoke about his own experiences under the Fulbright system and I join with him in hoping that the trail-breaking work of Senator William Fulbright will not go entirely unrecognised or unacknowledged in discussions of this Bill because it was very important.</P>
      <P>I have just returned from the United States where I was lecturing in Chicago, in the University of Madison, in Wisconsin, in addition to speaking at the American Convention on Irish Studies. There is considerable interest in Ireland and in Irish matters, literary, cultural and historical. It is a matter of sadness to me that my distinguished colleague on these benches Professor Murphy who was with me in Madison, Wisconsin, for procedural reasons is unable to speak on this Bill. I know he had prepared quite a lot to say and is well known in the United States as a brillant lecturer and as a congenial companion at academic gatherings.</P>
      <P>I have lectured in most parts of the United States and one of the things that gives me great pride is the extraordinary degree of participation by people of Irish origin and educational background at the highest levels of third level education in the United States. It is a matter of considerable pride to go to any arts department &mdash; I have lectured in both arts and law departments &mdash; and meet there a considerable preponderance of people with an Irish educational background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McGowan spoke about the European dimension and I am sure he is aware of the important Erasmus programme in that developing area which takes in all European countries. I have had the privilege of teaching students from European countries, many of them very gifted although there is sometimes a slight problem of language but that situation is certainly improving. We are living in a shrinking world. It is important <Col N="1997" /> that our students have contact with students from other backgrounds because university education does not depend only on the strict academic programme but also on contact with people from other cultures and backgrounds with differing views and opinions.</P>
    <P>This measure is governed principally by the Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act, 1961. The Minister in his introduction indicated that the principal and laudable aims of that Act are to enable the Government of the United States to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries. Further work needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be difficult, controversial, niggling or pedantic but I am sure the Minister is aware that considerable difficulties exist in the area of third level education because of the total lack of comprehension in the American system for the Irish university system. Professor Raftery was correct when he said our graduates at primary degree level are the equal of, and in many cases superior to, the equivalent product in the United States of America but is this understood in the United States? The Minister may be aware of the difficulties in this area but, without being too technical or difficult, I would like to put them on the record. As a university representative I am continuously made aware of the difficulties encountered by our graduates in the United States of America because the Americans simply do not understand our educational system. I hope this institution will look into the difficulties here which are the product of misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>Among these discrepancies is the fact that the United States only recognises 11 of the 13 years of Irish schooling prior to university enrolment. Contrary to the United States belief, an Irish student is expected and required to spend eight years in national school and at least five, but generally six, years in secondary school, totalling 13 to 14 years of pre-university schooling. The total years of Irish schooling outnumber considerably the number of years under the American <Col N="1998" /> system, yet, the official United States attitude does not recognise this. Since the beginning of the 1980s, because of the enormous proliferation of university institutions in America, it has been decided to centralise and co-ordinate the evaluation of foreign degrees. This is done in a clumsy way with considerable disadvantage for Irish students.</P>
    <P>A statement from the educational credential evaluation who evaluate our degrees states that no three year university first degree programme in the world is the equivalent of a bachelor' degree programme in the United States unless it requires completion of 13 or more years of primary secondary education for admission. The attitude is: &ldquo;We do not recognise as the equivalent of a bachelor's degree programme in the United States three year university programmes in Australia, Canada, outside of Quebec, Ireland, Israel, South Africa or any other country where 12 or fewer years of primary/secondary are required for admission.&rdquo; Most degree courses, certainly in the Arts, in the Colleges of the National University of Ireland, and three year courses. They are fine courses and their graduates are the equivalent of any graduates of the United States of America. These evaluators say, however, that they link Irish graduates with those of Israel and Canada, outside of Quebec, and so on because they do not have more than 12 pre-third level secondary schooling years, because they evaluate them differently. We have 13 or 14 pre-third level schooling years. It is a question of mutual understanding and I am glad that part of the legal framework of this Bill speaks about mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the people of other countries which must be looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The document is a correspondence I received from Educational <Col N="1999" /> Evaluators Inc. in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, giving what they deem to be the legal requirements in the United States as they interpret them, and they are the interpreting body for a particular area of the United States. A number of these bodies has been set up on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>That is the first and major problem. I have a long, voluminous correspondence containing about 18 points, but I am going to make two principal points. There is a misunderstanding of our degrees. The Higher Diploma in Education is not recognised in the United States as a post-graduate degree of any kind but is treated with contempt. It is not recognised that in order to take part in that programme in Trinity College, Dublin, one has to complete a full four year degree course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a problem with the way in which the numbers of secondary school years are totalled, with the recognition of the Higher Diploma in Education and there is a difference in our attitudes towards numerical marking schemes. For example, in the Irish system, a mark of 70 per cent, certainly in the arts, is a very considerable achievement and puts one into the first rank. It is a first degree mark. In the United States this is not the case. I came across this discrepancy in marking papers for American students. I would give an American 70 per cent, and I am rather a stingy marker. I had the experience of an American student, to whom I thought I had given an astronomical mark, coming to me in floods of tears saying: &ldquo;Professor Norris, what have I done wrong?&rdquo; I said &ldquo;You have done very well indeed. She said: &ldquo;Why did you give me only 70 per cent?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;Only 70?&rdquo;. This is a real problem. In Ireland 70 per cent reflects an A mark and in the United States 70 per cent reflects average work and would be represented by a C. There are all sorts of differences between arithmetical and notional marking systems but a university department would be the place to explore those rather than the floor of Seanad Éireann. A student can get a very high mark in terms of the Irish university system, have that on his or her record, present it in the United <Col N="2000" /> States and find that it is not satisfactory. That is a question of mutual understanding.</P>
    <P>I raised these questions last year because two former students of mine approached me about it. As the Acting Chairman and the Minister will realise, university graduates are my constituents, so I take a keen interest in them, politically as well as educationally. I raised this matter with the Minister for Education and there was some shuffling around as to whether it came under the ambit of the Department of Education or the Department of Foreign Affairs. After the initial holding letter, which I am sure is common to every Department: &ldquo;Dear Senator,... I am having inquiries made and will reply to you in detail as soon as possible...&rdquo;, I got the following letter on 31 January 1991:</P>
    <P>Dear David,</P>
    <P>I refer again to your letter of the 30th November, 1990, regarding the recognition of Irish degrees in the United States. It would be difficult to solve this problem on a unilateral basis without seeking to enter into some form of general arrangements on the reciprocal recognition of academic qualifications between Ireland and the United States. In view of the complexity of the educational system there and the variety and standard of qualifications available, I have no plans at present to seek to introduce such general arrangements.</P>
    <P>Experience in the EC in the context of the mutual recognition of degrees and diplomas has shown that mutual acceptability of educational qualification is difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>That is an honest answer but it does acknowledge a real problem lying at the heart of what we are doing here, because there cannot be proper beneficial exchange between two partners, the United States of America and the Republic of Ireland, unless we understand each other's system and unless there is proper mutual recognition of our degrees and attainments. Therefore, I <Col N="2001" /> ask the Minister if this matter can be addressed. I raise it in general terms under this Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Bill but some further investigation may be necessary and the opportunity that presented itself this morning to me to raise this matter may mean that the Department of Foreign Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Education, could investigate this further and examine the problem.</P>
    <P>Other problems are related to this, among them the question of the status of people doing medical research in the United States. I have a correspondence about that as well because of the visa requirements for people doing post-graduate research in the area of medicine. This issue is not, perhaps, directly relevant to this morning's work, but perhaps I can draw the Minister's attention to it. I raised it with the Minister for Education and was directed to the Department of Foreign Affairs. I have a correspondence with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the matter and perhaps I can refresh the Minister's mind by a little note to see if we can advance the situation further. This was brought to my attention by a graduate of Trinity College who presently holds a Chair in Yale University. When in Trinity College, he had the wonderful title of lecturer in Morbid Anatomy which sounds slightly grizzly but he is a distinguished medical man who has now taken up residence in the United States of America.</P>
    <P>A number of problems need to be looked at and if they could be ironed out they would make the process of exchange much more satisfactory from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Professor Raftery mentioned people from Asia and I would like to draw to the Minister's attention the plight of Palestinian students towards whom this House and Irish universities should be sympathetic. University College Dublin has a programme with Bir Zeit University on the West Bank of Israel and because of the political plight of the Palestinians we might expand this programme. We <Col N="2002" /> should not confine ourselves to the parameters of relationships between Ireland and the United States of America. We, too, should be as generous as possible within our limits in making the benefits of our knowledge and academic programmes available to people who, because of political circumstances, maybe placed at the moment in a difficulty. The Minister is a political animal as I am, and will appreciate, as I do, the side benefits of these kinds of educational programmes. Young people come to our country and our young people go to the United States or wherever it is, and they mix in what will undoubtedly become highly influential circles. In ten, 15 or 20 years they may be in a position to deal reciprocally with members of Governments, ambassadors or leaders of industry and such personal contacts are of great benefit to both countries.</P>
    <P>On the technical side of the Bill I notice that there are eight board members, four whom are appointed by the United States Ambassador, which is perfectly reasonable since they are providing the money. I also notice however that four members are appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and I share Professor Raftery's feeling that the Department of Education should be involved as we are talking about an educational exchange. Of course participation by the Department of Foreign Affairs is appropriate because there is an international agreement or protocol but the appointment of board members should be done in consultation with the people principally and directly involved. I am curious that the Bill says: &ldquo;The Irish members shall be appointed and may be removed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We spent quite a long time on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill discussing the machinery for the removal of members of a board and what one had to do to qualify for removal. It is a bold statement to say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs can appoint them in a hiring and firing role without stating why they should be removed. For example, in <Col N="2003" /> the case of a change of Government if the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not like Professor Bloggs from University College Cork or the new University of Limerick, does he or she not have to give any reasons at all for the removal? This is an inappropriately blunt instrument for the removal of board members. A specified reason for removal should be given. In the Environmental Protection Agency Bill it was ill-health or stated mis-behaviour. I would like to know that circumstances the Minister envisages for the arbitrary removal of somebody from this board. The Bill says &ldquo;there shall not be remuneration but there will be travel, meals and lodging and so on&rdquo;. It is essentially an unpaid role and it would be churlish to fire somebody without giving information. It is a possibility that may not frequently arise but perhaps the Minister could look at this.</P>
    <P>I notice also that the Minister says the commission will be empowered to provide its own accommodation and secretariat by acquiring property and engaging an executive director and administrative staff. The budget is quite small. Senator Lanigan, with his no doubt very wide ranging experience of investments, suggested that the budget might be about £550,000 a year in a good year. We have only got to roll our eyeballs down Kildare Street to see the way in which bureaucrats have engaged enormous offices and left them empty in what amounts to a public scandal. Again, I would like some criteria laid down for this; I do not think it should be necessary for them to acquire property. Surely there is enough Government office space left idle in this city or in one of the other cities of our country to accommodate them. There should not be extravagant demands for accommodation or staff.</P>
    <P>I raise those niggling points about the Bill but I also give it a hearty welcome. It is an important development which will benefit our students and American students. We have a very distinguished record not alone in the area of medicine and science and so on where we are not always among the world's leaders but in <Col N="2004" /> certain areas of the arts and spectacularly I might say in literature where we are a world leader. Senator Raftery mentioned the number of Irish people who have won the Nobel Prize. It is arguable that the greatest novelist, poet and dramatist in the English language of this century came from this country and in literature we are up there at the head of the field. The list of people such as Joyce, O'Casey, Shaw, Synge, Wilde, Becket, Behan is very impressive. It has an economic value because people do not normally visit us for our weather but for our cultural reputation. If you mention the word Joyce in Paris, New York or Tokyo, people will say Dublin, and if you mention Dublin they immediately start talking about Joyce, Yeats or O'Casey.</P>
    <P>A major international symposium is planned for Dublin in 1992. We expect about 1,000 scholars from all over the world but most of them will be from the United States of America. The event will be divided equally between my own university, Trinity College and Joyce's old university, University College, Dublin, because it is appropriate that people should have the opportunity of absorbing some of the atmosphere of rooms in which brilliant students like James Joyce studied at the turn of the century. I would like to take this opportunity of complimenting the authorities of University College, Dublin and perhaps also the Archdiocese of Dublin for the superb work of restoration that has just been completed in Nos. 85 and 86, St. Stephen's Green.</P>
    <P>I was saddened, and I am sure Members in this House will join in my feeling of sadness to learn this morning of the sudden accidental death of Barbara Haley, Professor of English at Maynooth College. Professor Haley was a distinguished colleague and dear friend of mine and somebody who just a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of accompanying to Paris and to the University of Caen in Normandy where we took part in a symposium on Anglo-Irish literature. The death of Professor Haley is a great loss to Irish academic life and I am sure the House will not think it inappropriate <Col N="2005" /> for me to express my condolences to her family and my sorrow that we should have been deprived of her great talents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the idea of educational exchange contained in this Bill. As a teacher I have long realised there is no substitute for travel and for the exchange of ideas between different people. Travel enables one to understand what makes other people tick and how their culture operates and to understand why there are so many different cultures throughout the world. I agree with Senator Norris about the problem of requiring recognition for degrees from Irish universities abroad and the misunderstanding in America about the qualifications of people who leave institutions in this country with excellent results. As Senator Norris said, they are equal, if not better than many other third level graduates throughout the world.</P>
      <P>There is also a misunderstanding in the US in relation to the accumulation of years in primary, second level and third level schooling for the recognition of degrees for teaching or other purposes, and also in regard to the fact that the Higher Diploma in Education is not recognised as a first graduate diploma in the United States. The situation is unfortunate but I hope in future that the development of these international educational exchanges will increase understanding. The only method to get the message across is by mutual exchanges between the two countries involved. They have to be educated about our system, just as we have to be educated about their system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the excellent degrees provided in this country by all the various institutions will be accepted as bona fide throughout the world the demand for Irish graduates testifies to the fact that our graduates are on a par with those of any other country. A range of companies line up here every year to employ our graduates; they hold conferences and <Col N="2006" /> information seminars and so on to encourage our graduates to join their institutions and industrial organisations. They would not do that if they did not recognise that graduates from our institutions are among the best in the world. We recognise the tremendous contribution our educational system has made to the development of our own country and, in addition, the contribution we have made to other countries by the excellent graduates who have gone to work abroad and have enhanced the industrial life, the culture and the economic development of those countries.</P>
    <P>Education exchange is extremely important for us. As we live on an island it is understandable that we may at times be rather insular in our thinking our approach and our attitude towards what takes place in the big world outside. This educational exchange affords us the opportunity to compare ourselves with other societies and cultures. That is very important. We must see other cultures in order to realise exactly what is good in our own culture and what is not so good in it. Accordingly, we have to recognise that while things are done in other ways, our attitudes and frame of mind may be a little better in some shape or form. We will only get that by comparing ourselves with these other cultures. This educational exchange affords the opportunity to a limited number &mdash; and it is unfortunate that it is a limited number &mdash; of students to participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>Referring specifically to the USA, many of use can claim that we have relations living in the United States, whether first, second or third generation. On the other hand, I have not met any American who has not claimed to have Irish ancestors. It is on record that every American President has claimed Irish ancestry. The significant thing is that they were proud to claim Irish ancestry. They were anxious to trace Irish ancestors. We should be proud that so many eminent people were anxious to claim a relationship with our country.</P>
    <P>I was reading recently that St. Brendan found America. St. Brendan was a <Col N="2007" /> Kerryman &mdash; Kerrymen are marvellous in their own way &mdash; and no one less than St. Brendan would claim the credit for discovering America. We have an affinity with America that stretches back a long way. The ties between Ireland and America have been developed. It is important that we are here today speaking on this Bill so that we can maintain, foster and develop the association that was built up between the two countries down the years. This is to the mutual benefit of both Ireland and America.</P>
    <P>We have one of the best educational systems in the world. The Bill before us will give effect to an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Ireland and that of the United States to establish this scholarship exchange scheme and to further expand the programme of academic exchanges between the two countries. As the Minister pointed out, it will result in a new Ireland/United States Commission for Educational Exchange and a new Ireland/US Educational Fund. I join with the Minister in congratulating the members of the Scholarship Exchange Board, American and Irish, both past and present, for the excellent manner in which they carried out their duties. I would also like to pay tribute to Senator Fulbright who was the pioneer in this area. His contribution in establishing this fund cannot go unrecognised. We are here today as a result of the developments that took place then. We welcome the new developments. As time goes by changes have to be made in the way things are done. We have to give due recognition to the people who have worked so well over the years in providing the exchange programme.</P>
    <P>I look forward to more developments in the area of educational exchange. I am particularly interested in the exchange of the no-so-bright individuals from here. The vast majority of the population who go into the workplace are not the top 5 or 10 per cent of academic high achievers. They are, by and large, the people we have to depend on to get things done. It is extremely important that those people <Col N="2008" /> should be afforded the opportunity to broaden their horizons, to develop their ideas and to see how things are done. I appreciate the financial implications and the difficulties that would be incurred in trying to provide a programme of that nature but I would ask that consideration be given to providing the mechanism where the ordinary &mdash; for the want of a better word &mdash; students and young people in this country would be afforded the opportunity to visit those places on an educational exchange programme, so that they, too, would get the benefits of travel and of broadening their ideas and their attitudes to different cultures. While I welcome the present system I would hope that it could be developed further to afford the opportunity to many other people to get involved.</P>
    <P>In the coming decades education will be greatly influenced by changes in the cultural, social, economic and political landscape. We all know that education is the gateway to the development of society. It is the mechanism by which we make the best possible use of that development. Educational exchange is an important element in society and in the progress of society, whether it is developing the Third World or in the highly developed countries. The difficulties in the Third World at present are primarily caused by lack of education. We listen regularly to people working in those areas. They talk at length about the fact that it is not sufficient to provide food for the people in difficulties. What we must do is educate these people to help themselves. We will never solve the problems of the Third World until we educate the people in those countries to look after themselves. There is an unimaginable amount of difficult work to be done. The Third World agencies are doing a manificent job trying to develop those systems. We can understand the huge disadvantages of working in those areas.</P>
    <P>Traditionally, education policies are national policies. The fast moving events of recent times such as the economic integration, the demise of the Communist agencies and regimes, and the emergence of the dynamic Asian economies were <Col N="2009" /> mentioned by two speakers. They have implications for national policies. Countries are becoming increasingly interdependent politically, economically and culturally. They will raise new and urgent problems in the years to come in terms of international understanding and exchange.</P>
    <P>Knowledge of other countries' cultures is essential to economic competitiveness. We are not talking just specifically about educational benefits but about huge economic benefits later both from the contacts that are made and the fact that people will begin to understand each other. There is no substitute for word of mouth. When people are in another country they should understand exactly how the people in that country operate and the benefits which would come from setting up industry there. Cultural and educational exchanges will enhance the understanding and attitudes of people towards this country, and <i>vice versa.</i> The buzz word, &ldquo;internationalisation&rdquo; and the impact of the media across all boundaries will, undoubtedly, raise concerns about how national cultural identities can be preserved. We will be at pains to preserve our cultural identity but we cannot do that by putting up the shutters and being oblivious to what is going on outside. The best way we can preserve our culture is by seeing how other cultures operate. We must open our doors to those people and show them the tremendous traditions, marvellous heritage, language and culture we have.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill. It can do nothing but good for the people who will be fortunate enough to engage in the educational exchange from the United States and from this side of the Atlantic. I look forward to further developments in this area. I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and I wish it well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I join with the other Senators who have spoken in welcoming this Bill, the main purpose of which is to give effect to an agreement between our Government and the Government of the United States for a programme of educational exchange. <Col N="2010" /> This agreement was signed on 27 October 1988. I understand it resulted from commitments given by the former United States President, Ronald Reagan, when he visited Ireland in 1984. The new scholarship exchange scheme being established under the agreement will increase the level of academic exchanges between Ireland and the United States. This is to be welcomed. The additional American funding being allocated for this purpose under the Fulbright Hays Act is also to be welcomed. However, in order to avail of this additional funding it is necessary to replace the existing scholarship exchange board which up to now has administered academic exchanges between the United States and Ireland by a new body which will be known as the Ireland/United States Commission for Educational Exchange. The establishment of this new body is provided for in this Bill. This body will, in the future, administer the scholarship exchange scheme.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in the tribute paid to the scholarship exchange board for the excellent work done by them since they were established in 1957.</P>
      <P>Sections 2, 3 and 4 deal with the establishment of the new commission and how it will operate. Its functions are defined in section 2. Section 3 deals with the number of members of the commission and the method of appointment of members. Section 4 sets out the provisions regarding the officers of the Commission. I would like to welcome the statement by the Minister that the commission will be larger and more autonomous in management and administration than the scholarship board. I also welcome the fact that the present chairman of the scholarship exchange board will serve as the first chairman of the new commission. This will provide a degree of continuity which will be of considerable benefit to the new commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fund which the new commission will have at its disposal is provided for in section 5. It will be known as the Ireland/United States Educational Fund. This fund will enable the Commission <Col N="2011" /> to finance a variety of activities with an educational dimension. Exchanges of students, research workers and teachers of the two countries will come within the scope of the fund, as will other educational and cultural programmes and activities such as research, studies and instruction. Hopefully, in the years ahead many citizens of both countries will benefit from the enactment of this legislation, the establishment of the new commission and the new Ireland/United States Educational Fund.</P>
    <P>Indeed, since 1957 many Irish academics and post-graduate students have been enabled to pursue further studies in the United States because of the existence of the scholarship exchange fund. Similarly, many United States students availed of the scheme to study in Ireland. Apart altogether from those United States students who come here under the scholarship exchange scheme, thousands of other United States students come to Ireland every year to partake in a variety of courses and summer schools. This is to be very much welcomed and encouraged. Indeed, I understand that more and more American universities and educational institutions are providing courses in Irish studies. Such courses will, inevitably, lead to a greater interest in Irish literatue, culture and history. We should do everything possible to harness this interest in an effort to attract as many as possible of those students to visit Ireland and spend some time studying here.</P>
    <P>Since the passing of the Scholarship Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1957 the programme of academic exchange has been under the umbrella of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Other Senators referred to this. I would also like to ask if any consideration was ever given to transferring this programme to the Minister for Education and the Department of Education. It appears to me that a very strong case could be made for doing so, as this programme would fit in very comfortably <Col N="2012" /> with the other activities of the Department of Education. I welcome the Bill and the additional funding being made available under it. I sincerely hope that increased opportunity will exist for a greater level of participation in the programme in the years ahead and that many Irish and United States students will benefit considerably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. I want to use the occasion to welcome the Bill which is very important. All of us are satisfied that educational exchange is vital. What exactly, one might ask, do we get out of exchanges such as these? We get recognition of the educational establishments here and in the United States. That, in itself, leads to a broadening of the mind of the students fortunate enough to be awarded these scholarships. It gives them an opportunity to study the culture and traditions of the country in which they are fortunate to be taking up their scholarships. More importantly, it gives them a learning experience of that educational establishment and of the way of life of that country and affords them an opportunity to compare the educational establishments both here and in the US. From a government point of view and certainly from the Irish Government's point of view exchange is vital because statistics show that something like 5 per cent of Americans actually travel abroad, which is a relatively small figure. One of the reasons may be that they have not been aware of Ireland as a country with tremendous tradition and culture and worth visiting. Because we have so many Irish people go to the US, and we have so many relations there, we may forget about the vast bulk of people there who have no tradition or contact with us in Ireland. I see, therefore, this exchange as giving an opportunity to bring in other graduates from the US to Ireland who will be the tourists of the future. They will return home and tell their friends and neighbours what a marvellous country this is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite interesting to consider the range of speakers. There were two speakers from the university sector, Senator <Col N="2013" /> McKenna from the vocational school sector, and Senator Mullooly from the national school sector. The two university Senators made no mention whatsoever of the regional colleges and the higher education institutes. As somebody lecturing in the Regional College, Cork, I take the opportunity to refer to these establishments and the excellence of the graduates who are being produced there.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned difficulties with regard to recognition of degrees here and in the US. My own personal view is that we can be very proud in Ireland of the quality of graduate that we are producing. This message is certainly getting across in the US. The number of companies who are now coming to Ireland to recruit graduates is growing annually. The graduates who have gone before have proved themselves. They have shown, after a very short time working in the US, that they are top quality. There is great scope and potential for development within industry there. In actual fact, it is causing difficulty in some areas in that some of our best graduates have been going abroad to companies in the US. Even though unemployment levels are extremely high, a company like Intel locating here in Ireland had a difficulty in recruiting top class graduates. It is ironic that in order to meet their requirements Intel had, through a network now established by the IDA, to contact Irish graduates working abroad to entice them back here.</P>
    <P>Degrees and status should be looked at particularly in our two countries. The Department of Education here and the education establishment in the US should compare our degrees. It seems that our graduates reach a far higher professional level at the end of their degree courses than would be the case in the US. We need equivalence in this regard. We have established an excellence in terms of the graduates we are producing but we might ask ourselves are we cutting down on the numbers who could become graduates because of the high standards we expect from them. Should there be a levelling off? It is something that we could pursue further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2014" /> I know, it is not appropriate to the Minister to advert to the fact that there is a difficulty with regard to titles of regional colleges in particular. What is in a name? On a visit to the US, as part of an industrial delegation, we had the President of a university and the principal of a regional college. When the itinerary was being prepared for these two people to visit educational establishments in the US the President of the university was sent along to equivalent universities in the US, but the principal of the Regional Technical College was sent to second-level institutions. In other words, the term and title &ldquo;Regional Technical College&rdquo; does not suggest that in these colleges we have degree courses and diploma and certificate courses. Some acknowledgment must be made of this and changing the title of the colleges would bring this about.</P>
    <P>With regard to industrial policy the IDA have singled out the pharmaceutical, electronic, computer and the health care sectors. The Government have particularly identified the food and tourism sectors. The commission might have regard to those areas when allocating scholarships? While I am not saying that policy should be channelled entirely into those areas, regard should be had to industrial policy here. When we are having exchanges and trying to get the best advantage out of them, we should keep in mind what industrial policy is and the advantages that can accrue from them. I have heard of cities and counties twinning with others in the US. While this scholarship scheme is laudable, obviously it is limited in its scope. For a long time I have held the view that we should be looking at twinning between third level institutions here and in the US.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the major impact that the US Government have had on the siting of industry here over the years. It makes me cringe when I hear people trying to denigrate some of the American policies. The American Government have been a good friend to us over the years, and I would like to acknowledge that here <Col N="2015" /> today. This agreement, and the amount of money that is made available, is further proof of their commitment to Ireland. As regards twinning, there are major advantages from that for our educational establishments. I would hope that the Minister for Education would consider whether any funding could be made available to universities, regional colleges and other institutions who become involved in twinning.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House. It should be put on record that despite the criticism from the Opposition Benches about problems in the prison services, this is the second debate on this general matter in the past 12 months. It was debated on 13 June, 1990 on a motion tabled by Senator Costello. While I am not criticising him for that it just shows that the Department, the Minister and the Minister of State are concerned about the problems in the prison services. They are doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>If we had a Utopia and a perfect society we would not need prisons. The reality is that for centuries a prison system has developed basically to protect the citizens who are being interfered with by criminals, etc. Unfortunately custodial sentences are the only alternative that can be used to ensure that the citizens of this country can walk freely in the streets and go about their business unhindered. It should also be said that the number of people who are apprehended, taken through our courts and eventually end up in jail does not reflect the incidence of crime on the streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total number of prisoners we now deal with is somewhere in the region of 2,100. This number has escalated over the past ten or 15 years. In our cities and <Col N="2016" /> towns there is increased violence particularly related to drug trafficking, etc. The drug barons and the escalating violence in our towns and streets, despite increased Garda numbers and increased resources, is a problem this Government and successive Governments have had to face in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The report notes with concern matters such as overcrowding and improper conditions in our prisons. It should be placed on record that this Government, the Minister and the Department have, over the past three or four years, done much to redress the problem. Perhaps it may be argued by the Opposition that enough has not been done but the Minister and the Department must be lauded for what has been done in regard to building, refurbishment and providing facilities and services in prisons. Let us compare the situation with that in the United States, a large country with a large population. The cost last year in the United States of running the prison services was $20 billion, a frightening amount. For the three previous years there were substantial increases in the United States budget to deal with the prison services generally but despite all that, the crime rate is escalating. We do not have that size of problem here and within our resources we are handling the situation reasonably well.</P>
    <P>As regards other European countries &mdash; and there was a survey done some time ago &mdash; out of 20 countries surveyed the Irish prison service was in sixth place. That indicates that in the context of Europe the Department, the Minister and the prison service are acquitting themselves reasonably well. For anyone to say that the Government ignore the prison service is an absolute lie. We must face reality. Whereas there may be some difficulties facing the Department and the prison service, there have been huge strides over the past three or four years to rectify this. For example, last year a riot took place in Strangeways Prison, Manchester. Prior to that riot the prisoners had to spend 23 out of the 24 hours of any given day in their cells. In Ireland prisoners are allowed out of their cells at <Col N="2017" /> 8 a.m. and do not have to return until 8 p.m. In the intervening time there are recreational, educational and training facilities available. That is reasonable treatment. It was stated in a debate here in this House last June that we were in parallel with prisons in England. The only parallel between Strangeways Prison and Mountjoy Jail in Dublin is that they are both old buildings but there is no comparison in the level of services that we are providing here. That fact must be put on record.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have criticised our judicial system and have said that the Minister for Justice and his Department are not doing enough to deal with alternative methods apart from issuing custodial sentences or sending people to prison. As a practicing lawyer I must say quite clearly and categorically from my experience at both District Court level, Circuit Court level and High Court level that that is not true. Most judges, whether they be district justices or judges of higher courts are very slow to send somebody to prison for six months or 12 months, depending on the seriousness of the crime. Where possible they will dispose of a charge by way of fine or will use the community service scheme which is something I would laud and commend. It may be argued that that scheme it is not being used enough. In my view it is being widely used and has a great success rate. There are certain people who are not suitable to be put on such community service programmes. Certainly a fine or even a suspended sentence is not enough. I have often heard, in my 12 or 14 years in court, judges saying that the person in front of them put themselves into jail. I remember one case where a man had been caught driving a car without insurance six times in 12 months. I was in the District Court on three occasions where the judge said: &ldquo;You are a married man with three or four children. As a last chance I am imposing a suspended sentence but if you are before me again in the near future while I am in this area I will certainly send you to prison&rdquo;. Not alone did that offender come back once, he came back twice. Six times in a given <Col N="2018" /> period he ignored the law, deliberately driving into the local village to have a drink, collect his dole or whatever. He had no insurance and ignored the Garda. In those instances, people driving vehicles and the public in general must be protected and the judge is left with no choice but impose a prison sentence. The judiciary must be complimented on their humane approach to these situations. As I clearly outlined earlier it is as a last resort that somebody is put in prison. In many instances the seriousness of the crime or the repetition of certain crimes deserves nothing but a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amount of money spent on the prison services, on the educational side the estimated cost for the current year to the Department of Education of 100 teachers, on a secondment basis, is £1.7 million. That is a substantial figure and shows the concern of the Minister and the Department for the education of prisoners. The estimate for the provision of library services for prisoners for the current year is £325,000. The estimated cost of training and equipment in prisons for 1991 is £232,000. The cost of tools etc. is £500,000. The cost of providing extra recreational equipment and supplies is £235,000. These figures represent a substantial increase.</P>
    <P>Since this report was published in 1988 the Government have made great strides in trying to rectify some of the defects that were pointed out in it. The report details the different prisons. Spike Island in Cork is mentioned where there is no overcrowding; there is excellent backup support by the VEC and FÁS, in providing training in different aspects. It says that during December &mdash; that was probably 1987 &mdash; the Geese Theatre Company of Great Britain visited the prison. Therefore, the prisoners are not totally neglected. This is not unique to Spike Island. Other prisons such as Mountjoy get visiting theatres and are allowed to see films etc. Last year during the World Cup the Governor of the prison, through the Department of Justice, allowed the prisoners to see the World Cup no matter what time of day <Col N="2019" /> or night the matches were being played. This shows the concern of the Government and the humane approach they have adopted.</P>
    <P>Since the debate last year the construction of Wheatfield Prison, at a cost of £40 million to the Department of Justice, was completed. That is a modern prison. The money spent by the Government indicates again their huge concern for the prison services in this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some statistics in relation to the Council of Europe document. Last year I said here that the rate of imprisonment per 100,000 of population is 98.2 per cent in the UK, 106.2 per cent in Scotland, 86.7 per cent in West Germany, 92 per cent in France, 96 per cent in Austria and 56 per cent in the Republic of Ireland. Out of 22 countries surveyed Ireland was sixth from the top at that time. This should be acknowledged.</P>
    <P>I would be the first to accept some of the criticism and comments made by speakers on the other side because AIDS in our prisons over the last four, five or six years is a new concept. It is one that is difficult to deal with and one which the Government are taking a very sympathetic look at. In Mountjoy there is a facility where AIDS prisoners are segregated and given excellent treatment. Doctors, dentists, psychiatrists and psychologists are always readily available in our prison services. On the last occasion the debate was spurred on by the fact that in 1989 four prisoners died in Irish prisons primarily by way of suicide. In 1985 in a four month period four prisoners died in our prisons. In the case of AIDS, or in the case of suicide, however diligent the Minister and the prison officers might be, it is difficult to do anything in advance that would be helpful.</P>
    <P>If one were to analyse the system, education is being provided in prison for people who are illiterate, to primary, secondary and university levels. Wherever possible this is encouraged. It is quite common nowadays to hear of long term prisoners studying law and arts and being encouraged by the prison staff and officers to do so. It has often been said <Col N="2020" /> that we have a terrible prison system, that our prisoners are being treated badly and so on but if we compare our system with that in the 20 countries surveyed throughout Europe we come out very well. Due to the progress the Government have made in the prison services since the results of the survey were published we must be in the top four. That should not be forgotten.</P>
    <P>I could go on at length but we have agreed to limit our speeches to 20 minutes. I do not wish to delay the House and I would like to let other people contribute.</P>
    <P>One must bring a balance to this whole debate because as a public representative, one criticism I often get from ordinary citizens is that there are people walking the streets of Dublin or the streets of Cork, who commit very serious crimes, whether they attack old people in their homes, which is a desperate crime, molest young children or commit serious sexual offences like rape, who do not serve enough time in prison. People say that our system is too lenient and lets people back on the streets too soon. That should be recognised because people are concerned that some of those who commit serious crimes are released on remission too early. There has to be a balance. The primary duty of the Minister, the Department and the Judiciary is to protect the citizens of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Recently in a Circuit Court case four people who had committed serious crimes against old people sought leniency from the court. I was almost six hours in the court that day and I heard them mocking the judge and the system. They are the type of people we are dealing with. If they take the Judiciary and our judicial system for granted, they deserve nothing more than to be in prison. I must compliment the Minister, and the Minister of State, and say that a very good job has been done in the past three or four years. If we continue the progress our prison system will be the best in Europe. That should be put on record and recognised by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome <Col N="2021" /> the Minister to the House and thank him for taking the debate. I look forward to his reply.</P>
      <P>The general conditions which prevail in the prison system are despicable and an indictment of the Minister for Justice. This is of extreme concern to everybody in the prison service. It is now six years since the report of the committee of inquiry into the penal system, which was chaired by T.K. Whitaker, was published. This made five key recommendations, most of which have been ignored.</P>
      <P>In discussing the prison system we must remember that society must be protected from the criminal elements. Sanctions are applied where the law has been breached. We have an independent judicial system which endeavours to apply the law fairly, regardless of its warts. It takes all the circumstances surrounding a case into account and then decides on the penalty. People are in prison because of their own actions. The old, the young, the vulnerable sections of society &mdash; in fact society in general &mdash; must be protected. The prison system fulfils its role in doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ten years ago it was recognised that there were problems in the prison service. They were identified as overcrowding, lack of activity for prisoners, unhygienic conditions and a lack of places for disruptive prisoners. The Department of Justice in recognising the problem facing the prison service developed a building programme costed at £13 million. This programme included the building of new prisons at Wheatfield in Dublin, in Cork and in Limerick and a security unit to hold disruptive prisoners in Portlaoise. This building programme if carried out would have a considerable impact on the problems in the prison service. Ten years later little has happened except for the marginal development at Wheatfield. Of those plans only the first phase has been completed. The problems due to overcrowding, lack of activity of prisoners, the unhygienic conditions and the lack of places for disruptive prisoners have become more acute in the past ten years. Added to these problems has been the <Col N="2022" /> increasing incidence of AIDS and other diseases in our prisons. The addition of Wheatfield Prison, and its 320 places, has not alleviated the chronic overcrowding problem. Mountjoy, the most unhygienic of our prisons, has the worst overcrowding problem. To accentuate the problems among its inmates are those who suffer from the AIDS virus.</P>
    <P>The problem of in-cell sanitation must be tackled. Only three of our prisons could be regarded as having proper cell sanitation. The Minister and the Government must give a commitment for the introduction of in-cell sanitation in all our prisons.</P>
    <P>The prison service lacks a clearly defined role and has no sense of direction. The Whitaker report states:</P>
    <P>The Committee is satisfied that the detailed administration of the prison has moved to an excessive degree to the Department of Justice to the detriment of discretion, responsibility and, therefore, good management. While the ultimate responsibility must remain with the Minister for Justice, the day to day administration of our prisons should be placed by statute in the hands of the director of the prison service who will be Chairman and Chief Executive of a separate executive agency or board and be the Manager responsible for the efficient functioning of the prison system.</P>
    <P>The Minister must appoint a clearly identifiable leader in our prison system, a person who would be responsible for the administration of the services and is seen to be so. The Government should give urgent consideration to this proposal.</P>
    <P>The Irish prison system needs a radical overhaul if it is to provide a humane and dignified regime into the next century for those in custody. This is going to cost money and the Government must give a firm commitment to allocate the necessary finances to introduce the changes which are needed. The Whitaker report states:</P>
    <P>It has been said that the way in which a society treats its prisoner population <Col N="2023" /> is a reflection of the degree of maturity and civilisation within the society.</P>
    <P>It one accepts this we should be very concerned about Irish society.</P>
    <P>The incidence of suicide in the general population has been increasing over the past number of years. An examination of the statistics available on the matter gives a fair indication as to the problems which face our prison service. Since 1975 there have been 19 deaths in the prison system which can be classified as suicide. The statistics indicate that the greatest percentage increase in the suicide rate in Ireland since 1970 has been among young males between the ages of 15 and 24 years. This group forms a large majority of our prison population. It is accepted that those with an alcohol or drugs dependency problem are a high risk factor for suicide attempts. This grouping forms a large part of our prison population. People from the more deprived areas of society, from large families with low educational achievements, overcrowding in the home, high unemployment, child neglect and so on, are about 12 times more likely to attempt suicide than those from affluent areas of society. People from this grouping make up by far the majority of the population of our prisons. As can be seen from this, the prison service is dealing on a daily basis with a prison population many of whom could be classed as potential suicide risks. The Irish prison system, like all prison systems, has had its share of suicides over the years. A sad fact is that a considerable majority of the suicides were either teenagers or in their early twenties.</P>
    <P>Any suicide has a very traumatic effect on the relatives and friends of the deceased. This is even more so in the prison context with the resulting media coverage of the incident, the inevitable public debate and the attempts to attribute blame. Given the circumstances, this type of reaction is inevitable and the consequences of it can have devastating results on the relatives of the deceased and on the prison staff directly involved <Col N="2024" /> in the discovery of the incident. The question which has to be asked is: can every suicide in our prisons be prevented? Probably the answer is no, but there are numerous incidents where the quick intervention of prison staff has saved lives. Prison officers on the ground are hampered by a lack of information on prisoners, such as records of previous attempts of suicide or unusual behaviour. Hardly a week goes by without a number of incidents involving prisoners cutting themselves and attempting to harm themselves in one way or another and many of these are not logged or recorded. In an attempt to bring about a strategy for the prison service to deal with the problem of suicide, early last year the Minister for Justice set up an advisory group to examine the issue of deaths in prisons and to make recommendations in relation to further measures which might be taken towards their prevention. I would welcome the Minister's comment on its progress and reports from that advisory group.</P>
    <P>We must be very concerned about the situation in the womens' prison. The prison is situated on one of the floors of the main prison in Mountjoy, so it is probably incorrect to call it a women's prison. It is now 21 years since it was recommended that it should be closed. Unlike the situation with male prisoners, all women prisoners are left together &mdash; shop-lifters, murderers, women sentenced for begging, drug pushers and so on. They are all held together. Most of the women held in the Mountjoy complex are there for pretty offences which do not need a high security prison, many of them should not be serving custodial sentences at all.</P>
    <P>The Whitaker report and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace have condemned Mountjoy female prison and in particular sending juveniles there. A secure probation hostel which would enable the courts to suitably deal with juveniles was recommended. This has not been set up. The conditions in the segregation unit are totally unsuitable for the needs of juveniles. I think most of us here have been made aware of a case of <Col N="2025" /> a 15 year old girl at present in solitary confinement in the segregation unit of the female prison. All the professionals who have dealt with her agree that she is in need of a great deal of attention. Preferably a residential therapeutic unit with child care workers is required. The approach to dealing with the 15 year old in such a close unit is surely unacceptable in 1991. This girl is on a very high level of medication and will find it difficult to adjust to normal society when she is released from prison. Since her admission to Mountjoy, this child has suffered great trauma and emotional difficulties. She has cut herself on numerous occasions and has attempted to hang herself at least on one occasion. We must introduce a progressive modern child centred service to deal with these types of situations.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael have called on the Government over the past two years for alternatives to prison sentences for minor offences such as non-payment of fines and debts and so on. It is absurd that our prisons are clogged up with offenders who do not pay fines or debts at a cost to the taxpayer in excess of £600 per week. Prisons should be reserved for those who commit serious crimes against a person and against property. They are the people who should serve their full sentence with time off only for good behaviour. A range of alternatives to prison must be considered. For example, the confiscation of property or assets should be available to enforce such fines. Compensation should be made to the victims of crime, particularly in the cases of old people who are often traumatised and do not recover from the affects of attacks and robberies. Where there is default in such compensation the confiscation or attachment of income, where possible, should be used. Where this is not possible, an extension of the present approach to community services should be substituted rather than putting people in prison. The opportunity to pay fines by instalments should also be examined. Many people do not have ready cash to pay a fine and, rather than putting them in prison, an approach should be made to allow them pay by instalment. Those who commit <Col N="2026" /> serious crimes and violent crimes should serve their full sentence rather than the revolving door approach we have at the moment.</P>
    <P>One third of offences are committed by those under 17 years of age and special mention should be made of this. They suffer from emotional, physical and cultural deprivation. Most of the crimes are petty stealing, and it is rare that a first time crime is committed by those over 17 years of age. We should take this into account. Prison is a training ground for such people. We must attack this problem by increasing the life opportunities of these people and by a careful programme of rehabilitation and education. The aim should be to keep offenders away from future criminal activities and out of prison. We should concentrate on providing further education, training, welfare and guidance to try to ensure that those who are in prison are helped to become constructive members of society.</P>
    <P>Many Members of the House do not have direct knowledge of the various prison systems and how they operate. I think we should all, as Members of the Oireachtas, be more aware of the complexity of the service and the difficulties which it experiences. May I suggest that Members of this House should be invited to visit a cross-section of prisons and prison accommodation to make ourselves more aware of the situation? We should visit a prison like Wheatfield and see how it works, Portlaoise Prison, the women's prison or the open prison like Arklow or Loughan House. I appreciate that Mountjoy is so overcrowded that it would probably be impracticable for Members of the Seanad who are interested to visit it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that my time is almost finished. I thank Senator O'Donovan for anticipating the criticisms of the prison service. I quite understand how he would do that having looked at the prison system and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on this subject, a subject that is raised very often in this House. Senator Costello, <Col N="2027" /> who is active in this area, raises it regularly. Something that is never raised in this House and which I believe should be talked about is victim's rights, It is time we had a victim's rights association.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is difficult to wear two hats. I have never heard Seantor Costello mention victim's rights in this House since I came here.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator has certainly raised prisoners' rights. Our prisons are very good at present and this Government have spent a lot of money in bringing them up to a reasonable standard, but we must start to think also of the rights of victims. I recall my own experience of being a victim of crime. My home was broken into. At the time I said to the garda in the court not to be too severe on them, that they were only young. He looked at me. My home has been burgled three times since and I would not be as lenient again. The people who carry out these burglaries are highly organised. They first come and case your property. They carry out the robberies on old people in the same way. They always case their victim, they study the case and then they swoop. The sad thing is that when you report it to the Garda the first person to be questioned is yourself and the second is your very loyal staff who are put under a lot of pressure. The third to be questioned are customers, people who are in and out, and particularly young persons who may at some time have come to the notice of the Garda. When a robbery is committed it has a very traumatic effect on many innocent people. There is a lot or pressure put on innocent people; <Col N="2028" /> there is a lot of pressure put on school children, particularly secondary school children, when a robbery takes place in a school or in a place where these children are in a habit of visiting.</P>
      <P>There are far-reaching effects of a crime. We all think of the criminal, and that is not bad. He or she is a human being and we must have a certain regard for them, but I think we are going a little overboard. There must be a balance. As the previous speaker said, many old people never recover from the effect of a robbery. I know a number of old people in my own area who were robbed and they never really recovered; indeed some died a short time later. A robbery has a very traumatic effect on such people and nobody is thinking about them at all.</P>
      <P>We all have experienced having our cars broken into. My car has been broken into in this city and a number of items taken, including a half set of golf clubs. Somebody somewhere is playing with a half set of golf clubs and is unable to get the matching half because it is impossible to buy them. They were Lynx paralax clubs, graphite shaft with chromium heads. Someone somewhere might hear of this and realise that they are playing with stolen clubs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My own place has been robbed on three occasions and my car once. These crimes nearly put me to the wall because over £1,000 had been stolen. At that time we had not reached the stage where we were putting everything under lock and key as we are now. Luckily, these criminals were caught because many people were questioned as to who knew the money was there. I was pleased that the criminals were caught. They had come from Northern Ireland, but I did not get back the money or the goods that were stolen. Perhaps six months after a robbery, when you are looking for something, you realise that you did not see it since the robbery. It is amazing all the things that are missing before you realise they are gone. We must have a balance here. We must have rights for the prisoners but we must also have rights for the victims. We are not talking enough <Col N="2029" /> about victims' rights and this is something we will have to deal with in the future.</P>
    <P>There are good rehabilitation services in our prisons and many prisoners are rehabilitated, but &mdash; and I have held this view about physically handicapped people in particular &mdash; if we had an organisation like Alcoholics Anonymous and Gamblers Anonymous, where rehabilitated criminals would be in charge, they would be far better able to speak on behalf of the people they represent than those of us who might think we know all about it but who have no experience of being a criminal. Since itinerants set up their own organisation they have acquired a more human face. Many political prisoners, for instance, come out of prison highly educated having pursued their studies in prison. If that service is there for political prisoners it is also available to other prisoners. Some prisoners have come out of prison with diplomas or degrees. There are many services provided in our prisons, but are they being utilised as much as they should, and when they are utilised, do we make use of those people, because there is nobody as good at giving advice as somebody with experience? You can talk all you like, you can read all you like, but it is all theoretical. I believe we should have more of those rehabilitated people in an organisation similar to Alcoholics Anomymous, because that organisation does far more for people with alcohol problems than any social workers, with no disrespect to them, because they have experience, they know the problems and they have gone through it themselves.</P>
    <P>In regard to our open prisons, I vist Loughan House occasionally; it is a hotel away from home. When you visit there the prisoners will make you tea. I have been entertained there by prisoners. There is one type of prisoner for whom I have great sympathy, those people who are victims of circumstances. They got pulled into cases where some member of their family or somebody else started the problem. These prisoners could have given evidence that would have cleared these people, but if they gave that evidence they would be looked on as <Col N="2030" /> informers on their own. Rather than inform on their own, they kept their mouths shut, remain silent and refuse to co-operate. I know of one particular victim, a fine decent fellow, who is in prison at present and he is certainly a victim of circumstances. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time and got enmeshed in the crime. He found it was as easy to take his sentence as to inform, because it was going to be a harsh sentence for him no matter which way he danced. He had no choice but to refuse to give evidence and as a result he found himself doing seven or eight years in prison. He is in Loughan House at present. It is good that he was moved to Loughan House because he should never have been in Mountjoy Prison in the first place. I am sure there are many cases that are like that where people are implicated and unfortunatley get caught up. I believe that for that particular type of person we should be making a special case. I did my best in one case. I succeeded in getting them as far as Loughan House, but I would like to have got more done.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more rehabilitated criminals. I use that term now with the greatest of respect, but if they had done a jail sentence that is an unfortunate bracket to fall into. I would like to see them more involved in rehabilitation services. They know the people, they know who is involved and they could give encouragement. It would be a boost to their morale to say &ldquo;Look, you have made it. You have been down and you have come up. Now you could help more to get up.&rdquo; By their example and by their help we could improve our rehabilitation services.</P>
    <P>Fifty years or more ago we closed prisons in this country, including a prison in my own town of Sligo. I remember at the time people saying &ldquo;Thanks be to God, we are at last an educated, cultured society. There is no need for jails&rdquo;. What has happened society over the last 20 years? Where have we gone wrong? Certainly, society has gone wrong. The reason is often given that people are poor and underprivileged and so on. I do not <Col N="2031" /> believe that. Just watch the supermarkets. There are many people caught who could damn near buy the supermarket. It is not for want of money, but they just get involved. Many of them pay up and smile and get out of it and that is it; but many of them do not.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand what has gone wrong with society that it is so criminally minded. This country is losing out now. Tourists cannot come into towns. We have gangs now on the east coast and as soon as tourists leave their cars the cars are robbed and all their belongings taken. Very often the money they brought with them to spend on a holiday in this country is stolen. Crime must be controlled before it gets out of hand.</P>
    <P>Is a jail sentence the answer any more? Are they really taking any heed of jail, or is it no longer a severe sentence? I do not know. Some would say we should have the same system as the Isle of Man where there are far more tourists and no crime. I do not know. I am not going to advocate violence to deal with violence, but I will certainly say that criminals are successful because of their violent methods. Because of their violence people are faced with the choice of trying to apprehend them and getting the worst of the battle, or they become so much afraid of the criminal that they say &ldquo;Take it, for God's sake, and leave me alone&rdquo;. Certainly, the criminal of today has become extremely violent. In this city, ladies driving their cars at night and sometimes in daylight, have their cars smashed and their handbags taken. That is planned and organised. It is not the act of stupid but of very intelligent people.</P>
    <P>I am one for giving prisoners rights and I am delighted that our prisons are being upgraded all the time. I can say that Loughan House, which is the only prison I have experience of, has improved enormously over the years. I was sad to see that some people broke out of it recently. Some of them are back in Mountjoy and some of them are still free. I cannot understand why prisoners, when they get to a place like Loughan House, cannot have some sense and avail of the services <Col N="2032" /> there, because it is really a hotel in the country.</P>
    <P>Fines were mentioned. There is an appeal to the Minister. I believe if anyone who finds it difficult to pay a fine writes to the Minister saying they are prepared to pay it in instalments, the Minister and his staff will be prepared to consider such an offer. Perhaps for some petty crimes we do put people into prison too quickly. These people are not a danger to society. I am speaking of people brought up for driving untaxed cars and so on. For that kind of a person, who certainly breaks the law but not in a violent or criminal manner, perhaps there should be a system of community work rather than prison. It would take some of the load off our prisons, because there are many people like that in prison who do not deserve to be there. I do not think that was the purpose for which we intended our prisons. On the other hand, I do not really know and I am only speaking of the situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>AIDS is a big problem in prisons today. I understand there are at present 40 male prisoners and two female prisoners who have been identified as HIV positive. I understand these prisoners are detained in the B base at the separation unit in Mountjoy Prison. The female prisoners are integrated with the general female population. Testing is on a voluntary basis and these figures do not reveal the full extent of the HIV infection among the prisoner population. It is estimated that there may be 200 HIV infected people in Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>Those are problems connected by and large, with drugs. People start with the abuse of alcohol from which they go on to drugs. Here is where we could do a good job. It is difficult. This is a multimillion pound business and there are people making big money on it. It is sad in our society today that people do not mind what suffering they inflict on other human beings as long as they are making money out of them. That is a sad reality of life today.</P>
    <P>If we could come to terms with substance abuse, a big improvement could be made in our society in general. I do not <Col N="2033" /> think for one minute that unemployment, housing and so on is really the answer to all this. It is simplistic say that. There are drug problems, there are alcohol problems, even in the best of homes. It stretches right across the board; it is not just in one section of our society. This is a problem which must be confronted if we are ever to achieve reduced numbers in prisons. That is the real answer to our prison problems. The numbers must be reduced because until we do that we have not learned to live as a society.</P>
    <P>I notice now that medical advice about HIV is that it is justifable on medical grounds, as distinct from operational grounds, to segregate offenders. An expert group, comprising medical, psychiatric, psychological and welfare disciplines, together with people who are involved day-to-day in the management of offenders, has been established to examine the manner in which these prisoners can best be treated. A simple issue in their deliberations will be the question of desegregation. A new unit in Mountjoy is being constructed which will cater <i>inter alia</i> for offenders who are HIV positive and who are no longer fit for the normal prison regime. That is great, because those are people who are sick. We must all have a greater concern for them than for any other type of prisoner because many of those people have been brought into drugs and so on and find themselves in prison as sick men and women. I have great sympathy for sick people and am delighted that this unit is being built. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the matter before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Prisons almost inevitably fail to achieve many of their stated objectives. They do not deter people; there is not a scrap of evidence that custodial penalties for crimes act as deterrents. I am perfectly convinced through my own experience and from talking to other people that the majority of those who go to jail for a variety of offences have absolutely no idea when they are committing the offence what the penalty is. A reflect response takes place every so <Col N="2034" /> often in this and other political systems when there is an outbreak of some spectacular form of crime &mdash; usually a crime that bothers the middle classes &mdash; which is to extend penalties and lengthen prison sentences. These measures do not work and make no difference. Prison is not a deterrent to the social classes to which prisoners largely belong. Senator Farrell said much that one could identify with but I remind him that the overwhelming majority of those who end up in prison come from backgrounds of extreme social and economic deprivation. It is not true that poor people are somehow worse than the rest of us but if the rest of us had to live in similar conditions of social and economic deprivation an increasing proportion of us would end up in lives of criminal activity. Many of us do not have to cope with the pressures, isolation and desolation of social deprivation in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true of all countries that those who go to jail are not necessarily those who commit the greatest crimes but those who commit a certain kind of crime and who come from a certain section of society. It is frequently pointed out, for instance, that a person who kills someone while drunk in charge of a car rarely ends up in prison although the crime is one of the most heinous offences in our society. It is not the fact that they are unlikely to go to jail that persuades people to keep on committing this crime. People who are found guilty of large scale white collar crime do not go to jail unlike people who are found to be fiddling social welfare, even for trivial sums and who generally receive suspended prison sentences. People fiddling their taxes do a deal with the Revenue Commissioners which does not involve any penalty. It must be the only area where if you are caught stealing, which is what tax evasion is, you pay back what you owe to the institution you stole from and there is no penalty. If everybody involved in theft could get away with paying back what they stole few people would go to jail. Penalties are imposed on people not because we do not recover the stolen goods but because they have done something wrong. When <Col N="2035" /> it comes to tax evasion we have a different perspective on it.</P>
    <P>Prisons do not work as a deterrent or in terms of rehabilitation either. Prisons achieve two objectives one of which is positive. They serve as a limited degree of protection for society from people who are proven to be a considerable threat. That is probably the only positive thing you can say about prisons. The tragedy is that the price of our protection from certain people is the damage to many people who pass through the prison system and who end up worse off in terms of their attitude to society and their attitude to crime. They believe, as many people do, that they have learnt a thing or two in prison which will save them from being caught next time. A spiral of crime is produced, directly and casually related to people's encounters with the prison system. If we were prepared to admit that the only positive function of prison is to protect us from certain people then much of our energy for putting more people into prison could be directed towards finding a punitive measure which would persuade people not to commit offences, protect society and not harm offenders. There is no point in getting ourselves into a reflex situation with prisons which gives us more problems to solve later on.</P>
    <P>The most comprehensive study on our prison system done during my political career and indeed for many years was the Whitaker Committee report. There is considerable lethargy about implementing its recommendations. Some of the factual information in it seems to have been dismissed, if not ignored completely. We still have considerable overcrowding in the prisons. It is difficult to deal with the prison situation when the most recent report on prisons and places of detention covers 1988. We do not have a report on 1989 that I am aware of nor a report on 1990 and we are halfway through 1991. This situation does not strike me as symptomatic of efficient prison organisation or efficient information assembly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> The prison population keeps on climbing. The daily average prison population in 1986 was, 1,869, in 1987 it was 1,943, in 1988 it was 1,962 and I am told the number of prisoners today is 2,170. I do not know whether that is the daily average for this year or the precise number at present. If you add in the sort of sums that the Whitaker Committee recommended we have a demand for about 2,500 prison places. It is something of an achievement that that number is a few hundred less than the minimum projection made by the Whitaker Committee for 1990. The demands that will result from the increasing numbers will go on forever.</P>
    <P>All recommendations in the Whitaker report deserve to be implemented, but one which could have been and has not been implemented is the recommendation to increase remission to what the Whitaker Committee say is the standard European figure of one-third. I have no idea what strange notion of prisons or their function persuades successive Irish Governments that 25 per cent remission is preferable to 33 and one-third per cent remission. I wish somebody would give me a reason other than telling me that it is still being studied. The Minister and his Department are aware of this matter for long enough to have done something about it. Remission in Northern Ireland is currently at 50 per cent, although one does not want to make invidious comparisons because there are other things about the Northern Ireland prison system that one would not like too much.</P>
    <P>It is well to recollect what it is like to be in prison. I had the experience of being inside Portlaoise Prison recently for perfectly legitimate reasons and on my count I passed through at least 14 locked doors. It is an awesome experience to feel that you have actually passed through not just one barrier to your escape by possibly 14. Going from one box into another and so on produces a surge of increasing isolation. It underlines the philosophy enunciated by a former Minister for Justice and now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, when he said that depriving people of their <Col N="2037" /> liberty is punishment enough. I get annoyed with people such as Senator Farrell, who said a little on it, when they talk about the excessively comfortable conditions in prison. Nobody here could spend even three days in the best prison in the State without realising what it means to be deprived of your liberty, however luxurious the conditions. You cannot have comfortable luxurious prisons; to be in prison is punishment. You are haggling about details if you haggle about decent conditions in prison which may encourage prisoners to do some good instead of enormous harm. Decent conditions in prison do not make prison a less awful experience.</P>
    <P>It is the poor, the excluded and the abandoned who go to prison. The other class of people who go to prison in this country are, of course, the subversive, political or whatever you want to call them prisoners in Portlaoise. They are a classic example of the meaninglessness of rehabilitation. I have no evidence that going to Portlaoise does anything to persuade people to change their political views.</P>
    <P>One of the great scandals of our justice system is the way we deal with juvenile criminals. A 15 year old girl/child is currently in custody in Mountjoy prison. The Department of Justice, in an exercise in semantics, says she is not in solitary confinement. It is not a view shared by the chairman of the visiting committee. I have a letter here from him to the girl's solicitor in which he says: &ldquo;Unfortunately the child is now in solitary confinement, basically&rdquo;. What this reflects is not that anybody is less compassionate than I but that the problem of the detention of children in the worst prison in our prison system will not be solved by meaningless arguments about semantics. The child is on her own in that prison because an eminent member of the Judiciary ruled that she was depraved. I have here in front of me two different affidavits, one from a professor of moral theology in Maynooth, Professor Enda McDonagh, and the other from a woman whose work with the deprived is usually lauded to the rooftops by people who want to bask <Col N="2038" /> in her reflected glory, Sister Stanislaus Kennedy. Both make the point that it is a contradiction in terms to use the word &ldquo;depravity&rdquo; about a child. By definition &ldquo;depravity&rdquo; is a comment on a lifestyle and a lifetime of change. I quote from Professor McDonagh:</P>
    <P>I say that for most Christian theologians and believers as well as for moral philosophers or ethicists &ldquo;depravity&rdquo; and &ldquo;depraved&rdquo; are used in a general sense of a very corrupt or serious perversion in one's behaviour and way of life. I do not believe that the words could or should be applied to a 15 year old.</P>
    <P>That is the view of the most eminent moral theologian in the State. A child is incarcerated in that prison because our society and law decided that she was depraved. Let me give you an account of what this &ldquo;depraved&rdquo; person does on her own. This recent account was given to a visitor:</P>
    <P>9 a.m. &mdash; up and called and door opened. I could go to the gym if I wanted. I only went this morning. Sit on the bed listening to tapes. I have five or six. 11 p.m. to 12 noon &mdash; school.</P>
    <P>She mentions the teacher's name but I will not mention it.</P>
    <P>I find it boring but I am coming on in the reading and writing. I could do a bit before I came in. I could not read a letter. Can read a few words. On Tuesday there is cookery at school times. I went once. 2 p.m. &mdash; everyday locked up. Listen to tapes again. 3 p.m. &mdash; I can go to the yard but I do not go since X left because I would not like walking around the yard on my own. I never went out at all last week except to school in the cabin. A certain prison officer is very nice. I might talk to her, etc. 4.30 to 5.30 p.m. &mdash; lock up, sit on the bed listening to tapes. 5.15 p.m. to 7 p.m. &mdash; TV. 7.15 p.m. &mdash; locked up until morning. Lock up at night time and dinner time is worst time. I sit down and cry and talk to myself and sing to myself the songs on my tape. I <Col N="2039" /> hate being on my own. It is boring. I feel like doing harm to myself. Last night I thought I would do harm to myself but I stopped myself thinking I would be out some day. When I think of my father's death I get upset.</P>
    <P>Her father committed suicide during the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>I cry every morning over him. I think of my father and my mother and the kids at home crying and so on.</P>
    <P>This 15 year old child has attempted suicide four time and is on the following medication: Valium three to five times a day, Ponstan four times per day, sometimes Largactyl and one sleeping tablet at night. I do not quote that letter with any voyeuristic delight. I quote it because it is wrong; the Governor of Mountjoy publicly said it is wrong to detain a child there. The prison officers believe it is wrong. They are all doing their best for that child. It is not their fault but the law's and the State's fault that we have nowhere else to put her except in appalling conditions in what is <i>de facto</i> solitary confinement. It is a scandalous reproach to our society that that child be locked up like that. I do not know what the Minister's answer to all of this will be but presumably to promise action some time next year.</P>
    <P>We have experienced extraordinary ambivalence about juvenile crime in this country. When we are in our &ldquo;sanctity of the family-cherish the children of the nation equally&rdquo; mood we accept that children need to be supported, educated, helped and all the things that go with love and family and so on. We are all very good at making speeches about it. The following week, if there is a particularly spectacular juvenile crime problem, we all change sides and talk about young thugs, &ldquo;lock them up, throw away the key and whip them&rdquo;. That ambivalence proves that we cannot accept the fundamental fact that at 15 a child deserves to be treated like a child. She is not a potential adult but a child. In that child's <Col N="2040" /> testimony you can see what you are dealing with. Whatever her problem or record we are dealing not with an adult but with a child, with the feelings and needs of a child. Locking a child up on its own could never be right and it is up to us as a society to deal with it now and not next year. That child should be out of Mountjoy today and it is the Government's duty to find somewhere else to put her. It is a shame on the Government, the Department and all of us that we would tolerate a child being kept in those conditions. We cannot talk about prison reform under my circumstances if we are prepared to tolerate the locking up of a child in a place like that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my time with Senators McKenna and Hanafin.</P>
      <P>Discussing the statement on the prison service what comes to mind is the misery that honest people of this island suffer when they are attacked, vandalised and their homes broken into. I ask myself the question: what rights have they? Have they the right to be protected? I think of the old lady last week who rang me. While she was out playing cards somebody broke into her home, ransacked it and stole £80. It was an absolute misery for that woman. The result is that that woman fears for her life and safety. She was living on her own. She asked me: &ldquo;What can you do for me? How can you ensure that my home is not broken into?&rdquo; The Minister and the Government have a duty as far as possible to ensure that the right of the ordinary individual is protected. Therefore I welcome the commitment of the Minister to assign a further 1,000 gardaí to the beat to protect the rights of the individual.</P>
      <P>I think of the person on the street at night who is attacked, mugged and maimed and I say it is essential that the Government put more gardaí on the street. I welcome the commitment of the Minister towards achieving that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we speak of rights I think of the rights of the ordinary member of society and the rights of a prisoner. To equate those rights and to find a balance is the <Col N="2041" /> important thing. We all ask ourselves what this Government have done to ensure that the rights of the prisoner are protected? The punishment for sinning against society is that the person be locked away and divorced from contact with the outside world, while at the same time ensuring that the prisoner has every possible amenity given the resources available to a Government. When I look at the Fianna Fáil Government performance in 1987 and the performance of the present Government since 1989 I ask myself have improvements taken place? Is there a general concern for those who have been locked up? The answer is a very positive yes.</P>
    <P>I can only speak about the prison in Cork because I am aware of what happens within that prison. The object in taking a person out of society is that when the term is served that person will return to society and operate in a constructive way within the law. How is that achieved? Are this Government and the prison officers achieving that?</P>
    <P>In the prisons at present training schemes operate for prisoners. I see Senator Costello looking at me as the general secretary of the ASTI and I want to remind him that marvellous training schemes are being undertaken under the vocational education committees. Prisoners have the option of undertaking courses provided by teachers under Cork City Vocational Education Committee. Courses in carpentry, painting technology and a wide range of activities have been provided by this Government. But is that enough? The answer is one can never be absolutely sure; the Government can only do their best. If these constructive outlets are not provided then surely there is no chance that these people will integrate properly into society at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>What are prisoners' rights? On what are they founded? Who were the people behind the founding of the prisoners' rights movement? What was their purpose and what did they hope to achieve? Balance is everything and a balance must be reached between the rights of offenders and the rights of people <Col N="2042" /> offended against. Society is structured in such a way that people will continue to offend against it and must be penalised.</P>
    <P>When we talk about prisoners' rights do we go overboard? Do advocates of prisoners' rights acknowledge the fact that the Government are trying to provide sanitary facilities in every prison cell? Do they acknowledge that Wheat-field places a major emphasis on work training? I do not think so.</P>
    <P>When I talk about a balance I think of advocates of prisoners rights who may be on the verge of incitement. When talking about rights I think of the prison officers. How much recognition is given to the laudable work prison officers do? Do the advocates of prisoners' rights consider these individuals?</P>
    <P>I am sorry to be personal to Senator Costello but I saw the Senator as a member of the Prisoners' Rights Movement on a television news programme which upset me very much. A group of prisoners were protesting on a roof top, damaging taxpayers property which would have to paid for out of taxpayers money. Forgive me for saying this, Senator, but you reminded me of Nelson Eddy when you were roaring at those people trying to communicate with them. I know you are very interested in prisoners rights but in terms of balance have you and your group Senator, gone overboard? That is a serious question which I ask. I do not like doing this but I am concerned about it since I saw that news programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been attacks on the cars of prison officers. There have been attacks on the homes of prison officers. We must get this whole debate in perspective and say: how does this come about? Is there any possibility that perhaps the outspoken statements, manoeuvrings and posturings could have brought about a situation where people would be incited, urged or exhorted to taking retribution on certain prison officers? It is, generally speaking, not my <Col N="2043" /> form to be as direct as I am here today, but I feel extremely strongly on this issue. I have met prison officers who are concerned about what has been said by prisoners rights organisations over the years. Damage has been caused to them personally and their wives and families have suffered also.</P>
      <P>All I can say and hope is that any statements made by any group would be tempered and that those statements would not alone consider the rights of prisoners but the rights of those people who are upholding the law, and not make life hell for the wives and families of those people who are acting in the best interests of this State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important issue. I do not agree with the fact that a certain small group of people take it upon themselves to be the protectors of the underprivileged, including prisoners. Every member of society is concerned about the problems different people have, and what would include prisoners. Senator Brendan Ryan was talking about the futility of having a prison service and the inevitable failure of a prison service. What alternative is there? We would all love to be able to bring in an offender and explain to him in nice language that this cannot be done and that he can go on his merry way, and that everything will be fine, but that is not what life is all about. If there is not a deterrent of some kind, then society as we know it will crumble. God knows, we have difficulties and problems enough with our jail system without throwing a blanket across the whole thing and saying that from now on there will be no deterrent, no penalties, no incarceration of any description, and that people can go their merry way and do what they like. Very quickly we would see society crumbling totally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would agree with what Senator B. Ryan said in relation to poor people. I deal with a fair section of poor people. I am not saying that they do not have their difficulties, but there are a number of <Col N="2044" /> people who have been born with a silver spoon and they too get into difficulties. It is not just because one is under-privileged that one will automatically face the problem of going to jail and of committing all these crimes. There are vast numbers of poor people in extreme difficulties who never resort to any type of offence or criminal activity. We are talking about a relatively small percentage of people here be they from the upper-class, the middle-class or the lower stratum of society. That has to be recognised.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan referred to the fact that drunken drivers may commit a crime and kill innocent people, and are let off scot free. That is not fact. There may be court cases which will go one way or the other, but I know of numerous people who were found guilty in that regard and have served jail sentences. I concur wholeheartedly with that. It is important that we set the record straight.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about suicides but the difficulties with suicide is that it seems to be a type of response to society in general. It is not peculiar to the prison services. It is something that we must all be concerned about at the moment. Because of the way society is progressing these tendencies are far more prevalent than they were heretofore. It is not necessarily because people are convicted of crimes of one sort or another that they automatically think of suicide. There is a substantial range of penalties and activities introduced by the courts. Sometimes the ultimate result is jail, but in a number of instances the Probation Act is applied for a range of numerous offences.</P>
    <P>Community service orders are widely used. Where vandals and thugs continue to terrify and harass old people, destroy property and set out in a calculated way to do as much damage as possible to society and to property in general, there must be a custodial sentence for them. How else are we to protect the innocent people? We all know there are innocent people living in absolute terror from one end of the day to the other because they are afraid these thugs and vandals will break into their houses. It is not necessarily a fact that they come looking for <Col N="2045" /> money. They take extreme pleasure in terrifying old people. The fact that old people have a few shillings to give them does not satisfy them. They will go out of their way to destroy any property these old people have. They will go out of their way to absolutely terrify them. There are numerous cases where rape has been committed on old people. That is a heinous crime.</P>
    <P>In relation to people who are convicted for the crime of rape, I am on record in this House on several occasions as stating that there is no custodial sentence I know of that is severe enough for people who are convicted of this heinous crime. Are we suggesting that we should devise a system where people who are known rapists should be released into society again? Are we saying that the finger should be waved at these people and they should be told they should not do that again? Are they to be released into society again? Some young people are raped continuously for seven or eight years, and the people who commit these crimes are supposed to be released into society again.</P>
    <P>I know my time is up, but I think it is important to put on record that we must have a proper custodial system. The job being done by the Government at the moment is first class. In the region of £70 million is being spent on the prison services this year. That is a huge amount of money. Everyone would like more but, unfortunately, we have to cut our cloth according to our measure.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on the work they are doing for the prison services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many different crimes and many of us feel very strongly about particular types of crime. To me the thought of prison is horrible but, like the previous speaker, who spoke about rape and child abuse, I feel that no sentence is long enough for somebody proven guilty of such a crime. I understand that there can be many complaints that would be justified from the inmates of a prison. There would be many complaints from the prison officers. It is the <Col N="2046" /> type of institution which lends itself to abuse of all kinds. I visited a prison on one occasion and it frightened me.</P>
      <P>I would like to speak about one particular case and bring it to the Minister's attention. In this case there are a number of points he might take into consideration. It concerns a girl called Julia Greene. She is currently detained in the segregation unit of Mountjoy female prison. She is serving a sentence of 18 months. She is held on a warrant of 12 months' imprisonment for failure to appear in the Children's Court on 5 November 1990. She is also serving a sentence of six months' consecutive imprisonment for the assault on Garda Noel Campbell at&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that I should not do that. The particular person I am concerned about was sentenced in 1990. The court certified that she was so depraved a character &mdash; nobody is so &ldquo;depraved&rdquo; a character &mdash; that she was not a fit person to be detained in a basic detention unit and that she was to be sent to Mountjoy prison. This certification was carried out under section 102 of the Children's Act, 1908. Her co-accused, Diana MacDonogh, was released on 26 April 1991 by order of the High Court due to the fact that the sentence she was serving was in excess of the legal maximum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular person I am speaking about was allowed to mix with the other adult prisoners for the first four months while she was in Mountjoy female prison. However, by order of the High Court the governor was directed that this young girl should be segregated from the adult prisoners and a segregation unit was set up. The Whitaker report and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace have condemned Mountjoy female prison and in particular juveniles being sent there. A secure probation hostel which would <Col N="2047" /> enable the courts to dispose of juveniles was recommended, but this has not been set up. The conditions in the segregation unit are most unsuitable to the needs of a 15 year old girl. She is held in solitary confinement in the segregation unit which is in Mountjoy female prison. All the professionals who have dealt with her say that she is in need of a great deal of attention, preferably in a residential therapeutic unit with trained child care workers. No such unit exists. Perhaps the Minister might take that into account. The concept of dealing with a 15 year old in such a closed unit is worrying. This girl is on a very high level of medication and will find great difficulty in adapting when she is released from prison, as you can appreciate.</P>
    <P>In Britain there is a prohibition on sending juveniles to an adult prison. So far we have failed to amend our 1908 Children's Act. Since her admission to Mountjoy this girl has suffered great trauma and emotional difficulties. She has cut herself on numerous occasions and has attempted to hang herself on at least one occasion. She was transferred to the Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, for a short period. Modern child care thinking regard it very unwise to put a 15 year old in such a closed unit. What should be recommended is a more open setting. Research shows that one of the difficulties with such a small unit is that the prisoners feel very cooped up and naturally pressurised. This girl of 15 is allowed regular visits from her family. However, she is the only prisoner in her unit. Unfortunately, she is also illiterate. She is very much in need of counselling and help because her father committed suicide. He died last February. I understand &mdash; and this is the tragic part &mdash; that she spends a lot of time crying when locked up and finds the conditions very upsetting. It is hard to understand, or to guess, how she might be when she is released from prison. She is where she should not be. I ask the Minister to look into it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the <Col N="2048" /> Senator for his accommodation. I would like to call Senator Costello. We are being flexible with your contribution, Senator, in the circumstances and I hope you will keep that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that you have been flexible and generous in relation to giving me some time. I have been asking the Leader of the House over the last number of months to ensure that there would be a debate on the prison system. I am certainly delighted to have the opportunity now of making my contribution. I want to welcome the Minister of State to the House. I suppose I have to express some disappointment that the Minister for Justice is not here to listen to the very valuable contributions that have been made. I have no doubt the contributions will be forwarded to the Minister by the Minister of State.</P>
      <P>In the first instance I must reject very strongly the personal slur and the accusations that were levelled against me by Senator O'Keeffe by suggesting very strongly that I was in some way responsible by my activities and my utterances in my position as a spokesman in relation to the prison system for attacks on prison officers. I must say that he got what I would regard as too much freedom to make those accusations. I regard them as scurrilous and unbefitting any Member of this House. The situation is at times misunderstood by a number of the speakers from the Government benches in that what we are discussing here is the prison system. We are not discussing the entirety of the issue in relation to crime or in relation to victims. I am not, have not ever, nor do I think anybody in the House is condoning any form of crime or any breach of the law. I am involved in the victims' rights organisation which is in action. It is active in the Dublin area. It is important that the people who are the victims of crime are also assured that their rights are respected. We do not always recognise the trauma involved for the victim in a criminal offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to some of the matters that were raised here about the facilities in the prisons, I would like to say particularly to <Col N="2049" /> Senator O'Keeffe that it has been as a result of a lot of hard campaigning on my part over the last two decades that we have 100 teachers in the prisons. There was none in the prisons when I started, except the odd nun or priest who came in and gave their time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Government had nothing to do with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It had to do with campaigning. The reason for it is that somebody stood up and said that the conditions in the prisons were intolerable and that a degree of rehabilitation should be put in position. One of the absolutely essential areas where rehabilitation was required was in the field of education. Anybody who would oppose the extension of rehabilitative facilities has his head in the sand in relation to the prison system.</P>
      <P>Could I also say, in relation to the statement made by Senator O'Keeffe about me speaking to prisoners on the roof of Mountjoy, that I was specifically requested by the prisoners to act in a negotiating capacity. I did that and contributed to the prisoners coming off the roof rather than, as Senator O'Keeffe seemed to suggest, being provocative. It would be much better if Senator O'Keeffe got his facts right rather than make allegations which are unfounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The simple fact of the situation is that here we are, a year after we had a very thorough debate on this matter in this House, and the overall situation, as I see it, is worse than it was at that time. The prison system is more overcrowded now than it was. There are more prisoners than there were 12 months ago. There have been more roof top demonstrations. There is regular slashing of wrists by prisoners in segregated units and in the basement. Of course, that whole area is intolerable: prisoners with serious medical complaints are segregated there from the rest of the prison population. Many of them are put down in the traditional punishment block in the basement of Mountjoy prison. As a result those who <Col N="2050" /> are in need of the best medical treatment are put further into despair and depression and inflict a lot of self-injury on themselves.</P>
    <P>The Wheatfield prison, which cost £40 million, has had its first riot. Unfortunately, it has not been in operation for more than two years, but the old regime is in operation there all the time. It is a new prison. I would expect an enlightened regime in operation, but there is not. There is no segregation in the prison. I have had more complaints from the new prison in Wheatfield than I have had in the last 12 months from any other prison in the State. That is certainly not a positive way for a new prison to start its days in operation.</P>
    <P>In our women's prison we had the first suicide last year. There has been a lot of self-inflicted injuries since then. We have the very damning report from the last annual report on prisons. I just do not know if anything has been done to remedy the description given on page 47 of the report:</P>
    <P>As we have reported previously, we are concerned at the lack of segregation of drug pushers and users, long and short term prisoners, young teenagers and experienced convicts and emotionally disturbed people all confined together. Despite the best efforts of management and staff the dangers inherent in this overcrowded situation cannot be eliminated. Theft, intimidation, drug and sexual blackmail incidents have occurred. Fewer detentions or more space is an urgent requirement.</P>
    <P>There has been no alleviation of that situation. That is a terrible indictment of that prison. We see now that there has been a further deterioration in the prison in relation to the girl who was referred to by a number of Senators, who is in the prison in solitary confinement because she was adjudged by the court to be unruly and depraved and is serving a sentence of 18 months. That is totally unsatisfactory. I am not going to go into the details. Most of them were described. That girl of 15 years of age spends 16½ <Col N="2051" /> hours every day on her own in her cell. Any reference to the fact that people were out from morning to night is not true in any prison in this country other than in the open prisons. There could be no defence of that. I would urge the Minister to look into that matter urgently. The problem of course is that we have not updated our legislation, the 1908 Children's Act. While the Minister has promised legislation to deal with juvenile justice there is no sign of that coming to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Last week in Trinity House there was another roof top disturbance. There have been deaths in prison and in Garda custody. In the last three years there have been 30 deaths in the prisons, which is an average of about four deaths per annum over the last three years. Eight of those deaths were in Mountjoy, which is an average of approximately three per annum. Mountjoy Prison is a particular black spot because of the conditions under which the prisoners are detained. Approximately 60 per cent of our prison population is confined in the Mountjoy complex. This needs to be addressed rapidly. The slopping out, which is one of the most degrading experiences still is the way the vast majority of prisoners have to go about their daily routine. They have to slop out in the morning, go down to the end of the corridor and dump out their chamber pot, rinse it under the tap and come back in again. They are locked up from 7.30 p.m. until 8 a.m., very often in doubled up and overcrowded conditions. I would ask what is the Minister doing about this problem? I would like to ask specifically in relation to some promises made by the Minister. The Minister in 1979 set up an advisory committee on prison deaths. Last year he stated that the committee was very near to completing its final report. Last week in the Dáil he stated again that the committee was very near to completing its final report. Could I ask him where is the final report?</P>
    <P>The Minister sacked the Mountjoy visiting committee because of their critical reports in 1988 and 1989. That is not <Col N="2052" /> exactly the best way to respond to criticism by the body that was established as a watchdog body for the public. The Minister promised this House on 8 March 1990 that allegations that had been made to me in relation to strip searching of women in prison would be investigated. He stated specifically that not only would they be investigated but also stated: &ldquo;I will release and make public the outcome of that inquiry and will take whatever steps are necessary&rdquo;. I have not heard a word since then other than a request from the principal officer in charge of the investigation to give what information I had, and I did so.</P>
    <P>There have been further promises by the Minister regarding further allegations by a number of ex-prisoners. Indeed, he promised that there would be a Garda inquiry. I would like to know what is the outcome of that inquiry. Can we expect that they will be internal inquiries and that we will get nothing out in public?</P>
    <P>There are further allegations in the Mountjoy visiting committee report and about prison staff in riot gear quelling a disturbance in the women's prison. I wonder if there was any response to those allegations.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the broad legislative framework in updating our antiquated 19th century prisons legislation and to take on board the principle of a justice model with the rights of those being incarcerated to the fore. That would be done through rehabilitation. I ask him to take on the administrative structure outlined in the Whitaker report, namely, that there would be a chief executive officer and a director of prisoners, and that justice would be only one feature of the administrative structure. All the other relevant elements &mdash; health, education, welfare and labour &mdash; would be part and parcel of the board that would run the prison system. That is the type of root and branch change we require. Obviously, the prison rules and regulations which are outdated and based purely on privilege would need to be updated urgently. As was said previously by a number of speakers, the punishment is the loss of liberty. Essentially, that is <Col N="2053" /> what the sanction of imprisonment is and should be. Any other punishment is additional and may not be warranted by the court. Rather than having a punitive model, we need a justice model. If people are treated like animals, the danger is that they will act like animals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the prison visiting committee, the 1925 legislation needs to be updated so that the personnel can be selected on an independent basis and that the punitive and disciplinary powers are taken away. There is no reason why a body which is a watch guard body for the public should also have disciplinary powers, even disciplinary powers to put people in iron. We do not need that. That should be done away with entirely. Of course, there must be a major move towards the alternatives which are recommended in the Whitaker report. We must get the Child Care Bill and the juvenile justice legislation on the books so that we can never again have a youngster of the age of 15 or less defined as unruly and depraved, which of course is a contradiction in terms and should never happen in any society. The women's prison and also St. Partick's Institution should be closed down, as the Whitaker report recommended.</P>
    <P>The only way we can go about dealing with the problem of prisoners who are addicted to drugs or alcohol or who have AIDS or are infected with Hepatitis B is by having a detention-treatment centre to which they would be sent directly from the courts rather than going into the mainline prison system. In other words, the emphasis would be on treatment for the problem rather than on security or punishment. That procedure, too, would eliminate the need for the present procedure whereby AIDS infected prisoners are detained in a separate area of the prison which, in the case of Mountjoy, is the basement. Because of the stigma attaching to such prisoners, it is impossible, under the present arrangements, for them to go back into their own community on release.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to raise the matters the Minister assured us he was investigating <Col N="2054" /> and in respect of which he promised to give the results in a short space of time. I would like him to give us the information to date on these matters. I thank the Minister for agreeing to the debate. He has been generous in that.</P>
    <P>I have criticisms of the way the prison system is run but I have no doubt the Minister will say he has been doing trojan work in regard to the Whitaker committe. My problem is that I have been around for the past 20 years arguing for prison reform and for prisoners' rights, issues which are of paramount importance if a prison system is to function properly. That system must have a philosophical base, the present prison system has no such base. The problem is that rather than improving the situation is getting worse. No matter what the Minister may say, that is the position as I am getting it from people who are in prison, from ex-prisoners and, indeed, from prison staff. The prison staff more than anybody else want the prison issue addressed because in a sense they are also prisoners, they are confined in the same conditions in which the prisoners are confined. For all of those reasons it behoves us all to take an interest in the conditions in our prisons and to see what we can do to improve them. Thank you for your generosity, a Leas-Chathaoirleigh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. N. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis áthais dom teacht anseo chun freagra a thabhairt ar an díospóireacht seo faoi sheirbhísí priosúin agus ba mhaith liom mo mhíle buíochas a ghabhaíl le gach Seanadóir a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht tábhachtach seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to assure the House that I am here representing the Government and the Minister for Justice. I want to assure Senator Costello in particular that the commitment of this Government to our prison services is greater than that of any previous Government and particularly Governments in which his party were involved. I have been given special responsibility for the prison services and we have ensured, by the investment we <Col N="2055" /> have made and by the decisions we have taken, particularly under the guidance of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Burke, and the support of the Department of Justice, that major progress has been made in the whole operation of the prison services and systems in this country over the past four years.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the ground covered in today's debate has been well traversed over the years. The matters which have been raised here this evening have been dealt with in Dáil Questions, in motions before this house and in various other public statements. Nevertheless, as the operation of our prison system is one which is of such vital concern to the entire community, it is only right that Senators should wish to further debate the issue. I welcome the opportunity of contributing to and responding to the debate.</P>
    <P>Those of us with responsibility for the prison service are always conscious of the contribution it makes towards the maintenance of law and order. It requires for its operation the dedicated input of a range of professional people, including doctors, psychologists, welfare officers, teachers, chaplains and representatives of various voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>All of their work is underpinned by prisons management and prison officers, who keep our institutions operational 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. I would like to take this opportunity and I know the House will join with me in acknowledging the work done by all of these people who, day by day and with great professionalism and dedication, carry out this task on behalf of our entire community.</P>
    <P>Prisons by their nature tend to attract considerable public attention. This is as it should be but it is an unfortunate reality that much of the attention focuses on the negative side of prisons. Publicity often gives an unbalanced picture and fails to acknowledge the many achievements of the prison system. Criticism often centres around prison policy, with the notion that this policy is flawed.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in the light of what I have to say, the House will readily <Col N="2056" /> acknowledge that there is nothing to substantiate this assertion.</P>
    <P>A prisons policy, if it is to earn the description of being effective, has to be characterised by a variety of features.</P>
    <P>I do propose to list these exhaustively, but would simply like to mention some, which I regard as the essential elements and argue that not only are they coherent, but that they are being effectively implemented.</P>
    <P>I think there can be no dispute that one of the central requirements of an effective prison system is that it should provide secure containment. While there may be much debate about the effectiveness or otherwise of imprisonment, all European governments agree that, if the public are to be protected imprisonment is the only sanction which is acceptable for certain kinds of offender and in respect of certain types of offences. Difficulties do, of course, arise from time to time in achieving secure containment, but I am satisfied that such difficulties as have arisen have been dealt with very well by prison governors and staff who deserve our deepest compliments for the good job they are doing.</P>
    <P>A central feature of an effective prisons policy is that there should be an emphasis on a caring and humane approach within the limitations necessarily imposed by imprisonment itself, and the need to maintain good order and security.</P>
    <P>This humane approach has been a cornerstone of Irish prison policy down through the years. Our prison system stands up well to international comparisons in relation to regimes, educational opportunities, medical care, diet, recreation and so on. The extent of our development in this area is the product of years of work by successive Ministers for Justice and staff at all levels at the Department of Justice, and I know the House will agree that this work must continue.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention, in particular, initiatives in this area which have been introduced in recent times.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to refer to the establishment of the Sentence Review Group <Col N="2057" /> under the chairmanship of Dr. Whitaker. Until the group were set up there was no systematic review of all long term offenders, although, of course, individual offenders were considered on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    <P>The group was charged with reviewing all offenders who had served seven years or more of a current sentence, excluding a sentence for capital murder. Throughout 1990 the group examined all eligible cases and made appropriate recommendations in relation to them. All these cases were duly considered by the Minister and so the first round of reviews can be said to be completed.</P>
    <P>The group remain in existance and, along with reviewing new cases as they arise, will reconsider old cases, where releases did not follow the initial review. I would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude to Dr. Whitaker and his team for the enthusiasm with which they have approached this very difficult task. Another initiative was the decision to establish the Advisory Group on Prison Deaths.</P>
    <P>The sad problem of deaths in custody is not only a source of anguish to the families and friends of the deceased, it is also traumatic for fellow prisoners and prison staff who have the unenviable task of coping with the consequences on the spot.</P>
    <P>There are many who, regardless of the facts, speak of the &ldquo;alarming&rdquo; increase in deaths while in custody. While there is little by way of solution to the problem to be gained by playing with statistics, it should be noted that there were four deaths in each of the years 1988 and 1989, and five in 1990. More significantly, however, in a four-month period in 1985-86 there were also four deaths. I make this point simply to illustrate that figures fluctuate and, while it is no consolation to anybody, least of all those who were bereaved, it is important to acknowledge the real facts.</P>
    <P>The causes of suicide are varied and very complex. Deaths in custody are a world wide phenomenon. As we all know, suicides do not happen only in prison; they happen outside prison as <Col N="2058" /> well. No fail-safe way has been found of identifying all potential suicide risks, inside or outside prison.</P>
    <P>So far as prisons are concerned it is likely that suicides arise from a variety of causes, and it is far too facile to suggest that there is only one cause, for example, pressure on accommodation, hoping that by addressing this one issue, we can come up with a solution.</P>
    <P>It is because of the complexities involved that an expert advisory group were set up to examine the problem and make recommendations. The Group comprise a wide range of disciplines, including medical, psychological, psychiatric and welfare, together with people who are involved with the day to day management of offenders. They have already made interim recommendations which have been accepted and are currently being implemented.</P>
    <P>Included in these recommendations is provision for 24 hour medical orderly cover in the closed institutions. The additional 43 medical orderlies necessary for this are being recruited. The other recommendations which are being implemented are the setting up of a suicide prevention group in each prison, a review of procedures for identification of potential suicide risks and improving the speed of response to suicide attempts. The final report of the advisory group is nearing completion, and when it is received it will be given urgent consideration.</P>
    <P>Another area of great concern in prisons and which is, of course, critical for offenders and staff alike, is the question of communicable diseases including HIV. This is a matter on which my Department have been approached by various interests and which has become the subject of intense discussion within the prison service and with the Department of Health, the Eastern Health Board and others.</P>
    <P>In the light of the considerable advances in scientific knowledge which have taken place in recent years in this whole area, it was decided to bring together people, who are appropriately qualified, to advise as to future policies <Col N="2059" /> in this area. The group were established in 1990 and are expected to report later this year. I intend to give priority attention to the advice which I receive from the group.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the House will be aware that last year Government approval was received for the construction of a special unit within the Mountjoy complex for those suffering from infectious diseases. It will be specially equipped to enable medical attention appropriate to the special needs of these offenders to be given. Work has started on the building, and it is expected to be completed within 18 months.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall aim of ensuring that the medical services provided to offenders are of the highest calibre the appointment of a full-time medical director, as recommended in the report of the Inquiry into the Penal System, known as the Whitaker report, was seen to be a high priority.</P>
    <P>Following initial failed attempts to attract a suitably qualified person for the post, approval was obtained for a considerable improvement in the employment terms and as a consequence, the medical director was appointed last October. This is a very significant appointment in the interests of bringing about improvements in the overall standard of health care throughout the prison system.</P>
    <P>I am, of course, fully aware that many would consider that a prisons policy which did not embrace plans for the implementation of the recommendations in the Whitaker report should be regarded as seriously flawed policy. Let me say that I share that view. For anybody with responsibility for the running of the prison service to ignore the findings of such a distinguished committee would be an act of folly. However, despite the assertions by many people, some indeed who do not from their pronouncements appear to have read the report very carefully, if at all, that the report has been shelved, I can assure the House that the reality is very much to the contrary.</P>
    <P>Some of the developments which it advocates such as the community service <Col N="2060" /> order scheme, the use of suspended sentences, fines, probation and so on, have long been a feature of our system. The setting up of the Sentence Review Group, the appointment of the medical director, the introduction of new duty rosters and so on is more recent evidence of the commitment to the implementation of the committee's findings.</P>
    <P>It is quite simply false, and indeed unjust to the Whitaker Committee, to suggest that their findings are being ignored.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, recommendations which are still under consideration such as the establishment of a prison board and the expansion of alternatives to custody to an extent which would reduce even more significantly the number of offenders in custody.</P>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of a prisons board, I am not sure that many of the advocates of this have carefully read what the report has to say. The report recommends that the day to day administration of prisons should be placed in the hands of a public official called the Director of the Prison Service, who would be chairman and chief executive of a board, consisting for the most part of members of his own staff. The type of management structure proposed is quite similar in fact to that which currently exists in my Department.</P>
    <P>A major question, which must be looked at when considering the subject is the question of whether the establishment of such a body is in the best interest of the public and of persons held in custody. There is a strong argument for saying that a member of the Government, should continue to have direct and immediate responsibility for those deprived of their liberty and direct answerability to the Dáil rather than that this responsibility should be placed in a non-elected public servant. Even if a satisfactory way could be found to delegate some responsibilities to a director, the reality of our situation is such that so many reservations would have to be entered in the public interest, in relation, for example, to subversives, sex offenders and other serious offenders, <Col N="2061" /> that such delegation could very well be meaningless.</P>
    <P>In mentioning this I do not wish to imply that the idea of a prison board does not have merit. What I am saying essentially is that certain issues require very careful consideration before final decisions are arrived at if we are to ensure that whatever is ultimately decided is in the best interests of the prison service and the public. At the present time, this question is still being reviewed and no firm decision either way has yet been made about it.</P>
    <P>There are many who continually advocate alternatives to custody, as if they did not exist already. I would like to point out that alternatives to custody not only exist, but are very widely and extensively used. Not many appreciate that at present there are some 3,500 offenders on alternatives of one type or another, including community service orders, compared with 2,200 in prison.</P>
    <P>Further options in the area of alternatives were recently explored and earlier this year, the introduction of a scheme of intensive supervision was announced. Thirty-one additional probation and welfare officers are at present being appointed for this scheme. They will be assigned the task of providing special supervision for about 200 additional offenders in the community, as an alternative to keeping them in prison.</P>
    <P>The scheme is aimed not only at reducing pressure on prison accommodation, but also at assisting those concerned in reintegrating successfully into the community. An innovation in the area of supervision will be the establishment of two drop-in centres for those under supervision. One of these will be located in Dublin and one in Cork. Counselling and other services will be available in the centres for those under supervision.</P>
    <P>With regard to the prospects of significantly reducing the existing population by the greater use of alternatives, however, it is only right to sound a note of caution. The growth in the prison population is already kept in check by the use of alternatives. It is simply a fact that alternatives to custody would not be <Col N="2062" /> appropriate for many of the offenders currently in custody. It is simply not true that our policy is to imprison all offenders regardless. On the contrary, every effort is made to provide many offenders with an opportunity to stay out of prison. Many of those currently in custody have either exhausted alternatives, or are guilty of such grave offences that alternatives are not appropriate.</P>
    <P>There have been many accusations that a revolving door system is now operating in our prison system. Under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, the Minister for Justice may authorise releases in particular cases.</P>
    <P>All of these releases have standard conditions, which include the obligation to keep the peace, be of good behaviour and be of sober habits. Other conditions are added, as appropriate, such as a requirement to report to the Garda Síochána, to be supervised by a welfare officer, or to reside at a prescribed hostel. Any person breaching any of these conditions is liable to rearrest and return to prison to serve the remainder of the sentence.</P>
    <P>The criteria by which cases are assessed for release are well known. They include the nature of the offence, the offender's previous criminal history, his or her attitude while in custody, the length of the sentence served and a Garda assessment of the risk, if any, which may be posed to the community by a particular release. It should be borne in mind that the overriding concern when assessing cases for release is the protection of the public.</P>
    <P>Parole systems are a feature of all civilised societies the world over. Our temporary release scheme is our system of parole and I am happy to tell the House the flexibility of our system and the substantial measure of control over the behaviour of offenders, which is possible under it is admired by international penological experts, throughout the world.</P>
    <P>While it cannot be denied that pressure on accommodation is a factor in some early releases, it should be understood it is only one factor in a decision to release an individual prisoner and all releases are judged in the light of the criteria, which <Col N="2063" /> I have already mentioned. I can assure the House that in administering relatively long sentences for serious offences, shortage of accommodation is not a consideration and it is important that that point gets across to those who engage in serious crime. For them, there will be no easy release.</P>
    <P>Apart from the normal prison regime, which includes training workshops and other facilities, we also run a number of workshop and welfare centres throughout the country for the more moderate offenders. We spent approximately £1.5 million annually on these services. We finance a total of up to 20 hostels and other voluntary groups. Training is specifically provided at Priorswood House in Coolock for discharged male prisoners run by PACE. Since 1977 we have supported the Candle Community Trust in Ballyfermot, which caters for boys up to 21 years of age. We also have excellent training workshops in Ballinasloe and Tuam and we support the Lions Villa Hostel in Chapelizod, Usher's Island Workshop, Dublin, the St. Vincent's Trust Hostel, the Youth Project in Dún Laoghaire, the Cork Probation Hostel, the Lady's Lane Hostel in Waterford and several other worthwhile projects.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the general question of prison accommodation. No Minister for Justice has ever denied that there are accommodation problems in Irish prisons and I will not deny it now. However, these difficulties are not of recent vintage and are constantly being addressed.</P>
    <P>In recent times a number of measures have been taken, which I know will help to alleviate the problems. Since 1989 a total of £23 million has been provided for maintenance and capital works for prisons, which represents a very clear commitment towards the ongoing upgrading of our prisons stock. Given the necessity to contain public expenditure in the interests of the economy in general, I would suggest that this allocation to prisons has been generous.</P>
    <P>First the place of detention at Wheatfield which provides 320 additional places <Col N="2064" /> for offenders was brought into full operation. As well as the capital-maintenance investment, a very heavy investment was also made in staffing resources. Major refurbishment and reconstruction work was commenced in St. Patrick's Institution in mid-1990, and the first phase will be completed by the end of next August. The other two phases will be completed next year. The work being undertaken involves major refurbishment and reconstruction, and will result in the provision of vastly improved cell accommodation and facilities for education, work training and recreation.</P>
    <P>In addition, the refurbishment provides for the installation of in-cell sanitation facilities and a cell-call communication facility in every cell. As part of this project, the existing women's prison is to be totally refurbished. There has never been any argument on my part that there was not an urgent need to improve these conditions. We fully accept that facilities for women prisoners must be improved as a matter of priority. With the completion of the first phase of the St. Patrick's project next August it is intended to move the women into the refurbished accommodation, as an interim measure. With regard generally to the question of providing a new prison for women, the position is that no option has been ruled out. However, it is considered that the total refurbishment of the existing facility is the only means whereby a significant improvement in conditions for women can be brought about in the short term.</P>
    <P>Work to improve the women's prison itself will commence this year. These arrangments may not be a full solution to the problem but they will be a considerable advance on what is there at present. They are intended to serve while the matter of providing a more satisfactory long term solution is being decided. The total number of women prisoners is quite small&mdash;45 female offenders in total, compared to over 2,000 male offenders. It is wrong to suggest that the majority of these women are minor offenders who can be dealt with otherwise than in prison. The fact is that <Col N="2065" /> the courts are very reluctant to send women to prison and it is generally only where the offence is very serious, or where offences are repeated over and over again without regard to the warnings by the courts, or where all sorts of alternative have failed, that women wind up in prison. Many women prisoners are committed also for drug-related offences. In these cases it is quite clear that the courts have little option but to impose custodial sentences.</P>
    <P>Plans are also well advanced for the replacement of one of the wings in Limerick prison by a completely new structure which will provide 30 additional spaces. Plans are also advanced for further developments in Portlaoise and Mountjoy. It has also been decided that in all new buildings and in refurbished accommodation, in-cell sanitation will be provided. It is expected that, within two years, 40 per cent of offenders will have 24 hour access to sanitary facilities.</P>
    <P>It is one of my primary concerns to ensure that everything possible is done to prevent illegal drugs getting into prisons. For this reason I have asked my Department to carry out a full examination of ways to prevent drug smuggling. I do, of course, acknowledge that in order to prevent completely the passage of contraband between visitors and offenders, during visits, it would be necessary to separate visitors from the offender completely. To introduce such a system would be unnecessarily harsh, particularly in cases where young children may be visiting. The problem is finding the correct balance to avoid unnecessarily harsh conditions for visits while at the same time ensuring an adequate measure of control. I hope that the examination referred to will help in deciding on this balance.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to the remission of sentences and compared our situation to the 50 per cent rate of remission in Northern Ireland, by his own admission an invidious comparison. Remission is only one aspect of the question of early release for offenders. The other one is parole which in our case is release under the Criminal Justice Act, 1960. The fact is that in our system any prisoner whose <Col N="2066" /> offence is not too serious and whose early release would not constitute a danger to the public is released well before his sentence expires. The increase of remission to be automatically applied irrespective of the nature of the crime, or the possible danger to the public, does not seem to me a sensible development. It is far better to retain the discretionary element which conditional release under the 1960 Act allows.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate a number of other questions were raised and I would like to refer to them briefly. A number of Senators made allegations that a young girl in Mountjoy is being held in solitary confinement in the women's prison. The implications in the allegation are refuted. Under the rules for the Government of Prisons, 1947, there is an obligation to segregate juveniles from adults. A successful action was brought recently in the High Court to enforce this obligation in the case of two young girls and, of course, my Department complied with the court order. Dormitory type accommodation with ancillary facilities were made available in the grounds of the women's prison and complete separation from adult offenders was achieved. One of the two girls has since been released and the result is that the other girl in this accommodation lacks the company of a like offender. Given this background it is a distortion of the reality to imply that the girl is being deliberately held in solitary confinement, a phrase which has specific connotations in prison language. I will, of course, keep the matter under review to find a way of avoiding any damaging consequences for the girl.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made the position quite clear. We are bound by the laws of this land. We are bound by the decisions of the courts of this land. We have adhered to those decisions. There were two people together in a particular unit of the prison system in Mountjoy prison. One of those has been released <Col N="2067" /> thereby leaving another person left in that position. We are obliged under the decisions of the courts to treat that girls in a particular way and that is being done in the most humane way possible. It is not our desire to hold that girl in a separate, single situation or environment. We are treating her as best we can, as humanely as possible and sooner rather than later we hope that she will be released.</P>

      <P>Comments were also made about the disturbance last week in Wheatfield. It is the first such disturbance since Wheatfield was opened and while injury to individuals and damage to property was not significant, it is regrettable that it should have happened. Any damage to an institution like this, which was provided at great public expense, has to be deplored. The trouble stemmed from a relatively minor assault by one prisoner on another. As often happens in a closed community such as this, retaliation by other prisoners followed. Staff succeeded in bringing matters under control but when the offending prisoners were left locked up, pending an investigation by the governor, some of them resorted to damaging cell items as a protest. As I have said, the damage was not serious, and more permanent fittings such as sanitary bowls and wash-hand basins were not damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything possible will be done to try to prevent a recurrence of this kind of incident. Prison staff and the majority of offenders there have too much respect for the excellent conditions to do other than avoid such incidents. Nevertheless it has to be said that any closed environment can give rise to situations and tensions which can easily develop into destructive incidents. Much can be done <Col N="2068" /> to avoid them and will be done, but there can be no guarantee that prison staff will always be successful.</P>
    <P>There was also some comment on overcrowding and questions about the action being taken to deal with it. It would be very easy for me to tell you that we were about to embark on a vast building programme to solve this problem forever. The management and operation of a prison system is not that simple. First, the point has to be made that there is adequate accommodation for all offenders convicted of the most serious crimes, that the public will be protected from such offenders and that nobody contemplating a serious crime should be in any doubt but that there will be a place for him or her. New prison buildings are very expensive &mdash; the cost of Wheatfield Prison was almost £40 million &mdash; and before committing further large sums of public money for new prisons we ought to be sure that they are indispenable.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the alternatives to imprisonment which have been developed, which are in the pipeline and which will continue to be sought. The reason for this is not only financial. I am sure we would all endorse the view of the Whitaker committee that for a variety of reasons imprisonment should be seen as a last resort and something to be avoided if at all possible. This idea of minimal use of imprisonment would find acceptance in most civilised communities. Subject to the overriding need to protect the public, there may very well be further scope for examining the question of the extent of our resort to imprisonment. I am having such an examination carried out. Should anything positive result from the examination there would, of course, be a benefit in terms of reducing overcrowding.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to strip searching. I understand that the inquiry carried out by a senior official in the Department of Justice has been completed and that his report is almost ready. I expect, therefore, to receive it fairly soon and I will give full consideration to its conclusions and recommendations and will make an announcement in due course. No decision has been made about <Col N="2069" /> publication, but I should imagine that publication would not be desirable if it contained names or other very personal details by which prisoners could be identified. There is a duty to preserve confidentiality in relation to persons committed to custody.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Cathaoirleach for his generosity in allowing so much time for this debate. I wish the House to agree that the approach being taken is the right one. Anyone who considers fairly the range of developments in the prison service which I have outlined must conclude that our balance between custodial and non-custodial treatment, together with the ongoing developments which are taking place, are clear evidence that we are operating a soundly based prison policy.</P>

      <P>This Bill is one of the most important pieces of legislation to come before this House in recent years. Reform and modernisation of the local government system has been one of the Government's highest priorities. It is also a task of considerable depth and complexity. One need only reflect briefly on the range of services, the extent of resources and the volume of employment involved in the local government sector, to appreciate that any changes in the system must be prudently formulated and implemented with the utmost care and thoroughness. One year ago both the Dáil and Seanad gave their assent to the postponement of local elections so that a full review of the local government system could be carried out. In so doing they indicated confidence in the Government's ability and determination to bring forward reform legislation in time for the holding of local elections in June 1991. I am glad to be able to honour that commitment to day and we pay the trust of the Seanad by bringing before it this Bill which constitutes the first, but very significant, element of the local government reform programme.</P>
      <P>I am sure that Senators are well aware of the need for reform of the local government system and are also well acquainted with the background to the programme which the Government announced in a statement issued on 7 March 1991. Nonetheless I feel it is incumbent on me to give the House as full an account as is possible in the time available to me today, not just of the actual contents of the Bill itself, but also of the background to the reform programme and the process by which we have arrived at this very significant point of departure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to sketch in the briefest possible terms, some of the key events <Col N="2072" /> in the evolution of our system of local government and the reasons why reform and reorganisation of that system is now necessary.</P>
    <P>On the foundation of the State we inherited a system of local government which was, in large measure, a producet of a series of 19th century statues culminating in the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1889 which consolidated the principal structural features of our local government system.</P>
    <P>Since independence, the local government system has been adapted and extended in a number of respects. Certain functions have declined in importance, others have increased, some functions were removed &mdash; health services for example &mdash; and many new ones added in environmental, planning and development and other areas. This evolution of functional responsibilities, adapting to meet the needs and demands of the day, has continued under a succession of statutes up to the present time. A management system was in operation in all authorities by the early forties, with various key functions and decisions reserved as the exclusive prerogative of the elected members, but there has been no significant change in organisational or structural arrangements since then.</P>
    <P>The question of overall reform and reorganisation has been a consistently recurring theme in the local government area for several decades past. It is a debate which has displayed some remarkably consistent features. For example, opinions as to the shape and direction which reform should take have tended to conflict sharply. Secondly, it seems that there has always been a sort of inverse relationship between the volume of discussion about reform and the extent of the action resulting from this. Thirdly, whenever it looked as if decisions and real action were about to be taken, this proved to be an illusion and a further period of stagnation ensued.</P>
    <P>It was at one such period that I came to office as Minister for the Environment. It quickly became clear to me that if progress was to be made, a new approach must be adopted. I became convinced <Col N="2073" /> that if the interests of local government were to be properly served, the reform question should not be treated as a political football. It was, and is, my view that, in order to achieve the desired results, proposals must be formulated on the basis of a thorough consideration of all views and they must have the support of a solid across-the-board consensus. This is precisely what the Government set out to achieve in their approach to local government reform. An Oireachtas all-party committee on the matter was initially proposed, as this seemed to offer the best prospect of securing the desired consensus. Regrettably, this proposal did not seem to meet with favour on all sides &mdash; the main Opposition party refused to participate.</P>
    <P>At that stage it would have been very easy to turn aside and allow local government to once again slide off the political agenda. The Government were determined, however, to press ahead with developing reform proposals through alternative mechanisms. A cabinet sub-committee was established in April 1990 and an advisory export committee appointed to assist them. By adopting this approach, the government ensured that the issue would receive due priority by being considered at the highest level while, at the same time, facilitating a wide input to the review process and bringing special expertise to bear on the issue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that this mechanism has worked extremely well. The advisory expert committee, who received a large number of submissions from interested individuals and organisations, completed their report just before Christmas and, as Senators will be aware, the report has been published. The Government had hoped that the committee could have completed their work some months earlier, but the complexity of the assignment, and the number of submissions received, made it necessary for the committee to seek an extension of the time limit set for them. I cannot let this opportunity pass without paying tribute to the chairman and members of the expert committee for the time and effort they <Col N="2074" /> devoted to their task. I am sure that all Members of the House will concur when I say that we are indebted to them for their work in the interests of local government.</P>
    <P>The Cabinet sub-committee, which I chaired, considered the report of the expert committee in January and February this year and made their own report to the Government. After due consideration, the Government decided on the reorganisation programme and a full statement of their proposals was made on 7 March last. The substantial Bill now before the House has been drafted, as a matter of high priority, in the relatively short period since then and has been brought before the Oirechtas at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I have set out in some detail, the sequence of events since April 1990 in order to show that there has been no avoidable delay on the Government's part in preparing and presenting this Bill. On the contrary, once it became clear last year that an all-party approach was not possible, we moved with top speed to meet the commitment to put legislation changes in place before the coming elections.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, appropriate that I should also explain, at this stage, why it is necessary that the Bill should be passed by both Houses no later than 17 May. The legal requirements concerning the timescale for the holding of the local elections are as follows. The elections must be held in June and, as already announced, the polling day will be on 27 June which is just about the latest practicable date. In turn, this means that the final date for publication of the notice of elections by returning officers is 24 May. This means that the ministerial order appointing the polling day will have to be made not later than 22 May. This, in turn, is linked to the final date for the signature of the Bill by the President and &mdash; even assuming early signature &mdash; the final date for the Bill to be passed by both Houses is 17 May. If the Bill is not passed by that date, elections cannot be held in June in County Dublin or postponed at the sub-county level. While this timescale is tight, <Col N="2075" /> the blame cannot be laid at the door of the Government: as I have already explained, there has been no avoidable delay on our part in dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>The decisions already taken by the Government make it clear that there is to be no more long fingering of local government reform and no seeking of pretexts on which to dodge decisions. The statement of 7 March spells out what is being done immediately and what must, for practical reasons, be dealt with on a progressive basis. On this point, however, it must be stressed that the programme will be a fully integrated one. There is no question, for example, of adopting only a minimal range of provisions now for the sake of short term expediency and postponing those which are of real importance to some vague future date. Although further legislation will be necessary to complete the programme and deal with all consequential matters, the Bill which is now before the House provides a broad framework for reform within which implementation can proceed in an ordered, progressive fashion.</P>
    <P>I will return very shortly to the contents of the Bill itself but first I would like, as I did in the course of my Second Stage speech to the Dáil last week, to recap briefly on some of the fundamental principles underlying the reform programme.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that one of the main reasons previous promises of reform failed to bear fruit was that, although there seemed to be general agreement on the need for reform, this was not, for the most part, based on a clear understanding of what is really involved. The reasons for reform and, indeed, the essential purposes of local government itself, may not have been rigorously thought through. As a result, the &ldquo;reform movement&rdquo;&mdash; and by that I mean both promises of, and demands for, local government reform &mdash;has enjoyed neither the degree of authority nor the depth of conviction necessary to carry a realistic programme through to finality. Regrettably, local <Col N="2076" /> government reform has often tended to be little more than an empty catch-cry.</P>
    <P>The reason we need reform is not that local authorities are doing a bad job. Not only do local authorities provide many of the essential services, such as water and sanitation, without which civilised, healthy living would be impossible, but they also provide a remarkable range of amenities and facilities such as swimming pools, libraries and parks, to mention but a few, which serve a valuable social and community role as well as helping to enhance greatly the quality of our lives. They have an indispensable role in the area of social housing. They provide much of the infrastructure essential to economic development while at the same time seeing to it that development proceeds in a rational and orderly manner and that the valuable resources of our environment are protected and enhanced.</P>
    <P>Problems may arise occasionally, or in certain areas, and these sometimes attract disproportionate attention. This should serve to point out how much we take local authority services for granted in the normal course. We seem to think of local authorities only when a problem arises or, perhaps, when we are asked to contribute towards their services.</P>
    <P>Prophets of doom have, in the past, claimed that the local authority system was on the verge of collapse and that the local authorities were in financial crisis. While that does not reflect the position today, some Members will inevitably attempt to find fault with the Government's reform programme on the grounds that it does not have enough to say about local authority finance. Such a criticism would, however, indicate a flawed perspective and a lack of appreciation of the correct sequence of events.</P>
    <P>The first requirement is to get the structures, systems, functions and operations of local authorities right &mdash; to attempt any financial adjustments in advance of this would, be a case of putting the cart before the horse. Getting these things right will go a long way towards ensuring continued financial well being. We have already come a long way on that road <Col N="2077" /> over the past four years. In line with the Government's own programme to restore the national finances, local authorities have achieved greater budgetary discipline. The need to contain expenditure within available resources is now the guiding principle. As a result, serious deficits which had been accumulated over a number of years have now been considerably reduced. This, has had to be the priority. The Government have also helped in this regard by implementing several sound practical reforms and rationalisation measures, such as the elimination of the circular loans and subsidies system and the reduction of extraneous financial burdens. A further example of this in the current year is the new arrangement for courthouse maintenance.</P>
    <P>The continuation of this practical and disciplined approach will continue to be the Government's priority in relation to local finances, with other adjustments being considered, where necessary, at the appropriate time.</P>
    <P>A scoping study was conducted by the London Institute of Fiscal Studies, at the request of the advisory expert committee, regarding central funding for local authorities. Their report, which was published along with the advisory committee's own report, concludes that our system of funding and our range of grants stand up quite well by international comparison. The report does, however, see scope for greater equalisation, primarily in the distribution of the rates support grant. I have, therefore, commissioned the necessary follow-up study to examine precise options for achieving greater equalisation among local authorities.</P>
    <P>The present Bill is not a financial provisions measure. It does not purport to be, was never intended to be, and it is not appropriate that it should be.</P>
    <P>A popular cliché in recent times claims that local authorities have become powerless. The facts, however, do not support this. The powers and functions of local authorities have been added to considerably in a series of statutes enacted in recent years. During my time as Minister, the Oireachtas has seen fit <Col N="2078" /> to enact several important pieces of legislation conferring significant powers and responsibilities on local authorities. There have been, or are currently, in preparation, Bills dealing with air pollution, water pollution, housing, roads, planning, urban renewal and derelict sites. Regulations made to give effect to various EC Directives have also added considerably to local functions.</P>
    <P>In recent years, local authorities have been given a new and more dynamic type of role in the pursuit of some important social and economic objectives. New departures such as the urban renewal scheme and the recently announced social housing plan are examples of this, involving increased discretion and scope for initiative on the part of local authorities. At the same time, I can point to the very significant increase in discretionary road grants &mdash; from £23 million in 1986 to £68 million in the current year &mdash; as an example of how local authority discretion has been enhanced even within a very traditional sphere of operations.</P>
    <P>A simplistic or superficial approach to local government reform will not suffice. It is necessary to be clear about the essential purpose of the local government system and the basic justification for the existence of the authorities which constitute it.</P>
    <P>Senators will appreciate my meaning when I say that there is an important distinction to be drawn between &ldquo;local government&rdquo; and &ldquo;local administration&rdquo;&ldquo;Local government&rdquo; involves much more than just the provision of services &mdash; important though that role is. What gives local government a unique character and sets local authorities apart from other executive type agencies, is their democratic representational role. Thus, it follows that a fundamental purpose and objective of local government reform must be to strengthen local democracy.</P>
    <P>The fact that local authorities are democratically elected does not of itself guarantee that they will be able to discharge their representational role as effectively as they should. Despite the considerable achievements for which <Col N="2079" /> local authorities can take credit, the public perception of them is frequently a negative one. This, I believe, is largely because they are often seen as bureaucratic institutions remote from the community.</P>
    <P>The structures, functions and operating methods of local government must be correctly attuned to the demographic, social and economic circumstances of today. Local authorities must interact with the communities they represent and that interaction must be a two way process. It must operate in such a way as to ensure that the authority is fully cognisant of the problems, needs, priorities and aspirations of its community and that such awareness is properly reflected in the way it discharges its powers and functions. Local authorities must be accountable to the people for how they perform on their behalf.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the local authority must have the capacity to promote the interests and development of its area, not just in a direct way through the exercise of its functional powers, but also as a catalyst of local energy and initiative and a facilitator and support of the efforts of individuals and groups within the community. Above all, local government must be made relevant and close to the people, and community participation with local authorities must be fostered. Local government, is, after all, the level of government which relates most closely to the day-to-day lives of people. If we allow flaws in the system to create a sense of alienation between communities and their representative authorities, a great disservice will be done to our whole democratic system.</P>
    <P>The other side of the local authority persona is a provider of services, an undertaker of works and a regulator of various local affairs. It is essential that local authorities achieve the optimum level of efficiency, cost effectiveness and value for money in the provision of works and services. They have made good progress in this regard over the past few years but what is achieved has to be done in an operating environment which, as <Col N="2080" /> the law stands, is not always conducive to efficient operation in modern-day conditions. It is a primary aim of the Government's reform programme to ensure that the structural, legal and operational framework within which local authorities operate is suited to today's circumstances and that it will facilitate and promote effective service.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the representational and functional roles of local authorities are complementary rather than conflicting. The system must operate in such a way that the democratic representational role is not subjugated to the role of the local authority as a provider of works and services. Operational and administrative efficiency must be pursued as a means towards providing the best possible quality of service to the people. On the other hand, local authorities must be prepared to operate in a mature, responsible and effective manner and be willing to make choices and, where necessary, take difficult decisions. The achievement of the correct balance between the operational and representational roles is an important consideration in the reform programme.</P>
    <P>If we are to have a meaningful system of local government the &ldquo;local&rdquo; element must be enhanced as far as possible. Local authorities must be locally focused and there must be an appropriate level of locally-based power and discretion. However, it is obvious also that local government functions have significant implications beyond the local authorities own sphere or operations. Thus, the question of maintaning a correct balance also arises in this context. The overall structural set-up, and the allocation of powers and functions, must both reflect an appropriate balance and co-ordination between local authorities and other public agencies and with central government.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that local government reform involves consideration of a fairly complex matrix of inter-related factors. Unfortunately, this is not a case where a computer can be programmed and fed with data so as to get a precise solution at the touch of a button. Nor is <Col N="2081" /> it possible to conduct controlled experiments to ascertain the likely results of particular changes. It is, instead, a matter of judgment and I am satisfied the Government have taken the correct steps to ensure that their judgment is well-informed and soundly based.</P>
    <P>The strategy for implementing reform is crucial to success. Reform and reorganisation of local government cannot be completed at the stroke of a pen or indeed the passage of an Act. It must be a process rather than a single action. In other countries where the local government system has been reformed and revitalised with great success, this process has taken several years to complete. The report of the expert committee also stressed this point. However, we are not content merely to issue a set of proposals and wait until every &ldquo;t&rdquo; can be crossed and every &ldquo;i&rdquo; dotted. That is the approach that has produced inertia in the past.</P>
    <P>The present Bill will get the reform process under way immediately and will also provide a legal framework within which a very large share of the detailed components of local government reform can be put in place progressively in an ordered and structured way. This will, for example, involve the making of various orders and regulations under the enabling powers in the Bill. This is the only realistice way in which a legal framework could be constructed which would allow a reform programme to be implemented as a continuing dynamic process.</P>
    <P>I have been criticised in some quarters for the manner in which the provisions of the Bill have been cast. It has been suggested, for example, that various matters for which orders and regulations are to be made should be spelled out in detail in the Bill. As well as being unnecessary, this would not be feasible. Many of the measures in question, for example, devolution of functions to local authorities, must be formulated as the reform programme progresses. We need the flexibility to add from time to time to the powers of local authorities or to add to the reserved functions of members. Removal of the relevant enabling provisions would reduce the Bill to a purely <Col N="2082" /> static, minimalist measure and would make a farce of the attempt to initiate a dynamic process of reform. I doubt very much if Members of Seanad Éireann want that to happen.</P>
    <P>Additional legislation will, of course, arise before the entire reform programme is complete. Certain matters will require further consideration, for example, the results of the proposed fiscal study, the consolidation and modernisation of the general code of local government law and the question of local government structures at the sub-county level. The strategy which the Government are following will allow decisions on these matters to be slotted into place without delaying implementation of the reform programme in general.</P>
    <P>I have devoted a good deal of time to discussing the general context and purpose of the Bill. I trust that Members of the Seanad will agree that it is important, especially at this Second Reading Stage, to be clear about the general principles underlying this Bill. I would like to move now on to discuss the main features of the Bill itself. I hope to outline as many aspects of the Bill as is feasible and I hope Senators will bear with me in this.</P>
    <P>Part I, contains provisions for citations, interpretation, regulations and the like.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill contains provisions relating to the functions of local authorities which are of fundamental importance to the entire reform programme.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides, for the first time, express statutory recognition for the representational functions of local authorities which, as I have already said, is one of the essential purposes of local government. The section contains provisions in relation to the role of the local authority in representing and promoting the interests of the local community including the representation of views to other public authorities, the promotion and facilitation of involvement in local affairs, and the carrying out of local research, surveys or studies. This will put the local authority to the forefront as the voice of the community and the upholder of its interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> A general competence is also being conferred on local authorities to take action in the interests of their local communities. This measure, which is contained in section 6 is designed to give local authorities discretion and flexibility of action in local matters where they are at present unduly constrained by the operation of the <i>ultra vires</i> principle which has often been perceived as a form of legal straitjacket. It will, therefore, constitute a very significant change in the legal position relating to local authority operations and will bring the position of Irish local government into line with that of local government systems in many European countries. The section instances various types of measures which a local authority will be empowered to take within the general competence power. Certain necessary safeguards are being provided to avoid, for example, activity by local authorities under the section that would prejudice or duplicate the functions of other public bodies. Matters to which local authorities must have regard in performing functions generally are provided for at section 7.</P>
    <P>Section 8 contains yet another set of provisions designed to copperfasten the legal basis of the local authorities' powers of action. It will remove doubts about local authorities' power to do things which are ancillary or incidental to their specific statutory functions.</P>
    <P>In pursuance of the commitment in the Government statement of 7 March to provide for the expansion of the role of the local government system, there is provision at section 9 to devolve new functions from the central level to local authorities. This provision will enable the Government to transfer by provisional order, to be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas, particular functions which it considers can be effectively discharged by local authorities. The advisory expert committee mentioned, in their report, various functions which might be considered for devolution, some in areas where local authorities have an involvement at present, others in areas to which <Col N="2084" /> the committee feel, and felt, the local authority role could be extended.</P>
    <P>As I explained in the Dáil, the provisions in the Bill will enable specific devolution proposals to be formulated and implemented in a way which is compatible with the reformed system of local government as it evolves, taking all relevant factors into account. The section provides a flexible mechanism which will allow for devolution of functions in specific areas on an ongoing basis. A full evaluation will be required, of course, before decisions can be taken as to whether particular functions are appropriate for devolution and factors such as cost, staffing and administrative implications will have to be taken into account. The section will also allow for the necessary adjustments of functions between classes of local authorities by way of order of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>Although it is included in Part VII rather than in Part II, I must also mention at this point section 52, which gives power to the Minister to dispense with certain controls affecting local authorities. This would, for example, enable regulations to be made for the removal or modification of unnecessary procedures or restrictions on local authorities and is, in itself, capable of being used as a powerful instrument of devolution. It is yet a further instance of where a regulation making power is being vested in the Minister to enable him to free local authorities from the shackles of outmoded controls and procedures.</P>
    <P>In carrying out their new and wider role in the local community, it is desirable that elected councils should have flexible methods of operation available to them. That is why Part IV, which comprises sections 36 to 40, contains provisions in relation to the establishment of local authority committees, either advisory or with delegated functions. There is provision also for joint committees to consider matters of concern to two or more authorities. These provisions will be of assistance where local authorities consider that the use of committees would be beneficial in the discharge of their functions, either from the point of view <Col N="2085" /> of operational effectiveness or for the purpose of advice and consultation. As I have already emphasised in the other House, it is not the intention that these provisions should pre-empt in any way the decisions which will have to be taken by the Government in relation to future sub-county structures and section 37 (1) (c) of the Bill makes this absolutely clear. Part VI is, in effect, a modernisation and consolidation in a flexible form of existing outdated legislation dating back to the 1840s.</P>
    <P>Next to the question of powers and functions, the aspect of local government most obviously in need or review is the structural set-up, which remains in essentially the same format as that created by the Local Government Act, 1898. It is essential to ensure that the structures themselves do not inhibit good local government and that we have a system which is conducive to both operational efficiency and effective local representation.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the Government have already indicated general agreement with the advisory committee's recommendation that the local government system be structured on three levels. They have confirmed that the county or county borough, as the case may be, will continue to be the primary unit of local government and that eight regional authorities will be established to promote regional level co-ordination. The necessary powers to establish the regional authorities and to provide for their functions and other operational aspects are contained in Part VII of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Pursuant to an order which will be made by me under section 43, there are to be eight regions as follows:</P>

    <P>I should emphasise that the regional dimension will derive from the local government system rather than being imposed on it. The regional authorities will be composed of elected members from county councils and county borough corporations within the region. They will not, however, be local authorities themselves. The role of the regional authorities will be to promote the co-ordination of public services in the regions and there is no provision in the Bill for any transfer of local authority functions to these bodies. The formal designation of regions will encourage a greater convergence in regional structures and operations of other public agencies. The need for co-ordination of this kind becomes apparent when one considers the range of services which are organised regionally, not only through bodies formally constituted on a regional basis but also in terms of various national bodies and services operating through regional or divisional structures.</P>
    <P>Members of the Seanad will, no doubt, have noted that the present Bill does not provide for any alteration in local government structures at the sub-county level. The expert advisory committee failed to produce agreed recommendations on this aspect. Two radically diverging alternatives were discussed in their report. One would have the effect of eliminating the directly elected sub-county tier entirely. The other would increase very substantially the number of such authorities and of elected members at this level.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, the Government must give further consideration to the most appropriate type of local government structures at sub-county level. Because of this, section 14 in Part III of the Bill provides that elections will not be held next June to authorities other than county and county borough councils. Residents of those authorities to which elections are not being held will, <Col N="2087" /> of course, be entitled to vote at county council elections in the normal way. Part III also contains consequential matters relating to appointment of members of harbour authorities and vocational education committees together with other electoral provisions including a technical provision to prohibit plural voting at local elections.</P>
    <P>Due to an oversight in the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, in relation to the county borough of Galway, the existing provision relating to revision of local electoral areas in the longer established county boroughts, which are scattered over a number of different Acts dating from 1929, are being consolidated and applied to all five county boroughs, thus rectifying the Galway situation. I would like to emphasise, however, that it is not the intention to use this provision prior to the local elections in June. Besides, section 12 confers no draconian or improper new powers on the Minister. However, arising from reservations which were expressed in the Dáil, I tabled a number of amendments on Committee Stage. The effect of these is to provide that in future any proposal for alterations of a local electoral area will first have to be referred for consideration by a boundary committee under part V of the Bill and that all orders providing for revision of local electoral areas will have to be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas. These amendments were accepted by the Dáil and put to rest any doubts as to the intention behind this provision.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Ministers of State will be excluded from concurrent membership of a local authority under section 13. This measure, which was announced in the Government statement of 7 March, is designed to emphasise the separate roles of the respective levels of representation in their own right and underlines again the increased independence from central Government which this Bill will allow to local authorities.</P>
    <P>While the Government's local government reform programme is a national one, the need for reform, especially from <Col N="2088" /> the point of view of structural change, is most acutely felt in the Dublin area. The scale and intensity of development, population growth and social change require the implementation of special measures for local government in Dublin. The Government are determined to ensure that this matter will be addressed urgently and effectively and that appropriate, more locally-focussed structures will be put in place, with authorities capable of responding effectively to the needs of their communities.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the Government's previous announcement that they have decided that the local government system in the Dublin area should be reorganised to take account of the large scale housing and other development which has occurred since the Dublin structures were last substantially revised 60 years ago. Dublin Corporation will remain and three new authorities will be established at the earliest possible moment to replace Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation. The June elections will take place on the basis of the three counties determined for electoral purposes in 1985, but with new titles, as follows: Fingal: the county are north of the Liffey; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown: the county area from Dún Laoghaire to Rathfarnham; South Dublin: the county area from Rathfarnham, west to the Liffey.</P>
    <P>Following the elections, the boundary advisory committee provided for in the Bill, which I will refer to further in a moment, will review the boundaries of these electoral counties including the boundary between south Dublin/Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which the expert committee felt might run along the main Bray Road.</P>
    <P>In the light of any changes in boundaries which may be decided upon and taking account of the preliminary results of the April 1991 census, any revision which may be necessary in the membership of the new Dublin councils can be considered at a later stage. This will not, of course, affect the June elections.</P>
    <P>The decision to set up three new county <Col N="2089" /> councils is aimed at ensuring more relevant and accessible local government with a sharper focus on the needs of the areas served. We need to take definite steps now, even in this first Bill, to get the process under way rather than repeat the half-hearted measures provided for in the 1985 Act. Accordingly, as a first practical step in the process of transition to the three new county councils, three statutory committees of the newly elected county councils, corresponding to the new county council areas, will be established under the Bill after the elections, one for each of the proposed county areas and composed of the members elected for those areas. Dublin County Council will be required to delegate functions and to operate as far as possible through these committees and each will have its own area manager to be appointed through the Local Appointments Commission. Pending this, three existing assistant managers will be assigned responsibility for the area committees, each exercising delegated functions appropriate to the area.</P>
    <P>Over a period the role of the committees will be progressively widened. The area managers, after necessary consultations with their area committees, are required by the Bill to submit a joint report on preparations for the establishment of new county councils for the three areas. In the light of that report the Minister will make regulations in preparation for the establishment of the new county councils, the dissolution of the present authorities and the transfer of staff, assets, liabilities, property, etc. to the new bodies.</P>
    <P>While further legislation will be required formally to abolish Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation and to establish the three new county councils, I would like to emphasise that, unlike the arrangements made in 1985, the provisions in Part IV of the Bill in relation to Dublin will not cease to have effect after the holding of the local elections. In fact, the provisions which I have alluded to will ensure that all of the necessary preparatory steps <Col N="2090" /> connected with the structural reorganisation in Dublin can be worked out and given effect to in anticipation of the further legislation.</P>
    <P>Many Senators will be well aware of the anomalies which are readily apparent in certain local authority boundaries. Moreover, the existing procedures for alteration of boundaries are cumbersome and the legal provisions fragmented. A revised set of provisions relating to boundaries is contained in Part V of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 28 provides for the establishment of independent boundary advisory committees to review local authority boundaries, including local electoral boundaries, or other local government matters referred to it. Provision relating to the referral of matters to a boundary committee and the submission of reports on boundaries by a committee are contained in sections 31, 32 and 33 respectively. New streamlined procedures for review and alteration of local authority boundaries are contained in sections 29, 30, 31 and 34. These include provisions relating to matters such as formulation of boundary proposals, consultation between local authorities concerned, powers of the Minister to alter boundaries and provision for dealing with the various transitional and consequential matters which arise from boundary alterations &mdash; for example, such matters as financial adjustments, transfer of staff, application of Acts or by-laws, etc. All reports of boundary committees will be independent in the performance of their functions.</P>
    <P>Under this Part a review of local authority boundaries can be initiated by a local authority or by the Minister but the Minister will be obliged to refer the matter to a boundary committee where there is disagreement between the local authorities concerned or where he considers, on his own initiative, that a boundary alteration should be made. By virtue of the amendments, made at Committee Stage in the Dáil and to which I have already made reference, a proposal to alter a local electoral area boundary will <Col N="2091" /> also have to be considered by a boundary committee. In the case of an order altering the boundary of a county or county borough, section 3 provides that the order will have to be approved in draft by both Houses of the Oireachtas before it can be made by the Minister as will an order for alteration of a local electoral area boundary.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to boundary alterations will constitute an important element of structural reform and reorganisation of the local government system. It is proposed, as I have already indicated, that a boundary advisory committee will review the boundaries of the new electoral counties in Dublin after the forthcoming elections. It is envisaged that a committee will also examine situations where existing boundaries of counties or cities are unsatisfactory and advise on any issues which may arise as a result of decisions on sub-county structures in due course.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the system of democratic local government requires that the status of local authorities as public institutions and of their elected members be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Part VII contains a number of important provisions towards this end.</P>
    <P>I am certain that all Members of the Seanad will agree that the role and status of the elected members of local authorities is fundamental to the democratic system of local government. The powers of the elected members are, in law, founded primarily on the concept of &ldquo;reserved functions&rdquo;. These are the functions which, under the City and County Management Acts, are reserved as the exclusive prerogative of the elected members, as distinct from the &ldquo;executive functions&rdquo; exercisable by the manager for the authority.</P>
    <P>This Bill directly specifies a considerable number of important powers and functions as being reserved to the elected members. For example, decisions in relation to representational functions under section 5; a decision under section 6 regarding activities of benefit to the local community; decisions under section <Col N="2092" /> 29 in relation to alteration of boundaries; establishment of committees under Part VI and delegation of functions to certain types of committees. That list is not exhaustive by any means. In addition, section 41 (2) will provide a new general power for the Minister to declare additional reserved functions by order. As I mentioned in the Dáil, it is my intention that a special review group, to include elected members, managers and representatives of my Department, will be set up after the elections to advise on this matter.</P>
    <P>In addition to their role in performing the specific functions reserved to them, the elected members of local authorities occupy a special position of authority and status in relation to the determination of local authority policy and general overview of their authority's operations. This is appropriate in view of the mandate which they receive from being directly elected. The reserved functions already tend to correspond with policy-making aspects and there are specific powers to impose various requirements on the manager. However, the fact that the policy-making role of the members is not spelt out clearly and succinctly in law has, I believe, caused the role and status of the elected members to be understated. Indeed, I suspect that very many elected members themselves are insufficiently aware of the full extent of the legal power and authority vested in them. In order to reaffirm and emphasise the paramount role of the elected members in the local government system, section 41 (1) provides explicit formal recognition of the policy-making role of the elected members.</P>
    <P>Part VII deals also with certain other matters pertaining to the conditions of local authority members and contains provisions designed to enhance the civic role of local authorities generally as representative public institutions. Section 48 empowers local authorities generally to confer civic honours. Section 49 will provide a statutory basis for local authority involvement in town-twinning arrangements. The major local authorities will be obliged under section 50 to produce <Col N="2093" /> annual reports which will be available to the public. Local authorities will be empowered under section 46 to organise special events for purposes such as receiving distinguished visitors and guests. All local authorities will be empowered to pay allowances to their chairmen under section 42 and section 51 sets out a new flexible, statutory framework for the payment of expenses to members of local authorities and for representation of local authorities at conferences.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, provides one of the single most important powers available to the elected members of a local authority. However, its use in relation to planning matters in certain instances and areas has on occasion given rise to some disquiet. The Government are concerned to ensure that this important channel of democratic input to the decision-making process is not brought into disrepute and that it will continue to be available to the elected members to use in a responsible manner and in appropriate cases. Accordingly, they have decided on certain changes in its operation.</P>
    <P>In future, for such a resolution to be valid in the case of decisions on individual planning matters, three-quarters of the total membership of the local authority must vote in favour and the notice of motion must be signed by three-quarters of the members from the electoral area or areas concerned. This is provided for in section 44. The corresponding provisions in relation to material contravention of a development plan are also being amended so that three-quarters of the total membership must vote in favour; this is contained in section 45.</P>
    <P>In line with the now established practice in the Civil Service in relation to the appointment of secretaries of Departments and the general trend towards encouraging mobility, there is provision in section 47 to prescribe a maximum term of office for future city and county managers.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for bearing with me patiently through what has, I <Col N="2094" /> must admit, been quite a lengthy contribution. However, I think I was justified in giving the matter quite detailed treatment because the Bill which is now before the Seanad is a very substantial measure indeed. In the outline which I have just given of its main features, I would not claim to have dealt with any more than the broad headings of the reform provisions. These powers will, in turn, as I have already indicated, accommodate a wider range of specific matters which can be dealt with in a flexible manner as implementation of the reform programme progresses. This is in keeping with the need to treat the programme as an evolving one, the elements of which must be built on progressively, and with specific measures being formulated with due regard to the programme as a whole and to its particular stage of implementation.</P>
    <P>As I said in the Dáil last week, the reform programme will open a new era for local government but it will also require new attitudes and approaches on the part of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The very fact that many of the reforms which have been called for over the years are now being provided will, in a sense, represent a challenge to local authorities and local authority members. Local authorities will be compelled to display an even greater sense of responsibility, maturity and self-reliance. The elected members of local authorities will be expected to play the central role which our democratic system always intended that they should. There will be an onus on them to utilise their enhanced position to the full in order to discharge effectively their duty of representing the interests of their communities and to be more fully accountable to the people for the performance of their councils.</P>
    <P>There will also be new challenges and opportunities for local communities. Among the chief objectives of the reform programme are the need to make the local government system more meaningful and closer to these communities, to make it more responsive to local needs and problems and to foster initiative in, and within communities. This also <Col N="2095" /> implies a greater degree of participation in local government affairs on the part of individuals and groups in the community.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a much more positive and concerned attitude to local government on the part of the community than is often assumed. There are rich resources of community spirit and initiative which the reformed local authorities can and must harness for the betterment of their areas. The members and officials alike of local authorities must be prepared to respond positively and energetically to this challenge. I know that I can also look forward to a positive and committed approach on the part of Senators during the debate on this Bill.</P>

It is despicable that there is no member of the press present in this House this afternoon. The Minister has operated totally within the rules. He has made a comprehensive statement on a Bill that has gone before the Dáil. Now we come in here and there is not one member of the press present. It is despicable, because this Bill has gone before the Dáil. It is now before the Seanad. There is no member of the press here. It is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>Just briefly on the previous speaker's contribution, I hope the people who at times criticise us for our absence and long holidays will be around at 11.30 p.m. or 12 midnight and give us <Col N="2096" /> some credit for the fact that the Seanad has been sitting three days a week, and sometimes for very long hours, for the last number of weeks.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. It is regrettable that this Bill, which despite being due to come forward for months, if not years, came forward with a certain indecent haste about ten days to two weeks ago. We are all aware &mdash; and particularly all the Members of this House &mdash; of the need for local government reform and of the fact that legislation is needed. Whether this Bill achieves many things is highly questionable. The fact that there is no mention of any aspect of financing of local authorities is like trying to run a horse race without putting up a jockey. That is the reality. That must be a disappointment to all of us who are concerned. Many of us have waited since the misguided manifesto of 1977 for local government reform in the area of rates and how local authorities are to function and carry out their duties. Since 1977 most local authorities have been trying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am sure Senator Lanigan, when he comes to discuss the few problems which I am sure he has in Kilkenny, will be able to state that he is not entirely happy with what has been achieved in recent years. We can support certain sections of the Bill but in others the Bill does not go far enough. One wonders, with the local elections being held in six weeks time, if it was absolutely necessary to introduce this Bill at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of inadequacies in local authorities throughout the country, various areas have certain defects and problems. I will deal with Dublin in detail later. The reality is that local authorities have to be more relevant. Members have to be given a greater say in how money <Col N="2097" /> is raised and spent. There is no point in our dealing with local government unless we are going to discuss financing as well. It will not be easy. There is no simple solution. We cannot expect year in, year out, to get a rate support grant. Unfortunately, in recent years, in Dublin anyway, the Minister has not been giving us enough money. He may have been fighting his own corner but the reality is that enough money has not been provided to carry out work that has to be done in certain areas. As a result our housing list is growing, our roads gradually collapsing, lights not being replaced, open spaces not being looked after and local residents having to get together to perhaps purchase a lawnmower. In this day and age, with double taxation, these matters have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>In relation to finance, the Minister referred to the fact that this party did not join the committee. This party had clear proposals in relation to local government reform. We were serious about it. We were talking about taxation as an integral part of the agenda because there is no point discussing one third of an agenda when the whole agenda should be discussed. That is why this party did not enter into discussion at that time or take part in that committee. The question is whether we are serious about local government reform.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of the Members of this House are members of local authorities and a few aspire to become members of local authorities. We all hope to be re-elected on 27 June as members of the authorities. I wish everybody here every success. As long as it is not my seat, all of you are welcome to a seat. We all agree with Ministers and Ministers of State not being members of local authorities but I vehemently reject the idea that Deputies or Senators should not be members of local authorities. We live in a real world and until the people who assert that TDs and Senators should not be members of local authorities say that members of local authorities should not be Members of the Dáil or Seanad we shall not listen and we should not even consider going down that road. The <Col N="2098" /> system has worked well, even though all of us here would consider that our commitments have increased with extra meetings and trying to combine various roles. Most county councillors do a lot of the work TDs carry out. Their role at times has been undermined; they have been sold short. The Minister is well acquainted with local authority members and I am sure he would be one of the first to admit that they work very hard and very diligently on behalf of their constituents. It is important that their role at all times is given support and that they are given reasonable remuneration. Many people criticise the role of county councillors and what they should and should not be doing, but if the people who are critical have a problem in their own area they are the first to go running to the same councillor asking him to use his influence or to get something done. None of us in this House needs to make any apologies to members of the public for any perks, which are few and far between. We have to go forward and ensure that local government is meaningful, and that it will mean something for the future. We have to ensure that councillors and members of local authorities are given a proper role in democratic functions. Once they have been given responsibility and power they should also be given the necessary back up. We would all support that. That is what has to be achieved in this Bill and in future legislation.</P>
    <P>We have to decide what we want from local government, where we want to see it going. The reality is that extra moneys will have to be provided. Members of the Seanad and the Dáil and members of local authorities will have to bite the bullet in the form of local taxation or raising local revenue. If we are serious about local government reform we will have to face these issues; if there is to be local taxation we will have to sort out general taxation.</P>
    <P>Senator Conroy and I are members of a local authority that imposed service charges for a number of years. People do not pay them willingly but they would prefer to pay them to have their refuse <Col N="2099" /> collected and to have certain ward schemes introduced. This has been quite successful in the Dún Laoghaire area. At least we could say that in X year we did something in that ward, and in Y year we did a few things in that ward. It has not been easy. Some councillors have taken a very soft line. They are the same councillors who month after month put down motions for various matters to be attended to.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a cop-out because it does not state how the necessary funds are to be raised. I will defend my record, as I am sure Senator Conroy will, next month in relation to service charges in the Dún Laoghaire area. Of course, we would prefer not to have them. We would prefer to have twice as much money from the Minister. While twice as much money from the Minister is unreal, maybe an extra few percentage points might possibly come next year. The reality is the Minister in recent times have been trying to run the local authorities on less money than has been given in previous years in real net terms. That has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>We are all aware &mdash; and this party is only too well aware &mdash; of the financial situation in the country. We do not go in for cheap gimmickry. One of the great cliches has been to send a deputation to the Minister when we come to the estimates meetings. Generally those meetings are declined by the Minister as he is otherwise engaged and cannot see the deputation &mdash; not that if the deputation had got to see the Minister it would have achieved anything anyway. I would ask the Minister, particularly in relation to the Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County Council area, if he would make a special case next year in this area, and perhaps he might see Senator Conroy, Senator Keogh and myself.</P>
    <P>The situation in Dublin is particularly bad. We have had the scenario that the monthly meetings of Dublin Corporation and of the 78-member Dublin County Council have been no more than a joke. At last Monday's monthly meeting I think there were about 26 section 4 motions down, some of them dealing with <Col N="2100" /> what would be termed section 4 items in relation to planning functions; but others, instead of being put down as ordinary motions of the council, were put down under section 4 whereby you can direct the manager to write to the Minister instead of putting it down by way of motion. This has been the scene for most meetings since 1985. We have had section 4 motions dealing with matters which by right should not come under section 4. Some of them are quite harmless and some of them are put down by councillors just to get publicity. The reality is that nothing else has ever been dealt with at those monthly meetings.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the council committee meetings have been quite constructive and I think there is a basis there for the development of the three areas which the Minister has indicated. The Minister says that the matter of boundaries will be looked at after the elections in June. A lot has to be done and a lot of thought has to go into this if we are to have these three new county councils, which is basically what they will be. I would like to ask the Minister what the timescale for the development of these three council areas will be. We are aware of the difficulties. Back in 1985 there was a dispute; it ended up that members of the council could not get their work attended to, but Members of this House or the other House who were not members of the council would receive letters. That was a farcical situation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to ensure that full consultation takes place in relation to dividing up those three areas. The easiest part of it possibly will be deciding on the boundaries and on the number of members, which may roughly correspond to the present Fingal, Belgard and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown committees as they are. But there will be a lot of difficulties, in relation to the transferring of staff. While Dún Laoghaire Corporation provides a basis for expansion, there will be problems as to where the other boundaries are to be drawn. What sort of time-scale does the Minister envisage for those county councils to be up and running? What consultations have taken place to <Col N="2101" /> date? Can he assure us that there will be full consultations with the unions and the staff so that we do not have the problems we had in the mid-eighties? It is important that we go into all of these matters and that the various problems are looked at. We should also look at the whole question of financial provision, fund raising and revenue raising.</P>
    <P>In the Dún Laoghaire area we have seen a chronic growth in our housing list. From last September to the latest figures, it went from about 155 to nearly 500. It is growing at a fierce rate. The response has been minimal. Only a dozen or 25 houses have been built in the last few years. We are all left to tell the many people who come to our weekly clinics and advice centres that it will be a long time before their housing requirements are met. We are going to have to tell them that they are to be kept in damp, over-priced flats or overcrowded conditions where they may be living with their in-laws, too many people to one room, unhygienic conditions etc. But the fact is there will be no houses available. I would like to know what remedies the Minister proposes in relation to buying extra land for housing and recreational facilities. The reality is that we have not in any way tackled the problem. With an extra ten or 12 people coming on our housing lists each month, the problem is gradually growing to epidemic proportions. It will shortly be out of control.</P>
    <P>One question on which I have received representations &mdash; and perhaps the Minister will answer this when replying &mdash; is in relation to how the Minister sees the whole question of archives. Perhaps the Minister might say whether he will give special funding to local authorities for the keeping of records. We have seen in recent times very successful celebrations in various authorities. Dublin had its millennium, Cork its 800th anniversary; Limerick at the moment is celebrating its 300th&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Dún Laoghaire is going to have its 1,500th. We have seen in recent times all of these areas promoting concepts of tradition and history. By and large, they have been very successful from the tourist point of view. It is important that all of this be maintained and improved. We are all aware of special places and special events in each of our local authority areas that can be highlighted.</P>
      <P>I note what the Minister has said in relation to the whole question of twinning but I am concerned about the section covering the Minister making orders. What is the Minister's intention? I hope the Minister is not going to start directing local authorities as to whether they should or should not be twinning with certain towns and villages in other countries. Most areas have built up relationships. Dún Laoghaire has built up quite a good relationship with Brest in France. I hope the Minister will not suddenly start interfering with the internal working of local authorities in that respect. Will he indicate at a later stage what directions he will issue? I hope that at most he might issue guidelines or ideas from his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of section 4 has been much mentioned and some of the criticisms have been slightly unfair to some members of local authorities. All of us would welcome the proposals in the Bill in relation to how section 4 is going to operate in the future. It is important that members of local authorities still have certain functions and that it is not a case that members talk at meetings and the manager makes all the decisions. The three-quarters rule is important because we have seen at times abuses of section 4s, where members in the north or south part of Dublin propose something concerning an area maybe ten or 20 miles away and the other councillors for that area conveniently drop out of things, though giving it a nod and a wink. We had a certain matter near Cornelscourt and the councillors in the ward area, some of whom are members of the party opposite, conveniently voted against it but in the sure knowledge that people are <Col N="2103" /> being whipped in from every other area to vote for it.</P>

      <P>No. That whole question of section 4s and their abuse is to be regretted. The idea of putting down a section 4 to ask the manager to write a letter to a Minister or Department was a total abuse and the new provision will probably be a big help in Dublin County Council. Whether it is three-quarters or two-thirds it is much of a muchness. Councillors in a ward will have to decide on a particular matter and then get three-quarters of the whole council there and voting. What will be the situation in a three seater ward? Will you need the whole three members supporting the matter? In the Dublin situation we have three, four and five seater wards. On the basis of three-quarters, will a three seater area mean that all of the members in a three seater will have to be supporting it if it is to have any chance of success?</P>

      <P>We certainly welcome the whole idea of a review of the operation of section 4. Some people have made the case that perhaps they should have been abolished altogether. I do not necessarily subscribe to that, but there was a need for a tightening up. It will mean that councillors will have to attend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the position regarding the membership of committees? Will it be a case that the group system which operated under the 1985 legislation will continue to operate or will it be a case that the majority can grab every seat on it for themselves? I do not know whether there was any change in this during the Bills passage through the other House, but perhaps the Minister would tell us whether the group system, which operated reasonably successfully and at least ensured a certain minimum representation, will be adhered to under the <Col N="2104" /> new Bill? It is important that membership of committees is based across party lines.</P>
    <P>What our spokesman said in relation to boundary changes is to be welcomed. It would be wrong if a Minister willy nilly could draw his maps himself and just put them through by some sort of regulation without discussion. It is important that all matters under this legislation be brought forward, displayed before this House and adequately discussed.</P>
    <P>There are many Members on this side who will be contributing both in relation to the general Bill and also in relation to problems in their own individual area. It is regrettable that there has been such indecent haste in trying to get this legislation through the House. The Leader opposite, who is generally very amenable, has been forced to put this Bill through a couple of hours after its passage through the Dáil. We will be putting forward on Committee Stage several amendments which we hope will be accepted or if they are not going to be accepted, that we will have explanations given which will allay some of the fears of the Members. The whole handling of this legislation in the last couple of weeks has been totally unsatisfactory. We have not even got a copy of the Bill as passed by the Dáil, yet here we are discussing it.</P>
    <P>I have tried to be reasonably constructive, even if in certain cases critical, because local government reform is very important to me. It is very important to the Members on this side and to the majority of the Members of this House.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing this substantial legislation before the House. It will stand as a tribute to the work of the Minister and to all those who have been involved in the review of local government over the past year or more.</P>
      <P>Local government has been the subject of discussion, reports and documents for almost 40 years. There has been concern about local government since the early sixties. Two reports were produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute covering the problems which existed even then in local government and dealt mainly with funding and the relationship between funding and structures of local government. Following the presentation of these two reports to the Department of Finance, the Department did what Departments of Finance all over the world do, they appointed an inter-departmental committee. Throughout the sixties this very fine body of people dealt with the whole issue of local government finance and taxation. No fewer than five separate reports were produced by that committee, some of them excellent. An early report dealt with the whole issue of rates and the rating system. There was a report dealing with the valuation system and another dealing with the importance and impact on exemptions and remissions on rates and also with the alternative systems of local finance and taxation. There was even a report on the agricultural grant and a final report was produced on the grants system and the way money was delivered from central Government to local government. There of these inter-departmental reports were so good that the Department of Finance took the unusual step of publishing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that early last year the Government proposed that an all-party committee should be <Col N="2106" /> set up to consider the question of local government reform but the principal Opposition party refused to take part. I believe this was a pity because they had a very valuable contribution to make. Their excuse was that the terms of reference did not include the funding of local authorities. They should have realised the importance of deciding in the first place on the broad structures which are desirable and have sought to make significant progress in that area. The Government were determined before embarking on this legislation to use the democratic process to the limit. In the absence of the proposed all-party committee, the Taoiseach took the initiative of establishing a special committee of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party whose terms of reference provided that they should have an important input into the Government's deliberations on local government reorganisation and reform. I had the honour to be a member of this committee and we were grateful to have the skilful assistance of Dr. Martin Mansergh who acted as our secretary. The committee consisted of 14 Deputies and Senators all of whom had considerable experience of local government. We met on 18 occasions during the period May to December last year. Before presenting our recommendations we carefully studied many reports issued during the past 20 years. We also invited submissions from our own councils throughout the country, and the response was most heartening and valuable. The committee made a working visit to England to study their system and their experience of reforms implemented over the years. Our final report was submitted to the Taoiseach and the Minister for the Environment on 5 December last and to our parliamentary party a week later.</P>
    <P>The experience of this and other committees in the recent past shows that the Government believe in involving as many members as possible in the formulation of legislation. A significant number of our proposals has been incorporated in the Bill. We wanted to cut out the unnecessary bureaucracy which involves referring virtually every significant <Col N="2107" /> decision to Dublin for approval. The Bill enables the Minister to devolve a whole range of functions and powers to local authorities by provisional order to be confirmed by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have made a great deal of noise about the Minister giving himself wide-ranging powers. In fact, he is making sure that reforms take place on a progressive basis, as it is seen to be desirable. To expect details of every item to be listed at this stage is less than realistic. Fianna Fáil Members will be as vigilant as others in ensuring that these powers are devolved without unreasonable delay. I am confident that the Minister will not require to be pushed in this respect. We hope to see the re-establishment of the committee dealing with such areas as local health, agriculture and education. Part VI of the Bill contains provisions for the establishment of such committees either in an advisory capacity or with designated functions. This is a most welcome development which has been called for by many public representatives of all political divides.</P>
    <P>We recommend that managers and other staff be more accountable to the councils and that the system adopted for Department Secretaries should apply to managers. Section 47 prescribes a maximum term of office for city and county managers. The day is gone when people sign on and expect to be employed for 40 years. We are all accountable. Public representatives will be accountable on 27 June of this year when we go before the people. In some parts of the country there has been much criticism of the attitude of management to public representatives. We certainly do not have that problem in Kerry where we have an excellent relationship with our manager and his staff.</P>
    <P>In our report we also recognise that urban councils have a major role to play within the reform of local government. I have only to look at the work over the years in my own area where Tralee Urban District Council have pioneered many huge housing developments as well as playing a major role in providing land <Col N="2108" /> banks for industrial and many other fine developments.</P>
    <P>I believe this legislation will have a significant effect on local government for many years ahead. It will do so because it has been drawn up with an eye to the future and, as the Minister has said, is not just a static, <i>ad-hoc</i> set-up designed to give the appearance that something is being done but makes no genuine provision for future development &mdash; the sort of measure that was introduced by Fine Gael and Labour in 1985. The so-called Local Government (Reorganisation) Act had little relevance beyond the local elections of June 1985. As soon as these elections were over all the promises that had been made about local government reform were dumped. This is not the Minister's approach. The Bill that has been presented to this House contains the basis for real local government reform and allows for action to continue until such time as the reform programme is implemented in full.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains the sort of measures which local authorities have been calling for over the years, calls that up to now have fallen on deaf ears. It contains measures which will transform the position of local authorities in many important ways. One of these is the general competence provision in section 6 of the Bill. Members of this House who have not had the opportunity of serving on a local authority might not fully appreciate the significance of this provision. Local authority members come up against many types of obstacles in the course of their duties. For example, we hear a lot about the frustration caused by shortage of money but as a member of Kerry County Council I can honestly say that the greatest frustration for local authorities has been to be in a position where something needs to be done, and the local authority is willing and able to do it but is prevented from proceeding by some antiquated principle of law. Could anything be more nonsensical?</P>
    <P>The present Bill changes all that and, as such, it is an historic development for local government in Ireland. The elected members of local authorities will be able <Col N="2109" /> to decide what action should be taken, based on their intimate knowledge of their areas and the needs and problems of the people in their communities. In short, they will be much better able to do the job they have been elected to do, that is, to fully represent the people.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I am not simply talking here about councillors making representations on behalf of their constituents. The reforms which are now being introduced will give local authorities a new and productive role. Under the new powers of action available to them they should be able to take on the role of development corporations for their areas. The Bill outlines a series of measures which can be undertaken by a local authority in the interests of the local community.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that I do not see this Bill as a pretext for the spending of money by local authorities on all sorts of half-baked schemes or ideas. This should not be allowed to happen. Local authorities must work within their resources. The main role of local authorities in regard to development should be to identify strategic objectives and ways of developing and improving their areas and assisting schemes to become self-sustaining. This should be a two-way process. It should not just be a question of the local authority undertaking the work or providing money. A major priority of local authorities should be to encourage initiative on the part of local groups and individuals and harness the talent available locally for the good of the community.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one area of local government reform that is of special importance, that is, the power being given to the Minister to devolve additional functions to local authorities. I agree with the Minister that these powers must be devolved in a logical and orderly way. The provisions of the Bill are designed to ensure this. I want to refer to one particular aspect of devolution: the need to widen the role of local authorities beyond their traditional areas of operation such as roads, housing, planning, etc. If I am not mistaken this point was made by the committee of experts <Col N="2110" /> who carried out the review of local government. They suggested a possible role for local authorities and linkages between local authorities and other agencies in the area of tourism.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in tourism because of its importance for my county. This sector is also of major importance to the economy of our nation, bearing in mind that it has been one of the principal growth sectors worldwide in recent years. Local authority involvement in this area is not only possible but essential. Many of the functions carried out by local authorities impact on tourism &mdash; for example, roads, signposting, prevention of litter, provision of amenities and development control, to name but a few. The role of local authorities in relation to tourism should not be confined to their activities within the local authority programmes. If local authorities are to discharge fully the overall representational role envisaged for them in the reform programme they should become more directly involved in tourism promotion. This is especially true in the case of County Kerry. Over the past two years Kerry County Council have allocated a certain amount for tourism in their estimates.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill provide great scope for increased local authority involvement in tourism. This can be achieved not only through the formal devolution of powers but also through the new general competence provision and the new provision for co-ordination and interaction between local authorities and other bodies, either through the new regional structures or the committee and joint committee procedures provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to some sections of the Bill. As a local authority member, I welcome the provision in section 44. The explanatory memorandum states that section 4 of the 1955 Act shall be amended so as to require that:</P>
    <P>...in the case of a resolution under that section relating to a planning application, the required notice in relation to the resolution must be signed by not less than three-quarters <Col N="2111" /> of the total number of the members elected for the electoral area or areas concerned and that it shall be necessary for the passing of such a resolution, that not less than three-quarters of the total number of members of the authority vote in favour.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in this section. Many vested interests wanted the new proposals in regard to section 4 motions dropped. I would certainly be against such a move.</P>
    <P>Under section 46, local authorities will be empowered to organise special events, such as receiving distinguished persons. For a number of years Tralee Urban Council and Kerry County Council were not in a position to make any funding available for a major festival in that county. Under section 42 all local authorities will be empowered to pay expenses to their chairman. Section 51 sets out a new flexible statutory framework for the payment of expenses to members of local authorities for representation at conferences. I believe these provisions will be welcomed by local authority members throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have many other significant and positive implications for local authorities. I realise that its enactment is a matter of priority and urgency and I will not take up any more time of the House. However, before concluding, I should like to take up the challenge issued by the Minister in his speech to local authorities to respond in a positive and energetic way to the Bill. As a member of a local authority, I can assure him that challenge and to avail of the opportunities which will go with it. I think I can say the same for my fellow councillors. I hope local authority members throughout the country will adopt a similar positive attitude to the Bill. I should again like to congratulate the Minister on a job well done and to thank him for the very full and enlightening account of the Bill and the reform programme which he has given to the House.</P>

      <P>From listening to the Minister's speech and reading what he said in the Dáil, I do not believe he is living in the same world as I in regard to the long awaited reform of local government. Obviously, I am delighted that Senators will have the opportunity to debate this Bill because, more than any other group of public representatives, Senators are best able to reflect the views of county councillors. I can assure the Minister that the views transmitted to us reflect a tremendous amount of disillusionment, disappointment and regret at the provisions of this Bill. The Minister's speech, the Bill and the explanatory memorandum are merely paper exercises, clichés, a word much used by the Minister in his speech. He did not give any commitment to set up a system of dynamic, powerful and autonomous local councils. Mr. T.J. Barrington, the chairman of the expert committee, spoke about a democratic, participatory, relevant and efficient system of local government. I do not see any reference to such a system in the Bill or the Minister's speech.</P>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware of the expectations of the electorate in regard to the long awaited reform of local government. As a councillor all I have been able to give to the electorate over the past six years is a series of negative answers regarding roads, public lighting, etc. We have a backlog of two years in regard to public lighting applications. It is extraordinary that the allocation in regard to public lighting each year is two lights, in an area with a population of 19,499 people. It is absurd that this can happen in 1991. I believe local authorities in the other 11 EC member states would laugh at an allocation of two lights.</P>

I do not think this council would be able to survive in the real business world if it were to throw away £3 million every year. I accept that the potholes have to be filled in but in bad weather the heavy rain and frost will wash away the work carried out with that £3 million.</P>

      <P>It is because I will be talking about funding in a moment. All I am saying is that the electorate have long awaited this local government reform Bill and they will be as disillusioned as we are because the question of funding has not been touched. I hope that disillusionment will not be reflected in a low turn out on 27 June. I fear it will, because during sporadic canvassing, I am all the time asked if we are really needed because we have been saying for the last six years that we have no money and no power. It is suggested that we should just scrap the whole idea of local government anyway because we have no power; that all we have been saying is that we cannot take over estates, that we cannot do anything about this or that cul-de-sac; that only. 1 of a kilometer of road will be surfaced and people should thank their lucky stars for that. As far as people are concerned, the jobs are not done and they want them done. They have waited for this local government reform which has been promised, and they really expected that their lot would be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill should have addressed the idea of creating awareness of the importance of local authorities to the community and the importance of communities being involved in local authorities. I do not see that in that Bill and I think a golden opportunity has been lost. The major aim of any reform of local government should be to combine community with local government in a system which is comprehensible and accessible to the community and which would encourage responsiveness and <Col N="2114" /> accountability on the part of elected representatives and officials. To be accessible a system of government must be widely understood. In my early days in Limerick County Council the first question I asked was why do we not have a public relations officer. A public relations officer is a most important person who can liaise with the local authority and the general public who are really quite removed from what should be the first tier of government in which they could participate. However, what happens is that doors close, shutters are put up and there is no comment if there is any controversial issue in relation to local authorities. People cannot have access. Newspapers ring up about halting sites or water rates or whatever, and there is nobody to answer the queries. Nobody will take the responsibility of explaining decisions. The Minister might tell me that local representatives can do it and, of course, the can; but there are many things going on in local authorities that we are not aware of. When I raise a question I am told there is no money, and that is it. I feel it is important that there would be recognition of the need for a public relations officer in local authorities to try to create a link between the general public and the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would also have looked for &mdash; and I suppose it is up to ourselves to push this &mdash; programme of political studies at second level in the context of environmental studies to familiarise students with the complex structures and functions of local authorities because it is the first tier of democracy with which they will come in contact. It is very important that they would have an opportunity to study these structures and functions at an early stage so that when they get married and want to have access to housing or are paying water rates or refuse collections, they understand what a local authority is all about and that it does not have all this money to be doled out. If they understood that, there would be far better liaison between themselves and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that local democracy is not quite understood. Citizens exercise <Col N="2115" /> choice in local democracy by voting for people to represent them. We are lucky we have democracy and that they have the opportunity to vote, but their exercise of control then is confined to not reelecting their local representatives at the next opportunity. Any influence in the intervening period is exerted through petitioning or lobbying of particular representatives mainly on specific issues that are important to the individual. That is very important because, broadly speaking, it is a controversial issue that catches the imagination of the people and in many cases the only time the general public come to their public representatives is when they have problems. However, there should be a far greater participatory role for the community in relation to their local authorities.</P>
    <P>What I looked for in this Bill was a participatory form of democracy where control, choice and influence are exercised continuously and not just at election time by active involvement of the community in decision making in planning and development processes. I do not think that would take from the role of public representatives. It would complement the role of public representatives because we spend our time liaising with residents associations, community groups and whatever, but they are removed. They are using us as the vehicle and channel of communication and that is right because we are public representatives, but they should be more involved in a participatory role. Adherence in this country to a representative view of democracy has the effect of distancing people from the functions and structures of local government. As I said, their influence is just through the ballot box and, generally speaking, local authorities are viewed as just another arm of central Government. There is little in this Bill which would involve community groups.</P>
    <P>The whole notion of funding is central to any reform. At this stage everybody is very much aware why the Fine Gael Party did not get involved in this Local Government Bill. It is because they are realistic <Col N="2116" /> and they realise that power is money; and if there is no reference to funding &mdash; and there is a slight reference which I will quote in a moment &mdash; we are really going nowhere. I cannot understand how the Minister can say that if we get the structures the systems, the functions and operations of local authorities right, to attempt any financial adjustments in advance would be a case of putting the cart before the horse. He said that if we get these things right it will go a long way to ensuring continued financial well being. I do not understand what the Minister means, I cannot fathom it. For instance, if I were deciding to build a house I certainly would not be talking about structures, functions and operations. I would be asking if I had the money to do it, and then I would set about the structure and getting the various elements into place before I would start building. Surely financing, knowing where one's money is, knowing how one is going to raise it, knowing that money is power, is the correct way to go about any reform.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point where the Minister refers to budgetary discipline. During my six years as a member of Limerick County Council, the more we pruned the less we got so that really we were doing ourselves a disservice. We might have been doing central Government a service by pruning but we were comparing ourselves to other county councils; we got our house in order, there was nothing wrong one way or another, we were not squandering money, but the more we showed we could operate within a tight budget the less we got. All we got at the end of the day was the comment that if we operated so well in 1980 we do not really need the same amount of money next year. That was the reality. We were really being the goody goodies; we should have gone ahead and spent and forgotten about this financial rectitude because we got nothing in return for our well disciplined approach.</P>
    <P>Looking at resources, and access to and control over resources, the following figures will illustrate the dramatic <Col N="2117" /> increase in the dependency of local authorities on central Government for finance. All I have available to me here are the figures for the years 1976, 1979 and 1983 and if I were to get the 1990 and 1991 figures I am sure we would see still further discrepancies. In 1976, the local rates percentage of sources of funding was 41 per cent, Government grants 38 per cent and miscellaneous sources 21 per cent; in 1979 local rates were 20 per cent, Government grants 60 per cent and miscellaneous sources 20 per cent; in 1983 local rates were 12 per cent; Government grants 65 per cent and miscellaneous sources 23 per cent. How can anybody say that we are democratic locally if we were dependent on Government grants to the tune of 65 per cent in 1983? Unfortunately, I was not able to get the figures for the years between 1983 and 1989-90 but I will look for them.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that we are becoming more dependent on Government grants. The graph has gone from 38 per cent to 65 per cent and from 41 per cent down to 12 per cent. Miscellaneous sources have remained about the same, from 21 per cent to 23 per cent. That indicates increased dependency on central Government for finance, really amounting to further erosion of autonomy at local level. Grants are tied, rubber stamped, call it what you like, to particular areas of spending and they undermine the discretion of the local authorities in identifying development priorities. There is really no autonomy in local democracy in relation to spending.</P>
    <P>Why are we out of step with the rest of Europe in terms of local taxation or whatever other form of funding we can get? They are not dependent on central Government. In relation to income tax some European countries give back to their local authorities the moneys raised within their local authorities and if an authority happen to be less well off than a neighbouring one they top up the money to ensure such a local authority is not disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In the European Charter on Local Government we read about the principle <Col N="2118" /> of subsidiarity. This EC policy has been hammered out since we entered the Community. The principle is quite simple. Public responsibilities should be carried out by the public authority closest to the citizen. We are ignoring the citizen's involvement all the time. When the Charter was opened for signature in 1985 11 member states signed. I believe Ireland still has not signed though I am open to correction on that. Why are we so different? Why do we feel we can do our own thing? We ignore the other 11 countries and the principle of subsidiarity which has been hammered out in documentation from Brussels. We want to be full Europeans but we never seem to sign or to accept what Europe believes is the proper way to go forward.</P>
    <P>The importance of local authorities in Ireland can be gauged by the extent to which functions are decentralised to local level. Council of Europe studies &mdash; which are not political statements &mdash; show that Ireland allocated to local level the fewest functions of any of nine European countries studied. The only country of the nine to have no local or regional powers in education or welfare services was Ireland. Again, we are out of step. The opposite end of the spectrum is that the contribution of community groups in Ireland to development has been outstanding in comparison with other European countries. Why are we at both ends of the see-saw, having tremendous development of community groups and then ignoring them? I have read about many of them in documentation from Brussels, groups who have developed structures which would promote partnerships between statutory and community based organisations and in this regard I think of the Paul project in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Local and regional authorities could play a co-ordinating role in integrated development for their areas, be it integrated rural development or liaison with the IDA, SFADCo or whatever. In local government we have employment and enterprise committees and planning and development committees. In Limerick we have had to ask a representative of <Col N="2119" /> SFADCo or IDA to come in. They come along, they give us employment &mdash; or unemployment apparently in recent times. They tell us the number of advance factories in our area and whether they are full and that is it. In contrast, local authorities provide services, water, sewerage, etc. and land from their land banks for factories, but we are not really recognised. These other bodies give us the facts and figures but they want no integrated role with the local authorities. I find that extraordinary, and here again we are out of step with other European countries.</P>
    <P>Communication between these semi-State bodies and the statutory local authorities is lacking. Sometimes the only knowledge we have of a factory coming to County Limerick comes from the <i>Limerick Leader.</i> In other words, the local authority are not even considered important enough to be informed beforehand of what might be coming to the area, despite the fact that the incoming industry will be seeking the services of the local authority in respect of planning permission etc. I will be looking for provision in the Bill for an integrated development role.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in this Bill to treating Ireland as a single unit for allocation of funds under the European Regional Development Fund. This Bill could have empowered local authorities to apply directly to the EC for funding for discretionary projects, but no, we have turned off the tap of moneys from Europe for local authorities &mdash; or regional authorities, although under this Bill they have no power I believe.</P>
    <P>Consider what we could do with funding. In my area £0.5 million has been collected from development levies which are there as a development fund in Limerick County Council. In any other European country an application to Brussels from a local authority for funds could have got backing of pound for pound or even more as has happened in Manchester and Belfast, and this is not necessarily confined to cities. Imagine what we could have done had we been able to <Col N="2120" /> draw down such EC funding. We have missed out once again because we want centralisation. We want the Department of Finance to be in control. Let us say I do not want the Department of Finance to be in control of moneys from Europe, but there is no provision at all in the Bill for local authorities to have any access to funding from Europe. I believe the General Council of County Councils and local authorities have made a submission to the Minister asking him to give them power to apply to Europe for funding.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to be altogether negative, but in regard to checks and controls I would welcome the abolition of the legal doctrine of <i>ultra vires.</i> I would welcome also the elimination of the principle of surcharge. The section 4 provision has never concerned me because Limerick County Council have never had to consider a section 4 motion. However, I am glad to see the Government's concern to ensure this channel of democratic input is not brought into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I am extremely concerned about the power being given to committees because a simple majority can carry a vote. The Government have control of quite a number of councils and in terms of democracy those committees could vote for a development plan or whatever, with no input from minority parties. I do not accept that there is any need to give such power to committees. At the moment anything discussed at committee level can go back to the full council for approval and discussion.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the reserved and executive powers. I am not happy about the position of councillors in the area of planning. The manager has his executive powers and he has emergency powers if he wants them. The councillors themselves have certain power but at the end of the day it is very little. In regard to the development plan they have power which has never been advertised in the sense that the public are not aware of it until they want to do something which the development plan prevents, though I am forever sending out newsletters telling them they should have an input into the plan through their councillors. It is a <Col N="2121" /> very important document for all county councils. It is necessary to move out of 18th century style local government and to have videos to take around to communities to show them what the development plan is all about, as it is a very complex document, and to show the improvements that have been carried out over a five-year period in their council areas. That would be one way of creating an awareness of the positive things done by councils.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the development plan and our position as councillors. We must be consulted if there is material contravention to the development plan. We can modify or revoke a planning permission but at the end of the day the planning power rests with the manager. I agree with the Minister that perhaps we are not aware of our powers and do not use them sufficiently. This is an area in which we as councillors should be far more vigilant. Section 4 is there to protect councillors but in many cases decisions are made and implemented before councillors are even aware of what they could have done to prevent something which may not be for the good of the council they are representing. In relation to the three tiers, we know nothing about the district councils. I hope that this will be thrashed out after the local government elections. That tier of local democracy will be one of the most important because it is closest to the citizens.</P>
    <P>I have been very disappointed with the Bill. We needed time to have it debated in full and not just have it pushed in for a couple of days. We needed plenty of time to debate it and examine it with plenty of time for amendments, etc. What was the reason for the postponement of the elections when we have had only a couple of weeks to digest this Bill? We have been waiting since 1898 &mdash; almost 100 years &mdash; for this Bill. It is a very serious issue because the people take their democratic right for granted. We are extremely complacent in relation to democracy. This would have been an opportunity for dialogue not just within councils and within the Seanad and the Dáil but with community groups and an <Col N="2122" /> opportunity for their input to be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I see little acceptance or acknowledgement of people power which, at the end of the day, will not go away because as people become more aware of their rights and their responsibilities they will be clamouring for another reform of local government because this Bill certainly will not answer their needs. They will be disappointed and, as I said at the beginning of my contribution, I hope that disappointment will not be reflected in a low turn-out at the polls because that will be interpreted as showing that the people do not value their local democracy. The reason is that there is no great democratic thread running through the Bill as regards bringing the people with us and acknowledging their power. In conclusion, an opportunity for a marvellous reform of local authority was missed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I join in the welcome to the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Connolly, who is with us at present. We are fortunate in that the two people who were directly involved in the preparation of this Bill, are long-serving and experienced members of local councils, both of them have played a long and effective role in the local authority system in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had the pleasure of being in the same organisation as the Minister of State, the General Council of County Councils, an organisation he served with distinction. I am sure when this Bill was being put together the Government and the country generally were fortunate that we had people who had, first, experience, and, second, commitment to the local authority system. Indeed, there have been many papers, many conferences, much discussion and much interaction between groups over many years with regard to local government reform. It could be said, to some extent, that lip service was paid to it. I do not agree with that. It is always better to tease out a situation, particularly if it is the intention to bring <Col N="2123" /> forward legislation that changes or modifies existing legislation and where the wish is that the new legislation will remain in place as a foundation stone for the next 50 years. Perhaps it has been to the advantage of all that long and thorough discussions and debates have taken place. Obviously, at the end of the day the discussions must cease to some extent and somebody must take responsibility for bringing forward the actual proposals. I want to compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and our Government for bringing forward this worthwhile legislation.</P>
    <P>The Local Government Bill, 1991, will provide the foundation for local government legislation which no doubt will be enacted over the next few years and it will put in place a set of structures for local government for the next four or five decades. Without legislation being introduced &mdash; this is where I would disagree totally with Senator Jackman &mdash; to determine the structures and functions of local authorities, we could not deal adequately with the finance of local authorities. We must have a structure on which to built. You cannot draw the water from the well unless you have a bucket.</P>
    <P>We have in these proposals a set of structures that will enable local authorities to function and to administer their responsibilities. The Government, the Minister and the Minister of State in preparing this legislation took on board the advice and the submissions of many groups throughout the country. I am glad the legislation is in line with the proposals of the general council of County Councils, of which I am happy to be a member. There was a responsible view from that organisation and that view was held in high esteem both by the expert committee and by the Minister and his Department when the legislation was being put together. Obviously, other groups such as the Association of Municipal Authorities, the expert committee, the parliamentary group of the Fianna Fáil Party, and many other national organisations made submissions. It was <Col N="2124" /> unfortunate &mdash; I do not say this in a derogatory sense or with a hard political bite &mdash; that the Opposition did not take part in the all-party committee. It was an opportunity for members of the Opposition parties to put forward good sound proposals. It would have made matters simpler if an all-party committee had been set up but that did not happen. Obviously, the Government had to proceed and I compliment them on their courage in doing so. I compliment the groups who went about their business in a very efficient manner and made their very detailed submissions following exhaustive consultations with their members and communities.</P>
    <P>Local government affects every man, woman and child. It affects their daily lives and surroundings and it provides local services that they need and use. National government should recognise this and provide a framework of principles on which local democracy can flourish. That is exactly what national Government are doing on this occasion. The objectives of national government should be to safeguard the rights of local authorities which are close to the citizen and which give him the opportunity of participating effectively in the making of decisions affecting his everyday environment. The administrative and financial independence of local authorities should be taken into account. The degree of self-government enjoyed by local authorities should be regarded as the touchstone of genuine democracy.</P>
    <P>There is need for a legal foundation for local government and establishing the principles governing the nature and scope of local authority powers. This legislation meets those objectives. Regard should be had to the administrative structures of local authorities and the need for adequate finance to ensure their basic autonomy. Further legislation is needed to bring that to fruition. The bottom line is that national Government should provide a set of structures and finance, and local authorities should insist on that. Here a set of structures is set down by national Government on which to build the local authority system of the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2125" /> Over the last five or six years I have made many submissions and prepared many papers on local authority structures, finance, functions and so on. I will not elaborate on them tonight because I am happy that the Minister, and the Government have taken on board in this legislation the genuine and constructive submissions from the relevant organisations, both local authority and community organisations. I heard criticism from Senator Jackman regarding decentralisation, or the lack of it, Structural Funds and the fact that local authorities have not sufficient finance. A number of realities have to be placed on the record. When the Minister for the Environment came to office in 1987 local authorities were in debt to the tune of £80 million but today that debt is just over £40 million. The Minister for Finance made a statement recently about the Structural Funds and said this country may benefit from those funds for a further three years. That is very important for local authorities. If their functions and structures are brought into line there will be an opportunity for development. The finance may be made available from the Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>As regards decentralisation, I would remind the House that there has been decentralisation to Athlone, Sligo, Cavan, Galway, Ballina and many other places. The record of the Government has been very much one of decentralisation rather than centralisation. As regards committees, it is very important that local authorities should be in a position to set up committees. Real democracy lies in the delegation of functions and responsibilities to elected representatives. I do not envisage any problem in that area. Control will very much be in the hands of local representives. The people who will exercise power will be dealing with everyday matters concerning themselves, their parishes, towns and electoral areas.</P>
    <P>Nobody could condone the position that existed in Dublin. There was a cumbersome county council which, with their existing membership, could not operate effectively. The Minister has dealt with <Col N="2126" /> this matter in a pragmatic and practical manner. There are to be three county councils in County Dublin, each with their own administrative staff and responsibilities. That is a most welcome development and one which I am sure the people of Dublin will find very much to their advantage. They will find they are nearer to their representatives in so far as distinct areas in the county will come under individual county councils. The last attempt in this regard turned out to be a farce and there was no real opportunity for local democracy. In this legislation the Minister is providing for real local democracy.</P>
    <P>I know this legislation does not deal directly with finance but it is hard to speak of local authorities without mentioning finance. As a previous speaker said there sems to be a castigation of the Minister regarding finance. I deplore that. It has been said that there is very little money available for roads. I spoke on this matter in the House two weeks ago and I outlined the facts and figures, but it appears I have to outline them again. In 1986, £23 million was provided for county and regional roads and in the three years 1989, 1990 and 1991, £169 million was provided. It is as well that we have the facts. It is a pity that we have to reiterate them some two weeks later. We will continue to do that, because there may be an attempt to con the general public coming up to election time. It is very important that the House be told of the facts.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation. It will lay the foundation of local government for the next 50 years. It will give the Minister the opportunity to continue his reforming approach. It is back-up legislation that will be needed over the next two to five years. It will also give members of local authorities an opportunity to have real local democracy and to have structures and functions available to us which were not available to us for a long number of years. Local authority members around the country will welcome this legislation. In time it will prove to have been reforming and far-sighted legislation. I compliment the Minister and the Minister of <Col N="2127" /> State on being here in the House for this debate. I have no doubt that this House will pass this legislation and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on this legislation. This legislation could with justification be claimed to have been rather rushed through the Houses of the Oireachtas. This is a point that the Minister, Deputy Flynn, acknowledged this evening &mdash; I am sure he acknowledged it in the other House also &mdash; when he devoted a considerable portion of his speech to explaining the pressures that required him to produce this Bill at relatively short notice and expecting an early endorsement from both Houses of the Oireachtas for it. That short notice and the amount of time available to this side of the House clearly places us in a certain difficulty as we are being deprived of the opportunity to go through the legislation, which can have important implications, in as much detail as we would like.</P>
      <P>Having entered that reservation in relation to what I have to say, I have read through the Bill and there are a number of comments I want to make in relation to what is in it and in relation to what is not in it but which should have been in it. There is a certain incentive in speaking after Senator Finneran, whose contributions are often well thought out. But he can be quite provocative as well in some of the observations he makes from time to time. I certainly do not share his conviction that this measure will form the foundation for local administration for the next 50 years. If that were to be the case, I think we would be building on a very flimsy foundation. Perhaps the Senator has more knowledge of what is intended than I have. Perhaps he looks on this as just putting the skeleton in place so that we can build bit by bit on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister in his opening statement spoke about the reform and modernisation of the local government system and said it has been one of the Government's highest priorities. There are two <Col N="2128" /> major areas where reform is needed in local government. We must reduce as far as possible centralised control and return power and influence to local authorities in matters which these local authorities can discharge. The second priority is to provide the financial resources required by local authorities to enable them to function effectively in discharging their duties. On my reading of the Bill, I feel it falls down on both these points.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech expressed regret that other parties did not join in the review of local government reform. That is a point that has been echoed by Senator Foley and Senator Finneran. I openly admit that within my own party, in discussing our attitude to that invitation, I was one of the people who opposed participation. I opposed it for a number of reasons. It is the duty of any Government to govern. The attitude and performance of the Fianna Fáil Party in the 1985 local elections left a lot to be desired, particularly the manner in which they attacked the need for service charges and their firm commitment to the electorate that these charges would be withdrawn once they controlled these councils. They reneged on that assurance; but nonetheless they recognised the need for a local tax, whether it was the restoration of rates or the imposition of property tax or something like that. They know even today that the introduction of that kind of local revenue is necessary for the smooth functioning of local government. The reason the invitation was issued to other parties to join the committee that was planning the reform of local government was to provide Fianna Fáil with the shelter of the other parties for the introduction of a local tax. That was one of the reasons I argued then that it is the responsibility of a Government to govern. In view of the assurances issued in the 1985 local elections that were subsequently dishonoured, I felt it was the duty of Fianna Fáil to face this issue on their own. They faced it on their own and they baulked. For that reason we have a measure before us that is little more than a skeleton at this stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> What the Bill does is to centralise control to an even greater extent than at present. A series of ministerial orders and regulations are provided for in this Bill which will ensure that the Minister, the centre, will have greater control over the functions of local authorities than they have at the moment. The discretion of local authorities will be overseen by and constrained by the Minister of the day under the powers proposed in this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about this measure being a major review of the local government system. He has spoken about reform and reorganisation, more meaningful functions being discharged by the local authorities and whether it is necessary in this measure to take account of the changes that have occurred over the past number of years. No matter how the Minister tries to represent it as giving more power to the local authorities, the fact remains that the Bill does not &mdash; and will not &mdash; shift power or decision making from the centre to the local authorities except in the situations where the Minister has provided himself with the controls to agree or disagree with the proposals of the local authorities in relation to many issues. Under this measure the decision making process of the local authorities will be constrained by ministerial control which will be exercised through orders and regulations.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to devolve to local authorities a growing volume of additional administrative duties. He has spoken about air pollution, housing and a number of other matters. He has devolved these additional functions to local authorities to administer without making provision for the additional financial resources required to administer them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the financial aspect, I should like to refer to the part of the Minister's speech dealing with a study conducted by the London Institute of Physical Studies at the request of the advisory expert committee regarding central funding for local authorities. He said that the report sees scope for greater equalisation, primarily in the distribution <Col N="2130" /> of the rates support grant. I am always very happy to see Minister Connolly present, but I am disappointed that Minister Flynn is not present because I wanted to highlight the lack of equalisation in relation to the rates support grant. I want to refer to a reply given by Minister Flynn to Deputy Shatter on 27 November 1990 in the other House which set out the allocations under the rates support grants to the different county councils and other authorities in 1990-91. While the average grant to the county councils was in the region of almost £4 million, my own County Clare received a figure of £128,000 in 1990 and £132,710 in 1991. The next lowest allocation was County Carlow, which got £1.8 million. The figure of £132,710 to Clare under the rates support grant compares to £6.2 million received by Mayo County Council; Laois County Council received £22 million. There must be a question in relation to the discrimination practised against my county council.</P>

      <P>The great weakness of the present Bill is its failure to deal with the funding necessary for local authorities. How this failure can be reconciled with the Minister's statement that he is devolving enhanced functions and duties to the local authorities is something that requires an explanation. If local authorities in the suggested activities that will be devolved to them are to participate and administer these activities fully, when will the additional finance be given to these already cash starved local authorities?</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to section 6 of the Bill in which there is a certain element of gamemanship. This section deals with the general competence of the local authorities and lists their powers in this regard. They may take measures and engage in activities in accordance with the law, including the incurring of expenditure, as they consider necessary or desirable, to promote the interests of the local community. They may carry out and maintain works of any kind, provide, maintain, preserve or restore land, structures of any kind or facilities, fit out, furnish or equip any building, structure or facility for particular purposes. They may provide utilities, equipment and material for particular purposes. They may provide any service or engage in any activity that in the opinion of the authority is likely to benefit the local community and may provide assistance in money or in kind. They may also enter into such contracts and other arrangements as the authority considers necessary or expedient. I would be delighted to endorse some of Senator Finneran's suggestions if there was freedom to engage in these activities with the resources available to local authorities to discharge these fine, ambitious objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further on section 6 says that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, prescribe matters in respect of which a local authority shall not exercise its powers conferred by the section. The same applies in relation to expenditure. The Minister may decide that it should not exceed a particular amount. <Col N="2132" /> While section 6 implies that local authorities will have all these powers the truth is that the Minister will be able to take them all back. If local government is to be effective it must be based on one primary principle and that is that if a function can be discharged at local level, it should be so discharged and the necessary funding made available. As I said earlier, under section 9, the Minister will have the power to devolve certain functions to the local authorities but, once again, he is silent on the question of finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the Government have decided there will be three tiers of local government with the county councils being the primary unit. I welcome and support that decision. That is how it should be. However, I would question the need for eight regional authorities even though I acknowledge that these will not be decision making bodies and will not have powers. Apparently, they will be co-ordinating bodies but essentially I think they will be talking shops. What concerns me is that in the future powers my be devolved to them. While others in the House may disagree I am of the opinion that the health boards, based on somewhat similar regions, have been a disaster in administering the health service. I would be greatly concerned if the functions which are discharged effectively by local authorities are surrendered to the regional bodies who may make a mess of it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other provisions of the Bill on which I hold certain views and which I would like to deal with. However I should make it clear that I have not discussed these with any of my colleagues. I would like to refer to section 13, the provisions of which will disqualify Ministers and Ministers of State from becoming members of local authorities. I have strong reservations about those provisions. This is a dangerous move in that it amounts to interference in the democratic process and with the right of the people to elect the person of their choice. In the past Ministers and Ministers of State used their discretion and most resigned, although not all. It is my view that the existing arrangements have <Col N="2133" /> worked well and should not be changed. It is unacceptable that the State be given the power to interfere in the relationship between people and their representatives.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill which deal with the allowances payable to chairmen of local authorities. No person should be at a financial loss for representing the public. Unfortunately, in many cases chairmen or chairwomen have had to meet many of their costs from their own financial resources. I am glad therefore that this provision has been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not mind if no one shares my views on the following matter. I would like to deal in a general way with sections 44 and 45 which relate to section 4 motions. I have read the Bill closely and recognise the intention in those sections. I would have to say that in the circumstances a reasonable compromise has been reached even though I am not happy with it. It is regrettable that the Minister yielded to the pressure brought to bear in this case and has proposed that the rights of elected members of local authorities be restricted further. I am a member of a county council who have rarely used section 4 motions. Indeed, there have only been five such motions in the past 17 years. This is the last safeguard available to the public representative with which to protect the public from an insensitive bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>This has been a contentious issue for many years and those councillors who have used these motions have taken their fair share of criticism; they have been criticised in the media and by non-elected persons some of whom, if they went forward for election, would not be elected to the smallest body of town commissioners in the country. Elected councillors are answerable to the public every five years unlike their detractors who are answerable to no one except themselves or to small self-appointed bodies. As a member of a county council who have rarely used these motions, I feel free to reject what I regard as unwarranted and despicable charges levelled at councillors in other counties by non-elected people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2134" /> While the Minister intends to limit the capacity of councillors to use section 4 motions he has preserved in a limited form an essential instrument of local democracy.</P>
    <P>I have expressed my disappointment at the fact that the Bill falls far short of what is required. It will not extend the powers and responsibilities of the local authorities in the way I would like. Where the Minister does propose to do this he has included other provisions which will allow him to make orders and regulations to take back these powers. I had expected the Minister to introduce more far-reaching powers in the Bill, to give the local authorities the opportunity to give a lead to their communities and the powers to discharge each function that it is possible to discharge at local level which at present is being discharged by central Government, and to make the necessary resources available.</P>
    <P>It is important for the standing of local government and for the future of local democracy that local authorities are enabled to discharge whatever functions are being discharged by the central authority which more effectively could be discharged at local level. Let me say to the Minister that it is essential that is done. Indeed, to ensure that it is done it is necessary also to give the financial resources or enable the local authorities to get their own financial resources to discharge these functions. If this Bill will begin the process that will lead to that it would be fine, but it is not in the present measure. Having entered these reservations and expressed these views on a number of aspects of the Bill, I look forward with interest to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>The storm of abuse which the Minister has faced since this Bill was published is hard to credit when one remembers that only over a year ago the principal Opposition party refused point blank to participate in an all-party Oireachtas committee. This opportunity was offered by the Government in an effort to ensure a wide consensus before <Col N="2135" /> embarking on the legislation. Fine Gael's excuse was that the terms of reference did not include such things as local taxation, property tax or other possible ways of financing local authorities. To have included these matters would have caused any reform whatsoever to be postponed indefinitely, such is the degree of differing views in this area. One only has to look at the events across the water where it has been impossible so far to come up with any replacement for the infamous poll tax. In the absence of the all-party committee the Taoiseach set up instead a committee of 14 Fianna Fáil Senators and Deputies who sat through the summer and autumn of last year on no fewer than 18 occasions. During this time they studied reports which had been issued over a 20 year period. They also invited submissions from all over the country and travelled to England to study reforms which had been carried out there. I would add that all this work was financed by the Fianna Fáil Party and not by the taxpayer. A great deal of what was proposed in their final report is now included in this Bill, added to the fact that the Minister and the Taoiseach set up an expert committee which also made an important input.</P>
      <P>This is just the first major step in bringing about a radical reform of the local government system. It has been criticised because it is seen as an enabling Bill. Why this Bill should be singled out for such criticism is beyond me. Countless pieces of legislation have been enacted by every Government since the foundation of this State which include the provision for ministerial regulation to be made by order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has set out in the first instance to begin the process of creating the structure under which local government will operate, The spirit of the Bill is about devolving much more power from the top to lower levels. For years we have been complaining about the bureaucracy of referring decision after decision to Dublin for approval. It would have been expecting a lot at this stage if the Bill were to spell out in detail what <Col N="2136" /> additional powers and functions were to be passed to local government. We would possibly have several councils saying they did not want such and such a power to be given to them. It is much more sensible that the devolution of any extra powers should be decided upon in the light of the experience of local councillors. Hopefully, we would then achieve consensus on all sides, which was denied by the Opposition's refusal to take part in the all-party committee. There is often a degree of cross party co-operation in the county councils which is all too rare in both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Opposition critics have painted a picture of the power hungry Minister sitting on his office like Scrooge deciding from time to time what functions, if any, he will dole out to the county councillors. This is far from the truth. The Minister has put an enormous amount of work and thought into the legislation. I know he is determined to put an end to the type of unnecessary bureaucracy I have mentioned and to give real power to the local authority throughout the country. My party already have been responsible for the decentralisation of the Civil Service in spite of the actions of the Fine GaelLabour Coalition Government who cancelled this programme in 1982. I have no doubt that we will also decentralise power in a similar fashion as a direct result of this Bill and I would remind the House that when these powers are devolved by provisional order confirmation will be required by an Act of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>There are several aspects of the Bill that I strongly welcome, among them are the re-establishment of the committee dealing with such matters as local health, education, etc. These committees will have either delegated or advisory functions. Another section will make managers more accountable by prescribing certain maximum terms of office. The provisions on planning in sections 44 and 45 will have the effect of removing once and for all any suggestion of abuse in the operation of section 4 motions. I also welcome the setting up of the eight regional authorities which will ensure the <Col N="2137" /> co-ordination of the roles of neighbouring councils. This makes good sense. We have seen in the past the effects of different standards of planning and design between one area and another. These are just a few of the excellent provisions in this Bill and on which the Minister must be congratulated. Between 1982-87 the two main Opposition parties were in Government and during this time they made no effort of any kind to address the local government question, even though the various reports were gathering dust in their offices. In the circumstances we can be excused if we are tempted to treat this present critisism with a small degree of contempt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Decentralisation is the call of the age. In my book &ldquo;this means more and more encroachment upon the domain of the supreme authority. This, of course, is a good thing for local democracy. At the same time I recognise it is necessary to maintain equilibrium between local and central government because we would all agree that that is the chief security upon which our Constitution rests.</P>
      <P>The limit of legal right to exercise sovereign powers is found in the special functions assigned to each minor grade of Government. Obviously, if local government were to undertake duties outside those assigned to them they would be acting illegally. Again, if they did so they would be encroaching either upon the jurisdiction of the other grades of Government or upon the domain of the supreme authority, Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the difficulties of striking an equilibrium between central and local governments. Having said that, I now put on record that the institutions of local government, town, borough and county councils, can be a great blessing to the country. They are a natural consequence of great masses of population in an area governing themselves. Obviously, they provide the readiest means of governing and of being able to be governed. Consequently it is very important that local democracy is not only kept intact but that <Col N="2138" /> it measures up to the demands of the day and keeps growing and developing.</P>
    <P>This is where the problem lies. I do not see this Bill developing local government or helping to generate enthusiasm among local communities or encouraging local democracy. I am all for improving and simplifying these institutions according to the best and safest principles. I believe that since we call ourselves patriots, legislators and some of us cheekily call ourselves statesmen, we should pursue the practical objective of improving and simplifying our institutions. How can we do that if the Bill before us does not provide the scope for it? I do not think it does. Therefore I find it a little difficult to support the Bill in that respect.</P>
    <P>We should be strong advocates of local government reform. We should seek to establish a graduated system so that every citizen with the slightest capacity for public affairs will be able to participate in local administration. In other words, we should seek to create a system which extends to every parish. Local government should be free from intricacies and the people best qualified, namely the local councillors, should be given the fullest possible scope to develop the interests of each locality. However, councillors are very often restricted by the actions of central Government who, instead of maintining the equilibrium, jealously guard their powers and do not delegate them in a proper way. We need an independent system of local government which would be subject to the necessary controls.</P>
    <P>Local government attracts the best peoople in each district, those who want to improve their communities. If we do not give local authorities proper powers, backed-up with substantial financial allocations so that they can be imaginative in raising taxes, and so on, they will not be able to give the necessary services to the people in their communities. Consequently, local communities will not believe they are being governed properly, with the result that no one will benefit. Members of councils and corporations should be regarded as directors of a large business and be treated as such. Many <Col N="2139" /> councillors have to depend on the goodwill of their electorate. This means they have to ensure that they do their work speedily to the benefit of the community. Unfortunately, we have not given local councillors sufficient scope to be imaginative in raising funds to supplement the derisory income councils receive. That does not help democracy in any way.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately tried in my contribution to limit my remarks to what I believe local government is all about. Having done this, I feel obliged to ask what has happened to our positive approach to such matters. When one considers the number of legislators who are members of local authorities one wonders how the powers of local authorities have been allowed to slip. It does not matter which Government are at fault, one is entitled to ask these questions. Who has attacked the dignity of local government and the funding of this vital public service? We are entitled to ask why this was done, We are also entitled to question a mentality which only leads in the final analysis to local government becoming a by-word in the minds of many people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities and, in particular, councillors do not deserve to be treated in this manner. However, because we have not funded local authorities properly we have placed them in the position where they are discredited by many people. The Government cannot, for example, tell CIE to purchase more trains because there are more passengers and then not fund them. Likewise, they should not give local authorities more powers without giving them the necessary funding to back this up. We should not put them in the position where they are discredited, which is what we have done in the past by not giving them sufficient funding or allowing them to raise additional resources.</P>
    <P>The paper powers being given to local authorities in the Bill will mean nothing if they are not given the necessary financial backing. Local authorities can administer the affairs of their local areas better than central Government. Yet these people are prevented from spreading this <Col N="2140" /> democracy to every parish in their areas. For example, the role of local authorities in the area of tourism has never been extended and the possibility of local authorities being able to provide better services in the health area has been diminished. Local authorities need real power, not paper power. They can only exercise real power when they are given sufficient funding by central Government and allowed to raise additional resources.</P>
    <P>The devolution of powers from central to local government and the transfer of functions between local authorities seems great on paper but it will be toothless if it is not backed by sufficient funding. For example, it might be possible for local authorities to raise additional funding in certain areas. I am not saying that they should borrow money from municipal or other banks as this would not be a viable proposition. Nevertheless, local authorities should be given the power to raise additional funding. I do not think they have that power at present. Perhaps they could get some additional revenue from tourism, the services they provide to very wealthy people or services they render on a regular basis. If local authorities could raise money from such sources, coupled with a substantial increase in their central fund allocation then we could then talk about giving them extra powers.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill will lead people to believe that there will be an improvement in the way they are governed at local level. As we know, it is very easy to govern cheaply. However, we must remember that governing cheaply is the same as governing badly. This is what we have reduced local government to, and I do not think this Bill will help give the lie to this. Efficient government implies efficient machinery which, as we know, has to be paid for. If local authorities do not receive adequate funding from central Government people will believe that our economy is stationary.</P>
    <P>Many commentators and Ministers have referred to the healthy state of our economy and there has been muscle flexing about the Government performance being up there with the best.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2141" /> However, despite that, local government is not allowed to be at the top. If Government performance was as good as it is claimed to be, then local government should benefit from the spin-off. To ignore the need to fund local government from the central Government and at the same time prevent them using their imagination to generate more revenue to meet new demands, is saying that they must remain stationary. Certainly they cannot meet any new demands. If we do not give them the finance and the means to obtain the finance, then people can justly claim that the Government have ceased to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>New duties have been imposed upon those who administer these needs. The Government say that they are doing very well; yet they do not provide for the needs of local government. Local government comprises a league of associations working in co-operation with their own communities and with the Government as a whole and the Government are not meeting their own needs if they do not look after local government as well.</P>
    <P>If we continue like this, the spread of the democratic spirit will come to a halt. If we continue to starve local administration of resources the growing demand for the amelioration of the conditions of the poorest citizens cannot be met effectively. How can we ask local government to cope with all these demands without substantially increasing their allocations? How can we ask them to look after our highways and byways, our roads, the sewers, health, and the poorest citizens in their areas and soon? How can we ask them to exercise more powers in these areas when this calls for a greater allocation of funding?</P>
    <P>I feel I am justified in taking this line on the basis of what the Minister said on Second Stage. However, the Bill is not a financial provisions measure. It does not purport to be such; it was never intended to be such and for the reasons I have outlined it is not appropriate that it should be. What will happen in Northern Ireland if there is devolved government, and central Government say they can have all of that responsibility not the <Col N="2142" /> money to do it? I am mystified as to how one can tell people they have a whole lot of new powers but they cannot have the resources to back them up.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the councillors who are doing a very good job and who are really up against it. This Bill does not allow them to exercise the powers they are being given. The intention behind the Bill may be good but local government will not be able to benefit from the Bill unless the money is there to back it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. I gathered from the Minister that it will reform local government. It is not easy to reform local government. I understand the Minister said that this is just the first step. He also said that it has taken up to 20 years to get around to reforming local government. It would be wrong, however, if we did not admit that there have been extraordinary changes in those 20 years and that those changes were not to the benefit of those elected to councils.</P>
      <P>Throughout this debate, and in addresses outside the Houses of the Oireachtas, there have been references to power. I must say I dislike that word, but in my contribution this evening I have to use it. It worries me because power has been abused by some people in this nation and in other nations and as a result we are all tagged.</P>
      <P>The Minister said in the course of his address this evening, that this will put local authorities to the forefront as the voice of the community and the upholder of its interests. I hope that that is what this legislation will achieve. It is what local authority is all about. I have strong views on local government and these views are well known. I will continue to hold my strong views totally separate from my electorate.</P>
      <P>Let us be clear as to what this legislation is about. Are we setting out here to reform local government? If that is what this Bill is about, it has my total support; if it is not what it is about, I would have reservations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, to the House. Both <Col N="2143" /> Deputies Connolly and Deputy Flynn, the Minister for the Environment, came into the House from county councils. The Minister now present has been a serving member until now, but as a Minister he will be banned from standing in the local elections. That may well have been too strong a decision, because many people who served in local government were elected to the national Parliament. Now we are putting through a Bill which debars Ministers of State and, In understand, other office holders from standing. I am glad Senator Howard referred to that also. It is not that we are two Clare Senators; we have very different views on many things, but I think those of us who have served our apprenticeship on the ground in local authorities bring more to national Government and legislation.</P>
    <P>I am a strong believer in serving one's apprenticeship. I have resented people on their first day, either here or in the other House, immediately taking senior office. I held that view ten and 20 years ago and I hold it still. In other arenas the practice of serving one's apprenticeship has been dropped and I think we are the poorer as a nation for that.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Flynn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, for bringing this legislation before us. Former holders of their offices served this nation well and I pay tribute to them for the role they played in putting local government where it is today in the face of all the snags and minuses. Some have long gone to their reward and some of them are still with us. I extend that tribute to the present holders of office the Minister and Minister of State. Local Government needs reform and we will have to make changes. This measure is the first step towards that end. I am in a position to talk about my commitment to local government between three of us, my family have served in it for over 60 years without a break. I would not ask any other family to serve such a long apprenticeship before attaining the position you hold, Sir.</P>
    <P>We should not do away with what is good in local government. Much of what <Col N="2144" /> is in place at the moment is acceptable. It seems the present local government framework has its origins mainly in the 19th century and must now be adapted to today's circumstances and requirements. Of course we do not wish to abolish the entire system. We must retain what is satisfactory and reform where reform is necessary. Local government has served this nation and its people well over the years.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states:</P>
    <P>General</P>
    <P>1. The Bill contains provisions for the implementation of a range of local government reform measures designed primarily to strengthen local democracy, to improve the system of local government, to increase its role and to give local authorities the capacity to serve the interests of their communities effectively...</P>
    <P>Part II contains provisions relating to the powers and functions of local authorities, including a statement of their representational role; provision of a general competence for local authorities to take action in the interests of the local community; ancillary powers of local authorities; and matters to which local authorities are required to have regard in performing their functions. Power to devolve functions from the central to local level and to transfer functions between local authorities is also provided for.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains provisions relating to local electoral matters including the postponement of local elections to urban councils, and here I think of Ennis Urban District Ccouncil. Some anxiety prevails at the moment about the future of the smaller authorities. Senator Foley appealed to the Minister to be careful in regard to the power and the role of urban district councils like Tralee and Ennis and small boroughs such as Clonmel. I do not know the Minister's intention but I join with Senator Foley in asking that the question be considered carefully before there is any change.</P>
    <P>Part VI contains provisions regarding <Col N="2145" /> the establishment of committees. I welcome this. I have made an appeal for the re-establishment of the health committees and agricultural committees. I cannot let this Bill go through this House without paying tribute to the former agriculture committees for their extraordinary commitment and work which I hope will continue in the various committees. I served on the health committee for nearly 25 years, right from its inception, and I learned a good deal from doing so. Everybody was informed at every level of the state of health in Clare by that committee, perhaps at some cost to myself.</P>
    <P>Part VII provides for the payment of expenses to local authority members and the provision of proper allowances in relation to expenses of local authority chairpersons. I support the concept that proper and very generous expenses ought to be paid to people who serve on local authorities. I am aware of the cost to a family, as are all my colleagues here who are all members of councils, of serving on local government. People outside refer to the mileage and so on but nobody makes money out of their expenses. I hope that Part VII of this Bill will be put in place and proper expenses provided for those people wo serve in local government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that section 4 will remain in the Bill in the form in which the Minister has decided. Some people in this House and in the other House thought that power should be removed while some thought it should be left in place. I am happy with this Part of the Bill and the fact that the power and the clout is left to the elected councillors to use when they need it. There have been only nine section 4 motions in County Clare since 1955 and none since January 1986, so there is no question of abuse of the provision in that area. I am happy, therefore, that the Minister has allowed the section 4 provision to remain for responsible councils and councillors to use it for the benefit of their people in the proper fashion. This provision must have been abused in some areas, otherwise the Minister and the Government <Col N="2146" /> would not have taken the step of removing it to the extent they have done.</P>
    <P>When replying, perhaps the Minister would clarify the position because he has been accused of taking all the power to himself. The accusations have gone on all day and they are going on outside. People are convinced that this is what this legislation is all about. If that were so, I would be the first to say so but I hope I am reading the Bill correctly, I do not always read legislation correctly. I understand that the Minister has to assume the power to pass it back to members of councils and that this is the first step. Even in Europe they ask that the first line of advice should come from local authorities. It should be remembered that when the Structural Funds were being put in place Europe asked that submissions be taken from local authorities first and carefully listened to.</P>

Those of us who listen have survived and remained at one with the people. I was amazed this evening to hear Senator Jackman &mdash; for whom I have the greatest respect &mdash; say that she found herself removed from the people of Limerick because of local government as it is now in place. I do not find that I am removed in any way from the people. If I have to go down town to buy, say, a loaf of bread, it involves a two hour exercise.</P>

      <P>I have found that local government, as it is in place, has stood me well. I was surprised that my neighbouring Senator should need more power in terms of this Bill to keep her close to <Col N="2147" /> the people in her electoral area. I would prefer that the Senator were here to hear me say this. I am not criticising her in any way but merely trying to emphasise how close I am, as are my fellow party Senators and the Minister, to the people in our areas. That is how one survives, whether it be in the context of local government or nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people have respect for us but we are the ones who must earn that respect. Most of us have succeeded in that regard. No. Minister can put in place legislation to enable us to hold the respect of our people.</P>
      <P>I am a little confused as to whether the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Flynn, means to ask us to ask him for permission to hold civic receptions or to make arrangements for the twinning of towns. Some Deputies in the Dáil said that we would now have to ask the Minister for such permission. Can you imagine having to ask the Minister for permission to hold a civic reception in Ennis or elsewhere, in Clare or to have to seek his sanction in relation to the twinning of towns? I hope I am wrong in this reading of the Bill but I am sure the Minister will clarify the matter.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the question of local charges. In Clare between 94 per cent and 98 per cent of local charges are paid, there is no trouble or hassle about them. Those people accept totally, as I do as an elected person, that we should pay for water and refuse collection services. The mistake in relation to these charges was that here in Dublin the people were told they did not have to pay them while those in the remainder of the country must pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to money issues, I understand there was a difference of opinion this evening between Senator Finneran and Senator Howard about the money allocated to the consituency of Clare. I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, and his senior officials at the Department of the Environment will clarify that matter in the morning. If the figure given is the only allocation that <Col N="2148" /> Clare has got, it must be a misprint. It would be draft. I know that many people in Clare were unhappy with the amount of money received. I hope it is a misprint, but the Minister has taken it upon himself to clear up the matter tomorrow morning and to say if the figure mentioned by Senator Howard is incorrect. The amount of money that Clare County Council have to raise is quite high. I would ask the Minister if it is correct that they have to provide 62 per cent of their funding. I know I am breaking the rules of the House in asking a question at this stage.</P>

      <P>There was some confusion about this matter earlier this evening, but it will be cleared up tomorrow morning.</P>
      <P>I welcome the change in position as regards county managers and the proposal to move them after seven years. In County Clare we do not know what is happening from one six months to another. There are some county managers whom we would be better off without &mdash; I am not referring to the managers in Clare. I welcome the section that provides for changes in this area.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his opening address. As Senator Foley has said, it was a well delivered speech. I am sure the Minister hoped he would be in Castle-bar by the time I spoke. His address to the House was most comprehensive and explained matters in great detail. I would like to refer to several parts of his speech but I will not delay the House in doing so. I welcomed the Minister's tribute to local authorities. He also referred to funding, but I will not go down that road because I have had words already with the Minister, Deputy Flynn, on this matter. There is only a certain amount of funding available and some constituencies have to get more than others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's reference to urban renewal. In fairness to the Government, particularly to Deputy Flynn and <Col N="2149" /> Deputy Connolly, recognition has been given to this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, is to be complimented on his very prominent role in the urban renewal programme. I have seen the urban renewal scheme in operation in Waterford and it is an excellent scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we are. I criticise the Minister when he deserves it but I also compliment him when it is due. The Minister went into detail regarding the role of local authorities. Perhaps he should read this paragraph again, The people serving on local authorities are well aware of their role and should be let get on with their job. The Minister also referred to computers. As the Cathaoirleach, who is a member of a county council, will know, you cannot make local government work properly with computers or buttons. You have to work hard, with the support and backup of the Department and stay close to the people. That is the way to get results. In fairness to the senior officials of the Department of the Environment, I have never clashed with them. I believe it is not in order to pay tribute to officials in the Department, and as a former Cathaoirleach I should know better, but I am doing so now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred in his speech to regional authorities. I am concerned about this matter just as I was about the health boards, and I believe we made a mistake in the regionalisation of health services. The Minister said the regional authorities will be composed of elected members of county councils, county boroughs and corporations within the regions. That seems very like the legislation we put in place regarding health boards. I would hate to see local government go down that road. The Minister should have confidence in the elected representatives, as I know he has. The people will re-elect the councillors who have served them well, and good councilors need not worry about the June elections. There has been a lot of talk about <Col N="2150" /> Fianna Fáil getting hammered in the elections but the serving councillors, some of whom are sitting around me, including Senator Staunton, need not be concerned about facing the people. Local government is quite different from national politics in that it is very personal. People cross party lines and look after the councillor who looked after them. I do not know where the idea came from about Fianna Fáil getting hammered in the local elections because that is not going to happen.</P>
    <P>If this legislation does as the Minister says it will, I welcome it. I hope it strengthens local democracy, improves local representation and gives more power and force to the elected members of the local authorities. It is up to us to ensure that this is done. If the legislation does as it is intended, the elected representatives will be happy. I thank the Minister and the Leas-Chathaoirleach for their patience because I think I crossed the line on a couple of occasions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a copy of the Minister's speech and in his introductory comments he said that in his view this legislation is one of the most important items introduced in the Oireachtas in recent years. I agree the subject in question is certainly one of the most important items in public life in Ireland. However, I find the Bill remarkably weak given the opportunity the Minister had. If the Bill is as important as the Minister says it is why is this House being treated so abysmally? In the Lower House when these issues were debated it was pointed out that this Bill had a gestation period of a couple of years. A very distinguished committee headed by the distinguished international authority on delegation of functions, Tom Barrington, ex-head of the Institute of Public Administration, produced a report which was delivered to the Government in early December 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are listening to a Minister who is talking about his respect for legislation, <Col N="2151" /> for legislative assemblies, and for local authority. It seems complete denigration of such rhetoric to come into Seanad Éireann, one of the two Houses of the Oireachtas, and issue an introductory speech telling us that for certain legislative purposes, this legislation must go through tomorrow and that we have a specified number of short hours during which we must conclude the Second State debate which he regards as of huge importance. By definition, it is a huge insult to this House. In the lower House our colleagues were complaining that they only had from ten to 14 days to debate and tease out the issues. I regard it as high farce. It has also been illustrated in the debate in the Dáil that there was no legislative necessity to bring in a thorough fundamental Bill reforming local government, but certain aspects might have been necessary. If the Government did not find the time to give the House the respect it deserves, a much shorter Bill could have been introduced to regularise the legislative anomaly. If a House of the Oireachtas, in relation to this matter of supposed great importance, can be treated in this manner, it does not imply a political commitment of respect for local authorities.</P>
    <P>If in the private sector, a corporation was run by an executive board of management, if the processing of arguments, speeches, drafts and legislation was sent up to the board for decision and the board were told that the executive had spent two years preparing it and there was such a rush to get it through now, that the members on this board must arrive at their conclusions before tomorrow to avoid a huge legislative problem, that would be regarded as gross incompetence. The Seanad is supposed to give mature consideration to legislation. The purpose of this Second House, the original concept of de Valera, was a House representing vocational interests rather than narrow political interests which was supposed to give mature people from a vocational background the time to give issues deliberate and mature consideration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> The interval between the time the Dáil concluded a Bill and its going to the Seanad was meant to give the public the opportunity to make their observations. If serious Senators could persuade the Minister that a number of amendments were necessary, he would not have the time to incorporate them, even if he had the political will to do so. Some months ago, we had a similar debate on the Broadcasting Bill. Many people in the vocational sector had reservations in regard to RTE's revenue losses. We were pushed into a tight corner because the Bill had to be passed quickly to avoid legislative chaos. The Bill when agreed here had to be rushed to the President for signature. That procedure was highly improper. It was using the guillotine in a very improper manner. The outrage expressed by many Senators on the Order of Business was quite appropriate and this certainly does not set a good example.</P>
    <P>The Minister thanked Senators for bearing patiently with him in what he agreed had been a lengthy speech. However, he believed it needed to be long to give the matter detailed treatment, because the Bill now before the Seanad is a very substantial measure indeed. If the Minister thinks he was justified in reading a 40 page speech into the record because of what he described as a very substantial measure indeed, is he paying a compliment to his fellow Members of the Oireachtas by suggesting that they can adequately cover this legislation in this curtailed debate? I wonder how many minutes each member will have to make his contribution?</P>
    <P>I know quite a lot about local government. I was elected a member of Mayo County Council for about 12 or 13 years. I was never defeated in an election and the only reason I ceased to run was that I was nominated to contest the European election and there was a rule in my party that one could not also contest the local authority elections. I had a vocational background on local government issues and on the devolution of authority. Before I became a member of the Oireachtas I was the architect of a policy <Col N="2153" /> document adopted by my party, &ldquo;The Policy for People&rdquo; which called for the establishment in the west of Ireland of a western development board in the five western counties and County Donegal.</P>
    <P>Studying the various issues with a view to producing a good paper, I had a number of meetings with Dr. Tom Barrington, the chairman appointed by the Government to this advisory expert committee. He is a luminary in this field and has an international reputation. The report he and his committee produced is a very remarkable document. I want to pay a compliment not to the Minister or his colleagues in Cabinet, but to Tom Barrington and his committee who, produced such a lucid and comprehensive report advising the Minister what local government issues should be reformed. They made copious references to the experience in other western European democracies.</P>
    <P>One of my colleagues in the Lower House said he made a detailed study of the number of reforms sought and recommended by Dr. Barrington and his advisory expert committee, and according to his study, 63 of the 75 recommendations are not being implemented. It is very sad that the Minister, who is competent in many ways who had the authority of the Cabinet, who had power in a major Department, and an excellent report from a superb advisory committee, unfortunately only formed a political subcommittee that did not grasp the nettle, and only superficially looked on issues on which there was political pressure to reform. The main thrust of reform was lost. That is unfortunate, because many issues dealt with in the Bill are of a peripheral rather than a fundamental nature. Of course, the question of local government is important but it is peripheral as we are not talking about the functions or relationships of councillors to management or to central Government. Local government in Dublin is tremendously important, boundary alterations are a logistical issue and not a matter of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>The core of the Minister's document, in comparison to the committee's advice <Col N="2154" /> on local government reorganisation and reform contains a few short nebulous bits and pieces about entertainment, allowances or reserved functions, but no meat. The Barrington document demonstrates how weak local government devolution of authority is here in comparison to most other countries in western Europe and the consequent need for reform. An examination of all the economies in western Europe, including Germany, since the energy crisis, shows that the Netherlands has been managed best, yet even in that country there is massive decentralisation of public functions. Although their population is significantly higher than Ireland there are about 762 local authorities in comparison with our 113.</P>
    <P>There is an interesting point about the Netherlands which highlights another situation, with our emphasis in this country on centralised Government. If you look at the huge achievements of the Netherlands economy in the last 12 to 15 years and to an extent, the undistinguished performance here &mdash; I am not talking about this Government but all Governments &mdash; there is an interesting paradox when you compare the structure of the national Parliament in the Netherlands against the national Parliament here. If you look at the equivalent of our Dáil, for their population of about 15 million people they have fewer Teachtaí Dála than we have for our 3.5 million. Maybe there is a message there somewhere for us.</P>
    <P>The Barrington committee sought reform because of the need to develop the democratic system, problems associated with centralised Government, the needs of local development and the best way to use resources. The report states that over the past 20 to 30 years most west European Governments have been updating their local democratic systems, especially in relation to local government and that Ireland has been unusual in not following this trend. The recent upsurge in democracies in western Europe, the widespread demand for participation and the determination of people to control their own affairs, has led to a movement which has swept across Europe for the <Col N="2155" /> last decade and a half but it has bypassed this part of the island.</P>
    <P>Barrington points out the problems here, which can be identified at subnational level, the lack of integration of services, the narrow range of functions in Irish local authorities in comparison with our counterparts in other western European country, they have either no involvement &mdash; or minimal involvement &mdash; in many areas which he spells out here. He refers to the extremely few numbers of local authorities in comparison with other European countries and he quotes the statistics: Ireland has 113, Denmark has practically 300 and Austria has about 2,375.</P>
    <P>I have found it a basic principle in politics over the last 20 years in this country that we are obsessed with continually comparing standards of our Government with those of other Governments. We are always talking in relative terms about events within our own country but the problem arises when you compare what is happening here with what is happening abroad. In that sense we need to be much more questioning and much less adulatory of Bills or speeches introduced by Ministers in any Irish Government, regardless of their politics.</P>
    <P>Barrington goes on to talk about the question of partnership. Senator Honan spoke about this, the recent insistence in the European Community on reform of the Structural Funds which mandated national Governments to get into formalised consultation with local authorities before the European Community would agree to supplying the funds.</P>
    <P>Again, in this area &mdash; in relation to events last year which caused a series of articles of an investigative journalist nature &mdash; there was considerable questioning by the European Commissioner of the attitude adopted by the Irish Government in their application for Structural Funds. There was merely the most superficial dialogue with one or two local authorities in the country, which was obviously merely an attempt to <Col N="2156" /> comply with the new European Community regulations rather than a desire to get into serious dialogue.</P>

That was an issue concerning the Minister and the senior executives within the Department of the Environment. Of course we should be moving in a more progressive fashion but this Bill is a whitewash and does not relate to what is sought by the Barrington advisory expert committee appointed by the Cabinet. If Minister Flynn had grasped the nettle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to my colleague from west of the Shannon, I do not accept that it is. The Minister's Bill deals with superficial issues, it was hurriedly brought out but does not address the fundamentals and core issues in regard to decentralisation of functions, authority or what local councillors should be doing. The weak attempts in this Bill to suggest that there may be increased powers in local government is typified by the wording in section 34 (2) which states that the Minister may, by order, make such provision as he considers necessary or expedient in relation to any matter. The Minister may, given his goodwill and specific attitude on an issue and out of the goodness of his heart, decide at a given time that a local authority may arbitrarily have a new function which he will define. It does not get to the core of the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to be particularly critical of this Government because I remember my own experiences in the past as the architect of this plan to have a western development board to which the Government in 1973, headed by Liam Cosgrave, <Col N="2157" /> became formally committed. The Government at that time formally announced, through the then Minister for the Gaeltacht, Tom O'Donnell, that it would be implemented. I was in constant touch with the former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, on the issue; I had his goodwill and he was pushing Ministers in relevant Departments to come through with it but there was massive resistance in senior circles in two Government Departments, one of which was then called the Department of Local Government, now the Department of the Environment. The Barrington report, on page 27, refers to all these issues &mdash; the structures, the built-in vested interests and the strings on all these things. In these circumstances it is crucial that there be strong political commitment to achieve those objectives.</P>
    <P>Progress will only be achieved in politics and public administration if there is a strong political will. To be fair to the Minister, when he does choose to exercise it he can display a strong political will but he has not chosen to do so in this instance. The Barrington report states that the crucial factor in the view of the committee is political commitment and what was sought was a clear statement from the Government or the Minister outlining their vision for the future. I had hoped that the Minister would be present in the House to hear me suggest that there is no evidence in the nebulous logistical Bill of any such political commitment or vision for the future on the part of the Minister or the Government.</P>
    <P>The Barrington report also deals with other issues which stem from the weaknesses in the structure of Government. It points out that there is apathy and disillusionment among the public with the weakness of the structures of the local authorities. It also deals with electoral issues and claims that there are many people who might otherwise be attracted to stand for election to local authorities but are not seeking election because they are disillusioned with what is going on. There is evidence to suggest that a significant number of councillors of stature and competence in all political parties <Col N="2158" /> will not stand for election in the next local elections for this reason.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister is committed to the idea that the county councils be the primary tier of local government. I agree completely with him because I am a strong fan of the county councils. They are very strong logistical administrative units with a history of tight management. We lost much when regional councils and boards representing two, three or four counties were established. I question the need to employ huge numbers of people to provide a multiplicity of service which were provided by fewer people in the past.</P>
    <P>I am aware of what has happened in the Galway-Mayo region and I must say, as a Mayo man, that I was not enamoured with the link up with Galway and Roscommon. It seems that virtually every meeting of the authority, dealing with tourism, regional development or any aspect of local or national life, takes place in Galway. Given that only a limited number of meetings have taken place in my county we seem to be getting the thin edge of the wedge.</P>
    <P>Some years ago county development teams were established. That was one of the most significant reforms in local government services during the past 30 years and these allowed the county councils, with the will of Government, instead of being merely concerned with sewers, drains, road construction and management, to discharge a development function. The teams consisted of the senior executives in the counties with the less developed counties having a county development officer. I do not know of any county which was not excellently served by the county development officers appointed. They liaised with national agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority, tourism organisations and other such bodies.</P>
    <P>It was at that point that we discussed the question of whether the Industrial Development Authority should have regional offices, but as we are aware all they did was establish a number of branch offices around the country. The officers <Col N="2159" /> appointed were accountable to the central office and had minimal discretion. This proved to be demeaning for the county development officers in Galway, Mayo and Roscommon who were doing an excellent job and there was duplication of services. The implication was that, in the industrial sector, the county development officer had no role as this was to be carried out by the regional officers of the Industrial Development Authority. This led to the county development officers becoming disillusioned.</P>
    <P>In their wisdom the Government appointed Dr. Tom Barrington, who has had a most distinguished career in local government as the chairman of an expert committee who produced an outstanding report which summarised the results of 40 or 50 years of work in the sector. The report pointed out that Ireland has one of the most centralised systems of government in Europe. I say, more in sadness than in anger, that instead of the Bill reflecting the recommendations of the expert advisory committee we are presented with a nebulous, logistical and anaemic document which addresses some peripheral matters but fails to grasp the nettle.</P>

I am glad to say that most of the points made in that submission have been taken on board by Dr. Barrington in the recommendations. I listened with great interest to the previous speaker who is a great orator and highly respected in this House. I always learn something new when he makes a contribution. However, I cannot for the life of me understand the reason his party, who were in Government on three occasions during the past 20 years, failed to bring a Bill such as this before the House.

      <P>The previous speaker suggested there was a need for a strong political will. I do not know of anyone whose political will exceeds that of the Minister for the Environment who has proved time and again that he is a great asset to the Government and the country. He has also been a tremendous ambassador for his home county of Mayo and I admire him greatly. Having regard to the enormous amount of legislation introduced by him and his Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, they are a great example to us all. It appears that they are working 14 hours a day seven days a week on behalf of all the citizens of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been waiting 20 years for changes and adjustments to be made to legislation but, at the same time, it is good to have the opportunity of discussing the legislation this evening. Quite often over the years we did not use the many powers we have as county councillors and as members of local authorities. I would like to pose a question to all of us who are county council members: how many members of county councils sat down and wrote and rewrote the estimates at any particular time of the year? We have the power; we could have done it, and had it implemented. Only one <Col N="2161" /> local authority, as far as I know, sat down recently and prepared their own estimate line by line and had it implemented by the manager. I think there is tremendous opportunity and power available to local authority members to voice their opinion in how the funding from Government and that raised in their own local authority areas is spent. Quite often we criticise and denigrate those who exercise the power, which we have if only we would use it. From that point of view, adding to the powers we already have gives local authority members a position of considerable power.</P>
    <P>I must welcome the re-establishment of committees of agriculture. These committees were very worthwhile and everyone was able to have an input in respect of what was happening in each parish and townland. From my experience as a member of the VEC committee in Westmeath since 1979, I must say the local committees are the place where one can highlight the causes most in need in the area. We are now in the run-up to the local elections. I know very well that were I not a member of the Westmeath VEC, the Castlepollard vocational school would not have been upgraded to provide classes up to leaving certificate standard. I am very proud of that. If, for some unknown reason, I were not to be re-elected, with that one great achievement I could say it was worth my while serving on the VEC because young boys and girls from under-privileged families and not so under-privileged families got an opportunity to do the leaving certificate at the local school, the only one in north Westmeath. I played a big part in that because I was the only member from north Westmeath on the committee at that time.</P>
    <P>In relation to the health boards there are various views on matters such as regional decisions and I see such a proposal in this legislation. The Midland Health Board covers the counties of Laois, Offaly, Longford and Westmeath. This Bill has a similar proposal for the same four counties. They relate quite well to each other; they are the four northerly counties of Leinster. We are <Col N="2162" /> very fortunate to have the Minister for Finance in Longford, the Minister for Education in Westmeath and the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment in County Offaly. Of course appointments are made on the basis of ability and achievement. It would give us great heart and hope for the future if this advisory committee were left the same for the four midland counties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the benefits this Bill will give to tourism and development committees. I would say the single most important local authority committee I have served on particularly when I was chairman of Westmeath County Council last year, was the county development team. The chairman of the County Council and the chairman of the VEC committee serve on the county development team in Westmeath. If I have a choice to serve again, when I get re-elected to the county council on 27 June, it would be on the county development team. It allows members an opportunity to plan for the future; anyone who can come up with the different plans and schemes can have a hearing with their IDA representative and other people on that committee. I welcome the setting up of these development committees. It is a tremendous step forward and this Bill gives us extra powers to do that.</P>
    <P>The midlands in the most underdeveloped region in relation to tourism but it has enormous potential. I represent the Lake District of Ireland, the beautiful Dún a Rí in County Cavan on the shores of Finea right up to Derravaragh, Lough Owel, Lough Lene and all the other lakes.

      <Col N="2163" /> There are proposals to strengthen procedures to prevent the abuse of section 4 motions, I can honestly say I never signed a section 4 motion since I became a member of Westmeath County Council in 1985. We had no section 4 motions from my electoral area. To my knowledge we only had two in the county in that time. It is healthy to have this provision available to deal with unforeseen circumstances or circumstances beyond the control of the public representative who is answerable to the public and has to seek re-election. I welcome the strengthening of procedures from the point of view of the section 4 motions used in the proper fashion and in the way intended by the legislators who passed the 1955 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that county managers will have to be re-appointed every seven years and that is a healthy thing. People are answerable to their chief executive and the chief executives, in this instance are the elected members of the local authorities. In Westmeath we have one of the best county managers in Ireland. He is a great executive; someone whom I looked up to when I was chairman; and would possibly employ in the morning if he was looking for employment elsewhere. We are very fortunate. On the other hand, as previous speakers have indicated this measure strengthens the hand for productivity and for efficiency. It ensures that no one will lose interest because he knows that at the end of his seven year term he has to account to his employers and seek re-appointment. I welcome that.</P>
    <P>Urban renewal was mentioned earlier. This is one of the greatest planks for re-election that the Minister of State, Deputy Connolly, can possible have in years to come. He will be remembered for his work on urban renewal as the late Donagh O'Malley is remembered for introducing free secondary education and a school transport system.</P>
    <P>This scheme has transformed areas where there was no growth; where there were isolated premises; isolated in every way. I should like to remind the House <Col N="2164" /> of the work in progress on the quays in Dublin from the Aisling Hotel to O'Connell Street. A friend of mine whom I met in Cannes in 1986 told me he would be filming in Dublin in two months time. I asked him why he had picked Dublin and he said the film was about the 1939-45 war and Dublin was the only part of the British Isles he knew of that had not been touched since the war. I remember mentioning that incident to a Minister for Finance, who is now leader of the major Opposition party and highlighting the problem to him. I am glad to see that our own Minister took this into account in the urban renewal Bill. I think 22 new buildings have been erected on that stretch of road over the past three years. This is a major growth area. People from the south and west who have to travel into the city via the quays get a good impression of Dublin when they see these developments. Areas throughout the country which were previously regarded as blackspots have been transformed with new buildings. These are regarded as growth areas which give employment.</P>
    <P>I want to put in a plug for Mullingar, the capital of the midlands. For some reason, I presume it is political, Mullingar does not have an urban renewal area. The Government should pay particular attention to Mullingar which has a great workforce with a good track record with trade unions. There are many young people living in that area who are looking for work. The people living there who are involved in industry deserve an opportunity to partake of the incentives available to every other town the size of Mullingar. The Minister lives close to Mullingar and he knows my views on this issue. I ask the Minister to include Mullingar in any further designation of urban renewal areas.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to delay the House further as many other Senators want to contribute to the debate. I welcome the Bill. Previous speakers have referred to their experiences over the years. I am looking forward to the local elections. My local authority worked as hard as they could over the past six years. We found it difficult to carry out our functions from <Col N="2165" /> 1985-87 as we did not have sufficient funding. However, plans began to come on stream from 1987-89 and we can now see the fruits of an effective Government and effective local authority members, most of whom are members of the Fianna Fáil Party. I look forward to the support of the electorate when we go to the polls on 27 June.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Is trua liom nach bhfuil an tAire féin i láthair mar tá an oiread sin rudaí maithe ráite faoi anocht go sílfeá go mbeadh cineál fáinne thart ar a chloigeann agus go mbronnfaí gradam naoimh ar an Aire Comhshaoil, an Teachta Flynn. Dá mbeadh sé thiar i gConamara nó thiar i gcuid dá chontae féin ní chuirfí aon fháinne timpeall a chloiginn in ómós don mhéid atá déanta aige sa réimse seo den Bhille Rialtais Áitiúil, ach chuirfí toirmeasc air faoi mar a chuirtear toirmeasc ar ghadhar nó ar chaora agus choinneofaí mar sin é go dtí go bhfeicfeadh sé lena shúile féin cé chomh dona is atá an córas rialtais áitiúil faoina cheannasaíocht, cé chomh dona is tá sé ag freastal ar mhuintir an iarthair i gcoitinne, agus ar mhuintir Chonamara go speisialta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bille ar bith a thagann os comhair an Tí seo, is cuma céard lena aghaidh é, bíonn tábhacht ar leith leis. Caithfimid glacadh leis go bhfuil an Bille áirithe seo atá os ár gcomhair, an Bille Rialtais Áitiúil, ar cheann de na Billí is tábhachtaí a d'fhéadfadh teacht faoinár mbráid. Baineann an Bille Rialtais Áitiúil leis na daoine a mbímid i gcónaí ag caint fúthu, is iad sin muintir na tuaithe agus muintir na mbailte lasmuigh de na cathracha. Is aisteach liom, Bille chomh tábhachtach sin, agus cáipéis chomh toirtiúil sin os ár gcomhair, nach bhfacamar é go dtí a sé a chlog tráthnóna. Maidir leis an Aire, tá seisean dulta tríd an gcáipéis go mion, tá an-staidéar déanta aige air agus dóthain comhairleoirí aige lena mhíniú dó céard atá ann, agus céard atá le rá aige. Ach muidne, níl tuairim dá laghad againn céard go bunúsach atá idir an dá chlúdach sin. Ní raibh aon am ceart againn le staidéar a dhéanamh air agus breithiúnas <Col N="2166" /> cuí a thabhairt.

Cuirfidh mé ar bhur súile daoibh an tráthchlár a chuir an tAire féin ann, ina n-abrann sé go gcaithfidh an Bille seo a bheith dulta tríd an Teach seo amárach, an seachtú lá déag den mhí seo ar a dhéanaí. Tá sé ag breathnú ar an am idir an seachtú lá déag den mhí seo agus an seachtú lá fichead de mhí an Mheithimh. Deir an tAire go gcaithfidh an Bille bheith ag an Uachtarán idir an seachtú lá déag agus an t-aonú lá fichead de Bhealtaine, sin ceithre la, agus caithfidh sé, ansin, bheith ag an Aire ar an dara lá fichead den mhí seo agus ag an gceann comhairimh sna comhairlí contae. Caithfidh seisean fógra a dhéanamh ar an gceathrú lá fichead chun go bhféadfadh na toghcháin bheith ann ar an seachtú lá fichead de mhí an Mheithimh. Sin cúig cinn de dhátaí idir seo agus sé seachtaine. Is Bille iontach tábhachtach é seo, agus an oiread sin ann a bhaineann le gnáthphobal na tíre agus seo muidne ag dul a dhéanamh reachtaíochta do na daoine seo agus gan aon am ceart againn chun é a phlé.

      <P>Ní hea, níl mé ag caint faoi dheich mbliana, tá mé ag caint faoi mhí nó dhó ar a laghad a thabhairt dúinn.

    <P>Níl ach reachtaíocht an-ghearr le déanamh anseo, ach deir an Bille seo, agus dúirt an tAire tráthnóna go gcaithfimid an chuid eile den reachtaíocht seo a thabhairt isteach an bhliain seo chugainn nó b'fheidir i gcionn deich mbliana nó níos <Col N="2167" /> déanaí. Más é sin an cineál Bille atá ann, agus is é go deimhin, beidh an toradh céanna ar an mBille seo faoin Aire Comhshaoil seo is a bhí ar an mBille a thug an tAire isteach i Rialtas Fhianna Fáil i 1961. Thug siad isteach an t-am sin Bille um Fhreagracht Phoiblí, nó the Public Liability Bill, agus seo 1991, 30 bliain tar éis dó dul tríd an dá Theach agus é bheith síithe ag an Uachtarán; ach níl an tAcht á fheidhmiú fós.

      <P>Bhí, ach tá mise ag caint faoin mBille a thug Fianna Fáil isteach i 1961, agus ag rá go ndúirt sibh faoin mBille céanna go mbeadh sé ina dhlí ar an gcéad lá de de mhí Aibreáin, 1967. Thóg sé sé bliana orthu an Bille a chur tríd, lena réiteach agus lena chur i bhfeidhm ar an gcéad lá d'Aibreán, lá na n-amadán. Tá sé fós sna statúidí agus níl sé á fheidhmiú. Tá mise ag rá go dtarlóidh an rud ceanann do go leor forálacha sa reachtaíocht reatha. Tá roinnt rudaí eile gur maith ann iad, ach bhíomar ag caint faoi atreorú &mdash; reform mar a deirtear i mBéarla &mdash; a thabhairt ar aghaidh. Nuair a tharla an Reformation in aimsir Luther agus iad ag iarraidh an Eaglais a chur ar an mbóthar ceart bhí fúthu rudaí móra a dhéanamh freisin ach thit siad ar an mbealach agus táimidne ar an mbealach céanna leis an mBille seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ní bheidh aon éifeacht, leis an gcuid is mó den Bhille seo. Bíodh go bhfuil moltaí deasa ann, ní fiú moladh bheith ann mura ndéantar é a fheidhmiú. Mar a deir an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Mair a chapaill agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;, &ldquo;Live horse and you will get grass&rdquo;. Tá meon deas ann, sentiments, mar a deirtear, ach ní Bille é sin, agus níl sé ag dul a freastal ar mhuintir na hÉireann. Is minic a chuirtear i leith rialtais áitiúil nach bhfuil an jab ceart á dhéanamh acu, a bheag ná a mhór, go bhfuil siad siléigeach ina gcuid oibre. Is minic a deirtear sin fúthú, rud atá fíor, agus sin <Col N="2168" /> ceann de na fáthanna go bhfuil mé andíomách faoin gcóras rialtais áitiúil atá ann faoi láthair. Mar shampla, tá an córas rialtais áitiúil freagrach as chúrsaí uisce agus ciallaíonn sé sin go gcaithfidh siad uisce ceart folláin a chur ar fáil don mhuintir atá faoina gcúram. Táimid ag dul chun cinn agus ag bunú go leor grúpscéimeanna le cúnamh, caithfidh mé a admháil, ón rialtas áitiúil. Bhí muintir na háite ar fad páirteach san obair, rud anmhaith, agus d'íoc an rialtas áitiúil 80 faoin gcéad den chostas agus d'íoc muintir na háite an 20 faoin gcéad eile. Scéim mhaith, inmholta a bhí ann. Ach anois, is é an aidhm agus an bunphrionsabal a bhí taobh thiar de seo ná, nuair a bheadh na grúpscéimeanna sin in ord agus ag obair go dtabharfadh an chomhairle contae dóibh. Rinneadh sin anseo agus ansiúd ach sa mhórchuid ní dhearnadh tada.</P>
    <P>Tá rialacha ag teacht ón Chomhphobal Eorpach, rialacha faoi chaighdeán an uisce atá le hól againn agus tá athruithe móra déanta ar na scéimeanna uisce. Níl siad faoin gcóras rialtais áitiúil, mar theip orthu siúd aire a thabhairt dóibh. Níl ar acmhainn na gcoistí uisce a cuireadh ar bun tada a dhéanamh leo. Mar sin, táimid anois fágtha leis na mílte grúpscéim uisce timpeall na tíre, gan aon treoir againn, gan aon airgead agus gan aon bhealach chun iad a fheabhsú agus a chur in oiriúint de réir rialacha an CE. Sin locht mór atá agamsa ar an gcomhairle chontae, is é sin ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil, an córas a deir Fianna Fáil go bhfuil sé chomh foirfe sin. Is rud bunúsach é uisce glan a bheith le hól againn. Rud eile atá go mór chun deiridh ó thaobh chohairlí contae de &mdash; agus arís tá an milleán ar an rialtas áitiúil agus ar an Rialtas dá réir &mdash; ná cúrsaí séarachais. Níl aon chóras séarachais faoin dtuath mar atá sna bailte móra. Táimid uilig ag brath ar dhabhach shéarachais. Is áit mhór é Conamara a bhfuil daonra mór ann ach tá an talamh chomh dona sin, idir thalamh portaigh agus thalamh carraigeach, nach bhfuil sé feiliúnach le haghaidh chúrsaí séarachais.</P>
    <P>Bhíomar ag caint faoi thithe a thógáil do na daoine. Is cuimhin liomsa gur impigh mé ar bhainisteoir Chomhairle <Col N="2169" /> Chontae na Gaillimhe agus ar an gcomhairle ocht mbliana ó shin, dul go dtí an Roinn Comhshaoil maidir le staidéar féidireachtaí agus mionscrúdú a dhéanamh chun a fháil amach cén chaoi ab fhearr le dabhach shéarachais a chur ar fáil in áiteanna ina raibh talamh portaigh nó talamh riascach, carraigeach nár fheil don ghnáthchóras. Sin cúram gur chóir a bheith ar rialtas áitiúil, rud nach ndearnadh riamh, agus táimid ag caint faoi fhreastal ar ghnáthphobal na tuaithe. Níor chuireamar, mar rialtas áitiúil ná mar rialtas lárnach, aon airgead riamh ar fáil le go bhféadfaí staidéar a dhéanamh ar na féidireachtaí maidir le dabhach shéarachais fheiliúnach a chur ar fáil sa chóras rialtais áitiúil. Níl aon trácht air sin anois. Táimid ag caint faoi thithe a thógáil agus gan aon deis againn dabhach shéarachais cheart a bheith againn sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tithíocht, rud eile atá go mór faoi cheannasaíocht na Roinne. Tá sé antábhachtach go mbeadh tithe ag chuile dhuine agus tá sé de dhualgas ar an chóras rialtais áitiúil agus ar na comhairlí contae tithíocht a chur ar fáil do chuile dhuine a bhfuil sé ag teastáil uathu. Tá iarrachtaí á ndéanamh, iarrachtaí atá fánach, gan chiall, gan mhaith. Tá na mílte duine ar fud na tíre seo agus gan aon teach oiriúnach acu&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Tá sé ceart agus lá ar bith teaspáinfidh mé don Seanadóir an liosta atá istigh ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe den mhéid duine atá ag iarraidh teach agus tá an oiread sin constaicí curtha sa bhealach orm ó thaobh nach bhfuil aon suíomh acu; nuair atá suíomh ach níl an suíomh feiliúnach, ní féidir dabhach séarachais a chur ann. Ní féidir an teach a thógáil ansin mar go mbeadh sé ró-chostasach ar an gcomhairle chontae an teach a thógáil mar gheall ar an suíomh atá ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá Seanadóirí áirithe ag caint mar go mbeadh cineál &ldquo;tunnel vision&rdquo; acu. Tá siad ag breathnú amach ar Chontae Ros Comáin agus na háiteacha sin go bhfeiceann siad macra méith na Mumhan agus macra méith láir na tíre, áit a bhfuil <Col N="2170" /> garraí bhreátha agus torthaí maithe ann, ach níl siad ag breathnú siar ar Chonamara beag no mór, no taobh thiar den tSionna áit a bhfuil droch-thalamh agus gach sórt eile, agus an méid airgid a chaitheas an duine bocht le suíomh a réiteach taobh thiar i gConamara agus áiteacha mar sin ní fiú tada an deontas ina aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Tógfaidh mé duine ar bith agaibh chuig na háiteacha seo. Tá liosta déanta amach agam agus beidh mé ag foilsiú liostaí chomh maith le griangrafanna. Tá breis agus 100 teach soleagaithe &mdash; demountable homes &mdash; i gContae na Gaillimhe. Agus níl iontu ach prochóga d'áiteacha. Tá daoine ina gconaí sna tithe seo agus is mór an náire é go bhfuil a leithéid ann.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam, agus molaim go mór, ar an dtaobh eile de'n scéal, go bhfuil scéim foilsithe. Agus tá sé luaite anseo ag an Aire, sé sin, faoin Social Housing. Tá sé tagaithe nó tá sé le teacht ach tá súil agam nach ar nós chuile shórt eile, mar tá suim ar leith agam ann.</P>
    <P>Chuamar síos chomh fada le áit an Aire Stáit féin, go dthí Rathdowney, bliain ó shin ag breathnú ar Social Home Structures á ndéanamh agus molaim go mór an tAire dá bharr seo. Rinne mé staidéar air agus tá mé ag obair le daoine eile le go mbeidh scéim cosúil leis againn i gceanntar an Spidéil. Tá sé seo cosúil lenár ngrúpscéimeanna uisce: muintir an phobail féin, an chomhairle chontae agus an Roinn Chomhshaoil &mdash; an gnáth &ldquo;three-tier&rdquo; system &mdash; ag obair le tithe a chur ar fail, do sheandaoine agus, mar adeir an Béarla, &ldquo;the disadvantaged&rdquo;. Scéim íontach maith í, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil lena haghaidh.</P>
    <P>Tá méadú airgid ann i mblianna ach cheana féin chuir mise ceist faoi cathain an mbeadh an scéim seo againne réidh. Deir siad go mb'fhéidir go dtógfaidh sé dhá bhliain nó trí nó ceithre bliana, níl a fhios againn. Ach idir an dá linn tá seandaoine amuigh ansin ina gcónaí leo féin, na seantithe ag titim anuas orthu agus tá na &ldquo;demountable homes&rdquo; seo, mar a dúirt mé cheana, chomh náiriúl sin nach cóir go mbeabh aon bhaint ag rialtas áitiúil nó Rialtas lárnach lena leithéid. Tá céim tugtha ar aghaidh anois agus tá súil agam <Col N="2171" /> go leanfar de seo agus tríd an Bille seo go mbeidh airgead le fáil lena dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá faitíos orm nach mbeidh an t-airgead ar fáil agus go mbeimid fós ag fanacht agus gan na tithe á dtógáil. Deireann an tAire sa Bhille seo go bhfuil sé ag caint faoi &ldquo;support grant&rdquo; le haghaidh bóithre agus tá sé ardaithe ó £23 mhilliún i 1986 go dtí £68 milliún i 1991. Sin ardú iontach, níl dabht ar bith faoi sin, ach níl sé le feiceáil. Níl a fhios agam cá bhfuil an t-airgead sin ag dul. Tá rud amháin cinnte: níl sé á chaitheamh i gConamara. Tá chuile bhóthar ann lán de phoill, agus táimíd tinn, tuirseach ag caint fúthu. Ar nós airgid do na tithe, tá na bóithre chomh dona sin anois gur cuma cé mhéid airgid ar an scála atá curtha ar fáil, ní bheidh deireadh sroiste go deo againn agus ní thiocfaimid go dtí an pointe go bhféadaimid a rá go bhfuil na fadhbanna sin go léir socraithe: ceist na mbóthar, ceist na tithíochta agus ceist an séarachais, agus pleann leagtha amach dá réir sin againn. Ní fheicim ag tarlú é. Ní fheicim ach go bhfuil caint ann go mbeidh a leithéid ann ach, thairis sin, ní dóigh liom go dtiocfaidh tada.</P>
    <P>Deir an tAire anseo go bhfuil siad ag dul i mbun na n-oibreacha seo &ldquo;de réir a chéile&rdquo;. Luann sé mar shampla an chaoi ar chuireamar airgead ar fáil le haghaidh na dtithe cúirte. Tá sé thar am an obair sin a dhéanamh mar bhí na foirgnimh chomh dona, chomh brocach sin. Aon teacht isteach a bhí as na cúirteanna sin ní raibh sé ag dul don chomhairle chontae. Bhí sé ag dul go dtí an Rialtas lárnach. Bhí teach cúirte againn i nGaillimh agus bhíodh Ardchúirt ann. Bhíodh na milliúin punt reatha ag dul tríd an chúirt sin in aghaidh na bliana. Cá raibh an t-airgead sin ag dul? Go Baile Átha Cliath. Ag an am gcéanna bhí dualgas ar an gcomhairle chontae é a choinneáil deisithe, péinteáilte agus chuile shórt eile a bhain leis. Tá athrú tagaithe ar sin agus is maith ann an t-athrú ach níl ann ach athrú beag, fánach, bídeach. Freisin, tá mian eile san Acht seo, go mbeadh airgead na gcomhairlí contae uilig ar leibhéal níos cothramaí. Tá súil agam go <Col N="2172" /> ndéanfar é sin agus go mbeidh sé le feiceáil go ndéanfar é, mar muna ndéantar é, agus is cinnte nach bhfuil sé á dhéanamh, beidh contaethe thar contaethe eile fágtha ar an ngannchuid.</P>
    <P>An rud is mó a chuireann iontas orm faoi ráiteas an Aire ná go ndeireann sé lom amach nach bhfuil baint ag an mBille seo le cúrsaí airgid. An bhfaca Seanadóir ariamh Bille chomh tábhachtach leis seo ag dul tríd an Teach seo, agus go ndéarfaí nach raibh aon bhaint aige le cúrsaí airgid? Nach shin é bun agus barr agus chuile shórt a bhaineann leis an gcóras rialtais áitiúil mar atá sé, nach bhfuil pingin acu le cúrsaí a chur chun cinn nó an dá phingin acu le cur in aghaidh a chéile. Ní mise atá á rá agus ní hiad na comhairlí contae atá á rá. Is iad na bainisteoirí contae atá á rá, an lucht riaracháin. Má ghlaoim ar an mbainisteoir nó ar an rúnaí nó ar an bhfear atá i mbun tithíochta agus má dheirimse leis, &ldquo;Tá an bóthar seo go dona nó an teach seo go dona nó tá an droichead seo briste&rdquo;, an bhfuil a fhios ag Seanadóirí cén fhreagra a thugann siad dúinn anois? &ldquo;Faigh an t-airgead dúinn agus déanfaimid duit é. Sin an freagra oifigiúil atáimid á fháil on mbainistíocht. &ldquo;Tá an oiread brú orm&rdquo;, deir sé, agus is é an freagra gonta, gearr atá le fáil ag chuile dhuine a chuireann ceist ar an gcomhairle chontae le jab ar bith a dhéanamh: &ldquo;Faigh an t-airgead agus déanfaimídne an obair&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Sin é an fáth nach raibh an Freasúra, Fine Gael, sásta le bheith páirteach i réiteach an Bhille seo, mar nach raibh an Rialtas sásta cúrsaí airgid a chur san áireamh agus an Bille seo á ullmhú. Tá an toradh le feiceáil anois. Tá sé ráite againne, tá sé ráite ag an Aire agus tá sé sa Bhille go mbeidh an córas rialtais áitiúil ag lorg luach a gcuid airgid, rud is cóir, is é sin, ma bhíonn punt le caitheamh acu is cóir go gcaithfear é ar an mbealach is fearr agus is éifeachtaí chun cúnamh a thabhairt agus toradh dá réir a bheith ar an gcaiteachas. An pointe atá mé á dhéanamh ná go mbeadh sé cinnte ón méid oibre a dhéanfadh an chomhairle contae, agus an modh riaracháin san áireamh, go raibh caoi á cur ar na bóithre <Col N="2173" /> beaga bailte, is cuma cén áit sa tír a bhfuil siad.</P>
    <P>Cuir i gcás go leagtar go gcosnóidh sé £20,000 le píosa beag bóthair a dhéanamh, sin an meastachán a dhéanfaidh an t-innealtóir contae. Ach, bíonn aguisín leis, go gcaithfidhmidne, an chomhairle contae, é a dhéanamh. Dar liomsa, sin é an fáth go bhfuil laige mhór sa chóras. sin é an fáth go bhfuil go leor airgid á chur ar fáil, ach nílimid ag fáil luach na bpinginí ón airgead sin mar go bhfuil an seanchóras ann mar a bhí riamh, seanchóras faoina gcaithfidh an chomhairle contae iad féin an obair a dhéanamh. Tá a fhios ag an Teach uilig agus ag an saol Fódhlach nach bhfuil siad inchomórtais leis an gcomhlacht príobháideach, agus dá gcuirfeadh an chomhairle contae deisiú na mbóithre amach ar tender, nó dá lorgódh siad tairiscintí ó dhaoine éagsúla, d'fhéadfaí an jab a dhéanamh, ní amháin níos fearr ach níos sciobtha, agus rud atá fíorthábhachtach, go bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh i bhfad níos saoire. Dá ndéanfaí i bhfad níos saoire é seasann sé le réasún go bhféadfaí i bhfad níos mó mílte bóthair a dheisiú de réir a chéile.</P>

      <P>Mura bhfuil Seanadóirí sásta cead a thabhairt dom dul ar aghaidh, caithfidh mé suí síos. Nuair a bheidh an Seanadóir ar an gcomhairle contae an mhí seo chugainn, le cúnamh Dé, beidh <Col N="2174" /> sé in ann é a dhéanamh agus cuid againn ag breathnú isteach air.</P>
      <P>Rachaidh mé ar aghaidh go dtí forálacha sa Bhille a bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag baint leo, agus ar chuir an tAire anbhéim orthu. Tá mé ar aon intinn leis an Seanadóir Tras Honan faoi seo, mar táimid ag trácht ar na réigiúin. Tá sé i gceist amach anseo réigiúin a chur ar bun. I dtaobh tíre is againne tá sé i gceist cathair na Gaillimhe, Contae na Gaillimhe, Maigh Eo agus Ros Comáin a chur isteach in aon réigiún amháin. Nuair a bheidh siad in aon réigiún amháin ba mhaith liom go mbeadh an tAire in ann a insint dúinn céard a bheidh ar bun acu.</P>
      <P>Beidh comhairleoirí contae ó na trí chontae agus ó Bhardas chathair na Gaillimhe ar an gcoiste réigiúnach seo ach ní bheidh aon chumhachtaí breise acu. Tá taithí againn go léir ar an RDO a bhí ann idir Gaillimh agus Maigh Eo. Cineál réigiúnachais a bhí ansin. Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Seanadóir Standún a labhair romham agus nocht sé drochmheas ar na cruinnithe a bhíodh ann idir an dá réigiún, is é sin, idir an dá chontae. Bhí sé ag maíomh, agus ag caitheamh anuas, go mbíodh an chuid ba mhó de na cruinnithe i nGaillimh agus gur fágadh Maigh Eo amach ar an ngannchuid. Is dócha, mar sin, nuair a bhunófar na réigiúin seo go mbeidh lárionad ann an chuid is mó den am. An mbeidh sé i Maigh Eo, i Ros Comáin nó i nGaillimh, nó cá mbeidh sé suite sa chaoi is go mbeimid in ann freastal ar na cruinnithe?</P>
      <P>Bhí iarracht de sin ann cheana leis an RDO, na Regional Development Organisations sin. Cá bhfuil siad inniu? Tá siad caite i dtraipisí, imithe ar nós na bhfáinleog a théann go dtí an Afraic Theas. Imíonn siad agus tagann siad ar ais gan éifeacht ar bith iontu. Tá mise eolach ar na RDOs sin mar bhí mé i mo bhall díobh agus is cuimhin liom gur fhostaíomar comhlacht cáiliúil le plean mór a ullmhú, plean mór eacnamaíochta agus turasóireachta agus le haghaidh na réigiún seo, ach céard a tharla dó? Tá sé ar na seilfeanna in oifigí na gcomhairlí contae i Maigh Eo agus i nGaillimh agus é ag bailiú deannaigh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Céard atáimid ag dul a dhéanamh <Col N="2175" /> anois? Táimid ag dul a thabhairt isteach réigiúin eile le go dtarlóidh an rud ceannann céanna arís. B'fhearr go mór, in áit a bheith ag cur leis an réigiún go bhfágfaí i leataobh ar fad é nuair nach féidir an obair a dhéanamh i gceart. Tá siad á dhéanamh i gceart i dtíortha eile, mar an Fhrainc, mar shampla, áit a bhfuil an struchtúr ceart ann agus maoiniú dá réir acu. Ach nílimid ach ag cur córais ar bun anseo le hainm a thabhairt ar rud nach bhfuil aon éifeacht leis. An rud is mó a chuireann díomá orm maidir leis an mBille seo ná, na comhairlí ceantair nó na fo-chomhairlí contae a bheidh ann; cuirfear ar an méar fhada iad, gan aon aird a thabhairt orthu. Nach aisteach an rud é freisin, ar nós gach ruda eile, nuair a thagann siad go Baile Átha Cliath socraítear nach gcuirfear ar an méar fhada iad.</P>
    <P>Tá sé ráite sa Bhille go mbunófar trí chomhairle contae nua: ceann i bhFine Gall, ceann i nDún Laoghaire agus ceann i mBaile Átha Cliath Theas, agus tá an reachtaíocht á socrú sa chaoi is go mbeidh sé ann. Níl mé á cháineadh, tá mé á mholadh, mar is rud maith é. Nach aisteach gur féidir é a dhéanamh i mBaile Átha Cliath ach nach féidir é a dhéanamh in aon chuid eile den tír, go gcaithfear sin a chur ar an méar fhada agus nach ndéanfar é?</P>

Má tá áit sa tír is mó go bhféadfaí é sin a chur ag obair gan mórán stró, is é Contae na Gaillimhe an áit sin; d'fhéadfaí an Ghaeltacht, nó siar ón Choirib, a thógáil mar aonad agus Oileáin Árann bheith istigh leis, in ionad bheith istigh in áit eile ar fad nach mbaineann leis an Ghaeltacht, ó thaobh rialtais áitiúil de. D'fhéadfaí aonad a bhunú ansin agus tá mé ag caint de réir mo thaithí féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cur leis seo ar bhealach eile, an spreagadh a fuair mé ó chuairt a thug mé ar bhaile bheag sa Fhrainc cúpla seachtain ó shin, agus a dhéanann cúpláil <Col N="2176" /> leis an Spidéal. Chuir sé iontas agus áthas orm, agus bhain mé lán mo shúl as an gcaoi a raibh an córas rialtais áitiúil ag feidhmiú sa cheantar sin. Sin é cuspóir an Bhille ach níl ann ach smaoineamh an seo.</P>
    <P>Bhí an smaoineamh sin ag Airí cheana féin, bhí sé ann deich mbliana ó shin, tá an smaoineamh ann fós ach níl sé léirithe sa Bhille seo. Sa bhaile beag seo sa Fhrainc a raibh mé ar cuairt ann ní raibh i gceist ach daonra 2,000 duine; bhí maor agus leasmhaor ann, póilín amháin agus triúr fostaithe le caoi a chur ar na bóithre agus ar an scoil, agus beirt eile san oifig. B'in an méid a bhí ann. Bhí airgead á fháil acu siúd&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Pól Ó Foighil</NameTxt>
      <P>Bhí seachtar ann don cheantar beag sin. Bhí airgead á fháil acu ón rialtas láir i bParas, ón réigiún, ón chontae, agus bhailigh siad féin airgead. Sin ceithre bhealach a bhí acu le maoiniú a fháil. Bhí an baile sin go hálainn, leagtha amach go deas faoi chóras rialtais áitiúil agus bhí chuile shórt ar bun sa réigiún beag sin. Sin é an córas a ba chóir a bheith á phlé againn anocht agus sin é an córas a ba cheart a bheith ann. Tá mé an-díomách nach bhfuil an córas sin i bhfeidhm anois. Labhraíomar ar alt 4 agus d'fhéadfainn, b'fhéidir, leathuair a chloig a chaitheamh leis ach tá mé ag ceapadh nach dtabharfaí cead dom. Is maith liom gur coinníodh alt 4 agus d'airigh mé daoine ar an taobh eile den Teach, ag rá, &ldquo;Bainimid le contae agus ní gá dúinn riamh alt 4 a chur i bhfeidhm agus a úsáid.&rdquo; Is eisleamáir don saol iad. Thiar i gConamara baineadh úsáid as alt 4 go mion minic agus tá mise ag rá gur ghá é a dhéanamh, agus beidh gá lena dhéanamh. Go dtí go mbeimid in ann, sa chóras rialtais áitiúil, áiseanna a chur ar fáil ar nós séarachais, uisce, mhéadú agus fhorbairt suíomh i gcoitinne, beidh gá lena leithéid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa chéad chás tugtar cead le forbairt a dhéanamh i ngarraí amháin agus ní thugtar cead sa chéad gharraí eile, ar fháthanna éagsúla, ach is é an bunfháth céanna <Col N="2177" /> atá leo go léir. Bíodh go bhfuil trí cheathrú de na vótaí ag teastáil le halt a 4 a chur i bhfeidhm is cuma, cé acu an tríú cuid nó an trí cheathrú cuid, is maith liom go bhfuil sé fós fágtha ann. D'fhéadfainn go leor a rá faoi theorainneacha chomhairlí contae agus vótáil. Sin cuid de na smaointe a bhí agam, a Chathaoirligh, agus bhí go leor smaointe eile agam ach tá mé a cheapadh gur cheart dom cuid de mo chuid ama a thabhairt do mo bheirt chomhleacaithe anseo agus duine nó beirt ar an taobh eile. Idir an dá linn, tá súil agam nuair a bheidh an reachtaíocht seo ina dlí nach ndéanfar dearmad de, faoi mar a rinneadh i gcás na reachtaíochta i 1961.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Is iomaí caint atá déanta faoin mBille seo agus is iomaí caint a dhéanfar, ach ba mhaith liomsa díriú ar chúpla rud ginearálta maidir leis an mBille. An chéad rud a ba mhaith liom a rá ná go bhfuil mé tinn tuirseach de dhaoine ag rá go bhfuil an Bille seo ag tabhairt an iomarca cumhachta don Aire. Má táimid ag dul ag athrú struchtúr rialtais áitiúil sa tír seo níl ach bealach amháin chun é sin a dhéanamh agus sin an bealach atá sé á dhéanamh. Dá mbeifí ag fanacht le chuile mhionriail agus mhionathrú a chur i bhfeidhm trí mhionreachtaíocht bheimis ag fanacht go lá Philib a' chleite. Is é an rud ciallmhar le déanamh ná an tAcht a athrú sa chaoi is go mbeidh cumhacht ag an Aire na hathruithe is gá a dhéanamh de réir a chéile. Tá sé blianta blianta fada ó cuireadh Páipéar Bán ar fáil, sílim sa bhliain 1961, maidir le cúrsaí rialtais áitiúil, agus ó shin, níor tháinig aon athrú ar an scéal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is rud simplí, bunúsach, daonlathach, cumhacht a thabhairt d'Aire rudaí a athrú. Mar a fheicimse an scéal, is minic go mbíonn an Teach seo sásta cumhachtaí móra leathana a thabhairt d'údaráis neamhspleácha nach bhfuil freagrach do dhuine ar bith, agus níl siad sásta na cumhachtaí céanna a thabhairt do na hAirí atá tofa ag Dáil Éireann agus do Rialtas gur féidir a bhriseadh má tá muintir na Dála sásta nach bhfuil siad ag comhlíonadh a ndualgas i gceart, agus cinnte a chaithfidh dul faoi bhráid an phobail <Col N="2178" /> chuile chúig bliana. Mar sin, creidim nach raibh ann ach scare tactics den chineál is measa an rud seo a bhí á rá ag Fine Gael, go riabh an iomarca cumhachta á tabhairt don Aire. Le fírinne a dhéanamh, creidim go bhfuill a fhios acu ina gcroithe istigh go bhfuil beart á dhéanamh, go bhfuil athruithe ag teacht agus go bhfuil an Bille seo ag dul a chur athruithe ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil go sciobthe. Go mórmhór, chuir sé an-iontas orm cáineadh a bheith á dhéanamh ar an moladh atá ann maidir le coimisiún le comhairle a chur ar an Aire maidir leis an ceantair thoghcháin. Faoi láthair, tá an ceart sin go hiomlán ag an Aire gach comhairle a ghlacadh ó dhuine ar bith, agus mar sin, shílfeá go mbeadh siad thar a bheith sásta go gcaithfidh sé anois comhairle a ghlacadh ó choimisiún neamhspleách. Bhí gá le hathrú ar rialtas áitiúil. Tá tús á chur ag an mBille seo leis an athrú sin agus creidim go bhfeicfimid anois ag teacht ón Rialtas seo, agus ó Rialtais eile a thiocfaidh ina dhiaidh, sraith de Bhillí a chuirfidh athrú ó bhonn ar an gcóras rialtais áitiúil. Tá roinnt forálacha thar a bheith tábhachtach sa Bhille seo. Tá forálacha, mar shampla, le fáil réidh leis an riail <i>ultra vires</i> a bhí ina dhiabhal cheart maidir le cúrsaí rialtais áitiúil. Tá forálacha eile ann a thabharfaidh cumhachtaí oifigiúla do chomhairle contae le representations a dhéanamh ar eagraíochtaí Stáit éagsúla. Is maith ann do na rudaí seo mar ba cheart go mbeadh dhá fheidhm ag comhairle contae ar bith, is é sin an fheidhm a gcuid gnótha a reachtáil agus a riarú go ceart; agus an fheidhm eile, ar ndóigh, labhairt ar son na bpobal sna contaetha ina bhfuil siad suite.</P>
    <P>Is fearr go mbeadh dream tofa mar sin ag déanamh na hoibre sin seachas dream nach bhfuil freagrach do dhuine ar bith agus nach bhfuil daonlathas ar bith ag baint leo. Thagair an Seanadóir Ó Foighil do go leor rudaí agus ba mhaith liom roinnt rudaí a lua ar thagair sé dóibh.</P>
    <P>Thiocfainn go hiomlán leis an Seanadóir Ó Foighil go bhfuil fadhb mhillteanach againn i gConamara maidir le cúrsaí bóithre. Mar atá luaithe ag an Aire in a óráid, agus mar atá ráite go mion minic, ceann de na fadhbanna atá ann faoi <Col N="2179" /> bhóithre ná an easpa airgid a bhí ann i lár na n-ochtóidí. Mar shampla, i mbliain 1986, má fhágtar as na bóithre náisiúnta den chéad agus den dara grád, caitheadh £23 mhillúin i rith na bliana sin go hiomlán.</P>
    <P>I mbliana táimid ag caint ar thrí oiread an mhéid airgid sin. Thiocfainnse leis go hiomlán nach bhfuil toradh an airgid sin le feiceáil. Thiocfainnse leis nach féidir bóithre Chonamara a thaisteal go sásúil. Tá fhios ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil go mbímse ag taisteal na mbóithre céanna sin lá agus oíche. Tá sé an-éasca don iománaí ar an gclaí a bheith ag tabhairt amach faoi chuile shórt, ach tá sé i bhfad níos deacra cuid de na fadhbanna seo a réiteach. Ceann de na fabhbanna is mó atá le sárú ag an Rialtas seo ná an fhaillí a déanadh i lár na n-ochtóidí ar na bóithre sin, an caoi a ligeadh chun donais iad ceal cothabhála, agus anois go gcaithfimidne dul agus iad a dheisiú ó bhun.</P>
    <P>Níl ach bealach amháin, dar liomsa, le díriú ar cheist na mbóithre. Agus sé sin go ndéanfaí scrúdú iomlán ar chuile shórt a bhaineann le cúrsaí bóithre chontae. Bhéinnse i bhfábhar go pearsanta go mbeadh plean réitithe ag an gcomhairle chontae a bhreathnódh amach, ní chun tuilleadh airgid a fháil amháin &mdash; tá gá le sin &mdash; ach a bhreathnódh chomh maith ar chúrsaí cothbhála, atá ligthe i ndearmad go hiomlán ag comhairlí contae áirithe; a bhreathnódh ar an ábhar atá á úsáid, ar an bpraghas atá á íoc ar an ábhar, ar an innealra agus ar an treallamh atá á úsáid.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Foighil an cheist maidir leis an obair a chur amach ar chonradh. Níl aon chosc ar sin a dhéanamh i láthair na h-uaire. Is rud é sin go mbéinnse go mór i bhfábhar, mar creidim go bhféadfaí cuid den obair a dhéanamh níos éifeachtaí ar an gcaoi sin. Tá riar mhaith oibre eile a bhféadfadh a bheith ar bhonn i bhfad níos tairbhí ná ag na hoibrithe atá fostaithe go buan ag na comhairlí contae. Ba cheart do chuile comhairle chontae daoine a fhostú go síoraí seasta, mar atá i gcuid de na contaethe atá teorannach do chontae na Gaillimhe, chun dul thart ag deisiú poill <Col N="2180" /> de réir mar a éiríonn siad, ag glanadh draineachaí agus ag coinneáil uisce de bhóithre. Ceann de na fadhbanna is measa sa chontae sin thiar againne ná an méid uisce a thagann trasna bhóithre agus an méid réabadh agus scrios a dhéanann an t-uisce céanna.</P>
    <P>Ba chóir do na comhairlí contae tabhairt faoi phleanáil cuimsitheach agus glacadh leis an saoirse atá tugtha dóibh ag rialtas Fhianna Fáil. Tá sé fíor nach raibh saoirse ag na comhairlí contae cúpla bliain ó shin a rogha rud a dhéanamh leis an airgead a tugtaí dóibh le haghaidh bóithre chontae, ach níl sé sin fíor anois. Tá iomlán saoirse acu anois airgead an block-grant a chaitheamh de réir mar a thograíonn siad féin. Go minic úsáidtear cineál leithscéil &mdash; ní féidir linn seo a dhéanamh nó ní féidir linn seo a amh &mdash; mar go bhfuil sé níos éasca sin a rá ná aghaidh a thabhairt ar na fadhbanna agus dul agus iad a réiteach. Caithfimid a bheith macánta agus oscailte agus caithfimid labhairt amach faoi sin.</P>
    <P>Tá saoirse ag na comhairlí contae agus tá sin ráite go minic ag an Aire cé go mb'fhéidir nár chuala an Seanadóir Ó Foighil é. Ba cheart dó eolas a chur ar na fíricí. Ceart go leor tagann moltaí i memos ón Roinn Comhshaoil go dtí na comhairlí contae ach níl aon cheangal ar na comhairlí cloí leis na moltaí sin. Is féidir leo dul agus an t-airgead a chaitheamh ar an mbealach a thograíonn siad féin.</P>
    <P>Luaigh an Seanadóir Ó Foighil tithíocht. Cinnte tá fadhbanna tithíochta ann. Tá fadhbanna tithíochta i gcathair agus i gcontae na Gaillimhe.</P>

      <P>Cén fáth?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>An fáth go bhfuil an fhadhb sin ann ná gur bhunaigh an Comhrialtas scéim a chosain £250 milliún ar an dtír seo agus a chuir bunáite an airgid ar fáil do dhaoine a raibh airgead acu cheana agus a d'fhág na bochtáin gan tithe. Sin bunús na faidhbe atá acu. Mar eolas don Seanadóir Ó Foighil, caitheadh £20 milliún anuraidh, de réir mar a thuigimse, ar an scéim sin cé gur chuir Fianna Fáil deireadh leis in 1987, agus caithfear £4 <Col N="2181" /> mhilliún i mbliana ar an scéim ceanann céanna. Dá mbeadh an £20 milliún sin againn anuraidh le tithe chomhairle contae a dheisiú, le caoi a chur ar shean tithe do shean daoine agus fáil reidh leis na demountables is iontach an obair a bhéadh déanta anuraidh. Bhí an t-airgead sin caite agaibhse agus muidne a d'íoc na billí. Sin an chaoi a raibh sé agus is fíor spéisiúil an rud é go raibh an tAire in ann i mbliana, mar go bhfuil deireadh go hiomlan leis an scéim sin anois, scéim nua tithíochta a chur faoi bhráid an phobail. Creidimse féin nach dtuigtear an scéim sin go forleathan agus nach bhfuil sé léite ag go leor daoine, ach nuair a bheidh sé i bhfeidhm go homlán creidim go bhfeicfear go mbeidh sé ar an rud is réabhlóidí a déanadh ó thaobh tithíochta de le fada an lá.</P>
      <P>Tá bun-phrionsabal amháin sa phlean seo, sé sin go mba cheart go mbéadh úinéireacht ag an gcuid is mó de na daoine sa tír seo agus is féidir ar a gcuid tithe féin. An dara phrionsabal atá ann &mdash; agus rud atá mé féin an-tógtha leis &mdash; ná go gcuirfear deireadh leis na ghettoes a bhí á dtógáil agus nach dtógfar na scéimeanna móra milteanacha seo ina raibh daoine i dtithe chomhairle chontae in aon cheantar amháin agus daoine de aicmí eile i gceantair eile sna bailte agus sna cathracha. Sin an polasaí is measa go bhféadfaí a leanúint. Ceann de na buntáistí, dar liomsa, a bheith i do chónaí amuigh faoin dtír ná go bhfuil chuile dhuine measctha, fite fuaite trína chéile agus nach bhfuil aicmeachas á chothú ag an Stát ar an gcaoi sin. Tá an-mholadh ag dul don Aire as deireadh a chur leis an sean-pholasaí a bhí ann agus díriú anois ar an oiread daoine agus is féidir a spreagadh lena gcuid tithe féin a thógáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Creidim go mbeidh an-tarraingt ag daoine ar an shared ownership option. Cuirfidh sé sin réabhlóid ar bun mar go gcuirfidh sé ar chumas go leor daoine óga a gcuid tithe féin a thógáil ar chostas réasúnta agus an leath eile den teach a cheannach amach ar ball. Ba mhaith liom a lua chomh maith, go bhfuil sé mar pholasaí nach dtógfar aon demountables eile. Is scannal i gContae na Gaillimhe <Col N="2182" /> iad na demountables céanna. Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach nach dtógfar aon cheann eile agus go gcuirfear deireadh de réir a chéile leis an gcuid atá ann. Mar chéim chuige sin i bplean nua an Aire tá scéim nua ann gur féidir suas le £10,000 a chaitheamh ag maisiú sean tithe do shean daoine, ag cur leithris agus seomra folcaidh iontu agus ag cur díon agus caoi orthu, seachas a bheith ag athrú na ndaoine amach as na tithe sin agus á gcur isteach sna demountables.</P>
    <P>Mar sin, is féidir a bheith cinnte nuair a bheidh an plean seo á fheidhmiú nach mbeidh daoine ag dul isteach i demountables níos mó. De réir a chéile beifear in ann díriú ar na daoine atá iontu cheana féin a chur i dtithe eile. Rud eile atá antábhachtach, agus rud a lua mise i bhfad ó shin ach nár chuala mé mórán daoine eile i nGaillimh ag caint air, agus is é sin ná go mba cheart go mbeadh sé mar pholasaí leithreas agus seomra folcaidh a chur sna tithe comhairle contae ar fad. Is cúis ríméid dúinne sa taobh seo den Teach go bhfuil airgead curtha ar fáil ag an Aire i mbliana len aghaidh sin.</P>
    <P>Sin iad na rudaí a bhaineann le rialtas áitiúil. Déantar dearmad go bhfuil airgead á chur ar fáil ag an Rialtas chuige sin faoi láthair. Is rud bunúsach go mbeadh leithreas agus seomra folcaidh i gcuile theach sa tír. In ionad a bheith ag caint ar na rudaí seo tá Fianna Fáil ag déanamh beart de réir a mbriathair. Cuireann sé iontas orm ansin daoine a fheiceáil ag casaoid faoi na rudaí sin, ag tabhairt amach agus ag rá nach bhfuil na rudaí seo á dhéanamh. Ag dul siar ar bhóithre, chuir sé iontas orm nuair a chuala mé an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag rá le gairid nárbh cheart airgead a chaitheamh ar Dhroichead Átha Luain. Agus chuir sé níos mó ná iontais orm nuair a thuig mé go raibh sé ar Údarás tionsclaíochta.</P>

      <P>Ní dúirt mé a leithéid. Dúirt mé, fair play do Athlone go raibh an t-airgead á chaitheamh ann.</P>

      <P>Bhí tú ag rá go mba cheart an t-airgead sin a chaitheamh i gConamara. An pointe a bheadh agamsa ná go gcaithfear na bóithre beaga agus <Col N="2183" /> na bóithre réigiúnacha a dheisiú ach go gcaithfear na bóithre náisiúnta a dhéanamh chomh maith. An dream is mó a bhrú Droichead Átha Luain ná an dream is faide siar. Mar thionsclóir cuireann sé iontas orm go bhfuil fear atá ar bhord atá ag iarraidh tionscal a chur ar aghaidh san iarthar ag rá nach bhfuil tábhacht i nDroichead Átha Luain do mhuintir an iarthair. Ní do Áth Luain atá an droichead tábhachtach ach don dream atá thiar, dream a bheidh ag iarraidh a gcuid earraí a thógáil ón iarthar isteach to dtí na margaí, isteach go dtí na calafoirt agus amach go margaí na hEorpa agus na Breataine.</P>
      <P>Molaim an plean a foilsíodh i dtús na bliana maidir le bóithre náisiúnta ach caithfimid dlús a chur leis an bplean sin. Caithfimid tuilleadh a dhéanamh má táimid chun na fadhbanna atá ag an dream is faide siar againn a shárú. Dream iad sin atá ag iarraidh teacht aniar aduaidh ar na fadhbanna seo &mdash; fadhbanna a bhaineann le droch-bhóithre agus atá ag iarraidh iomaíocht leis an dream ar an gcósta thoir. Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach dúinne thiar go dtógfaí na bóithre náisiúnta agus go mbeadh deis againn na hearraí a thógáil amach as an gceantar againne agus earraí eile a thabhairt isteach. Tá na bhóithre seo níos tábhachtaí domsa mar dhuine atá ina chónaí thiar ná mar atá siad do dhaoine atá ina gcónaí i gcathair Bhaile Átha Cliath agus nach dtéann siar ach uair nó dhó sa bhliain. Is polaitíocht den chuid is measa de daoine a chloisteáil ag rá nach ceart airgead a chaitheamh ar na bóithre móra náisiúnta. Caithfimid féachaint leis an dá rud a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí chomhairle contae i gcoitinne agus maidir le alt 4 déarfainn é seo le dream ar bith agus fiú le comhairleoirí Fhianna Fáil, ba cheart gur cumhacht é section 4 a bhainfí usáid as go hannamh. Ceann de na fadhbanna a éiríonn sa tír seo ná go mbaintear feidhm as cumhachtaí áirithe ró-mhinic. Is ceart an oiread cumhachta agus is féidir a thabhairt do chomhairlí contae. Ach maidir le alt 4, má tá a leithéid de instrument ag teastáil ó chomhairle contae go <Col N="2184" /> rialta, sílim féin go gcaithfidh an comhairle contae sin breathnú ar an bplean a chuir siad féin i bhfeidhm. Baineann alt 4 is mó le ceadanna pleanála a bheith diúltaithe i ngeall ar fhorbairt i gceantar high scenic amenity. Le rud mar sin, nuair a thosnaíonn an eisceacht a bheith gnáthach tá sé thar a bheith in am scrúdú cén fáth a bhfuil a leithéid ag tárlú. Caithfimid a bheith macánta agus oscailte faoi seo. Caithfear athbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an bplean forbartha chontae atá i gContae na Gaillimhe an chéad uair eile a bheidh sé faoi bhráid an chomhairle chontae. Níl sé infheidhmithe mar atá sé. Ní mór usáid a bhaint as leithéid alt 4 mar ní féidir le muintir Chonamara, go mór mhór, forbairt a dhéanamh agus tithe a thógáil ar an gcaoi a bhfuil sé i láthair na huaire. Ach os rud é gur cumhacht é sin atá cheana féin ag na comhairleoirí chontae seachas ag an mbainisteoireacht, sin an áit a bhfuil an fhreagracht agus sin an áit go gcaithfear díriú ar an gceist sin. Cuireann sé iontas orm nach bhfuil daoine ag díriú ar an bhfadhb sin agus nach bhfuiltear ag iarraidh an rud a chur ina cheart.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na comhairlí áitiúla, ní féidir iad a bhunú i láthair na huaire. Creidim gurb é an rud is fearr a dhéanamh ná díriú ar na comhairlí contae a chur ar bun i láthair na huaire. Molaim an moladh atá ann, breathnú ar chuid de na teorannacha a bhaineann leis na contaethe sin mar tá cuid acu as dáta anois. Tá mé an-sásta go gcuirfear na comhairlí áitiúla ann agus má tá aon amhras ar éinne nach gcuirfear ann iad caithfidh siad a thuiscint gur cuireadh na toghcháin do na UDCs, do na town commissions agus do na bardais do na cathracha beaga ar ceal. Tá fhios ag an saol Fódhla nach bhfágfar iad sin gan toghcháin sa bhfad téarma. Caithfear Bille nua a chur ar aghaidh agus na socruithe sin a chur ar bun sular féidir na toghcháin sin a chur ar aghaidh. Is iontach an scéal é go mbeidh an chothromaíocht chéanna ag chuile cheantar sa tír agus má tá town commission le bheith i mbaile beag go mbeidh an rud céanna i gceantar tuaithe. Caithfear féachaint ar na cumhachtaí, ar na freagrachtaí agus ar <Col N="2185" /> an airgeadas a thabharfar do na comhairlí seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh foinse amháin airgid acu taobh amuigh de fhoinsí áitiúla. Is dí-chéillí an rud é go mbeadh an t-airgead ag teacht ó Bhaile Átha Cliath, ón réigiún agus on gcomhairle contae agus ó fhoinsí áitiúla. Níl aon chiall, ó thaobh cúrsaí riaracháin de, in a leithéid sin de chóras.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go gcuirfear na heagrais seo ar bun, go dtabharfaí cumhacht ar bhóithre bailte, mar shampla, do na heagrais seo agus go bhfágfaí na bóithre réigiúnacha faoi na comhairlí contae. Is faoina leithéid sin de eagraíochtaí a bheadh sé a shocrú cad iad na bóithre a dhéanfaí, cén caoi a dhéanfaí iad, cén costas a bheadh orthu agus mar sin de. Ní bhéinnse ró-thógtha leis an iomarca structúr a bheith ann maidir leis na heagrais réigiúnacha i dtír beag mar seo, ach os rud é go bhfuil gá lena leithéid de structúr a bheith ann ó thaobh airgid an Chomhphobail de is gá go mbeadh feidhm reachtúil lena leithéid. Mar sin, ní bheidh siad cosúil leis na RDOs a bhí ann blianta ó shin. Beidh feidhm lárnach acu ó thaobh airgid ón Eoraip. Tá mé sásta gur daoine tofa amháin a bheas sna heagraíochtaí seo agus nach mbeidh daoine ainmnithe orthu. Creidim gur rud bunúsach é seo ó thaobh cúrsaí dlí de.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor leor rudaí sa Bhille agus d'fhéadfadh duine labhairt go deo ar na nithe atá ann. Ach sílim ag deireadh an lae go seasann dhá rud amach. Ar an gcéad dul síos tá an tAire tar éis teacht os comhair dhá Theach an Oireachtais agus chualamar go leor leor casaoid faoin deifir a bhí ann an Bille a chur tríd. Ach, ar ndóigh, ní raibh deifir ar bith orainn. Dá mbeadh an Freasúra sásta go gcuirfí na toghcháin áitiúla ar ceal cén deifir a bheadh orainn? Ach dá ndéanfaí é sin is iadsan an chéad dream a bheadh ag casaoid agus a bheadh ag rá go raibh andeifir leis na toghcháin agus gur cheart dul ar aghaidh leo, agus ag an am céanna tá siad a rá gur cheart reform of local government a chur i bhfeidhm. Is trua nach raibh príomh-pháirtí an Fhreasúra sásta páirt a ghlacadh sa díospóireacht sa choiste a bhí molta don chéad uair chuige seo. Creidim go bhfuil rud bunúsach á <Col N="2186" /> dhéanamh againn anseo. Nuair a bheidh sé seo á chur i bhfeidhm go mbeidh Rialtais ag baint an-leas as seo le cumhachtaí a thógáil ón lár agus a thabhairt síos go dtí an talamh.</P>
    <P>Ar an gceist sin is cuimhin liom go mion minic daoine a rá, cén fáth nach dtugann an tAire cumhacht don chomhairle contae é seo nó é siúd a dhéanamh, cumhacht a bheith acu le haghaidh seo, siúd agus eile, agus go raibh siad thar a bheith míshásta nuair a fuair siad amach nach raibh an chumhacht sin ag an Aire mar nach bhféadfadh sé de réir dlí na rudaí seo a dhéanamh. Mar sin, aon rud a deir na páirtithe polaitíochta, tá mise cinnte go mbeidh na daoine thar a bheith sásta go mbeidh an tAire in ann dul agus cumhachtaí a thabhairt do na comhairlí contae, agus sin an méid atá á déanamh. Táimid ag tabhairt cumhachta don Aire, ní le rudaí a dhéanamh é féin, ach, go bunúsach, le cumhachtaí a thabhairt do na comhairlí contae, rud ar chuala mé go leor leor cainte air thar na blianta, ach rud anois, nuair atá sé ag dul a dhéanamh, go bhfuil an-casaoid á déanamh faoi.</P>
    <P>An dara rud atá tábhachtach, agus go gcaithfinn tagairt a dhéanamh dó anocht, ná feidhmiú na gcomhairlí contae ar an talamh. Maidir le ceist seo an airgid, tá sé iontach éasca ag daoine, nuair a theastaíonn uathu éaló as bac, i gcónaí ag rá, tá tuilleadh airgid ag teastáil. Tá sé éasca dearmad a dhéanamh cé as a thiocfaidh an t-airgead seo ar fad. Ach níl an saol chomh simplí leis sin agus tá mé cinnte go dtuigeann chuile duine sa Teach seo é sin; agus go dtuigeann siad ag deireadh an lae go gcaithfidh daoine, ní amháin airgid a fháil ach féachaint chuige go gcaithfear go stuama é, sa chaoi is go mbeidh toradh le baint as.</P>

    <P>Tá áthas orm faoin stádas agus faoin gcumhacht a thugann an Bille seo do na <Col N="2187" /> comhairlí contae; ní minic a thugtar an t-aitheantas cuí dóibh. Tá éileamh nach beag ar na comhairleoirí céanna nach mbíodh ann go dtí seo. Caithfimid cur lena stádas amach anseo trí costaisí fóin agus costaisí poist, b'fhéidir, a íoc leo. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh seasamh ar leith ag cathaoirligh agus ag méara na mbailte móra mar go bhfuil ról lárnach le tógáil acu i saol na tíre. Tá forbairt ag teacht ar gach gné den saol agus uimhir mhór eachtrannach ag teacht isteach sa tír ar chúrsaí gnó agus ní foláir go mbeadh stádas agus airgead ag na feidhmeannaigh seo lena ngnó a dhéanamh i gceart. Tá soláthar sa Bhille seo chun cumhachtaí breise a thabhairt dóibh a chuireas lena seasamh i súile an phobail.</P>

      <Col N="2188" /> Tá gá ann le breathnú ar theorainneacha cuid de na ceantair áitiúla agus athruithe bunúsacha a dhéanamh. Rinne an Seanadóir Ó Foighil tagairt do chás na Gaillimhe, áit a bhfuil Conamara roinnte i ndhá chuid. Síneann ceantar amháin ó Abhainn an Chnoic, siar go dtí an Clochán agus aniar go baile Uachtar Ard. Tógann an ceantar eile isteach Gaeltacht dheisceart Chonamara, an ceantar ó Uachtar Ard go cathair na Gaillimhe ar thaobh amháin d'abhainn na Coiribe agus Oileán Árainn.</P>
