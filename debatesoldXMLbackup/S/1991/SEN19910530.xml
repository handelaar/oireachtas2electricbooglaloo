      <P>Could I offer, on behalf of my group, my congratulations to Archbishop Daly on his appointment as Cardinal? All our good wishes go to him on his new appointment.  It was very encouraging yesterday to see genuine goodwill coming from all sections of the community in the North on his appointment. On the Order of Business&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to join in the message of goodwill and congratulations to the new Cardinal.  It is appropriate that this island should have <Col N="486" /> at least one Cardinal.  Archbishop Daly is a very distinguished scholar and a distinguished churchman.  One thing that I was particularly pleased about was the very warm message of congratulations that was sent to the Cardinal from the primate of my own Church, the Anglican Church in Ireland.  The new Cardinal is a man who is very distinguished, rather conservative, but a man for whom even those who do not necessarily agree with him theologically would have a great deal of respect.  He is also a man of compassion and great standing.  We are lucky to have this new Cardinal in this country.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to join in the congratulations that have been expressed by my colleagues.  It is very significant that from all sides in Northern Ireland there have been messages of goodwill to the Cardinal.  He is a figure who, to some extent, represents unity.  I hope his influence can be brought to bear in the future.  I hope he will have a long and happy reign in Armagh as Cardinal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to object to the way in which business is being ordered today.  It is not right that a Bill should finish in the Dáil at 1.30 p.m. and come straight in here.  It is not even on the Order Paper.  We do not know what changes are being made in the Dáil.  Surely the whole point of the second Chamber is that we have time to look at the changes made to the Bill in the Dáil and to come in here in a calm way next Tuesday or Wednesday, if needs be.  It is totally unacceptable. This is not the first time Bills have been rushed in here from the Dáil and on a guillotine basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>We have become a sausage machine as far as the processing of Bills is concerned.  I find it unacceptable. It is bad for the House; it is bad for legislation.  I ask the Leader of the House what sort of pressure he is under that makes it so imperative that this Bill has to be rushed through all Stages today?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the senior Member here this morning.  I support Senator Manning.  If the Leader can give me a reason why this Bill has to be rushed through today I will listen to it.  Although he has his moments, he is usually a very reasonable man, so there may be a good reason for this.  If it is simply that it happens to be convenient, and there happens to be a convenient slot of time and he is rushing the Bill through now for ministerial or Government convenience, that is not good enough.  It is ridiculous for this legislation to pass in the other House at 1.30 p.m., be brought in here at 2 p.m. and expect some sort of serious discussion on it.  You will have smart aleck comments from the other side of the House about amendments being the same as ones tabled in the Dáil.  What else can people do when they do not have a chance to seriously reflect on changes made in the Dáil?  I agree with Senator Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>As health spokesperson for our party I want to join with our party leader, Senator Manning, in complaining about the ordering of business today.  We will not have a adequate amount of time to discuss this important legislation.  We will not have time for the necessary reflection on the Bill or to propose the necessary amendments.  It is all too hasty. Unless there are very compelling reasons involving the welfare of a lot of people. We should not rush the Bill through.  I cannot see such reasons and I do not think it should be rushed through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want, as an Ulsterman, to associate myself with the congratulations to the new Cardinal-designate.  As a man of <Col N="488" /> peace, he is a very appropriate person to be Cardinal at present.  There is nothing needed more in Ulster at this stage then peace and reconciliation.  We are all hopeful that the disgusting cycle of violence there will end shortly.  This has a lot of implications for the whole country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share the concern expressed by Senators Manning, O'Reilly and B. Ryan about the way in which this legislation is being rushed through.  Senator Ryan spoke very reasonably when he said that if there was some reason why it had to be through, then perhaps the Leader would explain it.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House to give the House an explanation, if one exists.  With the Local Government Bill there was a clear problem, although I have to say that even on that occasion a small group of us dealt with the amendments during the day.  I had to leave for about an hour and when I returned here the debate had collapsed.  Yesterday the same thing happened with the Finance Bill.  I was in my office waiting for a particular section to come up.  The House was at section 43.  I ran down to the House but when I got here they were at section 74.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is obviously the case. I am glad this has registered with you.  It is a pity if the Upper House is being regarded merely as a rubber stamp.  Constitutionally we have not only a right but a duty to contribute to the refining of legislation.  If legislation comes direct to us from the Dáil, there is no time for reflection.  There is no time to table amendments.  I share the general concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Leader also if he can clarify a point for me about the regulations in the Control of Dogs Act. It was stated today on the radio that the regulations are now in force, including the provision regarding bulldogs.  I wonder if that could be clarified.  I thought &mdash; but perhaps I am wrong &mdash;<Col N="489" /> that regulations needed to be placed before the House and approved.  Perhaps they do not have to be approved.  If they do, I would like them to be brought forward so they could be sent back in order to exclude bulldogs.  It is a pity to have a Bill that is nonsense.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Leader of the House would convey, or if he would think it appropriate to convey, what I am sure must be a general feeling in this House of great sadness and outrage at the appalling bombing in Northern Spain apparently by the forces of ETA, collaborators with our own Provisional IRA.  I would like the Leader to convey our sympathy to the Spanish Ambassador.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to a number of queries from Senators in regard to the Health (Amendment) Bill, I have been informed that the benefits of this legislation come into play on Saturday, 1 June and the Bill must be signed, I understand, tomorrow.  Therefore, on completion of the Bill tonight we will have an earlier signature motion for completion.</P>
      <P>The other query raised by Senator Norris concerns the control of dogs regulations, I will investigate that, Senator Norris, and inform you of the position.  I will convey your concern at the bombing in Northern Spain to the appropriate authority.</P>

      <P>I would like to say, I very much welcome any grammatical emendations or ameliorations which the Minister feels impelled to make.  It is particularly appropriate that it should be done in this House.  I would like to say also how very beneficial I have found my occasional sojourns in Seomra na Gaeilge.  As a result I was able to understand what Senator Ryan was saying without using the mechanical appliances for the purpose.  Had the Senator not made the point I would have done so, but perhaps I will mention it in English for my colleagues in Fianna Fáil so that they will understand what is going on.  I agree with Senator Ryan that it is very welcome that these amendments are down in the Government's name.  It indicates very clearly that there will be no difficulty about sending the Bill back to the Dáil and that the Minister will listen positively to the amendments from Members on this side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 20, after &ldquo;shall&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This section is very welcome.  I want to be totally non-confrontational about all these amendments.  They are a genuine endeavour to deal with the objectives everybody has in mind.  It is to be welcomed that a specific reference to homeless children should be in this legislation. I want to compliment the Minister and the Government.  This amendment was introduced to the original Bill as published and it is very welcome.  Each of my amendments has a <i>rationale</i> to it. The first of my amendments is simply to ensure that the sort of lethargy and inertia that can often characterise large organisations should not become the norm for dealing with the problems of homeless children.  My first amendment simply wants the words &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; inserted into the amendment after the words &ldquo;the board shall inquire into the child's circumstances&rdquo;.  I would not even argue with the precise phraseology.  We need to get a sense of urgency into this legislation, a sense which many of us feel about the scandal of homeless children. We all agree that there should not be homeless children in our society.  Therefore, we all agree that all State agencies and all voluntary bodies should be given both the powers and the resources to deal with the matter.  We must also ensure that those who have the powers exercise them with the sense of urgency which the rest of us have.  That is why I think the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; should be inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am never too happy with the phrase &ldquo;if the Board is satisfied that...&rdquo;.  The basis for a judgment about the matters <Col N="492" /> referred to in subsections (1) and (2) to section 5 is the provision that the health board shall decide all these things.  My feeling is that it simply should be so if the objective circumstances are such.  I do not like the idea of the board having to be satisfied.  It should simply be if the child has no accommodation available to him.  I do not know why this phrase &ldquo;if the board is satisfied&rdquo; has to be inserted. I think it should be taken out.</P>
    <P>The other amendments are consequential on it.  What I want taken out of this &mdash; and I doubt if it was the intention of the original draftsmen &mdash; is a suggestion that a child, and I will not argue about the age, can provide accommodation for himself.  If there is a homeless ten year old child there should be no investigation as to whether that child is able to provide or arrange accommodation for himself.  I am not going to argue about a 16 year old because we can talk about that later.  In relation to a ten year old child there should be no question of somebody saying: &ldquo;We have to investigate whether you can provide or arrange accommodation for yourself before we decide whether to provide accommodation for you.&rdquo;  Ten year old children cannot provide accommodation for themselves.  If the logic is that the parents should do it, then that gets away from the principle &mdash; which I know the Minister shares &mdash; that no child should ever, for whatever reason, have to live on the streets.  If we accept this, we cannot simply look at the parents' income or the domestic situation.  Therefore, we cannot put into legislation a requirement that a small child of ten or 11 should have an obligation to prove to a health board &mdash; or that a health board should need to find out &mdash; that the child &ldquo;is unable to provide or arrange accommodation for himself&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to know how a ten year old child could be required to provide or arrange accommodation for himself?  My amendment says that for children under 16 years of age this provision to provide or arrange accommodation should not apply.  I am not hung up on the age.  If the Minister care.  The school leaving age might be <Col N="493" /> more logical.  Homeless children should not have to go through the hoop of an effective means test as to whether they can provide or arrange accommodation for themselves.  It is a mistake to put it in.  I doubt if it conforms to the intentions of those who drafted the legislation.</P>
    <P>The last two amendments are simply to ensure that we do not get into the awful cheap hotels-bed-and-breakfast syndrome that characterised the operation of the Homeless Persons Act in Britain.  The health board should be required to take steps to make suitable accommodation available &mdash; and that means accommodation suitable for a child.  It is not just to get them off the streets so that they are invisible.  It is accommodation that is suitable in terms of the child's age, sex and other needs. That is why my final amendment suggests that the obligation should be to provide suitable accommodation and proper care.  The problem of homeless children is not just a problem of shelter.  It is a problem of abandonment, isolation and emotional deprivation.  You cannot deal with the problem of homeless children simply by putting them where there is a roof over their heads and they can have a bed for the night.  That is, of course, a necessary precondition, but it is not sufficient to deal with the problem of homeless children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Ryan's amendments.  They seem to me to be not only reasonable but valuable, if not essential, to the proper and effective functioning of the Bill.  I would like to mention the question of adding in the phrase &ldquo;and is more than 16 years of age&rdquo;.  Senator Ryan produced a series of cogent arguments.  I would like to add another.  I do not believe, for example, that a building society would lend money to a ten or 11 year old child in order to acquire a house.  The situation is nonsensical. It does not exist in the real world.  A child of ten or 11 years of age could, in almost no circumstances, be capable of providing accommodation for himself or herself.  I would like to strongly support Senator Ryan's amendments <Col N="494" /> Nos. 6 and 7 to ensure that there is an obligation on the authorities to ensure that the accommodation is suitable and, perhaps even more importantly, to add the phrase &ldquo;proper care&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We all recall with regret the kind of incidents which took place, for example, in the North of Ireland in the Kincora House affair where young children were placed by a local authority in situations where there was not proper care and where children were abused.  Many people are aware of situations in which children have been regularly abused while in institutional care.  I am not making any attack on institutions in this country.  I am not aware of such incidents, although they may well occur, but there are a number of precedents in the North of Ireland and England which should give us cause for concern.  Senator Ryan's amendment which inserts the words &ldquo;and proper care&rdquo; is a valuable and important one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Miss Keogh Miss Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Miss Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage we discussed the point that &ldquo;a child&rdquo; means a person under 18 years.  In the case of this amendment a child can provide accommodation for himself or herself at 17 years of age.  I am not too clear that the amendment achieves its aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is precisely the point.  The Bill quite rightly applies to every child under 18 years of age.  It also applies to children as young as five or six. It is meaningless to have a requirement, however it is going to be applied, that a health board have to go through the ritual of saying, &ldquo;Can this ten year old child arrange or provide accommodation for himself?&rdquo; The point I am making is that what applies to a 16 or 17 year old cannot apply to a ten year old and different provisions should apply.  The objective, and I am sure it is everybody's objective, should be that if a child of those sort of ages is on the street he or she should be taken off the street immediately and put into suitable accommodation with proper care.  I am sure that is what everybody wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me to be obscuring that <Col N="495" /> issue to put in a phrase about being unable to provide or arrange accommodation for himself.  This brings us back to an argument we had here on the homeless of few years ago, about the possibility of people making themselves deliberately homeless.  Whatever the arguments about adults it is no argument about children. I am not entirely clear what is Senator Keogh's problem.  I do not see why the provision of being able to provide or arrange accommodation should apply to young children.  That was why I put in 16 years of age.  I will not argue about the age but it is quite ridiculous that in the case of children below school leaving age the care agencies should have any obligation to find out whether they can provide accommodation for themselves. That is simply what I am trying to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators for their contributions.  If we could just look at section 5 in its totality for a moment.  The form of words we are proposing here: &ldquo;that there is no accommodation available to him which he can reasonably occupy&rdquo; is wide enough to include children who have a family home but whose circumstances there are intolerable. I am leaving open the type of accommodation which health boards may make available so as to ensure sufficient flexibility to deal with every contingency. That is the whole thrust of this section.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 2, I have some sympathy with what Senator Ryan is trying to achieve in this amendment.  I would expect that where it is reported to a health board that the child appears to be homeless, the board would investigate the matter as soon as possible to establish the facts and to make services available if this is necessary.  Indeed, even before this legislation is enacted the health boards have been instructed by the Department of Health to step up their efforts to provide accommodation for the young homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My successor as Minister of State in the Department of Health, Deputy Flood, is co-ordinating these efforts and has <Col N="496" /> announced a number of initiatives to increase the number of places available for the young homeless in Dublin and in other major towns and cities.  Additional places for the young homeless will begin to come onstream during the summer and further places will be provided later this year and early next year.  These developments are being funded from the special funds provided under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> for the special implementation of this Bill.  I mention this in order to underline the Government's concern for the young homeless and to demonstrate our commitment to bring an end to the plight of youngsters sleeping rough on the streets in our cities and towns to whom Senator Ryan referred.  I want to reassure Senator Ryan and the House that the provisions of this section will be closely monitored by Minister Flood and by the Department of Health to ensure that it is fully operated by all the health boards.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have a slight difficulty about accepting this amendment.  This arises from the fact that there are many sections of the Bill which provide that health boards &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do certain things. Nowhere is the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; qualified by the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  For example, I would refer the House to section 16 which requires a health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order in respect of a child where this appears necessary.  It will be noted that the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; does not appear here though quite clearly that is what is intended.</P>
    <P>I am advised that from the point of view of good drafting and consistency it would be better not to introduce &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; in some sections while not having it elsewhere.  This would only lead to doubt and ambiguity as to what is intended where &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is used without the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo;.  In the light of all I have said and to ensure that there is no grey area, no doubt and no ambiguity, I would ask Senator Ryan to reconsider his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Knowing the Minister, I am sure he was not going to remain silent on the other amendments.  I want to talk a little more about this.  If the problem is consistency throughout the legislation, then the Minister and his Department and the ubiquitous parliamentary drafts-people could deal with that.  The Minister seems to accept that the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; would make the legislation more precise and give the sense of urgency to it.  What he is worried about appears to me to be that it would give a lesser sense of urgency to other imperatives in later parts of the legislaation.  The solution to that is to put in &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; everywhere, if the Minister accepts that it is necessary and there is no problem about it.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Minister's advice carefully on this because I do not want to make this in the least bit confrontational &mdash; we are all on the one side on this &mdash; but he seems to accept that the phrase &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; would actually state the sort of urgency he believes should apply.  If he does and there are other areas where an equal urgency is required, and I would accept his point about the care proceedings, then the solution seems to me to be to insert &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; in the other sections of the Bill, not to simply drop my amendment.</P>

      <P>On amendment No. 2, I would differ with Senator Ryan on this point.  What the Minister has said quite clearly indicates that adding in the words &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; would create interpretative difficulties with the whole situation.  If it is included in one section and excluded in another problems may <Col N="498" /> arise under the old rule of interpretation which says: <i>inclusio unino exclusio altenius</i>.  Under that rule of thumb, if you include these words in certain sections, you are going to create problems unless they are throughout the Bill.  I agree with the Minister that putting in these words would slow down the procedure rather than make it more expeditious.  In this respect I would ask my colleague, Senator Ryan, to reconsider his amendment. I believe it would create interpretative difficulties but also it would actually defeat his purpose.  It would slow down procedures rather than speed them up.</P>

      <P>So long as we are not disposing of all of them at the one time, I am quite happy.  It seems to me that the Minister has a valid point.  Senator O'Donovan's learned exposé of the principles of interpretation have left me with no option but to accept that the only alternative available to me is to withdraw the amendment and go through the Bill, in time for Report Stage, and insert &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; in all the sections where the words should be included.  I was hoping the Minister might facilitate me by doing it himself.  But since he will not, it looks as if I have no option but to withdraw the amendment with a view, perhaps, to redrafting a similar amendment for a considerable number of the sections.  I believe it is important to tell large bodies that they have to move at a pace which is related to the needs of the individual, not to the organisational structure of the large body.  I propose to withdraw amendment No. 2.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank Senator Ryan for his generosity in saying he will withdraw the amendment.  The whole purpose of this Bill and the type of legislation we are trying to achieve here is that there would be instant action. We believe and Senator Ryan, as an experienced parliamentarian, understands that is you are dealing with a large <Col N="499" /> organisation or even ourselves as individuals, if we respond to something and we say we are going to do it as soon as possible, that does not mandate us to do it immediately.  We do not want to create a situation where there will not be instant action to serious situations.  This Bill is dealing with very serious problems pertaining to child care throughout the country and we want to make sure that there can be an immediate response, whether from the health boards, the staff of the health boards, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health or whoever. That is the kind of action we want operated as a result of this legislation being passed.  I am sure once we have dealt with all the amendments Senator Ryan will be happy that it will not be necessary to insert &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; throughout the Bill.</P>
      <P>On amendments Nos. 3 and 4, I think Senator Ryan is reading far too much into this phrase and he seems to be operating on an assumption that health boards will attempt to evade their responsibilities under this section.  I do not accept this.  On the contrary, I believe that the boards will avail of their new powers to take a more active role in relation to the young homeless.  As Senator Ryan is aware, the major difficulty at present is the lack of any clear statutory basis for such intervention by the health boards but now that we are rectifying that legislative loophole I am confident the health boards will not be found wanting in implementing this new provision.</P>
      <P>I think the criteria set out in paragraphs (i) and (ii) are a reasonable test of whether a child is homeless.  It is the health board that will have to inquire into the case and to establish whether these conditions exist.  That is all that is intended.  There is no sinister motive or attempt to undermine the thrust of the provision.  I ask Senator Ryan to accept my assurance on this and to reconsider these amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes without saying that young homeless people are in general unable to provide or arrange accommodation for themselves.  The reason paragraph (ii) appears here is because the Bill defines a &ldquo;child&rdquo; as a person of up to 18 years and because some, and I emphasise some, older children may be working and able to provide their own accommodation or they may be able to make suitable arrangements with families and friends.  I am advised, however, that the amendment is badly drafted and that the effect of it would be to limit the provisions of this section to children over 16 years of age.  Clearly this is not what Senator Ryan intended but it would be the effect of his proposal.  I ask Senator Ryan to consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>
      <P>On amendment No. 6, I accept that some of the accommodation in which homeless young people have been placed has not been entirely suitable.  This has been due to the shortage of places available for the young homeless.  I expect this problem to diminish as the new places I mentioned earlier begins to come on stream.  I have no difficulty with this amendment and I am happy to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering amendment No. 7 it must be borne in mind that when we are talking about children here we are dealing with people who are single up to the age of 18 years of age.  While most homeless children are likely to be confused and upset and in need of care as well as accommodation, this may not always be so, particularly in the case of older children.  If the child needs continuous care, then it is open to the board to take the child into its care either on a voluntary basis under section 4 or to seek a care order under section 18.  If, however, the childs' needs are not such as to require that he be in care, the board can provide accommodation under this section.  All of these provisions taken <Col N="501" /> together provide sufficient flexibility to enable the boards to provide the level and type of service that best meets the needs of the individual child.  I suggest that this amendment is not necessary and its only effect might be to require health boards to impose their care on older children who do not need or desire it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for accepting one of my amendments.  I am happy to withdraw the other amendments for a variety of reasons.  I agree with him about the proper care.  I take his point fully that it would be incorrect to impose an obligation to provide proper care as in the phrase contained in this legislation.  I think it would be wrong and I accept that.  Therefore, I am quite happy to withdraw that amendment accepting that there are other provisions to provide care.  That is valid and reasonable.</P>
      <P>I accept, unfortunately, that the Ministers' advice is probably correct about the way in which I have drafted the amendment about the age limit.  It has never been of particular concern to me to get involved in the niceties of drafting.  I am far more interested in discussing with Ministers the principle of an amendment and leaving it to the considerable resources available to the Minister to deal with the niceties.  I think that is one of the advantages the Minister has over individual Members of the Oireachtas.  He has the awesome resources of the parliamentary draftsman to deal with the technicalities but the problem still is, and we can talk about it again when we talk on the section, that there is now a legal obligation on a health board to go through the ritual of assuring itself that a ten year old child is unable to arrange or provide accommodation for himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew the minute I read it that it was there because there are obviously homeless children who could well be working.  Unfortunately, they cannot be on the dole because they do not qualify for it and that is an issue that perhaps could be talked about some time in terms of child poverty and child deprivation. The child could be working or could have <Col N="502" /> an income and I accept that but that is not an excuse for putting a phrase into the legislation that effectively requires all children's means to be investigated.  The Minister accepts what I am saying.</P>

The Minister may have been surprised that somebody such as myself would specifically raise that issue and I would like to put on the record of the House what presumably the Minister knows that the principal aggressors in that case were heterosexual married men with several children.  The statistics available in the past week from England demonstrate that in the United Kingdom 97 per cent of instances of child sexual abuse occur with heterosexual men as the agent.  I say that because I expressed my concern about these situations.  I am very grateful to the Minister for accepting Senator Ryan's amendment to include the word &ldquo;suitable&rdquo; but I felt that perhaps my mentioning of Kincora might be subject subsequently to misinterpretation.  I wish to place that on the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I only regret that our general housing legislation does not contain an obligation similar to that in the amendment to deal with homeless adults because I believe that the obligation however carefully qualified it has to be &mdash; and it is obviously a very carefully qualified obligation &mdash; is a necessary part of the provision.  The section is still bothering me because of this and I am glad the Minister is going to have another look at it.  However, I am not as happy as he is about the capacity of health boards to respond quickly.  I hope his successor will remind health boards that these things have to be done, they have to be done on Saturdays and they have to be done on Sundays and they cannot just be operating from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on a five day week.  That is one of the problems with large bodies and as a longstanding trade unionist I have every sympathy with people's rights to a reasonable working week.</P>
      <P>If we are to deal with the problem of homeless children the way the Minister wants to deal with it then first of all one could raise questions about resources. That is one of the matters we could spend the whole year talking about here and I am not sure we would achieve any satisfactory results.  The Minister might like to tell us what resources he or his successor are providing for the health boards to meet this obligation or will they have to do it out of their current budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, is he aware of plans to ensure that this obligation can be met in the way in which I think he intends, which is on a 24 hour basis, seven days a week?  You cannot switch off the service for homeless children at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.  It has to be available all day, every day and at weekends also.  The two questions are essentially about resources and staffing and the accessibility of the health board service to young people and to homeless young people and, incidentally, the process of making contact through voluntary organisations, through people in them <Col N="504" /> who would be able to help.  What is necessary here is that the voluntary organisations &mdash; or anybody who meets a homeless child &mdash; ought to be able to get in touch with a contact point and say, &ldquo;This child is homeless.  What are you going to do about it?&rdquo; and get, as the Minister said, and he was very emphatic about it, an immediate response &mdash; not tomorrow, not the next day &mdash; but immediately.  That should be the objective of all of us, that no child should spend one night on the street.  There should be no need for a child to spend a night on the street.  That is what we all agree on.</P>
    <P>I would like to know what plans are in train to ensure, first of all, that the resources are there to do it and, secondly, the resources are there to ensure that there will be an immediate reponse available, the way it should be, seven days a week for 24 hours a day.</P>

      <P>May I thank Senator Ryan for his very warm comments about section 5?  We are very committed to this whole Bill and section 5 is a series of important amendments that we brought forward during the debate on the Bill. This section and the Bill will have an effect on the situation pertaining to adult homeless.  As we debate the Bill, it will become obvious that we are also concerned about people who may be homeless or who may be in care up to the age of 18 years.  Under this legislation these people will not be the responsibility of the health boards, of the Department of Health, after the age of 18 years. However, we have put in a sort of a linkage with local authorities where we will be in a position to exert certain pressures on them to ensure that they take up where we leave off in situations where over 18 year olds would be homeless as a result of going out of care under the Child Care Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are totally committed to providing sufficient resources.  It is not normal that before you pass a Bill funds are made available in any budget or provision made in the Book of Estimates.  However, the Government were so committed to providing resources in this situation that we <Col N="505" /> did include £1 million in the Book of Estimates and subsequently in the budget in anticipation that the Bill would be passed during 1991.  I am very confident that with the co-operation we have here we will have the Bill passed in this session and it will be operative immediately thereafter.  The resources will be available and thereafter we will be reappraising the whole situation and seeking further resources in the Book of Estimates later this year and into the 1991 budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had better not make a habit of this but I want to thank the Minister for what he said.  I am glad that there are provisions available but is he happy that the organisational arrangements are going to be made too?  I am a little bit wary of health boards, they are under enormous pressure.  A number of them, for instance, have attempted &mdash; and in some cases I think have succeeded &mdash; in reducing their funding to voluntary organisations dealing with the adult homeless on the grounds that that was now a matter for the local authority.  It was never the intention of the Housing Act that the responsibilities of health boards in supporting voluntary organisations dealing with the homeless would be lessened.  In fact, section 65 grants have been reduced in many cases &mdash; I know of some specific cases &mdash; on what I think are the spurious grounds that this is now a matter for the local authority.</P>
      <P>It is that sort of organisational or managerial attitude in health boards that bothers me.  I wonder, as well as making the money available, is the Minister making any effort, or is he aware of any efforts being made, to provide the structure on the ground which will make the service accessible.  It is no good having wonderful accommodation for homeless children if most people in the voluntary organisations or in any groups who come into contact with homeless children, can only make contact at normal office hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The realities are that you will often only identify the existence of homeless children late on in the day, in the evening. That is when they become visible.  In a <Col N="506" /> crowded street in the middle of the day you would not be able to identify them. Is there a structure being developed within the health board service which will work in tandem with everybody else and which will accept the fact that children's homelessness becomes visible at inconvenient times in terms of large organisations? That is as important as the resources are, to actually change the mentality so that the service becomes available when people need it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure Senator Ryan that I have the utmost confidence in the ability of the health boards to deliver the necessary services.  We have been in constant communication with the health boards.  From my personal involvement and experience with the health board over the years I am confident that there is no better structure to respond to the challenges that will arise as a result of this legislation being passed. We have had various sub-committees working with health board staff involved, particularly senior social workers and various other administrative officers.  We are guided by those people and we are at present in negotiation to ensure that there will be 24-hour cover available, seven days per week.  We are working on that at the moment in anticipation of the Bill being passed.</P>
      <P>As regards the provision of accommodation by the health boards, we are confident that they will be able to respond as a result of the various discussions we have had.  We have full confidence in that.  Voluntary agencies also operate for the health boards and for the State in providing accommodation.  We have no doubt that seven day cover and availability of both services and accommodation will be available as a result of the Bill being passed.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (7) (c), line 34, before &ldquo;when&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;either on its own initiative or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 7 deals with the child care advisory committee and subsection (7) deals with the things that a child care advisory committee should do.  Subsection (7) (c) states that the advisory committee shall report on child care and family support services in its area when so requested to do so by the health board.  My view is that such a body should be allowed to take some initiative of its own.  My amendment would say &ldquo;either on its own initiative or when so requested&rdquo;.  If we are going to set up child care advisory committees in each health board area then they should not be, if you like, beholden to the health board.  They should be allowed to act on their own to study the child care and support services in the area and to do it not only when the health board want it but also when they believe it is necessary.  It is a very stunted existence to give a body like that, if one of its major functions, which is to report on the quality of the services, can only be exercised when the Health Board Act asks it to.  We have had considerable discussion about similar bodies in recent months here, when we were going through the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which states that the agency has a number of functions which it shall exercise when asked by the Minister or on its own initiative.  In my opinion each child care advisory committee should be able to report on child care and family support services, but not just when the health board ask them.  They should be able to do so when they believe it is necessary.  That is the purpose of amendment No. 8.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 41 and 42, after &ldquo;prepared&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and published&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister, in a different incarnation, discussed with me freedom of information and freedom of access to information four years ago.  Section 8 refers to the requirement of the health boards to have a report prepared on the adequacy of the child care and family support services available.  Subsection (4) requires the health board to submit a copy of any report prepared under the section to the Minister.  I would like to ensure that any such report does not become a private document but a public document.  I do not want to get involved in a discussion about the niceties of drafting. It may well be necessary to amend parts of a report and would be confidential, though I do not think so given the sort of generalities involved in the section.</P>
      <P>My amendment seeks to amend subsection (1) to read: &ldquo;A health board shall, within 12 months of the commencement of this Part and annually thereafter, have a report prepared and published on the adequacy of the child care and family support services available in its area&rdquo;.  As an alternative to that, if the Minister is not happy, we could amend subsection (4) so that the copy of the report prepared under this section and given to the Minister could then be published by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am increasingly concerned that large organisations must be publicly accountable, and they cannot be publicly accountable without public access to the information on which they work.  Part of this information is a review.  I am aware that the argument that often arises is that if this report is to be published the health board would be far more circumspect in their criticisms of the services.  I do not <Col N="510" /> think that is a valid argument, because if that argument was to be carried to its conclusion very little would ever be published on the grounds that it would be better to keep it private because people would talk more freely.  I believe we would serve the objectives of this legislation in terms of developing public awareness and concern by ensuring that any such report prepared by the health board be published.  That is the function of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment essentially on the grounds that the matters in the report should be of public interest and, in a democratic society, should be available to the public.  We probably would need to publish the broad conclusions about the availability of services, buildings and so on.  There may be specific detail peculiar to certain institutions that should not be published, or some specific comment that might prejudice good work.  But the general conclusions, and the general state of affairs in relation to child care in a health board area, would be a matter of public interest and should be treated as such.</P>

      <P>There may be a misconception to some extent here that such a report would not be published.  I would not read it in that way.  My interpretation is that to insert &ldquo;and published&rdquo; there would be usurping the powers of a health board.  As a member of a health board I would feel aggrieved if it was not within my power to have whatever annual reports the board prepared brought before and discussed at public meetings of the board.  People will appreciate that the monthly meetings of the board are public and that the press are present. Therefore, I do not support this amendment. It is interfering with to some extent, undermining or usurping my membership of a health board.  It is the duty of members of the board and the chief executive officer to discuss annual reports.  We are all aware of the annual reports before us on the ambulance service, the psychiatric service, care for the elderly, or whatever.  They are discussed <Col N="511" /> by the board at a public meeting.  Interpretations are given by board members. I consider that they have the right to make those interpretations as members of that board.  If the matter is to be taken further it can be done on a public basis.  I do not think there is any intention not to publish. In fact, there is every intention to publish, but through the channel I have outlined.</P>

Under section 33 the health board are under a statutory duty to provide such services, so this report will serve as a useful yardstick by which the board and their members can judge their success in achieving the objectives of the legislation. The intention is that the report will be submitted to and considered by the members of the various health boards.</P>
      <P>As Senator Ryan is aware, and Senator Finneran has already alluded to this, meetings of health boards are held in public and there is usually a good attendance from the press.  Thus, while the reports will not be formally published, I would expect that their contents would be widely publicised.  I also believe that it would be useful if the board were to make copies of the report available to any of the bodies referred to in subsection (3) (b), whom it had consulted in preparing the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would see this amendment as making it mandatory on the board to publish reports and we would see this as an unnecessary duplication of effort and wastage of resources.  We believe that the reports should be put together.  The health boards have a statutory duty to provide the services.  They must report on those services.  They are obliged to present their reports to the board members and the board members then can decide what action to take <i>vis-à-vis</i> the report; and as the meetings are always public meetings and the press would be available, the reports would get publicity. <Col N="512" /> If we were to publish them, the situation could be that perhaps before the board members had an opportunity to consider they might find themselves in a straitjacket as a result of some misinterpretation of what is in an already published report.  I would suggest therefore that on the basis of what I have said this amendment is not necessary.</P>

      <P>Unless I am entirely wrong &mdash; which, of course, is remotely possible but not likely &mdash; in regard to the requirement that a health board will have a report prepared, that report will not be formally prepared by the health board until the health board have adopted it. Therefore, it cannot be published until it is prepared.  The report becomes the health board report after the health board have accepted it, not while it is an internal document circulating through the bureaucracy.  The board are the board; the entity is the health board, not the management nor anybody else.  The section says that the health board shall have a report prepared.  That action of having the report prepared will not be completed until the board have accepted that report; otherwise, it is only a draft report.  I am not talking about publishing a draft; I am talking about publishing the prepared report.  It should not be leaked until after it has been accepted by the members.</P>
      <P>I would accept, incidentally, that if incomplete draft reports were to be published it would be both wrong in principle and wrong from the point of view of the members of the health board.  I accept that fully.  I know that there have been problems from time to time with sub-committees of local authorities where half reports, or incomplete reports, or drafts which have not been amended are leaked.  It causes considerable controversy. Sometimes it is clearly an abuse of position by people to leak incomplete reports that are often inadequate or simply early drafts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not talking about publishing drafts.  I am simply ensuring what the Minister and Senator Finneran assure me is the case anyway, which is that these <Col N="513" /> reports which come to the board will be published after the board has agreed them.  I could understand if there was a possibility of incomplete reports being published before the board had approved them.  It is not the chief executive officers who prepared this report, it is not the child care workers, it is the board who must prepare this report.  Once it is prepared it should be published.  I am not going to push this because the Members assure me that it will be published, but I am intrigued why people would resist specifically saying it should be published if they all accept that it is going to be published anyway.</P>

      <P>I think there is a difference between a report becoming public and being published.  We would have no difficulty with information becoming public.  The board will consider the reports.  The reports will be available to the board and their professional staff. The reports will be available to the Department of Health and their professional staff.  If we are to put very scarce resources into publishing reports I do not see that this would be giving priority to what our desires are, and that is ensuring that there is an adequate level of child care services throughout the country.  It is unnecessary to put the onus on the boards and these reports should be published. They are not the type of resources to be providing reports that are going to be made available <i>ad lib</i> to the public. The fact that the report is prepared by the board, discussed by the board, is available through the board to the public press, to the public at large and is available to the Department of Health is more than sufficient.</P>

      <P>I did not realise it was the word &ldquo;publish&rdquo;.  I am not suggesting that health boards have to compete with Darton, Longman and Todd as publishers. I am simply saying that we should ensure that the report is available to the public.  The sort of normal phrase that is used would be that copies of the report shall be made available to the public at a charge which shall not exceed the cost of <Col N="514" /> copying the report.  That is precisely what I mean by &ldquo;publish&rdquo;&mdash; that copies of the report should be available to the public and the normal wording is that the charge for making the report available shall not exceed the cost of copying it.  That is the way to do it.  I do not think that if someone wanted a large report from a health board the health board should have to publish limitless numbers of free copies.</P>
      <P>If you want to, we can talk about publish and make available for sale at an economic price.  I really think we are getting into the realms of the ludicrous here.  I am inclined to withdraw the amendment on the grounds that I am not sure that the Minister is right in talking about the difference between &ldquo;publish&rdquo; and &ldquo;making available to the public&rdquo;. But on the grounds that he has the expertise of the parliamentary draftsman behind him I will withdraw the amendment and perhaps have a different one for Report Stage.</P>

      <P>It seems to me very clear that what the Minister is talking about is in fact a form of publication.  You do not have to produce an unlimited edition in order for the thing to constitute publication. Publication can be done cheaply and effectively &mdash; the desk top publishing. You do not have to engage in the kind of exercise that Senator Ryan was describing.  He instanced Darton, Longman and Todd &mdash; a reference no doubt to what he refers to repeatedly as his Church.  I am very glad the Minister has the attitude that he has with regard to conserving the paper resources of the country and not causing excess cost to the Exchequer.  May I say, for the record of the House, I greatly wish that this was an attitude shared by some of his Cabinet colleagues, because I receive endless copies of the speeches of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, done up in the most elaborate style, despite the fact that these things are already available on the record of the other House, which I receive automatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the parsimonious attitude of the Minister.  I wish it was extended to his colleagues.  But I would maintain what <Col N="515" /> the Minister is talking about already constitutes publication.  I think what Senator Ryan is interested in, and what I believe is appropriate, is the making of information available to the public in this area.  If the Minister is satisfied that this is so done under the conditions he is talking about, which in my view constitute publication but not the kind of expensive publication he is talking about, then I think the situation is already met.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (2), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  children who are homeless under the terms of section 5.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment has to do with the topics that will be discussed or will be reported on in this report that we were talking about a month ago.  With the usual phrase &ldquo;without prejudice to generality,&rdquo; it lists five different categories of children: children whose parents are dead or missing; children whose parents have deserted or abandoned them; children who are in the care of the board; children who are at risk of being neglected or ill-treated; or children whose parents are unable to care for them due to ill-health or for any other reason.  My amendment would add to that list what I know we all accept to be an extreme category of need among children, that is, children who are homeless under the terms of section 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, as part of the ongoing commitment to deal with the problem, the Oireachtas has to ensure that we do not have homeless children in the future.  It is important that we have an annual review of the numbers thereof under this review of services.  It is an important service in the area of child care and child welfare that the health board would provide accommodation for children who would otherwise be homeless. It terms of the annual review it would be <Col N="516" /> appropriate, and necessary that a specific sub-category be inserted into the categories on which they must report to identify the children who are homeless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support what Senator Ryan had said.  It seems to me to be important that we should deal in this list with children who are homeless under the terms of section 5.  I would also have liked to see some provision made for children who are in a situation of sexual abuse.  The Minister in the explanatory memorandum also very specifically lists these.  He says:</P>
      <P>... revised provisions to enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, ill treated, neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk in the care of or under the supervision of health boards.</P>
      <P>I suppose you cannot have an endless proliferation of categories, but it seems to me this is one the general public are very concerned about.  In a sense I am straying a little because I am not speaking exclusively to Senator Ryan's amendment, which I think is a very important one.  Perhaps the Minister might consider on Report Stage also including a category of people who are being sexually abused, in or are at risk of being sexually abused, in addition to Senator Ryan's amendment about children who are homeless, which seem to me again to be a major vulnerable category of people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very familiar section in terms of its phraseology.  It says:</P>
      <P>A health board may, subject to any general directions given by the Minister and on such terms and conditions as it sees fit, make arrangements with voluntary bodies or other persons for the provision by those bodies or other persons on behalf of the health board of child care or family support services...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sounds fine.  What it has meant in other areas of which I have some knowledge is that it results in minuscule grants being given to voluntary organisations, that the arrangement that is made is a grant equivalent of perhaps 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the budget of an organisation. There is an identical phrase, for instance, in the Housing Act of 1988 <Col N="518" /> whereby local authorities may, on such terms and conditions as they see fit, make arrangements with other voluntary bodies to deal with homeless people.  In most cases that ends up with a contribution towards the running costs of whatever unit it is, which is minuscule in terms of the actual costs.</P>
    <P>I would like to get some assurance that we are not going to have health boards, for reasons of severe financial constraint, able to walk off from their responsibilities by saying they have made an arrangement with a voluntary organisation when, in fact, that means a £10,000, £15,000, £20,000 or perhaps £30,000 grant which represents no more than 15 per cent or 20 per cent of the budget of the voluntary organisations.  That is not the sort of partnership between the State and the voluntary sector that everybody talks about and everybody, including myself, makes fine speeches about.  Partnership means some sort of relationship of equality.  Part of that equality must be that where a voluntary organisation &mdash; and many of them can do the job extremely well and with considerable efficiency &mdash; enters into an arrangement it must be at a level of funding which is significant in terms of the cost of running the service.  It cannot be a shoestring way of doing something; it must be real, substantial funding.  I do not expect the Minister to say he will fund them all 100 per cent but I am unhappy with the way that sort of phraseology in other legislation has actually been applied by the local authorities in the case of housing.  I am just worried that the health boards will do something similar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept a lot of what Senator Ryan says.  I can assure him I do not propose to fund these bodies 100 per cent, and I do not think they would want us to do that.  It would be unfair to them, because we must respect the existence of many of these bodies for many years and the tremendous work they do.  It would be unfair if the State was to impede the flexibility, the level of service and the type of structures and systems of funding within which they operate.  However, we <Col N="519" /> must also ensure that flexibility is available to the State through the health boards to assist these bodies.  Perhaps some may be under financial pressure for one reason or another and it may be in the interests of the State, through the health boards, to come to their rescue rather than have some of the services they provide go out of existence.  It certainly would be in the interests of the State that they would assist with funding, give additional funding, recognise the role being played and have a reasonably balanced structure whereby these organisations would know they were entitled to a specific amount of funding or a standard amount of funding; or in cases where they were being asked to provide a new service on behalf of the State, which they had the expertise to do and which the State may not be able to provide at a particular time, that the State, through the health boards, could provide funding.</P>
      <P>I would like to pay tribute to all of these bodies for the wonderful work they do.  I hope the necessary resources will be available to ensure that they will be able to expand and continue the level of service they are giving right across the board.  The State in itself could not afford to fulfil its social and statutory role without bodies and organisations like these. It is good that we would have this type of public/private voluntary mix in the interests of the best level of care and human service for people.</P>

      <P>This applies to a considerable part of Part III as well and we can discuss it on section 13 also.  What steps are in train or what currently is available to provide training for the Garda in this difficult area?  As one who <Col N="520" /> frequently has become involved in wrangles about criticising the Garda, I have to say that my experience of the Garda in dealing with areas of social distress is that in many cases they can often be a lot more committed to the people involved than some of those in the caring services. I know this from my involvement with homeless people.  The Garda can show a degree of sensitivity and flexibility that is a great credit to them in the way they deal with often difficult people.</P>
      <P>This is a very difficult area for the Garda and I would like to know what training will be available to them.  It could be a problem for any garda in a particular situation where something had to be done quickly.  We should ensure that they are actually trained in terms of what they will be doing.</P>
      <P>The second issue that arises is the question of the expertise of the Judiciary, particularly district justices. It is a very delicate matter and one could get into hot water dealing with the Judiciary.  It is a specific area and one which I would like to have some feeling that there will be people on the benches of the district courts who have some training.  I am not casting any aspersions or making any comments.  It is a demanding and distressing area, and people are needed to deal with at the judicial level who have proper training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, we must remember that there are in many of these cases quite distressed parents who will often feel that they have been hard done by.  What is their position in terms of legal aid if they want &mdash; and they have a right &mdash; to contest the various orders?  Do they have to fund it out of their own resources?  This would concern me because it would be much earier, for instance, to take all the various actions involving children of parents who are poor than to take similar actions involving children of parents who are very well off.  In the case of poor parents you could have a fairly smooth ride through the courts because they would not be able to afford to take legal advice, to get legal aid, or get a solicitor or barrister.  Will legal aid be available or how will the <Col N="521" /> parents be legally represented if they cannot afford a solicitor?  There are three questions there concerning the Garda, the parents, the Judiciary and legal aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important section.  I want to assure Senator Ryan that the Government have looked at every aspect of Garda training.  As the Senator knows, we have changed the whole system from a six months crash training course to a very detailed academic and practical course of two years' duration.  I visited the Garda Training College and had discussions with the Garda authorities and I am absolutely certain that the modern training being given to all gardaí is equal to anything in the world.</P>
      <P>We can be absolutely certain, with the environment in which they operate, the technology and the aids available to them, the structures, the system, the excellent training they undergo in regard to real life situations, in all types of crime and other problems, that the modern garda is one of the best trained people of any profession in the world at this time. I am pleased to be able to say that here. From my knowledge I have no doubt that they are being well trained in the child situation, in handling all kinds of human situations and I do not visualise any difficulties in this area.</P>
      <P>On the legal side, as the Senator knows we have brought for the first time into a Bill like this a right for legal representation for the child in particular.  It will be a matter for the court to decide who pays for that legal representation. There is great flexibility and that is something everybody welcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know how dramatically improved the Garda training is, but I am concerned that, of necessity, a significant number of the Garda Síochána will not have had the opportunity to go through this sort of very good training system that is now available but will have gone through an older system which was far less developed and which everybody, including the Garda's own representation association recognise to be inadequate. <Col N="522" /> It will not just be the new gardaí who are coming out of the new training courses who will have to deal with child care problems.  It will be all of the Garda Síochána.  I would like to know if there will be any provision to make sure that all the people who missed out on the excellent training will at least in this difficult area be given some training so as to understand and be able to deal with the problems.</P>

They hold regular in-service training courses, and conferences, and all situations are taken in a modern context.  The most up-to-date information is made available.  Where gardaí have a particular function, like juvenile liaison officers, community policy and various other responsibilities in Garda stations, they are constantly involved now in new in-service training.</P>

      <P>What about the Judiciary?  I say this very tentatively because I am treading on dangerous constitutional ground now.  District justices are only human beings, I am sure I am allowed to say that without being disrespectful. Is there any way in which the increasing skills of the Garda, the increasing commitment of the health boards and all other things that are implied or contained in this legislation, can be utilised so that the other side of the equation will become equally skilful, trained and knowledgeable?  Can we do anything to ensure that those who deal with these cases on a day-to-day basis will be operating at the same level of perception, knowledge, information and understanding as everybody else?  There have been problems from time to time with district justices dealing with areas like child care, custody and all those issues.  There can be considerable unevenness, to say the least, in the decision-making at that level.  Is there any way steps can be taken to ensure that <Col N="523" /> those who deal with these cases are people who from the point of view of personality, background and training are suitable for the job.</P>

      <P>Personally, I believe that we are all equal, that we are all doing the same job in different ways.  However, we will have various levels of expertise, given the background we come from, the training we have, the opportunities that are presented to us.  The Judiciary are in a very particular position.  The Constitution places a particular responsibility on them.  It also gives a particular role to us as legislators.  As regards the various cases of child sexual abuse and other child problems that have come before the Judiciary over the last number of years, it can be said that they have handled them with great skill and expertise.  I am quite confident that, given the demands on the Judiciary, they, at any particular time, will make their own decisions, their own arrangements, <i>vis-à-vis</i> any particular situation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to insert references to assessment in section 13 and 18 of the Bill.  This is required in order to place beyond doubt the right to undertake a medical or psychiatric assessment of a child placed in care by the courts whether under an emergency care order, an interim care order or a care order.

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 11, subsection (7) (a), between lines 40 and 41, to insert the following new subparagraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv)  the educational needs of the child.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment refers to subsection (7) of section 13 which lists the directions a district justice may give.  Subsection (7) (a) states:</P>
      <P>Where a justice makes an emergency care order, he may, of his own motion or on the application of any person, give such directions (if any) as he thinks proper with respect to...</P>
      <P>The section lists a number of things, (1), the address or location of the place, (2), the access of parents (3), the medical or psychiatric examination, assessment or treatment I believe of equal importance should be the educational needs of the child.  After all, the right of every child to primary education is guaranteed under the Constitution.  It is as important a part of a child's development as medical or psychiatric help.  It seems to me that it would be not just appropriate but necessary that a district justice should be entitled, where he sees fit, to make a direction so that the educational needs of the child are met.</P>
      <P>The decision about the emergency care order and the details of how it is to be implemented cannot be separated from the fact that the child's educational needs must in terms of access to a decent school so that whatever schooling the child is receiving and be continued while the emergency care order is in operation. Therefore, it seems to me that it would be appropriate to have the amendment inserted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with <Col N="525" /> emergency care orders.  I stress the word &ldquo;emergency&rdquo; because it should be noted that this type of order expires after a maximum of eight days.  It is, therefore, a short term order and responds to an emergency.  Subsection (7) must be viewed in the light of this.  It sets out what directions may be given by a district justice while an emergency care order is in force, that is during a maximum period of eight days.  It is difficult to envisage what directions would have to be given during such a short period of time in relation to the educational needs of a child.  If, for example, the child had been sexually abused or physically assaulted the primary concern would be to ensure that he or she received appropriate medical examination and treatment and any necessary psychological support.  In such a case, there would probably be a temporary interruption of the child's schooling but in the circumstances I think we would all agree that this is reasonable.</P>
      <P>It may be, however, that what Senator Ryan has in mind is enabling a justice to give directions as to the educational needs of a child on a longer term basis. If that is the case I would make a number of points.  First, this is not the appropriate section to insert such a provision dealing, as it does, with the short term eight day order.  The appropriate place for such a provision would probably be section 18 which deals with full care order.  Second, under section 10 (2) responsibility for the care of the child is vested in the health board.  This would include responsibility for ensuring that the child receives a proper education.  In the light of the provisions of that section, I would suggest that there is no need to insert a provision empowering the justice to give directions as to the child's education.  In all the circumstances I would ask Senator Ryan to consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>

      <P>Subsection (2) reads:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section, a person shall be deemed to have been informed of the placing of a child in the custody of a health board under section 13 if he is given or shown a copy of the emergency care order made under that section or if that person was present at the sitting of the court at which such order was made.</P>
      <P>The point has been made to me that there ought to be some obligation to explain verbally, particularly to parents, what has happened and tell them they have rights under this legislation and under the Constitution. I do not think putting the needs of the child first, which is what we all accept, should mean ignoring the rights of parents.  It is a difficult and stressful time for everybody involved.  Anybody who works in the area will tell you that separating parents from their children or children from their parents is very traumatic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as it stands is a little bland in that it says showing people a copy of the emergency order or giving it to them is sufficient.  I can understand why we do not want a complicated set of legal obligations which could be used to hinder the implementation of an emergency care order.  I have no problems about that, but in terms of the guidelines the Minister issues, the guidance that is given or in some other way, we should ensure that parents have it explained to them in simple language what has happened and what their rights are.  It is not in any way against the objective of the legislation to make sure that the care order, or whatever procedure is being taken, is explained to the parents in simple English or to whoever should be told, and they should be made aware of their rights. They should not have to go through a complicated search to find out what their rights are.  That serves no purpose and <Col N="527" /> makes a difficult situation even more difficult for everybody.</P>

      <P>What Senator Ryan is saying is very reasonable.  We have taken cognisance of that in the Department of Health.  We have had discussions with the health boards.  Guidelines are being drawn up and already some boards are making special leaflets available to parents outlining what their position would be, what services are available, what their rights are and where they can go to get free legal aid and so on.  We have had discussions and the attitude we will be adopting will be the most open, informative, and human possible to ensure that in this traumatic situation the parents are fully alerted to what happened, and we will ease their burden as best we can.</P>

      <P>This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 25 and 26.  The amendment to section 18 is a <Col N="528" /> technical one which has been recommended by the parliamentary draftsman. It deals with cases where a court decides not to make a care order until the child reaches 18 years but instead makes a care order for a shorter period of time.  Where the court makes a short-term care order it is important that it should have the ability to extend the order later if that proves necessary.  At present section 22 (a) provides that the court may renew a care order.  I am advised that the provision of section 22 is too vague and that some criteria need to be laid down as to the circumstances on which are orders may be renewed or extended.</P>
      <P>The amendment to section 18 deals with this by providing that a court may extend the care order if grounds for the making of a care order continue to exist with respect to the child.  I believe that this formula provides better safeguards for the child and its parents against unnecessary or excessive extensions of care orders.  If this amendment is accepted it is proposed to delete the reference to &ldquo;renew&rdquo; at section 22.</P>

      <P>I contacted the Labour Party this morning. Unfortunately they are not able to be present and I am happy to move these amendments on their behalf.  I know the Minister will give a considered response to this amendment.  Perhaps he will agree with it because it allows for a situation where, if there is an application for a care order and the court refuses it, this does not close off the possibility of a supervision order being made.  This could be quite important because if the court decides to reject an application for a care order it still leaves open the possibility that if the situation is viewed as being less serious or in some other way different, then a supervision order could be applied by the court.  I am happy to move this. Even if it is not agreed I can leave it on the record so that the Labour Party, if they have returned to favour by the time Report Stage comes, can make their own arguments.  The same goes for the related amendment, amendment No. 20.</P>

      <P>The original version of this provision was the subject of a great deal of discussion in the Dáil and I brought forward amendments on Report Stage to deal with the concerns that had been expressed about it.  It now provides that where a health board apply for a care order and the court is satisfied that it is not necessary or appropriate to make a care order but that it is desirable that the child be visited in his home by the health board the court may instead make a supervision order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a sensible provision which ensures that where the evidence or the circumstances of the case are not sufficient to justify the making of a full care order the court will still have the discretion to grant a supervision order.  I am sure that some commentators have suggested that this will be used as a safe option by the courts and the result will be that health boards will have to settle for supervision order in certain cases in <Col N="531" /> which a care order is what is required.  I do not accept this view.  I believe that over the last few years, in particular, the courts have developed a great deal of expertise and skill in dealing with child care matters.  We can depend on the experience and expertise of the Judiciary to weigh up the evidence before them and to decide on the type of ward appropriate to each individual case.</P>
    <P>In any event, as it becomes clear that the supervision order is not working, that it is insufficient to ensure that the child is properly cared for and protected, there is nothing to prevent the health board returning to the court, within days or weeks if necessary, with a fresh application for a care order.  In view of what I have said I appeal to both Senator Norris and Senator Ryan to reconsider their amendments and withdraw them.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Norris that it is better to have it on the record and let the Labour Party decide then what they wish to do for Report Stage.  I am surprised at this amendment. I say this because this phrase was inserted in the Bill on Report Stage in the Dáil with the full agreement on all sides.  Its purpose is simply to enable the court to make a supervision order during the period when an application for a care order is being considered.  As the House is aware, it may take a few weeks before a decision on a care order is reached. This provision enables the court to place the child temporarily under the supervision of the health board in the meantime. It can be seen, therefore, that this is a useful provision which we should retain in the Bill.  I regret that I would not be able to accept it because we debated this at length on Committee Stage in the Dáil and the House was unanimous in accepting it.  It is a temporary situation that at least the child's needs for special protection are taken care of until there is a <i>de facto</i> decision taken by the courts on the matter.</P>

      <P>This is not my usual position on these issues.  The penalty for a person who fails to comply with the terms of a supervision order, by modern day standards is relatively mild.  Subsection (5) states: &ldquo;shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £250.&rdquo; Given the sort of draconian enthusiasm that many of my colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas have for penalties, a fine of £250 seems relatively light.

      <P>Basically, I have an open mind on the situation.  To be honest, we debated this at some length and we arrived at £250 because we felt we were dealing with people in a traumatic distress situation.  In many cases there may be serious social problems in a family and they may be under severe pressure.  We felt that putting in a bigger fine, perhaps to £1,000, would be unwarranted and it would not be feasible to be looking for that type of money from people in a situation where they would be seriously distressed, under personal pressure, physical pressure, financial pressure and serious mental and traumatic pressure. <Col N="534" /> We thought that the sum of £250 was striking a fair balance.

      <P>I would like to hear something on this amendment from the Minister.  It is a strange provision.  I have pencilled in perhaps offensively and unfairly on the side of my copy of the Bill: &ldquo;a licence for sloppiness&rdquo;.  The Bill states, &ldquo;Where a court finds and declares in any proceedings that a care order for whatever reason is invalid the court may of its own motion or on the application of any person refuse to exercise any power to order the delivery or return of the child to a parent ...&rdquo;.  It would be foolish to insert in all legislation the provision that if a higher court finds that what was done in a lower court is invalid they can still go ahead and do it if they think it necessary.  I am unhappy that we <Col N="536" /> would circumvent the judicial process by double-guessing people so that the courts would not be as much of a remedy as they might and people would be subject to something close to double jeopardy in that instead of having the decision of a lower court ruled on by a higher court the case would be adjudicated on for a second time.  I am not saying that I oppose it but I would like to hear the basis for its justification.  I know of a particular case which produced emergency legislation on child care some years ago and I wonder if it is to avert any such event in future that this section is inserted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We debated this matter on two occasions at a meeting of the special committee.  When the Bill was originally published we proposed that if an order proved to be invalid for a technical reason or otherwise the court had no option, irrespective of whatever environment or circumstances the child found itself in, but to return that child to the same environment even though that could be detrimental to the child.  We had discussions with the Attorney General and discussions on Committee Stage and this section was agreed as a result of those proposals and discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section seeks to get around the original difficulty by providing that where a court finds a care order invalid it may refuse to order the return of the child to its parents if this would not be in the child's best interests.  It may either make a fresh care order or remit the matter to the relevant District Justice so that he can consider the need to make a fresh care order.  Technically, what that means is that if a child in respect of whom an order was given in a particular district area now found itself in care in another district and that care order was found invalid the District Court in the new area could make a fresh order or taking into account all the circumstances it could refer the child back to the original District Court who could take a fresh look at it and make a final conclusive order. The underlying thrust of this section is to safeguard the well-being of the child.  We do not want to leave anything to chance <Col N="537" /> or permit technicalities to take precedence over the well-being of the child. That is the reason for this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the enthusiasm. This section genuinely bothers me and I am not talking about anyone's good or ill will.  Under criminal law, for example, there is a guy walking the streets of Cork who was convicted of murder on a confession signed 48½ hours after he had been detained under the Offences Against the State Act and he was freed by the Supreme Court because he signed the confession half an hour outside the permitted detention period of that Act; his confession was found not admissible as evidence.  There was no other evidence against him and, therefore, he was freed and there were other related issues.  If we had similar legislation to the proposed section here under criminal law the Supreme Court say: &ldquo;Even though the lower court's decision was invalid, on the basis of the evidence available we think you are guilty.&rdquo;  I know the Supreme Court does not operate like that but I have my doubts about the constitutionality of this section although I appreciate the motivation.</P>
      <P>I worry that health boards may consider that as long as they have a plausible case, the legal niceties need not trouble them too much because if somebody contested a case in a higher court the legal niceties would not be at issue.  We are a law-making society; the law protects us all from each other and the law must operate properly although it can be a nuisance.  One can understand people's concern about the technicalities in the criminal law, in civil law and in this area of child care but at the same time I have my reservations about this provision. There is a slightly Kafkaesque tone about this provision and one could imagine parents in the centre of it all feeling they had got somewhere and then discovering they were actually back where they started.  I am not going to make a big issue out of this but I am less than happy about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should ensure <Col N="538" /> that this legislation is not defeated on technical grounds in any court which would not be unprecedented.  The case of Duggan v. Evans concerned technical defects in summonses and it was decided that in the court a District Justice, Circuit Court judge or garda had power to amend summonses there and then and not have the cases thrown out on a simple technicality. I accept the trend of Senator Ryan's comments but this legislation is very sensitive and caring.  What is being proposed is to ensure that a technicality whether at district or circuit court level should not overturn good work done as a result of a particular order.  I cannot accept that it may be deemed unconstitutional because there are precedents. If it is included in this legislation it will be effective.  It is a wise provision and it would be a pity to omit it.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan has made me a little worried by his arguments which I think were well founded.  I was hoping that we would move on rapidly because I want to get on to the question of the guardianship <i>ad litem</i>.  The powers here are very broad and are not, as my learned colleague, Senator Donovan said, just for a technicality.  The wording is quite clear here: &ldquo;for whatever reason is invalid&rdquo; and it can be on the courts own motion or on the motion or any interested person.  I would be very worried if something which is invalid could be retrospectively validated no matter what the reason for its invalidity by a motion of the court or of an interested person or party.  I say this because of a long history in England, for example.  In a case in Orkney the rights of parents and of children were violated by just such an intervention by a well meaning interested party and there was a refusal by the court to return the children.  The children were inteviewed after that and there was no doubt whatever that the rights of the children were violated under those circumstances. I think there was a similar case in Leeds.  Before we award these very remarkable powers we need to be quite sure that they are justified.</P>

      <P>I am not a lawyer but this is a very important section.  We had discussions with the Attorney General as I said and there should be no doubt that the purpose of the Bill is to protect the child at all times.  Going back to the point that Senator Ryan made earlier, I do not think one can compare this section to the Offences Against the State Act.  While I am not a lawyer I believe that if the person he referred to did commit this murder was detained for 48½ hours and got away in the Supreme Court on a technicality he could be rearrested under the Offences Against the Person Act. That would be my personal view and, perhaps, I am wrong.</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is the well being of the child.  I suggest that: It has been discovered that there is a defective order and there is a case before the court for the second time that court can of its own motion, taking into account all the circumstances, make a new order. If it does not want to do that it can refer the case back to the original court where the first order was made to allow that court make its own decision.  In the interests of the child we must allow that flexibility.  We cannot have a situation where the well being, future, security and care of a child is to be decided on technical defects.  That cannot be allowed to happen because a child is not an adult.  An adult is physically and mentally stronger and is better equipped to accept or respond to whatever decision is taken. We must ensure that where there is doubt or defect, the child's vulnerability is not compounded; consequently, this section is of vital importance.</P>

      <P>This is my last contribution. I am not going to oppose this provision.  It has been discussed in considerable detail.  I would have been much happier if it had been drafted in terms which referred to technicalities but, as Senator Norris said, it states: &ldquo;declares in any proceedings that a care order for whatever reason is invalid&rdquo;, whatever reason it thinks.  Even if a court finds profound reasons why it is invalid we are inviting it to adopt a procedure which is <Col N="540" /> somewhat peculiar.  I am going to say no more other than put my own reservations about it on record.</P>

      <P>I would not like any doubt to linger about the situation because the interest of the child and the liberty of people are at stake.  We are saying that the court may, if it feels it to be in the interest of the child; it does not have to.  Taking into account all the circumstances, information and professional advice available it may then make a decision; it is not bound to do it but it may make it if it feels it is in the best interests of the child.  That is very important.</P>

Line 38 already provides that in any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of children the court shall have regard to certain matters.

      <P>This is inarguable particularly since the Minister said that the paramount issue is the well-being of the child.  This directs the Bill back on to the need to safeguard and promote the child's best interests.

      <P>I would be very reluctant to change the form of words in section 24.  First, I would point out that the formula used here is broadly similar to section 3 (2) (b) on page six of the Bill which we have already agreed.  This form of words already appears in the Adoption Acts and in the Guardianship of Infants Act.  In our discussions and deliberations on this Bill we have taken great care to ensure that there is a line of consistency between the Adoption Acts which refer to children, the Guardianship of Infants Acts which also refer to children, and this Child Care Bill and the Children Bill, 1989.  Because of that, I would be grateful if Senator Norris would consider withdrawing this amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 31 provides a kind of ethos for the question of guardianship <i>ad litem</i>, which is what I am really interested in.

As it reads at the moment the section says: &ldquo;...in so far as is practicable shall give due consideration, having regard to his age and understanding to the wishes of the child&rdquo;.  We wish to insert there not just the wishes but the feelings of the child and to ensure that these wishes and feelings are made known to the court.

We have clearly listed throughout the Bill that the wishes, the interests, and the position of the child must always be the overriding factor.  I would be reluctant to accept this amendment for the same reasons I opposed amendment No. 30, that is, because we do not and should not depart from the formula that is used in the other Acts referred to in relation to children.  There has been a line of consistency in these Acts and it is important from a legal interpretation to ensure that the courts can clearly have a consistent trawl of legislation available to them pertaining to child and children matters; that they can interpret this situation from the various Acts and that at the end of the day, taking into account all the information and advice available to them, they are able to make the best decision possible in the interests of the <Col N="543" /> child.

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1991, before the House today.  This Bill is important legislation which will provide for the restructuring of eligibility for health services, as agreed by the social partners in the context of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> adopted earlier this year.  The Bill also provides a statutory basis for the operation of a residency qualification in order to avail of health services and provides for the abolition of the income ceiling for payment of the health contributions, as announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>I propose to discuss each of these areas in detail.  First, however, I consider it important to set out the background to the Bill and the reasons for making the proposed changes to the current eligibility system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arises from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, which was agreed between the Government and the social partners at the start of the year. It is appropriate, therefore, that I should remind the House of the major commitments which it contains in relation to the health services.  The programme commits the Government to investing, over a seven-year period, no less than £100 million of additional capital expenditure to the development of community-based services for the elderly, for persons with a mental or physical disability, for the psychiatric services, for child care, for the improvement of dental services and for the provision of new health centres. We are also committed to significant increases in the level of day-to-day spending on these services, so that we will, by the end of the seven-year period, be spending £90 million more than the present level of current expenditure, in real terms.  The Government are committed to providing additional funding in each year's budget to achieve these <Col N="547" /> targets, and a significant start was made with the allocation of £8 million this year.</P>
    <P>It is also very important to stress that the development of community-based services which will be possible as a result of this expenditure is going to take place in a very co-ordinated and planned way. Over the past few years working parties and study groups have carried out detailed reviews of the various services and have identified the necessary direction and priorities for their development. Senators will be aware of the work of, for example, the Review Group on Health and Welfare Services for the Elderly, the Study Group on Psychiatric Services and the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services.  Under the programme, the key recommendations of all of these reports will be implemented.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy to provide health services to everyone's satisfaction if money were no object.  Unfortunately, the costs of providing health care are so high, and the potential demands on the service so limitless, that we will always face resource constraints and the difficult choices that go with them.  This will be true no matter what level of funding can be provided.  It is crucial, therefore, that our decisions on the development of services and the way in which we make them available are based on the most thorough and expert analysis of the needs to be set and the best way of meeting them.  The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> involves a radical overhaul of the health services, and I believe that one of its great strengths is that the various proposals are backed up by the research and analysis of the expert groups that I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The programme's commitments in relation to eligibility provide further examples of the Government's approach to taking careful account of expert research and analysis in adapting the health services to meet changing circumstances in our society.  The report of the Commission on Health Funding, which has been generally acknowledged as an exhaustive and most valuable examination of the funding and administration <Col N="548" /> of the health services, was published towards the end of 1989.  The Government then embarked on a consultation process on the commission's recommendations to ensure that we had the firmest possible basis for our decision on their implementation.</P>
    <P>The commission made a number of recommendations in relation to eligibility. These were subsequently endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in their important report, A Strategy for the Nineties, which provided a significant backdrop to the discussions with the social partners on the new economic and social programme.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in particular, pressed for the inclusion of the measures in the programme and this was agreed between the Government and the social partners.</P>
    <P>One of these measures, which did not require any amending legislation, was to have the chief executive officers of the health boards carry out an early review of the methods of assessment used throughout the country for determining eligibility for the medical card.  There is a need for these procedures to be flexible to ensure that no person in genuine need of a medical card suffers hardship through inability to obtain one. However, the commission had also highlighted the need for uniformity and consistency in the assessment procedures so that persons in similar circumstances are assessed similarly in all areas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that this review has already been completed and that, on foot of it, the chief executive officers have now agreed uniform procedures for assessing eligibility for the medical card, which will operate consistently in all areas.  In addition, the chief executive officers have agreed that income from the social employment scheme and the family income supplement will in all cases be excluded when an applicant's income is being assessed. These changes are very welcome and have been sought for some time.</P>
    <P>The removal of the income limit for eligibility for category 2 health services was one of the major recommendations <Col N="549" /> of the Commission on Health Funding. At present there are three categories of eligibility: category 1 are entitled to the medical card and to receive a comprehensive range of services; category 2 are entitled to the hospital services card and receive a more limited range of services, which does, however, include free hospitalisation subject only to the £12.50 per day charge up to a maximum of £125 in any 12 months; category 3 have the same entitlements as category 2 with two exceptions: they cannot avail of consultant care as a public patient and they cannot avail of the free maternity care and infant welfare service which is provided by general practitioners.  In both cases, they must arrange to receive these services privately.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise, therefore, that the difference between category 2 and category 3 relates only to a person's liability for professional fees.  Everyone in either category has the same entitlement to a bed in a public ward, paying only the £12.50 charge where it applies. The removal of the income limit for category 2 &mdash; in other words, the abolition of category 3 &mdash; does not have any effect whatsoever on the number of people entitled to public ward services.</P>
    <P>The commission put forward a number of arguments for removing the income limit &mdash; arguments subsequently endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council.  These arguments can be summarised in two sentences: first, that it is impossible to operate the income limit fairly; secondly, that the existence of category 3 can, in practice, work against equitable access to public beds.</P>
    <P>As regards the first of these arguments, there are several well-known difficulties in the operation of the income limit. Ostensibly, the purpose of the income limit is to identify a cut-off point beyond which a person should be able to afford to pay for any necessary consultant care for himself or herself and for any dependants. In practice, the level of income alone is far too crude a measure to identify who can or cannot afford these services, since it takes no account of differing circumstances such as the size of <Col N="550" /> the family, whether anyone in the family needs regular medical care, and so on.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the only way to operate the income limit without having a very complex administrative system is to rely on the document which most people can produce as evidence of their income, that is, the form P60, or similar documentation from the Revenue Commissioners. Given that half the population are entitled to category 2 services, the House will appreciate the need for a simple method of determining eligibility, and the use of the P60 is ideal in that respect.  However, it gives rise to many anomalies.  For example, each person in the family who has independent income, below the income limit, can obtain category 2 eligibility in their own right.  Since the income limit is £16,700 at present, a family with two salaries of £16,500 is in category 2 despite having a total income of £33,000 &mdash; yet a family with a total income of £17,000, from one salary only, is in category 3; a single person earning £16,500 is in category 2 while a large family with a single income of £17,000 is in category 3; a spouse taking up employment, and thus increasing family income, can actually move from category 3 to category 2.  This occurs when the spouse of a person in category 3, who, as a dependant, would also have been in category 3, takes up employment at an income below the limit and is thus separately assessed as eligible for category 2.</P>
    <P>The second argument relates to the way in which the very existence of category 3 can, in the view of the commission, of NESC and of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, work against equity of access to public beds.  The fact that patients are simultaneously public patients of the hospital but private patients of the consultant &mdash; in other words, where a category 3 patient exercises his entitlement to a public bed &mdash; involves a danger that consultants may, all other things being equal, admit the fee-paying patient ahead of others, resulting in &ldquo;queue-jumping&rdquo; into public beds.  There is no administrative device that can overcome this difficulty, since <Col N="551" /> the decision as to which patient is admitted first is a clinical one which can only be made by the consultant concerned. The only solution is to move away from the concept of having fee-paying patients in public beds at all.  There are two possible ways of doing this.  The first way would be to remove the entitlement to a public bed from those in category 3.  This would mean that the difference between the costs faced by those in category 2 and those in category 3 would greatly increase.  Since we have already seen the difficulties associated with the method of identifying those in category 3, the House will appreciate that this approach would only serve to increase the unfairness of the system.  The second way is to give everyone the entitlement to avail of a public bed, as the public patient of the consultant, but to require fee-paying patients to avail of private or semi-private accommodation.  This was the option recommended by all the groups I have mentioned, and it is the approach which is embodied in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will be as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;everyone, regardless of income, will continue to be entitled to a public bed as a public patient;</P>
    <P>&mdash;those who wish to be public patients will not be liable for consultant's fees;</P>
    <P>&mdash;where a person opts to be the private patient of a consultant he or she will, of course, continue to be liable for professional fees;</P>
    <P>&mdash;modifications in access to beds will be phased-in so that, in general, public patients will be accommodated in public beds and private patients in private or semi-private beds.  However &mdash; and this is important &mdash; emergency cases will always be accommodated even if the appropriate bed is not available.</P>
    <P>When the Bill has been enacted the Minister for Health will immediately be making regulations which will provide for <Col N="552" /> the designation of public hospital beds as public and private, and provide that public patients must be accommodated in public beds and private patients in private beds.  There will be provision for emergency cases to be accommodated even when the appropriate bed is not available.  The regulations will provide for the gradual phasing-in of the restrictions in access to beds over the next three years, to enable the Minister to ensure that the new arrangements are operating fairly and effectively.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the new system, the Department of Health have been involved in detailed discussions with every health board and public voluntary hospital, who have been asked to draw up proposals for the designation of public and private beds and for a three-year phased implementation of the modified system of access to these beds.  These proposals are being examined by the Department of Health, who are responsible for co-ordinating the overall phasing and for monitoring the new arrangements as required under the terms of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It is important to get the balance right in the designation of beds so as to reflect fairly the patterns of public and private practice.  Hospitals have been asked to ensure that their consultants are fully involved in drawing up their proposals.</P>
    <P>The clear identification of the status of every patient, as either the public or private patient of the consultant, will be implemented in every hospital, for every patient, from next Saturday, 1 June.  Also from 1 June, subject to the enactment of the Bill by that date, the income limit for category 2 services will be removed, so that those who wish to avail of public consultant care may do so, regardless of income.  The system of requiring public and private patients to avail of the appropriate designated beds will then begin to be implemented, carefully and gradually, to make sure that the transition works smoothly and effectively in the interests of all patients.</P>
    <P>The new identification system will also apply to out-patient hospital services. <Col N="553" /> Section 7 provides that, in relation to out-patient services also, the Minister will be able to specify by regulation that where a person is the private patient of a consultant he may, as with in-patient services, forgo his entitlement to treatment as a public patient.  It also empowers the Minister to specify out-patient hospital charges for private patients.  This is consistent with the general approach now being taken, that is, that private patients of consultants should be regarded as private patients of the hospital as well.</P>
    <P>I can best summarise the purpose of the new system by saying it is intended to benefit public patients without disimproving the position of private patients.</P>
    <P>Public patients will benefit by having greater access to public beds, as private non-emergency patients cease to occupy these beds.  The Department of Health will be ensuring, through their monitoring of the beds designation process, that there is no fall in the number of what would have been regarded as public beds up to now.  In certain hospitals there have been beds which are nominally regarded as semi-private but which have up to now been largely occupied by public patients. The appropriate proportion of such beds, based on a detailed examination of their usage, will be designated as public beds to ensure that there is no reduction in the number of beds effectively available to public patients.</P>
    <P>The private patients who are occupying public beds will be gradually be absorbed in private and semi-private beds.  To some extent, this will be possible by better management of these beds but, where necessary, hospitals will be able to increase the number of private and semi-private beds to cater for the level of private activity.  Any increases in the number of these beds will be at the expense of public beds and will be introduced on a self-funding basis.</P>
    <P>It is not expected that the changes in eligibility will cause any significant reduction in the proportion of the population who are already insured for private and semi-private care.  This view is shared by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board and is borne out by independent research <Col N="554" /> by the Economic and Social Research Institute.  There is, therefore, absolutely no basis for the suggestion which has been made by some Members of the Oireachtas in recent months that the new measures will lead to substantially increased pressures on public wards.  All the indications are that the benefits to public patients arising from the measures can be achieved without having to increase the number of public beds or to incur additional costs in the public hospital system.</P>
    <P>However, the programme contains a commitment to monitor the operation of the new arrangements.  If there are teething problems the Minister is satisfied that they will be overcome and he will take whatever action proves necessary in order to ensure that the fundamental objective of equity of access is achieved to the greatest extent possible.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Health Funding placed great emphasis on the complementary roles of public and private healthcare.  When those who can afford to do so decide to take financial responsibility for their own hospital expenses, for example, by taking out voluntary health insurance, those who rely on the statutory services benefit also since there are more resources available to meet their needs. It is also unquestionable that public patients, and the public hospital system in general, benefit from the availability in that system of the highest calibre of consultant, which is encouraged by the existence of private practice in public hospitals.  The Commission on Health Funding, whose primary concern was so much related to ensuring equity of access to services, argued clearly that there was nothing wrong with people being able to get hospital care more quickly by going privately at their own expense, provided that the public patient has a reasonable service and is not disadvantaged as a result of the private patient's access.  It is the scope for such a disadvantage, through the possible queue-jumping of private patients into public beds, which is being specifically addressed in the new measures.  The balanced mix of public and private healthcare will continue.  The <Col N="555" /> programme contains a commitment to ensure that the public hospital system continues to cater adequately for the needs of private patients, and that the important role and contribution of voluntary health insurance is not diminished in any way.  The announcement by the Minister for Finance in this year's budget that income tax relief on voluntary health insurance subscriptions will be maintained is a practical and positive demonstration of this commitment.</P>
    <P>The Bill also deals with one aspect of eligibility which did not arise from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  The opportunity presented by the need to amend the eligibility provisions in the Health Act is being taken to provide a statutory basis for operating a residency qualification for access to services under the Act.  For reasons which I will now explain, it is necessary to do this in order to ensure that groups such as young Irish emigrants and persons working temporarily abroad are catered for fairly and on the basis of standard guidelines.</P>
    <P>It has long been the practice to operate a residency qualification for entitlement to health services in Ireland and, indeed, this is the practice in most other countries also.  A person is regarded as &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; to the healthcare system of the country of residence.  If he needs healthcare while in another country, he is subject to whatever arrangements that country makes for non-residents.  This would never, of course, mean being denied necessary treatment, but it can mean being liable for the cost of providing it.</P>
    <P>In the absence of a statutory basis for the residency qualification, it has not been possible to have any statutory or uniform criteria for determining when a person should be regarded as qualifying. The Commission on Health Funding pointed out that this can lead to uncertainty, and the operation of different criteria in different areas.  Under the Bill's provisions, the sections of the Health Act dealing with the two categories of eligibility will both be amended to insert &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo; as a qualification. <Col N="556" /> There is also a provision to empower the Minister for Health to issue guidelines on uniform criteria for regarding a person as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo; for this purpose. These guidelines will be for the use of the health boards in deciding on eligibility, and also for appeals officers under the new appeals system on health eligibility matters which is currently being established.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains certain safeguards in relation to this issue.  Section 9 specifies that the new provision will not in any way affect the arrangements under which residents of EC member states may obtain necessary services, while temporarily in another EC country, on the same basis as if they were living there. The Bill also provides that the powers of a chief executive officer of a health board is available to him to award full eligibility on hardship grounds to someone who would not normally qualify, and will extend to giving eligibility, where it is warranted, to persons who do not meet the criteria for &ldquo;ordinary residence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Before formulating guidelines on the criteria for being regarded as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;, the Minister for Health proposes to arrange for discussions between the Department of Health and the health boards on the common problems which arise at present in the interpretation of residence.  The Minister's intention is to ensure that anyone with a reasonable case for being regarded as eligible for health services here is able to avail of them.  In particular, persons temporarily abroad must be catered for.  I am thinking here, for example, of recent emigrants who may not yet have established permanent residence elsewhere, and of people who go abroad to work on short term assignments but would still be regarded as maintaining their permanent residence here.  The case of foreign students in Ireland is also one which has given rise to differences in interpretation, and the Minister for Health has in mind to specify, following the relevant consultations, that registration for courses of study beyond a specified duration can be taken as qualifying the student as &ldquo;ordinarily resident&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Section 8 of the Bill provides for the amendment of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, to abolish the income ceiling for payment of health contributions.  In the budget speech, the Minister for Finance announced that this contribution would, from the 1991-92 tax year, apply to all income, as is already the case with the employment and training levy.  As the income ceiling was £16,700, the effect of its abolition is that 1¼ per cent of all gross income over that amount will now be payable, in addition, of course, to 1¼ per cent of the first £16,700.  A person earning £20,000 per annum, for instance, will pay an additional £41.25, or approximately 80p per week.  Persons earning less than £16,700 will not be affected in any way.</P>
    <P>There is no direct relationship between the income limit for category 3 health services and the income ceiling for health contributions.  They have differed from time to time and, although they have usually been the same, there is no legal or technical reason this should have been the case.  It is certainly not the case that the income ceiling on health contributions is being abolished as any kind of a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the removal of the category 3 income limit.  The purpose of the measure is to provide some of the very substantial cost of the development of community based services under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  As I outlined earlier, this will involve capital investment of £100 million over the next seven years, and will also involve yearly incremental increases in the level of current expenditure so that annual current spending on these services will be £90 million higher in real terms in seven years time than would have been the case in the absence of the programme. The total amount of additional spending over the seven years will thus cumulate to several hundred million pounds, and this will enable us to transform our community based services along the lines recommended by the various working parties and study groups in recent years.</P>
    <P>In this context, I believe that the decision to draw a greater yield from the health contribution, without in any way <Col N="558" /> affecting those earning under £16,700, is more than justified.  This income will also enable any costs to be met which arise from the eligibility extension, although I should stress that it is by no means certain at this stage that the eligibility measure should give rise to any significant extra costs, for reasons which I discussed earlier.</P>
    <P>To conclude I wish to summarise the various initiatives contained in the Bill. The Bill sets out new eligibility arrangements which were announced in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  These measures go towards rectifying a number of anomalies identified by the Commission on Health Funding and the National Economic and Social Council which arise in determining eligibility for hospital services cards.  I have in my speech explained in detail the fundamental problems inherent in the current practice of using income as the primary criterion.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will, I must stress, be of significant value to public patients and will lead to more equitable access to public hospital care.  In improving the position of public patients, the new arrangements will also continue to ensure that the public hospital system continues to cater for the needs of private patients.  Our public hospitals benefit greatly from having a balanced mix of public and private practice and the Government will strive to ensure that this balance is maintained.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the new system the Department of Health have been involved in detailed discussions with health boards, public voluntary hospitals and the medical organisations to establish the actual mechanisms for the implementation of the new measures.</P>
    <P>The operation of the new arrangements will, as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, be monitored by the Department of Health during the three year phasing in period to ensure that the system is working as intended.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these measures will be effective in improving equity of access to public hospital services and in the light <Col N="559" /> of the huge body of independent support for these measures, I am assured that they have overwhelming support.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, on his appointment and welcome him to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I want to put clearly the position of my party in relation to this legislation.  We will be opposing Second Stage for very considered reasons and not on any loose consideration.  We believe the Government are now almost officially adopting a wrong set of priorities in the health area.  People earning over £17,000 per year never asked for this amendment and they were not looking for it.  I do not consider it a priority item on the health agenda at present.  In a Utopian situation, I would love to see the day when such would be the case.  However, it is not too late for the Minister to think again and to consider going back and identifying the real priorities in health.  This amendment is not one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can imagine people being impressed by it on first reading.  I am convinced that Senator Farrell will make it look quite a pleasant document, and that is how it appears on first reading but the reality is something different.  At present we have huge numbers of people waiting for hip replacements, 2,400 people waiting for tonsillectomy operations, 3,000 people waiting for cataract operations and 1,000 people waiting for heart by-pass surgery. At the same time, there is a massive cutback in the money for each health board area.  In the North-Eastern Health Board area we will suffer a cutback of £2.5 million this year in expenditure.  We have 66,000 carers around this country who should be getting assistance but they are not.  We do not have an adequate system of respite care.  We have huge waiting lists at present.  We do not have adequate outpatient care.  On top of all this, despite many platitudinous commitments to the contrary, we have never properly addressed the question of providing an adequate public health service. <Col N="560" /> That is why I do not consider this legislation a priority at present.  We have 103 haemophiliacs waiting two years for compensation. It would be much better if that question were addressed.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's constituency, the Tallaght Hospital project has been put on ice and I would consider that a great health priority at the moment.  Throughout this country there will be seasonal closures of hospital wards.  That is proposed in virtually every health board area.  In all the hospitals at present the nursing profession, the people at the coal face of delivering our health services, are operating under incredible stress, are operating in extraordinarily difficult situations and are definitely in need of extra staff.  The other night I attended a very well conducted, very reasonable public meeting on the health services in Carrickmacross organised by the Irish Nurses Organisation.  All the nurses had stories to tell of incredible levels of stress, of an incredibly low level of morale and of incredible levels of need in each of the hospitals in which they were working. Their stories were extraordinarily depressing.  I could not sit through an experience like that, listen to those people and come here today and do anything other than oppose this legislation which is not a priority item on the health agenda.  That is what I proposed to do.</P>
    <P>There are a number of difficulties with the legislation.  The first problem is that it is almost an admission of failure on the part of Government, almost a diversionary tactic, almost a straying from the real needs of the health services.  The people to whom it is directed, who are meant to benefit from it, are not looking for this facility.</P>
    <P>The next difficulty is that there is no extra money allocated to the health services this year to match the number of new people who are supposedly going to come into public treatment.  I find that an extraordinary scenario.  If that is the case, then the only conclusion one can draw is that there will be a reduced level of service for existing public patients in our hospitals.  There will be fewer admissions this year to our hospitals because of the <Col N="561" /> long seasonal closures that will take place throughout this country this summer. That obviously is an indication that the Bill could not possibly be intended to work properly.  We are looking at fewer people being admitted because of longer seasonal closures.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister, the philosophy behind the legislation and the rationale for it comes from the health commission report.  I welcome that report and consider it to be extremely comprehensive, interesting and worthy of consideration by everybody in public life. But when the health commission recommended extending eligibility for health care they advocated it as part of a package which would include a common waiting list system.  They advocated a common waiting list system in which I passionately believe and would commend as the correct strategy for the health services at present.</P>
    <P>A common waiting list system would mean that people would be admitted to hospital irrespective of means on medical needs alone.  They would gain priority for admission to hospital on the basis of medical need.  That seems to me to be the only logical, equitable and decent system.  That was the context in which the health commission advocated extending eligibility.  The Minister has decided to maintain the existing system and not to operate the common waiting list system. We are going to continue with two waiting lists.  The Minister, in his speech, said his biggest difficulty with the common waiting list was one of practical implementation.  I do not accept that. Implicit in that &mdash; although it was not the intention &mdash; is an insult to the medical profession.  I believe the medical profession would co-operate in operating a common waiting list system.  I also believe that mechanisms could be put in place at departmental and health board levels to monitor the common waiting list system and to ensure that it worked.</P>
    <P>After a year of operating the common waiting list system on an even more regular basis, we could look at the numbers of people, the socio-economic classes they came from and whatever, who were <Col N="562" /> gaining admission to hospitals.  It could be monitored and the fact that it is difficult is no reason not to do it.  If we were to operate on the principle of not doing anything that is complex or difficult, society could not evolve in any meaningful way and there would be a very little in the way of achievement.  Most of the great social successes of our era have been difficult at the outset.  It is a false interpretation of the health commission's report to isolate the concept of full eligibility and not to realise that that full eligibility for health services was intended in the context of a common waiting list.</P>
    <P>The Gleeson report and the deal with the consultants was arrived at in the context of a common waiting list.  That was the thinking behind the Gleeson report. We are spending £35 million on the new deal with the consultants and I am not convinced &mdash; and there is nothing in this legislation that would convince me &mdash; that that money will filter through to the benefit of public patients.  I have yet to be convinced by the Minister that that will be the case.</P>
    <P>There was one fascinating aspect of the Minister's speech.  The Minister says &mdash; and I know this to be the case from media reports and from casual conversations here and there &mdash; that there will be the same level of take-up of the VHI.  He argues that this is clear from independent evidence and I accept that that might be the case.  The consultants have been given an assurance on this basis that there will be no fall-off in VHI take-up.  This raises a fundamental question: if there is going to be no drop in the number of people taking up VHI &mdash; and that contention is explicit in the Minister's speech &mdash; how in God's name will it be attractive for people to stay in the VHI, people who are already in very difficult economic circumstances with mortgages, university fees and a range of personal expenditure? How will those people find it attractive to be in the VHI unless &mdash; and this is critical &mdash; the public health sector will be worse and that it will be at such a level that it will not be attractive to participate in it.  That is the fundamentally obnoxious aspect of this legislation.  That is the most <Col N="563" /> damning feature of it.  For what the Minister hopes, in terms of VHI membership, to remain the case, there is an acceptance that there will be a second rate public health system.  That is very saddening.</P>
    <P>Assuming that large numbers of people stay in the VHI &mdash; and I am of the view that they will because of the fact that we are not taking on the health system properly &mdash; and pay the extra health levy proposed in the legislation, on the Minister's own admission there is no return for those people who will be the victims of a new and extra taxation load at a time when they are crippled by over-taxation. That is a shocking indictment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister makes the point &mdash; and it is a valid observation &mdash; that consultants are taking in private patients at present and admitting them to public wards, and that this has to be dealt with. It is the view of my party that this should be dealt with but I do not accept that this legislation is the way to deal with it.  I argue that the way to deal with that is to implement, as the health commission and the Gleeson reports intended and as the principles of equity and justice would suggest, the common waiting list system.</P>
    <P>We were told on numerous occasions publicly, and indeed recently, that a patients' charter is on its way.  In principle I welcome the concept of a patients' charter. It is necessary and can only be a good thing in the health services.  However, I find it extraordinary that the Minister has missed an opportunity to incorporate the health charter in this legislation.  If it is not incorporated in the legislation and if it is not given some statutory basis it will be nothing more than a sort of statement of what should be the case.  There will be no recourse for people to actually gain redress under it.  I am not convinced that the Minister is serious about the patients' charter when in fact it is not incorporated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>The fundamental position I would put to the Minister on this legislation and the reason I am opposing the legislation and that my party will be opposing Second Stage is that we as a party are absolutely <Col N="564" /> horrified with the gross tragedies and the gross needs throughout the health services at the moment, with the huge waiting lists, the absence of a complete service and at a time when that is the case the Minister is introducing something we consider to be unnecessary.  On that basis all this House can reasonably do is reject this Bill and refer it back to the Dáil because I consider it a waste of time. What we should be doing this evening is discussing how in God's name we can deal with the crisis in the health services at every level and how we can deliver a quality of health care to people in need, how we can deal with the carers, the nurses, with all of the people at the coal face of the health service.  That should be our agenda today, not providing eligibility for people who are not looking for it.  It is a whole wrong set of priorities.  It is quite bizarre and on that basis could not be accepted.</P>

      <P>I must put on the record of the House that Second Stage is intended to deal with the specific purposes for which this Bill is intended.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáilte mór roimh an tAire ar an céad tám atá sé ins an Teach seo.  I welcome the Minister of State to this House.  He had wide experience of health matters before he took up office.  His involvement with the health board and in the health services in the city of Dublin has given him a broad experience of dealing with health.  I wish him every success in his new ministry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I will quote the old old proverb: He that has no time for his health today may have no health for his time tomorrow.  At present this is the biggest problem we have, so many people are abusing their health to such an extent that they are putting increasing demands on the health services, particularly in regard to the abuse of alcohol, drugs and so on.  This causes many serious road <Col N="565" /> accidents and other problems and is putting great strain on the health services. This year we are spending £1,500 million on health services, that is £400 per head of population.  When you consider all the people who do not go to hospitals, when you consider all the people who are in the VHI, what is it costing per head of those who are attending hospitals?  We always talk about there not being enough money.  Of course there will never be enough money for anything.  It is only a short time ago since we were told that if we got £1 million more per health board, it could leave us quite happy, £8 million would solve all of our problems.  The Minister gave us that £8 million, £8 million extra this year.  It has allowed much good work to be done and to continue to be done but I would also like to point out that during the run of this programme before us each health board will be receiving £11 million extra because there is going to be £90 million extra provided under this Bill, that is £11 million extra per health board.  To say that there will not be sufficient money to run this does not make sense.  There was no real opposition to this Bill from the other side.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in regard to medical card eligibility.  This is something we have been talking about for a long time.  Under the medical card system, when applicants were being assessed, social employment scheme money and family income supplement were taken into account.  We always opposed this. Indeed the North Western Health Board sent in resolutions which I gladly supported, to have that system abolished.  It was very unfair that we should take that type of income into account when assessing means for a medical card.  Under this Bill such income will not be taken into account.  We are going to have a more solid and honest base for assessing medical card eligibility.  I believe that will be a great advantage to many people in the lower income groups.</P>
    <P>It is right and proper that everybody should be entitled to free hospital beds. What happened in the past was that there was a certain number of beds.  Many consultants ensured that they put the <Col N="566" /> maximum number of private patients through their practice and they put them into public beds.  Medical card people and the public health people were left in the queue longer and longer, many of them hoping that some rich uncle or someone else would come along and give them the money.  There is one thing I can never understand about hospitals.  We hear all about people being overworked and overwrought but we should have a balance, and we do not have that balance. There must be good wages, good conditions but there also must be good production.</P>
    <P>It always amazed me how you could be on a waiting list and have to wait perhaps two years while at the same if you decided to go private the same staff could take you in straight away.  There would be no problem.  If staff are so overworked how can they take in people who have money in their pockets?  It makes a farce of saying that they are overworked.  I am pleased that this Bill will put an end to that system and put an end to queue jumping.  Those who go private will go into private beds and the public beds will not be taken up by fee-paying patients. People with medical cards who want to go public will be able to do so and get full treatment.  That is the good thing about the Bill before us.  It is flexible because often people who go to England for a short time are taken off the register, which is the usual way of knowing whether a person is in residence or not. If they are off the voters' register they must not be in residence.  Even if they are not on the register they could still be in residence because they might have gone for a short time.  I am pleased also that tourists will be covered under EC regulations and nobody will be left in need of medical care.</P>
    <P>A point was made about the closure of beds during the summer.  This is nothing new.  Much has been made of this in recent times but the beds are those reserved for patients for elective treatment, that is, treatment that is not urgent.  In many cases the people waiting for elective treatment never go for it.  We are told by the professionals that they <Col N="567" /> cannot carry out this treatment without having a full backup service and assistance. Therefore, if we were to keep this system going all year round we would have to double the number of staff, appoint more consultants and more backup service.  That would be impossible. It is only to facilitate people going on holidays that wards are closed.  Wards have to be refurbished, decorated and maintained and a period in the year has to be set aside to do this maintenance. While the ward may appear to be closed it is being refurbished for the coming year.  It is not right to be making this hullabaloo about closure.  This has always been the case down through the years.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the waiting list for hip replacement operations. I am pleased to say that in my health board area we have now four orthopaedic surgeons while a few years ago we had only one.  I believe that the hip replacement waiting list will be up to date very shortly.  It started only a few years ago and for a number of years people were afraid to go for the operation. It has become so successful that people are availing of it and it is great that they can do so.  We are going to have more problems in this regard because joint replacement is now becoming the big thing.  Hips, knees and other joints are being replaced.  High tech medicine is very good but there is a limit to what we can spend.  It is in high-tech medicine that the holdup and delays occur; it is not in the ordinary medicine as we knew it some years ago.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as an emergency that cannot be treated.  No matter what emergency there was here over the years, the one thing every public representative did was to pay tribute to the hospital services for the able manner in which they dealt with each emergency that arose. There is no problem about emergencies.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have no doubt that it will be for the betterment of all. Many people have been asking for years that everybody be entitled to free hospital treatment.  In the past people paid consultants for the operation and then the <Col N="568" /> hospital had to provide the remainder of the services.  Under the new system, if patients go private, the hospital will get money; everybody will get money.  It will not be a question of the consultant being paid and the hospital providing the services. That will work for the benefit of everybody.</P>

      <P>The only way to describe this Bill &mdash; since it attempts to go in the direction in which I would like the medical services to go, but does not go half far enough, and I cannot oppose it &mdash; is that it is profoundly dishonest, because it does not do what it sets out to do.  It does not give people free hospitalisation in a public ward.  The best it does is to guarantee people that for the first 30 days of a year that they are in hospital they will not have to pay more than £125.  After that the people are caught by a classic Catch 22, which, may I say, has characterised Governments since 1987 in which they appeared to do one thing on the surface and do the exact opposite underneath.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I am permitted I will mention two areas as examples.  For instance, in the area of poverty they have given the impression that they are doing wonderful things about certain groups while at the same time reducing the taxation element of expenditure on social welfare, and they were actually spending less up to this year than they were four years ago.  They reduced expenditure on social welfare and gave the impression they were doing something about poverty.  They have done the same job of reducing expenditure on local authority housing in a dramatic fashion, but giving the impression that they were doing something about some of the more spectacular needs.  What they are getting very good at is identifying the area of need in a particular category and saying, &ldquo;We will target that group and we will be very good about this group.&rdquo;  They are doing things that of themselves are extremely good, for instance, about homelessness, homeless children, certain categories of poor people and the unemployed, while at the same time cutting back severely on <Col N="569" /> all other areas of expenditure in those areas.</P>
    <P>What we have is a very clever way of making the less poor pay for some remedial action on behalf of the extremely poor.  We do it via social insurance on small incomes to pay for higher unemployment assistance for long term unemployed people.  We do it by reducing public authority housing and using a proportion of the money saved to do very publicly acceptable high profile things about homelessness.  That is a very clever trick that both the present Coalition and the previous Fianna Fáil Government have become expert at.  This one is a classic of its kind because nowhere in the Minister's speech or in the legislation will one see any reference to Statutory Instruments No. 180 of 1976, which states:</P>
    <P>These regulations may be cited as the Health (Charges for inpatient Service) Regulations, 1976.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) (1) of that statutory instrument states:</P>
    <P>A charge towards the cost of inpatient services provided under section 52 of the Act may be made on a person who is not a person with full eligibility where a person (a) has no dependants and has been in receipt of inpatient services for 90 days or for periods aggregating in total 90 days within the previous 12 months.  The charge under this article shall be at the rate not exceeding the income of the person, less a sum of £2.50 a week or less such larger sum as may be determined by the chief executive officer of the health board.</P>
    <P>What that means is that after 90 days a person could be charged their full income, less £2.50 a week.  That was the figure in 1976 and it is still the figure today.  The health board on the arbitrary judgment of a chief executive officer can deduct everything out of a single person's income except £2.50 if they are in a hospital for more than 90 days.  The rationale behind that was that they were people who were in long term institutional care.</P>
    <P>However bad that was, it went from being a reasonable object of complaint to being entirely ludicrous when the Minister <Col N="570" /> for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, introduced Statutory Instrument No. 300 of 1987, which sought to bring the other one up to date by reducing the period from 90 days to 30 days.  The situation today is that after 30 days in any hospital &mdash; and there are no exceptions to this &mdash; a single person may have their whole income deducted to pay for the cost of hospital care.  Something that began as a provision for long term patients has become a backdoor method for health boards to raise funds.  The only statutory limit is the cost of care or the person's income.  Generously enough, they have provided that the person can have £2.50 a week left out of their income.  That is the only guarantee people have in legislation about what can be done.</P>
    <P>How can we wave a bit of legislation around and say, this is great; this is free hospitalisation?  It is free hospitalisation if you are not sick for longer than 30 days in a year, but if you get sick for any longer it is far from free.  If you happen to be confined to a psychiatric hospital and you observe the obscure regulations of the VHI, you will discover that if you are actually at work and on sick leave the VHI will not cover you either.  This is, as I have said, a classic.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing in the extreme that neither the Commission on Health Funding nor the trade union movement or anybody else seems to appreciate that we do not have any right to free hospitalisation for anybody for more than 30 days.  For the first 30 days the most you can be caught for is £125.  After that you can be caught for the full amount of your income, less £2.50 per week, and the upper limit for what you can be caught for is the economic cost of that bed.  It is profoundly dishonest to describe that as free hospital care.  It is not free hospital care, but it is a backdoor charge under a gloss of doing something very impressive.</P>
    <P>I have a specific case in mind of somebody in one of the health boards.  I am not going to say any more than that, because the last time I mentioned a specific case it involved the school where my own children attend and I had the Minister's office on to me wanting to berate the board of management in the school for something I would blame the <Col N="571" /> Department of Education for.  I do not want that to happen, so I will not be specific.  But I know somebody got a bill for £2,700 from a health board because they were seriously ill and had to be in a psychiatric hospital.  This is a simple person at work and because the individual has a relatively large income the bill was £2,700.  He was in a public hospital, in a public ward, and he got landed with a bill for that amount. This legislation will make not one scrap of difference.</P>
    <P>We also know what happened under these two wonderful little regulations that float around on the periphery and which undermine all the wonderful phraseology of all this.  These two pieces of subsidiary legislation mean that at least in the health board area I live in, the Southern Health Board, they have a little trick.  If you are in hospital for more than 30 days they withdraw your full eligibility on the grounds that you are no longer eligible for a medical card because you are in hospital care.  They take away your medical card and then they start charging you after 30 days if you are in the sort of hospitals where you are less likely to protest.  They do not do it in acute hospitals, but not because there is any prohibition on it.  Let us remember, these regulations apply, there are no qualifications, no limitations, this is a charge for in-patient hospital care.  I find it quite extraordinary that we are talking about legislation to make hospitals free while we have regulations under the same 1970 Health Act to charge people for hospital care.</P>
    <P>I find the whole thing quite astonishing. It is meaningless.  It is a fine and noble gesture for people who have occasional serious illnesses that do not last for more than 30 days.  There is no guarantee in this legislation that people will not be landed with enormous hospital bills.  Cash strapped health boards have become positively rapacious in their endeavours to collect money.  Debt collection agencies have been engaged in my own area to put pressure on old age pensioners to pay their hospital bills under these regulations.  These poor people are persuaded by the Government &mdash; and, I regret, with the apparent unwitting cooperation <Col N="572" /> of the trade union movement &mdash; that they have an entitlement to free hospital care.  They have, if they do not get sick for more than 30 days.  The whole thing is ludicrously meaningless.  It is a smokescreen because of the existence of those regulations.  There may have been some logic to long term patients, that is, those who are in hospital for more than 90 days, having to make a contribution. There is no logic other than the cutback mentality that has run away with this Government in the area of health care, to this 30 day restriction.</P>
    <P>It is so extraordinarily ludicrous, I have seen eminent economists of a right wing persuasion talking about the country operating a free national health service that we cannot afford.  What really cannot be afforded is the sort of bills that some people are getting when they have the misfortune to be in hospital for longer than 30 days.  I find the whole thing ludicrous in the extreme: that people can be stuck with those sort of bills and at the same time we are told we have free hospital care.  That is the first major problem.</P>
    <P>The second major problem is the extraordinary optimism of the Minister about the capacity of health boards to regulate some of these things.  It is a phrase that I think is familiar to everybody.  He talks about the improved management of beds as a way of guaranteeing that there will not be any problems with this.  We have had four years of ministerial exhortations to improve the management of beds. What we have had is the tragic signs of a particularly non-militant trade union, the Irish Nurses Organisation, who do not have a reputation of being anything other than intensely committed to the welfare of patients, feeling obliged to put their members on strike in the South-Eastern Health Board region because of the state of the hospitals.  They are not making it up.  Nurses do not go on strike, do not withdraw their labour, particularly nurses in the INO, without considerable provocation and considerable upset to themselves.</P>
    <P>That is the reality of this exhortation to good management.  It is a reality of overstretched people, nurses in particular, whose commitment to their <Col N="573" /> patients is being presumed upon shamefully by many health boards, people who are racing around in a state of near exhaustion from overwork, trying to keep up with a burden of work that is ludicrously disproportionate to the resources they have at their disposal.  To talk about, as the Minister did, the idea that somehow better management will work is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other things in the Minister's speech that bother me. One is this idea of the categorisation of beds as private or public in public hospitals.  It has echoes that trouble me. My view, for what it is worth &mdash; and like most middle class people I have Voluntary Health Insurance cover &mdash; is that if people want private medicine they should have it in private hospitals.  So be it, if they want it let them have it.  My view also is that it is a particularly slight assessment of the worth of the best of our medical profession to assume that if we did not allow them to have private practice in public hospitals they would all desert the public service and run into the private sector.  There is no evidence to sustain that.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom many consultants by deliberate choice do not do any private practice, because they are happy to work in the public service on a good salary, doing a public service and doing it in a way which means that medical priority alone will be the criterion on which they will decide to deal with patients.  There is this sort of trite suggestion that the justification for continuing to have private beds in public hospitals is so that these poor, sensitive, delicate consultants, who need, apparently, these enormously inflated incomes that they will get out of private practice to keep them in the public service, will not desert the ship.  I do not think it is true.  I do not think many of them want to.</P>
    <P>My view is if the only motive a good consultant has for working in a public hospital, if the only thing that keeps him there is the extra income he gets out of private practice, the public service would be better off without him, because if that is his or her priority then quite clearly the service they will give will not be based on any sort of profound medical reasons but <Col N="574" /> it will be based on &mdash; and this is the Minister's perception not mine &mdash; their own greed and their own need to have more and more money.  As if the new salary of £35,000, £40,000 or £50,000 was not enough, we have to let them have private practice so that they can achieve whatever sort of inflated income they want, and many of them appear to have a perception of an income that is in excess of that of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that people need this sort of income, nor do I believe that all of the good recently highly qualified young doctors this country has produced, many of whom are living abroad, would need that sort of income to come home to work full time in a well run public hospital care system.  That is entirely ludicrous. It is quite offensive, when you read about it, to assume that this sort of private practice is a necessary incentive to keep good doctors in the public sector. It is not in other countries where they have comprehensive national health services and there is no reason it should be here.  If they want to make money let them take all the risks and run a private hospital, not have a foot in each camp with a guaranteed income from the State and a guaranteed guarantee from the State to be able to extend their income by private practice essentially at the State's expense.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to outpatient services.  Can he give us a guarantee that people who are entitled to free outpatient services will be seen by a consultant? From what I know the health system in many cases it is rarely a consultant who conducts those clinics and it is often a junior doctor.  The phrase &ldquo;junior doctor&rdquo; is one of those concoctions of the medical profession that is profoundly offensive.  Some of the junior doctors are senior to half the Members of this House in age and also have perhaps ten to 15 years' experience.  But the medical profession has created this kind of profession where the only people who are permanent are consultants.  It is a wonderful hierarchial system which keeps everyone else in a state of considerable obeisance to the wonderful consultant, but it is a ridiculous system.  There should be career levels for doctors in hospitals at all levels <Col N="575" /> in the same way as there are in every other area of work.  In universities you do not have career professors, with everyone else on their way to some where else.  You have people who are employed at various levels and you should have people in various levels in hospitals, not just consultants who are permantent with pensionable positions &mdash; not all of them, but you should have some.</P>
    <P>What guarantee do the poor misfortunate people who have to depend on the public health service have, if they go to an outpatient department, that they will be seen by a consultant?  What guarantee do we have that the people who are not going to be charged for going to outpatient departments and who will get a bill from the hospital will be seen by the consultant and not by one or other of his or her juniors?  The truth is we have no guarantee, because nobody can guarantee that these services will be delivered. This legislation is so riddled with presumptions and assumptions about what is happening in the health services as to be almost meaningless.  It incapsulates within itself a principle, and therefore you cannot vote against the Bill on principle, but you have to deal with the realities.</P>
    <P>I am still intrigued as to the state of play with the new consultant salaries.  I have long said that I would be quite happy to support the idea of a dramatic and significant increase in consultant salaries if that would get us cast iron guarantees that consultants in public hospitals would devote their talents exclusively to the service of patients in public hospitals; and if people were not happy with that let them go to private hospitals where the private consultants, taking the risk of working in the private sector, could earn whatever they could command from selling their service on the private market as a perfectly legitimate and reasonable thing to do.  As far as I can see &mdash; and I have a certain insight into it for domestic reasons &mdash; we are far from getting any cast iron guarantee that under the new and extraordinary salaries that have been paid to consultants there will be such a guarantee that they will actually be working in the public sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> I do not understand at present how a consultant who is supposed to be in the hospital for 33 hours a week, can also be running a lucrative private practice in a private hospital.  For instance, in Dublin many of the consultants in the Blackrock Clinic are attached to other hospitals.  Do they have the powers of bilocation, or are they working 19 hour days to be able to look after patients in the public hospitals and patients in the private hospitals at the same time?  What is going on?  Does anyone know, or are these people accountable to anybody?  In my own small area of work in the public sector I have to be in a certain place at a certain time to do a certain job, and it is very easy to identify whether I am there or not.  Apparently, it is not possible to identify under the present regime whether a consultant is in the hospital on a particular day, will be there on a particular day or will be there for a particular set of hours.  The common contract &mdash; and I have read it &mdash; has so many bolt holes and ways out.</P>
    <P>If the rest of us in the public sector had a similarly benevolent contract available to us, in terms of what cannot be done to us by our management, we would be most grateful to our unions; but apparently our unions, for reasons that are perfectly reasonable, would not be able to extract similar concessions to those that the present Taoiseach granted to the consultants when the common contract was introduced in his period as Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The legislation is riddled with inconsistencies. It is profoundly dishonest.  It is a meaningless standing on its head of legislative priorities to produce a Bill which says it is giving people free hospital care while at the same time two pieces of theoretically subsidiary legislation say the exact opposite: that after 30 days you pay up limitless amounts, £200 to £250, if you can afford it, less £2.50.  I know it does not operate.  In the Southern Health Board area it is 80 per cent of your income.  Are they not very generous? They leave you with 20 per cent of your income if you are in hospital for more than 30 days.  That is what is wrong with the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not want to spend too much time <Col N="577" /> on the Minister's speech.  There are some things in it which, if they work, are very worthwhile, particularly his reference to some sort of rational approach to eligibility for medical cards.  I read somewhere that part of that rational approach would be a rational approach to the process of appealing against refusals of medical cards, because that has been for a considerable period of time a matter of extraordinary injustice.  I have always felt it was one that was ripe for challenge in the courts, because in some health boards the appeal against a chief executive officer's decision to refuse a medical card goes to the chief executive officer.  You have a person adjudicating on the appeal on his own decision.  Could anything be more ludicrous than that?  I am glad that that is being dealt with.  I am glad that the philosophical principle that underlines this has been accepted, the philosophical principle that people should not be able to jump queues and get into private beds in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>I am worried about some of the phraseology about beds being identified as public or private, because the Minister's speech is full of these optimistic assumptions that they will work out precisely to a &ldquo;t&rdquo; what proportion of beds are public and private in terms of demand for hospital care.  If these workings out are not possible, are we going to end up in a situation with private beds remaining empty in a public ward and public patients being refused because the only beds that are empty are private beds?  I accept that in emergencies this will not happen, but for non-emergency care in a hospital are we going to end in a situation where we will have private beds empty, public beds all full and people being told: &ldquo;Come back next week?  There are no beds available for you because you are a public patient&rdquo; or will we have the reverse?  Will we have consultants telling their private patients: &ldquo;I am sorry, all the private beds are full.  There are only public beds empty and you cannot have one of those?&rdquo; I doubt if we will have that.  My view is that at the end of the day it is the poor who will suffer when choices like that have to be made.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on this.  In regard to these famous regulations that I have <Col N="578" /> quoted at length, it is wonderful to watch in a cynical sort of a way how they are operated.  They are not operated generally in acute hospitals, because patients in acute hospitals usually have articulate families and are often articulate themselves and they can howl.  The views about psychiatric patients in psychiatric hospitals are perhaps different.  It is one thing to get somebody up at a public meeting and say &ldquo;I had a hernia and I could not get into a hospital because there were no beds&rdquo;.  It is another thing to say &ldquo;I was psychiatrically ill and I could not get into a hospital because there were no beds&rdquo;.  Because of the nature of society's perceptions of psychiatric illness most people will not publicly campaign and complain about the quality of psychiatric care because it targets them as being somehow, in terms of public perception, unwell.</P>
    <P>Would any member of either House of the Oireachtas get up in public and say &ldquo;yes I was in a psychiatric hospital for a period of a week or a month&rdquo; whereas all of us will happily talk about our experiences in general hospitals.  There is a stigma and because of that people will not complain very much about what happens to them in psychiatric hospitals and because of that I suspect many health boards believe you can get away with things in terms of psychiatric patients that you would not get away with in terms of patients in the general medical service; hence the application of these mysterious little regulations, where we have the definition of a long-stay patient being anybody who is in hospital for any more than 30 days.</P>
    <P>It is another of the sleights of hand that have characterised the last four years where a good thing appears to be being done, while nothing is being done.  It is something that, philosophically, if it actually meant anything, would be very worthwhile but, in fact, in the way it will operate will be quite meaningless.  We will still, as I said &mdash; and this is the fundamental issue &mdash; leave large numbers of people liable to substantial bills, old people liable to have all of their pensions taken from them if they are in hospital <Col N="579" /> for more than 30 days, single working people liable to have all of their income up to the cost of the bed, less £2.50 statutorily and perhaps a bit more, taken from them if they are in hospital for more than 30 days.  In such a regime where that sort of unqualified right to charge still exists, to talk about the provision of free hospitalisation is a joke.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood) Chris Flood">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Flood)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those Senators who have contributed to this afternoon's debate which we all found very informative indeed.  It is an expression of their own commitment to the Department which I operate in, the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>I want to respond to a few points which were made by the various contributors. Senator O'Reilly said he welcomed, in principle, the question of the provision of a patients' charter.  This is something that has been welcomed by many people with an interest in the health service, bearing in mind, of course, that the patients' charter will be based on a number of very specific principles.  Very briefly, they are: the right of access to services in accordance with need; the right of considerate and respectful care; the right to privacy; the right to information, the right to confidentiality of all medical records; the right to refuse to participate in research projects; the right to respect for religious and philosophical beliefs; and, of course, the right to make a complaint.  We all agree that a patients' charter is long overdue.  The Minister has given a specific undertaking to have all of those issues contained within the charter implemented without delay.  That is something I am quite sure Senator O'Reilly and the other contributors here and in the Dáil will welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly also referred to waiting lists.  Waiting lists, unfortunately, whether we like it or not, are a feature of all health systems, particularly all modern health systems.  The Government have placed strong emphasis on tackling the waiting lists in a co-ordinated way.  I wish to give Senators some small example of progress which we have made: the waiting list for hip replacement <Col N="580" /> operations has decreased by 16 per cent since April 1990; the waiting list for cataract operations has decreased by 12 per cent since 1989.  We are making some significant progress in dealing with these waiting lists and indeed for open heart surgery and ear, nose and throat surgery. The purpose of this Bill, obviously, is to help reduce waiting lists for public patients by making public beds more available to them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly also raised the very important question of VHI membership. The Economic and Social Research Institute have carried out an independent research into this issue which concludes that the extension of eligibility for professional fees will not have any significant effect on the proportion of the population who opt to join the VHI.  That is an independent research carried by the Economic and Social Research Institute and that is the information available to us.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note also that the majority of the membership of the VHI are in category 2 in terms of health eligibility and are, therefore, entitled to public consultant care.  This is some further evidence that extending the entitlement to higher income group should not be expected to affect VHI membership to any significant extent.</P>
    <P>At this point also Senator O'Reilly went a little parochial, if he does not mind me saying so, and referred to the North-Eastern Health Board allocation. May I put on the record of the House that the North-Eastern Health Boards 1990 allocation was £61.050 million and 1991 the allocation was £63,855,000, a 4.6 per cent increase.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Reilly referred to the Tallaght Hospital, a project in which I have had very great interest.  The capital allocation for 1991 for the Department of Health did not allow for the commencement of any major new capital project. In the circumstances the building of the new Tallaght Hospital could not commence in 1991.  The Minister for Health is currently drawing up a submission which he will be putting to Government on the capital requirements of the health services in future years.  This will include provision for the Tallaght <Col N="581" /> project.  Obviously we are all anxious that the project proceed as quickly as possible. It is a major project at £120 million.  It will be no mean achievement to assemble that kind of financing and guarantee it during the course of the construction period.  All of us with an interest in Tallaght will be anxious to see the hospital coming forward as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>With regard to the common waiting list to which Senator O'Reilly also referred, this matter was raised in the context of the Commission on Health Funding. There are two serious reservations which we have about the commission's recommendation in this area.  First, the recommendation could result in the public patient being disadvantaged.  The commission's recommendation relied on the monitoring of admissions to ensure that private patients were not admitted to the available beds ahead of public patients with greater medical need.  There could be great difficulties in practice with this recommendation since the decision to admit a specific patient is, and must always be, the clinical decision of the consultant concerned.  For this reason the Government and the social partners believed that the public patient would be best protected by ensuring that for non-emergency treatment public beds were available exclusively to public patients.</P>
    <P>On the second reservation, I am very much aware that it is the view of those involved that, in the interests of the public hospital system and of the public patient, it is important to maintain the balanced mix of public and private care in our public hospitals.  The public patient benefits from the availability of the best and most skilled consultants who can be retained in the public hospital system because of the opportunities for private practice there.  Under the new arrangements any increased demand for private care can be met by expanding the number of private and semi-private beds in the public hospitals without disadvantaging the public patient.  This expansion will be possible because it will be self-funding. If there was a common waiting list applied to these beds such an extension would not be possible.  The likelihood is that the focus of private practice would begin to move away from the public <Col N="582" /> health hospital system.  In the long run this would be much more to the disadvantage of the public patient.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the question of long-stay charges after 30 days.  The Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, stated in the Dáil yesterday that, following the raising of the matter during the Committee Stage debate on the Health (Amendment) Bill, 1991, he has been in contact with a number of health boards to establish the position in relation to acute hospitals.  It was the Minister's understanding from his inquiries that the charge was applied in some cases where patients were receiving services of a long-stay nature although they might, in fact, be in acute hospitals.  This would include, for instance, certain patients in psychiatric units in acute hospitals and also certain geriatric patients who might, for example, be maintained in an acute hospital awaiting transfer to a geriatric facility.  The Minister also announced that, in view of the fact that these charges which have been in operation for 15 years going back to 1976, and are now giving rise to certain problems of application, he was arranging to have a whole area of long-stay charges reviewed by his Department.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell spoke strongly in defence of the public patient.  I want to confirm that the whole purpose of the Bill is to ensure that public beds are available for public patients and that, as was the case up to now, private patients will no longer be able to occupy public beds, which may have caused disadvantage to public patients in the past and that in future a private patient who opts to go privately will have to occupy only a private bed except in certain cases of emergency which will apply to both public and private patients.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell also referred in general to the funding of the health service and the provision of high-tech treatment. This is a very important aspect of the delivery of health services involving increased growth in expenditure whereby high-tech treatment can be very costly. This has to be taken into account and is being examined by the Minister in every appropriate case.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan was critical of what he <Col N="583" /> might have termed as good management aspiration in the hospital setting, particularly as it applied to nursing staff.  Good management in any centre is always a good objective, a meritorious objective. One can always improve in management whether it is in the management of technology, the management of base or the management of outpatient departments, etc.  Good management is something we need to address in a specific way to the health service in an effort to improve conditions for those who need to do business with the health service.  We would all be in agreement on that.</P>
    <P>With regard to private medicine being practised in public hospitals, it has been the tradition to mix public and private practice in our hospitals.  It has proved useful and assured that consultants are available to the public patients as well. We are anxious that that continues.  The mix has also been good.  In this Bill we are talking about designating the public bed or designating the private bed and being quite clear in the management of hospitals as to what is a public bed and what is a private bed.  It is time that the doubt that existed in people's minds about the classification of beds was removed.  That is a primary part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan welcomed the changes in dealing with medical card applications. All of us, who have been involved in any way in public life through our clinics or on a health board, as I have been, will know that there has been very great concern by the public as to the uniformity of approach in awarding the medical card.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm, for the benefit of Senator Ryan and others in this House, that the independent medical card appeal system is being established.  It will probably be something along the lines of the independent appeals system recently established in the Department of Social Welfare.  It gives people an opportunity to have their say and have their cases dealt with rationally, with a high degree <Col N="584" /> of uniformity which was lacking up to now.  We all agree that this decision, with regard to medical card applications, is most welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also raised the question of consultants and the common contract. Some issues which he raised this afternoon in the course of Second Stage debate have been part of the negotiations with the medical profession which have now been concluded.  Many of the points he raised have found their way into the discussions on the common contract and have been included.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered most of the points raised.  I want to return to the primary purpose of the Bill which is to provide for the new eligibility arrangements arising from the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  As we have already stated the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> provides for the extension of eligibility for public consulant services to the entire population. The programme also provides for the introduction on a phased basis of modifications to the arrangements for admission to public hospitals.  These new arrangements will improve equity of access to public hospital services by removing these elements of the present arrangements which may in practice be unfair to the public patient.</P>
    <P>I am also very pleased that the Bill provides a statutory basis for the operation of the residency qualification to determine eligibility for health services in Ireland.  The operation of the new arrangement for public hospital services will be monitored closely by the Department of Health as provided for in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It is clear to me, in the light of the discussions with the social partners, the report of the Commission on Health Funding and NESC, that there is a wide measure of support for the course of action set out in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling in relation to the amendment which stated &ldquo;that the Minister shall provide, by regulations, for the preparation of a charter of patients' rights in relation to hospital services and community health services&rdquo;. My amendment went on to explain the nature of the charter.  Before I could agree to the passing of section 2 may I say that I find it regrettable that the charter is not part of the legislation.  Giving this charter a statutory basis in legislation would have been a tremendous boost for the health services and would have ensured that people could have recourse to some document or regulations when they wished to protest about a particular situation in a hospital.  It would have set an acceptable level of waiting list, if such a thing were possible and would be much more acceptable than what exists today. A right of access to medical records would be part of such a charter and there would be a procedure for dealing with peoples' complaints.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to a charter in his reply on Second Stage but I am disappointed that it has not been included in this legislation.  Will the Minister indicate when the charter might become a reality and in what way does he think the charter can be made effective. My concern is that we could agree a charter of patients' rights which in itself would be good and welcome and would have the complete support of my party but may not have teeth or a basis in law, to give the patient the right of recourse to some forum.  I would like the Minister to indicate his plans in this area to the House and I will consider my attitude to section 2 in the light of the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 35, after &ldquo;health boards&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and these regulations shall <i>inter alia</i> provide&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  for the provision of sufficient public beds to provide care for all those who seek access as public patients in an equitable manner with the beds provided for those seeking private care, and</P>
      <P>(ii)  for the annual review of bed mix and case mix to ensure that equity continues to prevail in the allocation of in-patient hospital services&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that it will be written into the legislation that there be sufficient public beds to provide equitable care for those seeking access as public patients with those seeking private care.  It suggests an annual review of bed mix and case mix to ensure that equity continues to prevail in the allocation of in-patient hospital <Col N="588" /> services.  This is a worthwhile amendment and I urge the Minister to accept it since he indicated to the House in his Second Stage speech that he was going to ensure such a provision of beds.  If that is the Minister's commitment I cannot see why he should have any difficulty accepting an amendment which seeks to write that into the legislation.</P>
    <P>My party are concerned, as I indicated on Second Stage, about the general state of the health services but I do not propose to go over that ground again.  Our greatest concern is that there might not be equitable bed distribution resulting in an unfair advantage to some groups over others.  We are very concerned that the allocation of beds be done justly and the Minister should accept this constructive amendment which will basically write into the legislation what we all aspire to. The acceptance of this amendment would be a litmus test of our genuine concern.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that we are not implementing a common waiting list system which, despite organisational difficulties, is the best system because it takes people in on medical priority alone. This reasonable amendment does not seek to cause difficulty but to assure people that there will be a fair mix in hospital beds, that justice will be done and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>This is a worthwhile amendment but I cannot understand how it does not impose a potential charge on the Revenue but, presumably, things sometimes get past the vigilant eye of the Cathaoirleach that might not otherwise be in order.  It is a worthwhile amendment which is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the Bill and deserves for that reason to be supported.</P>
      <P>It may sound a little cavilling to say that Senator O'Reilly and Fine Gael have caught up with the health services having conspired with previous Governments to destroy them but I am glad they have rediscovered the importance of them after two or three years of silent toleration of the job done on them between 1987 and 1990.  For the philosophical conversion it represents from Fine Gael and for the principle involved I am happy to support the amendment.</P>

      <P>I want to reply to the remarks made by Senator Ryan.  I do not think the Senator seriously believes them himself but is engaging in jest because of the late hour and the holiday atmosphere prevailing.  This amendment is an indication of Fine Gael's constant concern for equity in the health service including complete availability within a just and fair system.  When we operated under economic stringencies in the past we always maintained a high level of service to patients and I know Senator Ryan is not serious in what he says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 of the Bill amends section 55 of the Health Act, 1970, by substituting a new text which provides that the health boards may make in-patient services available to persons who do not establish entitlement or who are deemed to have foregone their entitlement by choosing private medical services. This is broadly what was in the original section 55 with an adjustment to take account of the charges made in section 5 of this Bill which have already been addressed earlier.  Section 55 was, therefore, further amended by the new provision for the making of regulations setting out these services and how they are to be provided to private patients by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would help to clarify the purpose of this amendment of the Health Act for Senators if I briefly sketch out the arrangements I propose putting in place by regulations.  Under this section the proposed regulations will put in place the key elements of the new arrangements for the admission of private patients, which will be that all beds will be designated either private or public beds.  Certain special categories of beds, such as those in intensive care units, will not be designated as these must be available as required.  Elective private patients will be admitted from a private waiting list to a designated private bed.  Elective public patients will be admitted from a separate public waiting list to a designated public bed.  Emergency admissions will be accommodated in whatever bed is available at the time and to avoid unnecessary disruption of hospitals when category 3 is abolished from 1 June I propose to <Col N="590" /> phase in the new arrangement for admission to a hospital over a three year period.</P>
    <P>The first move will be to designate beds in all hospitals either private or public. Officials of my Department have already held meetings with all the voluntary hospitals and health boards around the country to explain how the new arrangements are to operate.  Hospitals have been asked to submit their plans for designating beds and for the phasing in of the new admission arrangements.  My officials are now holding a series of follow up meetings to finalise these plans which will require my approval.  I will not approve plans which result in any reduction in the number of beds available to public patients and this has been made clear to hospitals.  Once the plans are put into effect my Department will be monitoring their implementation very carefully and reporting back to me on how the new arrangements are operating.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the common waiting list and I want to point out that the new arrangements will require the operation of separate waiting lists for private and public patients. Senators will be aware that the Commission on Health Funding recommended a common waiting list and as I have already pointed out in the previous debate, I have two serious reservations about the commission's recommendation in this area.</P>
    <P>The first one is that the recommendation could result in the public patient being disadvantaged.  The commission's recommendation relied on the monitoring of admissions to ensure that private patients were not admitted to the available beds ahead of public patients with greater medical need. However, there could be great difficulties, in practice, with this recommendation since the decision to admit a specific patient is, and always must be, a clinical decision of the consultant concerned. For this reason the Government and social partners believed that the public patient could be best protected by ensuring that for non-emergency treatment, public beds were available exclusively to public patients.  Secondly, as I have already stated, I am of the opinion that it is in the interests of the public <Col N="591" /> hospital system and of the public patient to maintain the balanced mix of public and private care in public hospitals.</P>
    <P>Turning to the amendment put forward by Senator O'Reilly, I am not in a position to accept this amendment because it contains vague aspirations to provide sufficient beds in an equitable manner without defining this or saying how it is to be done.  The regulations which I propose to make under this section will include concrete measures for improving equity of access to hospital services by ensuring that publicly funded beds are available for public patients.  The designation of beds as public or private which will be required under the regulations will require my approval and I have already given a clear commitment to the House that there will be no reduction in the number of beds available to public patients.</P>
    <P>The second part of the proposed amendment calls for an annual review of the bed mix.  I will be carrying out a continuous review of the bed mix and of private and public care to ensure that the new arrangements are operating in the way I intend and if there is any need to take corrective action that will be done arising out of the ongoing continuous review.  I think they will meet the Senator's specific requirements with regard to the annual review; this review will be continuous.</P>

      <P>I take the point about the regulations being introduced but I feel this amendment would have improved the legislation and I cannot accept that there is a difficulty with incorporating this statement of principle and policy in the legislation.  We should be writing this in and eliminating all the waiting lists on a once off basis, which is our present party policy.  This statement, together with the regulations, could only improve the legislation and give people the necessary reassurance.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> In page 3, lines 36 to 42, to delete subsection (3) and subsititute the following new subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(3) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, copies of them shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of them has been pased by each such House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is very straightforward and should be readily accepted. It is based on the acceptance which we would all defend to the last, that the Houses of the Oireachtas are the primary legislative body and, as such, that regulations under this section should be put before the Oireachtas for scrutiny.</P>
    <P>That is reasonable and acceptable and I cannot see a practical difficulty with it, nor do I think it needs further elaboration, except to say that if regulations are in order they will gain the immediate approval of the Oireachtas.  If they need improvement then it is only right that they go through a process of scrutiny and I urge the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. The course being taken is the normal practice in such situations and it would not be practical, or desirable, that a debate in each House of the Oireachtas be required each time it was necessary to make variations in the regulations, no matter how minor.  Under section 6 (3) of the Bill, the Oireachtas will be able to annul any regulations should it choose to do so, so I do not think it is necessary to make the provisions proposed in the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(e) Where it is proposed to make regulations under this section, copies of them shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not come into effect until a resolution approving of them has been passed by each such House.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Essentially this amendment has the same objective as the previous one.  I do not accept the difficulty posed by the Minister if the regulations come before the Oireachtas.  I do not think the Oireachtas would obstruct any minor adjustments to the regulations that might take place over a period.  The amendment stands on its merits and I am not convinced that it is inappropriate to involve the Oireachtas at this stage because of the sensitive and serious nature of the regulations.  I cannot accept that the practical difficulty is a problem and we should not allow such considerations to interrupt us in an area so important as the delivery of health care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not support this amendment.  Section 7 of the Bill, which the proposed amendment relates to, involves inserting into section 56 of the 1970 Health Act, as amended by the Health Amendment Act, 1987, a provision to enable the Minister to make regulations specifying the circumstances in which a person may avail of consultant out-patient services.  I could not, therefore, accept the proposed amendment because I regard it as undesirable that a debate in each House of the Oireachtas should be required each time it was necessary to make variations, no matter how minor, in the detailed regulations.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the procedure set out in section 7 is the appropriate one and is in line with arrangements made in similar situations up to now.  Also of relevance is the fact that changes to the regulations may be required as a matter of urgency and having to debate the regulations in the Oireachtas would cause unacceptable delays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been a problem about health contributions from those not in the PAYE sector.  Many of the health boards have a problem with the health levy supposed to be due from the farming community and many health boards have relatively large sums of money outstanding which are a necessary part of their funding.  Since we are talking about changing the Health Contributions Act, does the Minister have anything to say about all those who should be paying their contributions in the same way as PAYE workers who have their contribution assessed on the basis of their income?  What is being done about those who are outside the PAYE sector to ensure that they make an equivalent contribution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 of the Bill deletes all reference in the Health Contributions Act, 1979, to the income ceiling on health contributions.  The income ceiling was, until now, increased each year.  For the 1990-91 tax year it stood at £16,700.  Payment of the 1.25 per cent contribution, therefore, ceased when income reached that figure.  The removal of the ceiling will obviously have no effect on anyone earning less than £16,700 per year and a person earning above £16,700 per year will now pay 1.25 per cent on the balance. For example, a person earning £20,000 who would previously have paid an annual health contribution of £208.75 &mdash; the maximum payable based on the ceiling of £16,700 &mdash; will now pay £250 per year which is an increase of £41.25 or about 80p per week.  The health contribution has often been criticised as a regressive tax bearing proportionately <Col N="595" /> more heavily on people with lower incomes.  Anyone less than £16,700 has until now been paying 11.25 per cent.  Because of the income ceiling a person earning say, £30,000 has been paying the health contribution at an effective rate of 0.7 per cent, dropping to only 0.4 per cent, for someone earning £50,000.  Everyone, regardless of income, benefits from the availability of health services and it is certainly fair that everyone should contribute in proportion to their ability to pay.</P>
      <P>The yield from this measure is estimated at £19 million in a full year most of which will accure in the January to March period as outline in more detail during the Second Stage debate.  This money will go part of the way towards meeting the very high cost of the commitment to a major development of a community based service which is included in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  It will also be put towards any increased costs arising from the extension of eligibility although, as discussed earlier, there are grounds for believing that any such cost will not be significant. Health contributions are now collected by the Revenue Commissioners and health boards are collecting arrears due before this change, that is before 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health boards have pursued a vigorous line in the collection of outstanding amounts and have notified defaulters of their intention to take legal action for the recovery of arrears.  Solicitors' letters <Col N="596" /> have been issued and some health boards have selected cases for proceedings if demands are not met.  It is likely, therefore, that a considerable portion of these arrears will have to be regarded as written off, unfortunately, because of factors such as death of person originally assessed, change of ownership of farm, etc.</P>
