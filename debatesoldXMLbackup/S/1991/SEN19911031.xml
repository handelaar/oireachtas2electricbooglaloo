      <P>I have notice from Senator Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Transport and Tourism to outline the crew content of the cost cited by Aer Lingus for landing the proposed Los Angeles service at Shannon and Dublin.</P>
      <P>I regret that I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Jackman as not suitable for dicussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take all Stages of item No. 1, Sea Pollution Bill, 1990. There will be a sos for lunch between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, certainly we will co-operate in trying to ensure that all Stages are taken today, but we cannot give any guarantee. We certainly are not agreeing to any guillotine on it but there will be co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="334" /> In view of the opinions expressed by every speaker yesterday in the debate on the reform of the Seanad, that we should be able to respond in a flexible way to major matters of moment, would it be possible to have a debate next week on the general political situation? The events in the country are being discussed everywhere except in this House. Everybody in this House would like an opportunity to put his or her views on the record and to have these matters discussed. I am asking for a general political debate next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I agree with Senator Manning that there is something distinctly peculiar about us not being able to discuss these important issues? May I move an amendment to the Order of Business so that item No. 10 be taken first today? It refers to the printing of a Bill on a Register of Members' interests. Perhaps the Leader can at least on this occasion explain to me why there is some problem about printing a Bill. I do not want to discuss it. This is a 30-second operation. I would like the Leader to explain why somehow the position of the Government is threatened by the printing of a Bill. I have been ten years in the House and I do not understand it. Maybe the Leader will explain it to me. I move: &ldquo;That item No. 10 be taken first&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Leader of the House if he would allow a debate on recent statements made by car hire/self-drive promoters to tourism interests over the past few weeks that next year's car rates will show an increase of approximately 40 per cent over current rates? Would the Leader not agree that this will have a devastating effect on the future of our tourism potential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the revocation yesterday of the licence to TV3, would the Leader make some time available at the earliest opportunity to enable the Minister for Communications, or some spokesperson, to bring us up to date in relation to the whole question of <Col N="335" /> broadcasting in light of the difficulties we had last year with the Broadcasting Bill? Could we have even a short debate in relation to the whole question of broadcasting? Secondly, in relation to the ongoing courts' dispute and the strike which is leading to a chaotic situation, could I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice the need to break this <i>impasse?</i> There are many innocent people, including the general public, being affected in various ways. If this continues much longer there will be a gradual breakdown in the whole legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's request for a debate on the political issues. It is anomalous that no debate is taking place in this House while the last three weeks have been devoted to the events that have been taking place in relation to a very large number of scandals and queries about issues of low standards in high places. It is a shame that this House has not had an opportunity to discuss a matter of major current concern. Could I say, in that context, that we are again proposing that we take motion 42 as an amendment to the Order of Business? It is the first item on the agenda and is concerned with one area, that is the non-disclosure by directors of companies of their interest in matters where there are allegations of improper and, indeed, criminal behaviour. It is important that we have a discussion where, in fact, there has been an admission by at least one person in that respect. It is of concern that the House discuss the matter.</P>
      <P>Secondly, could I ask the Leader of the House why he is proposing now that we take all Stages of the Sea Pollution Bill, in view of the fact that the Order Paper refers just to Second Stage? Surely this is a matter that should have been discussed and agreed between the Whips in advance, rather than having it simply being announced here by the Leader that this is the proposal at this point in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to address a query <Col N="336" /> to the Leader in relation to next week's business. I understand that the Defective Products Bill may arrive here next week. Therefore, I suggest that the discussion next week should be a Second Stage discussion. In relation to the likely arrival of the Bill for debate here next week, I am anxious that the debate would be no more than the Second Stage debate, in view of the recognised interest of the Minister concerned to speed legislation through this House. That has been my experience on a few occasions. It is important legislation. We can debate Second Stage but I do not want to be confronted with a situation next week in which I am told that all Stages are to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I still have not got a detailed response to my question about the programme of legislation to be initiated in this House. We had the Government Chief Whip in the House last night on other business. I made clear to him my comments on that. I also indicated that we would appreciate hearing from the Government side the list of legislation which is to be initiated in this House. I find it just a little incompatible that on one side we are rushing through legislation but we do not seem to have extracted from the Government a commitment to a programme of legislation which is to be initiated in this House. I find it demeaning to the operation of the House. We should demand from the Leader that consistent pressure be put on the Government Chief Whip to ensure that legislation is initiated in this House.</P>
      <P>I would also like to second the proposal of Senator B. Ryan that Item No. 10 be taken. It is not very much to require of Government that this Bill be printed and published. It is a very reasonable thing. In the context of comments made on both sides of the House it is in line with policy. I think goodwill should be shown in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to ask the Leader to expand on his comments yesterday when I requested that there would be a debate on the proposals to change the Treaty of Rome and on a draft Treaty of Rome. I <Col N="337" /> want to make the case that this has not happened in the past six months. We have not been able to get our hands on the draft treaty. I have been trying to get it for the last month but I have failed. We do not know what is being discussed. As legislators and supposedly leaders in this field we are not aware of what is being discussed. I am not saying that we should be necessarily objecting to change but we need to discuss the matter and to highlight aspects of it. I have a particular interest in aspects of it myself. I would ask if the specific item of the proposed changes in the Treaty of Rome, the draft Treaty that will be considered by the legislators in Maastricht in December, should be put before the House for discussion, even if it is only for Statements. Certainly we should be able to address the matter.</P>
    <P>When the Cathaoirleach referred to the papers laid before the Seanad this morning, I felt there was an attempt to slow down the people of Clare. I am referring to the increase in the areas under speed limits under the Road Traffic (Speed Limits) County of Clare Regulation, 1991. I am not sure that we could have agreed to that in this House. Will the Leader say whether the comments and views of the representatives from that county have been obtained or is this a nasty attempt to slow down the people of Clare and to extend speed limits? It is a matter which should be discussed in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is too much ambition in Clare for them to be slowed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, we will look after Clare. You should just look after yourself. Clear was fine before you came along and it will be fine when you are gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator O'Toole in his call for a debate on the changes that are about to take place in the Treaty of Rome. We are now just five weeks away from the summit. These matters are going to affect <Col N="338" /> not just our generation but generations to came and the views of the people as expressed through the representatives of this House should be made known.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to support the call of Senator B. Ryan for publication of the Bill he referred to. I argued with a Member of the European Parliament that Members should declare their interests. There were very good reasons in the European Parliament Particularly for that and I can see that there are reasons now in this country also for us to have a declaration of interest by Members of both Houses.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, I would like to support Senator Foley in relation to his call for a debate on car rental costs. However, that should be broadened to include all car costs. The cost of buying a car in Ireland is prohibitively high. It is not entirely due to VAT and excise duties. There are other factors which must be examined. Car insurance costs are excessively high. Car hire costs are now such a that visitors to this part of this island are regularly coming through Northern Ireland in order to hire a car at about half or one-third of the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that all sides of the House should share the concern that has just been most recently expressed by my colleague, Senator Raftery, in relation to the forthcoming Maastricht summit. I suggest to the Leader of the House that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who would obviously be at the coal face in relation to all of these matters, should be asked to come to the House for a debate and perhaps enlighten the House as to the Government's position in the very complex issues which are facing this country and which, as Senator Raftery has quite correctly said, will affect not only this generation but generations to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to support the call from my colleague, Senator Foley, who with myself shares the tourism portfolio on our side of the House, that there be some clarification in relation to the <Col N="339" /> excessive car rental costs. I would, however, just add a caveat in relation to Senator Raftery's comments about the car costs as they apply to this country as distinct from car rental costs. A recent survey in the United Kingdom indicated that not only is Ireland being ripped off in relation to car costs but that the pretax cost of cars in the United Kingdom, which all of us are aware are much cheaper than here, are also excessively high relative to our European partners. There is a rip-off somewhere and certainly it is an issue that should be given an airing in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator B. Ryan and Senator Raftery with regard to Item No. 10, that is, the register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill. It is not a good argument to say that because it is part of the Programme for Government a private Member cannot get a First Stage discusion. In my time in the House I do not remember any other Seanad turning down the First Stage &mdash; the printing of a Bill. The Government must be very well informed if they can afford to ignore the contribution that can be made. Even if the Bill never got a Second Reading, it should get a First Reading. It could be of assistance to the Government in drawing up their own part of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of liability for defective products, I agree with Senator Howard. It is a very important Bill. At the moment we have all sorts of watchdog programmes on television and radio but it should not be left to those programmes. Certainly, we should not put ourselves in a situation, where in some of those programmes it could be said that the legislation was rushed through, and that mistakes were made because we did not take enough time to deal with the matter. Therefore, I agree with Senator Howard that to take all Stages of this Bill in one day would be a nonsense. I am not sure if that is the intention, but I support Senator Howard and ask that plenty of <Col N="340" /> time be given for consideration of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no trouble in supporting the call for more debate on events in Europe. I do not do this because Senator O'Toole has suggested it; I do so because I believe we should have more debate. In my contribution yesterday when we were having a debate on reforming the Seanad there were two Senators in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, there is a long-standing tradition in this House that references to the absence of Members are not made. The Cathaoirleach, more than anybody else, would be aware of that. People were keeping very close tabs on what the Senator was saying, despite the fact that there were other activities in other places at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not allow Senator Honan to be chastised in the House in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew eventually the old friendship would come to the fore. In my contribution yesterday I went to pains to say we should have more debate on Europe in this House. We should be told of developments there. If we, as parliamentarians and Members of this House do not know, what chance have the people throughout the nation? If county councillors have to declare their interests as well as other ordinary people like myself, I have no trouble with Item No. 10. It will be interesting when it comes forward.</P>
      <P>My daughter was home recently from Bermuda. When booking her air ticket &mdash; she lives there, in case Senator O'Toole thinks she is on a holiday there &mdash; she booked a car for a fortnight from the other side of the Atlantic and she got if for half the price she would have paid if she had landed in Shannon and got it there. I support Senator Denis Foley's call for a debate on car rental costs.</P>

      <P>An tseachtain seo caite chuir mé ceist shimplí ar an gCeannaire. <Col N="341" /> Is cosúil nár thuig sé mé agus míneoidh mé mo chás arís. D'iarr mé díospóireacht, an tseachtain seo caite, a phléfeadh drochstaid iarthar na hEireann. Tá daoine ag caint anseo ar a mbeadh i gceist i gConradh na Róimhe dúinne; ní chaiallaíonn an conradh sin dada do mhuintir an iarthair ach go bhfuil an úile rud caillte acu dá réir. Sin é an fáth go bhfuilim ag lorg díospóireachta ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, sóisialta agus cultúrtha iarthar na hÉireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the House is being pressed for the second time by Senator B. Ryan and by Senator O'Toole to taken Item No. 10. I would like to point out, with your permission, that there is nobody on this side of the House who would resent that motion being taken. In fact, I just did a head count, and I think that 99 per cent of the people on this side of the House, if not 100 per cent, have signed the register of interest as members of local authorities. Therefore, perhaps the motion is more applicable to the Members on that side. of the House than to those on this side. May I ask if the two movers of the motion have signed a register of interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning's request that there should be a debate on the unusual political circumstances. Yesterday during the Seanad reform debate Senator Manning pointed out that it was anomalous that we can discuss these matters in private and in various public platforms outside the Oireachtas but not here. The revised Programme for Government provides for greater flexibility, specifically in Dáil Éireann and we certainly should follow that lead. There are many things <Col N="342" /> that we cannot do ourselves to reform this House. The leader of the House pointed out yesterday the various constraints in the way but there is no reason we should not provide time. There is plenty of time and we will make that decision ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disgraceful of Senator Pól O Foighil to get up here and produce a gléas aistriúcháin in front of this House and suggest that the Leader of the House does not understand what he says. We fought very long and hard to get a gléas aistriúcháin into this House. Senator Ó Foighil fought for it but it was despicable of him to get up here and, because he did not get a question answered in the manner he wanted, that he should blame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Order. I cannot allow this. Senators, resume your seats. When Senators wish to make a contribution on the Order of Business they should do it through the Chair. Furthermore, the sensitivity of Senators should not be such that they are provoked into this type of banter across the floor. It certainly does not contribute anything in the context of the debate yesterday about reform of this House. I am asking Senator Lanigan to make his contribution by putthing a question to the Leader of the House, and I want no further interruptions, please.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, the comment of Senator Lanigan in referring to another Senator as a despicable man should not be allowed on the record I ask that Senator Lanigan withdraw that comment and be finished with it. It was said in the heat of the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I withdraw the comment, but I do not withdraw the sentiments I expressed. The Leader of the House has been asked many questions about having <Col N="343" /> a debate on the Treaty of Rome. We should not forget that in this House, over many years, we have had a tradition of debating matters relating to Europe which have not been debated in the other House. We continue to have debates here about matters in Europe. We also take reports from the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. This House has a tradition of doing that and nobody in the House would object to such a debate. There should be a debate on the Treaty of Rome but we should not forget that we have had these debates here in the past and will continue to have them.</P>
      <P>We must all agree that car costs in Ireland are too high and we must address this to various Departments. There must be questions to the Minister for Finance. I am asking that a debate take place and that the costs of motoring in Ireland be debated in a comprehensive manner. Insurance costs must be taken into account and also the fact that we do not have a regulation to test cars as they have in other countries. Car costs can be related to the fact that we do not have car tests. The Department of the Environment and the Department of Finance would be involved if we are going to have a comprehensive debate here on the cost of cars and their running costs. This has nothing to do with the motor industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say, as a Senator who is not notably sensitive, that I greatly enjoyed the little bilingual spat, but I am saddened that the vocabulary collapsed at the word despicable? I hope there is a word in the Irish language that reflects this very important concept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support Senator Brendan Ryan in urging that Item No. 10 be taken. It would be a very interesting exercise if it were taken. I remember putting down amendments rather like this to cover part of this area on the Companies Bill and the two principal parties voted them down, and I am very interested that they have such a unanimous interest in <Col N="344" /> encouraging this now. I welcome it and I hope that this will be taken soon.</P>
    <P>There is an element of hypocrisy in it, just as I think there is an element of hypocrisy in the question of discussing reform of the Seanad. We all know there are two or three simple reforms which would make the place a lot more relevant. They will never go through because they would dilute the parties' stranglehold over this House.</P>
    <P>I support the calls that were made yesterday from all sections of the House for a debate on the banking system in this country. I am sure the Cathaoirleach will find this very interesting and significant. I would like to ask the Leader if he intends to give us an opportunity to represent what many people in this country feel about certain aspects of banking? There seemed to me yesterday certainly to be virtually unanimous feelings throughout the House. This is almost unique in my experience. Every section in the House seems to want to discuss the banking system and it is time we had such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning and others asked for a debate on the general political position of the country at present. I will give no promises but I will examine the situation. In regard to item 10, which has again been referred to by Senator Brendan Ryan and a number of other Senators &mdash; it deals with the printing of a Bill &mdash; I did indicate, and it is still the position, that it is part and parcel of the new Programme for Government. I give an assurance to the House that I will examine it in much greater detail and <Col N="345" /> give a positive answer to the House next Wednesday. I will come back to Senator Bendan Ryan before next Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Senator Foley asked for a debate on tourism and he rightly pointed out the high costs of car hire. I will consider this request and I support his view and the view of Senators Raftery, Mooney and others with regard to this problem. I have no plans to accede to Senator Cosgrave's request for a debate on broadcasting at this time I will certainly bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice his concern regarding the courts' dispute. I have no plans to take item No. 42 as Senator Costello suggested. Senators Howard and Harte made a good plea for not taking all Stages of the Liability for Defective Products Bill next week; it was never my intention to take all of that Bill in one day. The Second Stage will be followed by Committee and other Stages at a later date. Concern on this matter has been expressed by many Senators, particularly on the Opposition side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My reply to Senator O'Toole is that I did give a programme for Government. The Chief Whip, Senator Wright, and I have consistently been seeking for legislation to be initiated in this House. We will continue to do so and I take exception to the suggestion that we are rushing legislation through the House; that is not the case. I support the request for a debate on changes taking place in the Treaty of Rome and I think I read that the Minister was about to introduce a White Paper on that matter. I will make further inquiries and report back. Senators Raftery, Mooney, Harte and Honan also asked for a debate on European affairs. In response to Senator Ó Foighil's request I have to say that I was not here last Thursday. Senator Wright took the view I am taking that the Senator's request is not appropriate to the Order of Business. The Senator had ample opportunity during the week, during the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> debate, to talk about aspects of the west of Ireland and did not do so. It would be a suitable subject for Private Members' Time. I was not here last Thursday and did not know about his <Col N="346" /> request. I have noted Senator McGowan's comments and also those of Senators Lanigan, Murphy and Norris. I have given a guarantee to Senator O'Keeffe, who has been consistently raising the question of the banking system, that we will try to do something on that as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister from my adjoining constituency; it is the first time I have had the opportunity of speaking to him although I see him within my own area frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A night such as last night shows how vulnerable we are when we think of the difficulties which trawlers got into, situated as we are at the intersection of transatlantic sea routes, a tiny island with such a great stretch between us and neighbouring continents. We need a task force to complement the Minister for the Marine's task force and the new force would be drawn from local authorities, farming organisations and tourist organisations. This suggestion has not been taken up since it was first mooted following the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> disaster in 1986, which, thankfully, did not damage our coastline <Col N="347" /> greatly because of the tremendous work of local authorities and of the Department of the Marine. I hope this notion of a local task force will be developed because it is locals who will have the first intimation of any disaster that might occur.</P>
    <P>Last week I referred to the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo; and in an amendment today, an Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil will continue that debate on what constitutes a ship and on the area of classification. I referred also to flawed construction, particularly in newer vessels, it was not the old hardy annuals that were causing problems in our waters. I wondered if we had the necessary international expertise in relation to the construction of ships. I did not refer last week to the problem of dredging and there is no reference at all in the Bill to the pollutant aspect of dredging. Much dredging takes place in the estuary in Limerick and in Cork harbour. We are becoming aware that our harbours may be subject to a slow, insidious build-up over the years of noxious materials that accumulate from chemicals upstream and which may ultimately cause pollution. The area of dredging should have been included within the remit of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred to resources last week, a most important aspect in relation to the implementation or enforcement of legislation. An inspector under this Bill may be a surveyor of ships, a person appointed to be an inspector by warrant of the Minister, under section 20, an officer holding a commissioned naval rank in the Defence Forces or a member of the Garda Síochána. I would like to dwell on the importance of the role of the Garda.</P>
    <P>If a spillage occurred at Bere Island, for example, 220 miles south-west of us, at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m. it is realistic to believe that the first person on the scene there would be the local garda. We could not expect immediate help from the experts of the Department of the Marine. It is essential, therefore, that gardaí, particularly in coastal areas, receive appropriate training because it is not enough <Col N="348" /> for them to go on ship and use their ordinary powers, which is obviously why the Garda are referred to in that section of the Bill. Gardaí would need special training to deal with the intricacies of spillages or pollution of any kind. This refers again to the need to provide them with a certain level of expertise. I am not talking about intense training but basic training for the gardaí who are part of that inspection force.</P>
    <P>When we come to basic measures of enforcement some very simple facts need stating. I spoke last week about the necessity to have the nuclear pollution aspect written into this Bill. If we were to start with our own civic responsibilities we might first take the local authorities under which we have the harbour boards. In order to get rid of basic waste &mdash; and Senators last week discussed the disastrous effects of plastic on fish life as well as the fact that it is not biodegradable &mdash; skips which cost £10 to £12 to hire must be located on the spot. In Limerick docks where two or three ships generally tie up together, instead of locating a ship within a local authority area which is inaccessible to the ships, the skips might be located 25 yards from the ship so that plastic could be disposed of.</P>
    <P>My second point is in relation to recycling. All of these suggestions relate to environmental protection and if a bottle collection point could be established close to the skip for plastics then two problems might be solved. If something is accessible it will be used and the same thing may be said in relation to children and litter. If refuse bins are located nearby, a child will drop the litter into them if he or she has been trained in school or in the home to do so.</P>
    <P>The onus here is on the harbour boards but I am afraid that something as basic and as simple as this may be overlooked. It is important that local harbour boards place those skips where they are going to be used. That refers not only to commercial vehicles but to marinas also. With the present emphasis on pleasure and leisure boats, it would be important to place a skip on marinas to receive plastic waste. Pat Lawless, the Limerick man <Col N="349" /> who sailed from Limerick to the United States, recalled at an environmental conference in Clare over the weekend, the sea of plastic on which he was floating as he fought his lone battle across the major trade routes of the Atlantic. Nothing has changed since then. The problems of a sea of plastic and chutes spewing out this horrific substance will continue and it could be prevented if skips were provided where plastic could be disposed of. That is something over which we have control.</P>
    <P>Walking on Fanore beach over the weekend I saw a united Europe, united in the sense that the plastics that spewed across the coast, came from every country within the EC. There were Spanish shampoo and French detergents containers; the contents of well-stocked supermarket shelves were spewed out on what is quite an unused area of Clare. It did not come from the locals; it was certainly EC refuse on our coasts. There was plastic there from as far away as Quebec, Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, to be picked up. The labels on some anti-freeze bottles were in French showing their French origin in Quebec but it was extraordinary to find such a residue of plastic along a beach in the west of Ireland. It is within our capacity to do something about our plastic by providing skips to avoid its deleterious effects on marine life.</P>
    <P>Regarding the prospect of nuclear pollution, there should be greater reference in this Bill to the development of an integrated approach between the Departments of Energy and the Environment. It is not enough to leave everything in the hands of the Department of the Marine on this issue.</P>
    <P>Coming to education, I refer again to the emphasis that should be placed on the horrors of plastic in order to impress on our young people who will be the adults of tomorrow the need for more preventive action in relation to the problems associated with plastic and glass and other pollutants.</P>
    <P>I welcomed the Bill last week and do so again today. Many of the points highlighted have been tabled in the form of amendments from our side of the House <Col N="350" /> and we look forward to debating those later this morning with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is in line with the environmental action programme which has been brought in by the Government. It will also bring us into line with legislation in other countries. The Minister in his opening remarks on the Bill went into great detail about MARPOL, the international organisation monitoring all marine pollution. This Bill would not be much good to us here in such a small island if it were not being implemented in other countries throughout the world, especially in Europe. As a small nation on the most westerly point of Europe we are susceptible to deposits of refuse, sludge and waste on our shores. Two factors are responsible for this: the prevailing winds which are normally south, south-westerly or westerly and, secondly, the tides. We are rightly placed in the wrong position to collect everything out there in that big ocean.</P>
      <P>It has been said that our young people have become very environmentally aware over the last number of years. We were all horrified when we saw the damage done to hundreds of square miles of sea during the Gulf War when oil wells in the gulf were bombed by Saddam Hussein. This brought home to us the possible consequences of pollution: a sea in which nothing could live. There is great credit due to all who went out there to help clear up the pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody is probably of the same mind with regard to pollution. Pollution is an unfortunate reality. War is a terrible thing and Saddam Hussein's deliberate blowing up of oil wells was equally bad. I, and probably some other Senators, remember seeing the film on RTE about seven or eight years ago entitled &ldquo;The Seas Must Live.&rdquo; The point being put across, which was taken up by another film that came out shortly afterwards from the Central Fisheries Board connected with inland pollution and entitled &ldquo;While Fishes Watch&rdquo; was that if fish and marine life generally perish because of pollution, we will be next. The title of <Col N="351" /> the film, &ldquo;While Fishes Watch&rdquo; brought home the fact that while fish survive our planer is safe but the minute that fish life starts to die and water is poisoned we will not be able to survive and our planet will be endangered.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill although there are a few things that I cannot figure out. One of the sections provides for the exemption from the Bills provisions of any warship or ship being used by the governement of any country. We are a neutral country and my view would be that these warships should not be allowed into our territorial water, let alone exempted from the provisions of this Bill. It is all right now but in ten or 15 years' time we do not know what position we will be in with regard to war in other countries. What could happen to those of us on the west coast of Ireland? People like Saddam Hussein could return and there could be war and pollution all over the place again. What we are saying here is that it is all right to bring in warships, that we will exempt them. Let them pollute away but stop everybody else.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister like to explain how warships of any country could be used for non-commercial purposes? The only thing a warship will do, I suppose, is to go to war; that is its main function. Why are such ships exempt from the Bill?</P>
    <P>What causes all this pollution? Over the years we have learnt that ships coming to Ireland from other countries and getting caught in storms have caused the greatest amount of pollution. Together with that source a great deal of pollution is caused right under our noses by foreign factory fishing boats who come into our inlets in winter time especially. I have often seen up to 30 boats in Brandon Bay and in Ventry harbour for months on end taking fish aboard from smaller boats and processing the fish night and day; offal must be produced by the processing of fish at sea. The factory ship uses oil and other waste is pumped into these inlets and harbours while these boats are docked there. The Minister <Col N="352" /> could have seen some of these boats himself in Killybegs or down in Castle-townbere; they are called Klondikers because they sit there opportunistically waiting for the price of fish to drop. When the price of fish goes down they buy at a low price and wait.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that these boats are coming into places such as Ventry and Brandon Bay where there are no harbour masters or anybody who can inspect them and stop them. I welcome that part of the Bill which gives the Minister power to appoint inspectors in cases like this.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that these small harbours and inlets, in County Kerry at least, have harbour constables who are employed by the local authority. This provision was made under an old Act and in all these little places with a slipway or a small harbour it is the harbour constable's job to report back to the local authority if a light is out or a ladder broken, or something like that. These harbour constables or inspectors could be given more responsibilities; they are there anyway. I do not mean that these harbour constables should act but they should be able to report to the authorities who would then act. I think there are 14 or 15 of them already around the coast of Kerry and more than likely they exist in other counties as well. At the moment they are getting paid for doing nothing. I know that their remuneration is very little; it used be about £100 a year. They should be delegated to report back to the appropriate authorities about factory ships and other ships inside harbours where there are no harbour masters and where we have no way of knowing what is happening in them.</P>
    <P>The other source of pollution is the raw sewage flowing into harbours and bays throughout the country. The sewage in my town flows straight into the harbour. I know now that steps are being taken to open a plant there to eliminate this problem. The trouble is that this is a totally enclosed harbour, almost landlocked but for a small opening, and whatever silt from the town goes into that harbour it remains there. The same <Col N="353" /> applies to Tralee bay. There has been much discussion in recent years about the pollution of Tralee bay by the sewage from the town of Tralee.</P>
    <P>Sewage is one thing, but industrial waste making its way through our sewerage system and eventually emerging into bays and harbours is another story. Nobody knows whether there are chemicals and detergents going through these sewers and ending up in our harbours and bays.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that a major harbour development is taking place in Dingle. In accordance with the environmental action plan we are trying to stop fishing boats polluting the sea, but there are no onshore facilities for boats to get rid of their sludge when they arrive in the harbour. I am not sure which comes first in this case; the horse or the cart.</P>
    <P>I know this Bill is necessary but if we are to stop boats, fishing boats and yachts from disposing of their waste at sea we have to provide the onshore facilities in the form of pumps and the sludge tanks which can take all the waste. There are about 25 or 30 fishing boats in Dingle and probably another 40 or 50 smaller boats. The same situation exists around the coast; I am just giving the example of Dingle. All these boats have to change the oil in their engines every couple of weeks. If you add it all up, it is a great deal of oil but that oil never comes off the boat. It is pumped directly into the sea causing continuing pollution, day after day. It is like the old saying, bailíonn brobh beart. A small amount at a time is involved but added up together, it becomes a massive amount. The Minister might keep in the back of his mind that he could provide some money in this new development in Dingle for the onshore facilities mentioned in this Bill. We are poor people down there and we would like a bit of help.</P>
    <P>We can, of course, bring in the legislation for fishing boats but it is not much good unless the facilities are provided onshore. I know that in the environmental action plan all these facilities must be in place by 1998. Where there is a <Col N="354" /> harbour authority, the onus would naturally be on them to provide the facilities but in a small place like Dingle, even though they have a harbour authority, the amount of finance coming in is not great, so Government help would be needed to provide a sludge tank and such facilities.</P>
    <P>Yachts are another source of pollution although, not to the same extent as the bigger fishing boats. I do not know of any legislation making it compulsory to have a sludge or waste tank on a yacht. My information is that 90 per cent of the yachts in Ireland have no sludge or waste tanks or any such facility. If there is no such legislation then it should be brought in now.</P>
    <P>About four years ago, I had to go to England to get an engine for my own boat and I asked for filters; they are the filters between the diesel tank and the engine. I specifically asked for a glass filter so that I would know just by looking at the filter whether the fuel was dirty or clean going through to the engine and I could clean it. The person behind the counter told me he could not sell that type of filter because they were illegal. He told me that in England there were stringent laws brought in for boats on sea, rivers, lakes, canals and so on. Glass filters were affected because they can get broken and cause oil to spill onto the bilge of the boat and make its way into the water. There is no such law here in Ireland and he showed me thousands of these illegal filters in his store. I told him they were not illegal in Ireland and that he might as well give me a couple of them which he did. These are matters we must consider. Each one is a contributing factor to polluting the sea, rivers and lakes.</P>
    <P>Pollution of the sea is dreadful. Indeed, but for the quick action of the Minister and the Department of the Marine we could have had major disasters off the west and south-west coast in recent times. The seas must live. Now that the Taoiseach, in all his wisdom &mdash; and we thank him for it &mdash; has made our water the first safe haven in Europe for whales, dolphins and mammals, we <Col N="355" /> should put more emphasis on educating people about pollution, teaching the younger people the dangers, what it can do to our harbours and our seas. We have a little watchdog for pollution in Dingle and that is Fungi the dolphin. According to an article in last week's paper, dolphins are one of the first to detect pollution at sea. The dolphin is there as a watchdog in our harbour and he also gives endless enjoyment to thousands of people. However, his value as a detector of pollution is limited. He does not come all the way into the inner harbour in Dingle. He stays outside and anybody watching his movements from overhead would clearly see the line where Fungi operates. He will not come within 200 or 300 hundred yards inside the mouth of the harbour because then the waters change. However, while he is there, hopefully he will continue to watch for it.</P>
    <P>I would like to see more detailed legislation introduced. It is all right, in a broad sense, to say that there must be sludge and waste facilities on these boats but we must also deal with the problem. This Bill deals with what we should or should not do about pollution but it does not set out the type of sludge tank and onshore facilities which should be provided.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out in his speech, we live in changing times. Oil is the biggest pollutant of our waters but dangerous chemicals are now being transported in more modern ships, huge tankers three-quarters of a mile long. God forbid that anything would happen to any of them on the west coast of Ireland; we would be wiped out. I know the Minister and the Department of the Marine are very alert when it comes to taking action and I congratulate them. In his speech, the Minister referred to the very quick action taken to deal with an accident and I agree with him. He said: &ldquo;The Minister used his powers of intervention early in 1989 when the 85,000 tonne bulk carrier <i>Yarawonga</i> having lost 300 square meters&rdquo;&mdash; nearly the size of Croke Park gone off the side of a boat and it was still afloat &mdash;&ldquo;of steel side plating in mid-Atlantic was abandoned by its crew&rdquo;. <Col N="356" /> He also mentioned the <i>Tribulus</i> which limped into Bantry and the <i>Capitaine Pleven II</i> incident at Ballyvaughan. The Department and the Minister were very alert in taking rapid action there and that is what we want.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have more help. All the other small harbours and inlets all around our coast should have someone to report to the authorities on unusual activities by big boats which come into shelter from time to time. That is why they come to sheltered harbours such as Bantry harbour and Brandon.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and his Department on bringing this Bill before the House. I will ask some questions on Committee Stage. It is a major step forward and I support the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure to sit in this House and listen to somebody who has such an intimate professional knowledge of the sea as Senator Fitzgerald; it is quite an educational experience and I greatly enjoyed listening to his contribution. I recall enjoying an earlier contribution almost on my first day in the House. It is very useful for someone like myself who is a teacher, to come into the Seanad and learn something about life in the country from an expert. I was also very taken by the fact that Senator Fitzgerald raised certain queries I would have myself. In fact, I hope to have the opportunity to put down a couple of amendments on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Principally, the worry the Senator seemed to have, which many people will share, was about the deliberate omission, the exemption from the operation of this Bill of warships. I think this is unnecessary. It damages and limits the entire Bill. I am not entirely surprised. Although I welcome this Bill which represents some degree of advance, it is not a particularly forward looking, active or progressive Bill and I doubt very much if the Minister would have the gall to stand there and maintain that it does. Very disarmingly, in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum, whoever concocted this makes it perfectly clear that this is another piece <Col N="357" /> of facade legislation. It is a charade. It is simply intended to enable us to join a community of nations by becoming signatory to a protocol which we are 16 years behind in doing. It is a remarkable and regrettable fact that Ireland is the last of the European maritime states to become a signatory to these protocols. I do not believe there is much room here for satisfaction or self-congratulation. We are tardy. We are catching up and we are merely doing so because there is external pressure on us to ratify certain international conventions. This is on page one of the Explanatory Memorandum. It could not be clearer. It states:</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the State&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) to ratify the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973;</P>
    <P>(ii) to accede to the Protocol of 1978 modifying that Convention;</P>
    <P>(iii) to accede to the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil, 1973,</P>
    <P>by giving them the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>In other words, between 13 and 16 years later we are doing the minimum necessary to catch up with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we look at the question of pollution of the sea. We are, after all, an island. We are surrounded by this element and we need to be very careful indeed about the way in which this important element in our lives is abused. For that reason I am concerned that there are what seems to me to be unnecessary and dangerous exemptions which require a considerable explanation.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not really deal either with another matter that Senator Fitzgerald raised, the enormous impact of sewage in the sea. I do not think there is any section in this Bill that deals with that. Perhaps I am wrong. The Minister might be able to draw my attention to it if there is. It seems that this is both dangerous in <Col N="358" /> ecological terms and also very wasteful. I want to ride a hobby horse of my own.</P>
    <P>We have, for example, in Dublin, two facilities on the South Wall. We have an enormous electricity generating complex and right beside it a series of sewage outfall works and pumping stations. Here we are, expelling this partially treated matter into the sea right in the heart of the capital city of the country, polluting beaches as much as it possibly can. Yet, this material could be reclaimed, could be used hygienically and economically in order to help to generate electric power on the one hand and to provide fertilizer as well. It is economically viable. In the long term it is an attractive financial proposition but I suspect the reason this is never addressed is simply because it would take about ten or 15 years for the economic spin-off to really materialise and no Government are prepared to think in ten or 15 year terms. I would like to have the Minister's view on this question related specifically to Dublin. I am taking that as an example. We have the opportunity here not only to cease pollution of the sea but also to do something that is economically to the benefit of the community. It would be a classic example of recycling.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also that there is very little about nuclear waste. We have, for example, a situation where we have a highly problematic plant &mdash; to put it at its mildest &mdash; in Sellafield. Gross nuclear pollution of the sea is occurring and this is going to escalate because many countries are either refusing to develop or are closing down facilities for re-treating and reprocessing nuclear waste. Where is it all going? It will be concentrated over the next few years at Sellafield and the pollution in the Irish Sea will increase.</P>
    <P>On the nuclear level this is an additional reason why we should be worried about the exclusion from the operation of this Bill of warships, submarines and so on. Many of them at the moment are in Irish waters. They habitually use Irish waters. It is impossible to calculate the risk of a nuclear accident at sea, because of the secrecy surrounding the operations of nuclear submarines and the <Col N="359" /> records of their activities. The Irish Sea contains up to one-fifth of the United States' nuclear arsenal at any one time. In addition, there are Warsaw Pact submarines at either end monitoring them. This is a highly dangerous situation, when one takes into account the fact that nuclear submarines, despite the secrecy surrounding them, have been demonstrated to be susceptible to accident. If there is a major accident in the reactor of a nuclear submarine the situation could equal the disaster we had in Sellafield. Yet, in a Bill that purports to deal with pollution in the sea, we neglect one of the most glaring obvious dangers, the danger of nuclear waste.</P>
    <P>We have had a number of Bills &mdash; the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and so on &mdash; dealing with elements of pollution but, by and large, they tend to deal with &ldquo;end of pipe&rdquo; solutions to the problem of pollution. I would like to mention something that I think is relevant to the question of pollution of the sea. It is an interesting example because it comes from the Scandinavian countries, from Denmark where there is a high degree of consciousness with regard to pollution and attempts are made to deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>This example, which I take from a Greenpeace report, indicates that, even in countries which are more alert than we are, there are considerable dangers of discharge from plants that employ reasonably effective end of pipe treatment process. I am quoting from this report:</P>
    <P>A recent Greenpeace report on Kommunekeml. [it is obviously some kind of industrial plant] in Denmark &mdash; often acclaimed to be &ldquo;the world's best incinerator&rdquo;&mdash; revealed that at a DRE (destruction removal efficiency) of 99.99 per cent more than 10,000 kg of organic substances and 2,000 kg of heavy metals were blown from the incineration stack each year. Since 1975 when the plant first opened a total of 217,174 tonnes of fly and baghouse ash were deposited in a landfill by the <Col N="360" /> sea the leachate from which has caused significant heavy metal contamination to nearby mussels. This, not to mention the approximate 700 gm of dioxins at the dumpsite and 70 gms per year emitted from the stack.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days people from the North have almost camped outside the gates of Leinster House, they are a kind of cross-Border group, as I understand it. They are concerned at plans to develop an incinerator in the North of Ireland which will have a serious impact all over the island. This becomes very clear when in Denmark an almost 100 per cent efficient incinerator is causing massive impact into the surrounding sea which affects shellfish in the area.</P>
    <P>I believe these questions have not been properly addressed by the Bill. I would like to hear if the Minister is prepared to address them and I hope there will be time to introduce amendments. I will oppose section 4 in which there is the exemption for warships. I intend to propose some other minor amendments and seek to introduce a new paragraph which regulates the entry into the Irish territorial waters of vessels carrying nuclear weapons. They are dangerous, because there is a risk of accident and also because the Government still accept on the part of the Irish people the absurd, ludicrous and insulting policy of the United States Government that they will neither confirm nor deny what all of us know to be the case, that is that warships and submarines carrying nuclear weapons regularly enter Irish waters and frequently visit Irish cities, including the city of Dublin. They dock right in the heart of the city where, if there was an accident, which is statistically quite a possibility, the very large population concentration in this area would be exposed to very significant danger indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I was fascinated to hear Senator Fitzgerald, who is an expert in the whole field of oceanfaring and all that entails. It is an education to listen to someone who is <Col N="361" /> such an expert in that field and to hear his experiences at first hand.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris mentioned the fact that this country is ten to 16 years behind the times in relation to some developments. There are many things in this country about which I am glad we are ten to 16 years behind, particularly in relation to pollution. We have a high quality of life in relation to pollution. Other countries have introduced legislation to try to deal with pollution which is way past the point of redemption as far as those countries are concerned. Pollution here, as compared with other countries, is relatively non-existent, which is extremely fortunate. While we may be ten to 16 years behind in terms of legislation, we are recognised as a country that has a very clean environment. People are very conscious of the environment and are becoming more so. It is appropriate that we should be introducing this type of legislation.</P>
      <P>With Senators Fitzgerald and Norris, I am at a loss to understand why warships are excluded from this legislation. I do not know the reason for it. I would love to be told exactly what the specific reason is for excluding warships. All ships, irrespective of their cargo, be it freight, passenger, nuclear or whatever, should be subject to the same stringent regulations. The fact that a ship is built for a specific purpose does not for one moment mean it cannot just as easily cause pollution as any other ship. If two ships are sailing the seas and one of them happens to be a warship and if there is an accident the fact that it is a warship does not diminish the possibility of it causing just as much pollution as the other ship.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I welcome the legislation. Its purpose is to update existing legislation in relation to prevention of pollution from ships and from the intervention of ships following upon a maritime casualty as enshrined in the Oil Pollution of the Sea Acts, 1956 to 1977. In order to prevent or control pollution that may be caused by ships the State's powers need to be strengthened. This is acknowledged on all sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> The international treaty commonly known as MARPOL 73/78 is considered to be the most ambitious international treaty covering marine pollution ever adopted and it gives us scope to introduce this legislation. Part II of the Bill is the most important part. It deals with the prevention of pollution at sea. It will give statutory effect to the provisions of the five annexes of the MARPOL Convention. It deals with regulations relating to ships generally or, indeed, to any class of ship with the exception of warships.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister and the Department on the campaign they carried out recently highlighting the type of damage that plastic can do to marine life. Plastic is a threat not alone to marine life but to human life at sea. For instance, if it gets caught in the propellers of ships and puts them out of action it could lead to loss of life. Plastic is a strong, durable, buoyant and lightweight material but it is immune to the natural process of decay. It is particularly dangerous to marine life, including fish, sea birds and all types of sea mammals. Birds or fish ingest it and it gets stuck in their throats and they are not able to eat.</P>
    <P>I read somewhere recently about birds which swallowed plastic pellets and become so buoyant that they were not able to dive for food. As a result, they died of starvation. That is dreadful. The people who use plastic should be aware of the damage it can cause. The unsightly scenes of plastic and other waste being washed up on our shores should be the concern of everyone who has pride in this country. The unthinking individual can cause enormous problems by just not being aware of his or her responsibilities in this matter.</P>
    <P>The tourist industry is now one of our greatest generators of jobs. Many groups both State and otherwise, sell this country as one having a healthy, clean environment and spend enormous amounts of money promoting the industry. All this will go for naught and will be put in jeopardy as a result of dirty beaches caused not by local people's negligence but, in general, by ships at sea. The waste from ships inevitably comes to shore and <Col N="363" /> causes enormous problems. The strongest legislation possible should be introduced to ensure that pollution at sea is wiped out as far as humanly possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris mentioned the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which was initiated in this House and which is now being taken in the other House. It is major legislation. It is important that we should concentrate our minds on the environment to such an extent at this time. Over the years people, for one reason or another, did not recognise the importance of a clean environment. One advantage we have is that, relatively speaking, we are pollution free. Our seas are relatively pollution free, particularly the waters of the south, south-west and the west coasts. As Senator Norris said, the Irish Sea is a completely different matter.</P>
    <P>Although the Bill does not deal with pollution from sources other than ships, I do not think we can forget the situation in relation to Sellafield and the damage that is being done to the Irish Sea as a result of the emissions from that plant. It is of major concern to people in this country that Sellafield continues to operate. The dangers from it are absolutely enormous because of the fact that we are so close to the plant. That plant is being used more and more by international bodies because of the difficulty in getting places that allow the disposal of nuclear waste. It would appear that Sellafield is continuing to welcome all this waste disposal with open arms. There was a recent proposal to bury nuclear waste at the bottom of the Irish Sea in large tanks. They guaranteed that because of the type of protection they use it would be 100 per cent safe. Nobody can give that type of guarantee. How can they suggest that after 20, 30, 40 or 50 years their methods will hold up and there will not be any leakage or spillage given the force of the sea over the passage to time? No-one can give such a categorical assurance.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is seen as one of the most radioactive seas in the world. That should <Col N="364" /> be of major concern to everyone. I compliment the Government and all the relevant authorities who are at pains to persuade the British authorities to change their mind in relation to Sellafield. The campaign mounted a number of years ago to try to close the plant must be intensified. We must continue to use whatever opportunity is given to us to bring it home to the authorities there that it is just not good enough that we are put in danger on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>There are statistics and reports which prove that people living in certain areas on the east coast of this country are affected in one way or another as a result of living so near to Sellafield. It is not a problem of our own making. The European Parliament should be extremely concerned about this and it should be highlighted on every occasion so that the British authorities are made quite aware of the way we feel.  I am sure many people in Britain would feel exactly the same way as we do. I do not think the fact that Sellafield employs a large number of people is any just reason for it to remain open. We have a duty as public representatives to use every opportunity given to us to highlight the difficulties we have in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>While this Bill does not cover nuclear waste, it would be remiss of me if I did not draw attention to it. We are an island nation on the periphery of Europe with fishing grounds and an abundance of marine life. We have a quality of life in terms of our environment that is the envy of many countries that have huge environmental problems.</P>
    <P>The threat of pollution from the gigantic tankers that Senator Fitzgerald mentioned earlier is enormous. Some factory ships are like towns. They are so big that some small towns in this country would not have the same type of facilities as they have. I happened to see one or two of them and I just could not believe that a ship of that size could float. It defies comprehension. Many of them sail our seas every day. As Senator Fitzgerald said, the pollution they cause goes somewhere. That is the problem. They are out <Col N="365" /> to sea and they dump all sorts of waste and eventually it ends up on our shores.</P>
    <P>As we depend so much on tourism it is extremely important that our shores be clean and free from waste. It is bad enough when we cause the problem but it is intolerable that we should have to clean up the mess created by others who do not give a damn about what they are doing. They just want to get rid of their waste, be it plastic, offal or whatever. They dump it and let other people, in this instance ourselves, suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>It is important that this legislation has been brought forward. I do not agree with Senator Norris when he said it is only a sham. It is very important legislation. It enables us to implement very stringent rules and regulations in relation to shipping on the high seas.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the consequences of disasters. Disasters like the <i>Amoco Cadiz,</i> the <i>Torrey Canyon,</i> the <i>World Glory</i> and the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> spring readily to mind as do the enormous problems caused by those disasters in relation to the oil that was spilled and came ashore. There was a massive loss of fish and bird life. The sight of birds caught with oil all over them was horrific. We know that when the feathers and wings of birds become polluted with oil, to all intents and purposes that is the end of the story as far as those birds are concerned. In spite of the efforts made to save them the majority die.</P>
    <P>We have a responsibility to try to ensure that as far as possible those terrible disasters do not recur. The amount of money necessary to clean up an oil spillage is absolutely colossal. There is an old adage that prevention is better than the cure and if we can introduce legislation to limit problems in relation to oil spillage and other types of pollution then it behoves us to do that.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned pumping facilities in relation to shipping and that is extremely important. I agree with him in relation to treatment plants. It is extremely important that we have proper treatment plants in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="366" /> I was fascinated to hear him talking about Fungi. Dolphins are very sensitive to pollution and Fungi would not come more than 200 or 300 yards in to shore which indicates that the waters around the shore are polluted. I imagine that is the case with all the water around our shore for a couple of hundred yards out.</P>
    <P>Raw sewage is pumped into our seas every single day. I acknowledge that enormous amounts of money must be spent on treatment plants to ensure that we have pollution-free seas. We must have in place legislation to ensure that these ships have proper bulk tanks for waste disposal and we must have pumping facilities onshore. Local authorities must ensure that proper facilities are provided onshore to treat sewage from towns, villages and cities and also that proper pumping facilities are provided where ships could offload their waste when they come into port.</P>
    <P>While this Bill deals specifically with seafaring, it is no less true in relation to inland waterways as well. There are difficulties in relation to the River Shannon. We have three of the finest inland lakes in Europe and there is a problem there as well. That has been recognised by the local authorities and they are now ensuring that the towns which are located adjacent to the lakes have proper sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation. I have a few question marks in relation to warships and other areas but by and large it is important that this legislation has come before the House at this time. I compliment the Minister and give the Bill my full support.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> I welcome the Minister and also the Bill. The presentation of the Bill before the House at this time reflects a new awareness of environmental concerns. It comes in tandem with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Derelict Sites Bill and with the new civic charter the city council has put together for a better, healthier and cleaner environment for the city. In a sense what we are doing is extending the same concerns we have about pollution on land to the sea and the ocean surrounding the island. It is essential that we do it as an island nation and that it is done in an international context.</P>
    <P>What we are doing really is putting into domestic legislation what is already an international convention, that is the international convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973 and the amendment in the London Protocol of 1978, what is known as the MARPOL Convention of 1973 and 1978. I am disappointed that we are doing so at this late stage. We could have had this legislation on our Statute Book a decade ago. It seems extraordinary that it is now 1991 and we are implementing an international convention of 1973. We are almost 20 years down the road and that is not good enough. I would be delighted if the Minister could give me a satisfactory explanation for that.</P>
    <P>My concern with the legislation is that it provides with one hand and it takes away with the other. I am delighted with the provisions it makes as specified in the interpretation section 3 (1) where &ldquo;discharge&rdquo; is referred to. It states:</P>
    <P>oil, oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage or garbage or any effluent containing any of those substances, means any release, howsoever caused, from a ship and includes any escape, disposal, spilling, leaking, pumping, emitting or emptying of any substance from a ship, but does not include...</P>
    <P>This is a refrain that goes through the legislation, not just in section 3 but in sections 4, 10, 12 and 13. Once you have <Col N="368" /> a broad range of exclusions you weaken and undermine the legislation. What we are really looking for is strong, anti-sea pollution legislation. I presume in the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo;, submersibles refers to all submarine activity under the water as well as over the water?</P>
    <P>The second item that section 3 (1) does not include is the release of oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances or harmful substances directly arising from the exploration, exploitation and associated offshore processing of sea-bed mineral resources.</P>
    <P>In other words, you can have the same emissions as are prohibited in the substance of the legislation provided they are for a particular type of accepted exploitation or development. Surely we need to put firm controls on the manner in which mineral resources are exploited in the sea.</P>
    <P>In relation to scientific research the same exclusion or exception is allowed. The legislation could have been specific in terms of regulations that would apply in those areas. There is a lot of seabed exploration involving oil rigs and harmful toxic emissions can occur.</P>
    <P>Section 4 contains the most serious flaw in the Bill. It states: &ldquo;This Act shall not apply to any warship or to any ship for the time being used by the Government of any country for purposes other than commercial purposes.&rdquo; I cannot see why warships should be excluded. To use a phrase &ldquo;for purposes other than commercial purposes&rdquo; obviously gives <i>carte blanche</i> to military activity because military shipping is not used for commercial purposes. I would be concerned that it would apply to the nuclear area.</P>
    <P>Submarines, nuclear-powered ships or ships where dumping may take place in the context of the proposal for the new dumping at Sellafield may not be covered. I am concerned to know why there should be such an exception. Why should emissions of these noxious matters from warships be permitted? Why should a warship be exempt? Why should any military ship be exempt? I cannot for the life of me see why we should make such exceptions. That is the area where there <Col N="369" /> is most secrecy. We do not know their activities. We do not have a register of military ships in our seas and territorial waters. Is it because we are not prepared as a State to demand that all shipping that passes through or in our waters be registered so that we know its destination and purpose and that it be bound by strict anti-pollution legislation? That is the second exception which I regard as unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In terms of section 10, while the Minister may make regulations requiring the notification in section 10 (5) &mdash;&ldquo;notification... by the master or owner of a ship carrying any prescribed substance of any intent to load or unload any such substance in the State&rdquo;&mdash; that is a very narrow definition or parameter to be providing for shipping in our waters. If we are simply concerned with shipping which is going to a destination in the State, and is going to load or unload any substance which is an undesirable or noxious substance, then that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>All shipping, whatever we may think may or may not be the cargo, or whether it has sewage or garbage of any description of a toxic or non-toxic nature, irrespective of its cargo, or irrespective of whether it is going to load or unload in the State must be of concern to us. We should demand as of right a register of all shipping that comes within our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>That should be as simple and natural a thing as ensuring that every aeroplane that passes in the air must be notified. It is the only way that we can keep tabs on shipping. It must be all-encompassing. One must make no exceptions and say that certain shipping must register and other shipping must not register. Whether it is coming into the sea space or whether it is a military ship, a nuclear-powered ship or a ship carrying nuclear material, or a warship, then all of that must be part and parcel of what we are trying to do to prevent pollution by this legislation. I cannot see why we should exempt any owner of any ship or any State that has shipping going through our shipping lanes. I do not know how strongly the Minister has stressed this in the <Col N="370" /> other House, but I cannot expect that it would have gone through the other House without severe opposition to these exemptions in relation to the classes of ships, the types of ships and the cargoes and the destination of ships. Pollution is pollution. Once it takes place in the sea it does not matter how it happens or what the function or purpose of the ship is. If pollution takes place or if it is potentially likely to take place then it should be covered. I am not satisfied that this proposed legislation covers that.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, I am dissatisfied with section 12. There is a very heavy burden of responsibility placed on harbour masters but there is no such burden of responsibility placed on the Minister to ensure adequate staffing and resources to meet the colossal demands that may arise from implementation of this legislation. If it is a situation whereby ships actually now obey the legislation and come in with cargoes which may have to be jettisoned if something goes wrong or the cargo has become toxic or noxious then there must be facilities to deal with that situation. Very large quantities may come into our country, not into any other country. They may come into our territorial waters and our ports. We must provide the facilities to ensure that they can be dealt with and that the cargoes can be made non-toxic. There should be a waste disposal area to deal with the matter so that we can eliminate it as a pollution threat. That is the function that is put on the local harbour master and, no doubt then passed onto the local authority in the vicinity.</P>
    <P>At present we have a terrible situation in most of our towns and in our ports. We do not have secondary, not to talk about tertiary treatment for sewage or refuse coming from land, so how are we going to deal with a heavy demand if this legislation is effective? How are we going to deal with a heavy demand coming from the sea? If every ship now cleans its bilges and its tanks before going to sea, how will we manage? We all know what had been going on in ships in the past when there was very little concern for the sea environment. In between voyages when a cargo is left at a port of destination very <Col N="371" /> often the ship sets sail again and on its passage to its next destination to pick up a cargo it cleans out its holds, its bilges and its tanks. That is done in the open sea. All that will now have to be done at the port at which the cargo has been unloaded. That will require extra facilities.</P>
    <P>I do not see the Minister here taking on board the responsibility in terms of staffing and the facilities that will be required in all our ports to ensure the implementation of this legislation. It is always wishful thinking to draft legislation or to pass legislation and then to cop out without putting in adequate resources to ensure its implementation. That is why we have so much legislation on the Statute Book which is not being implemented. The resources are not there to do it. That, to my mind, is another exception that is not being covered sufficiently here.</P>
    <P>The final area I would refer to is that I am particularly displeased that this really is a Bill for the Minister for the Marine. All powers are delegated to the Minister. There is very little actually here that is not saying that the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; or the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. It is bad in a Bill. The Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; make regulations; the Minister &ldquo;may by regulations&rdquo; require. It is bad to have legislation in which there is too much discretion given to the Minister. I know that the Bill is implementing an international convention, but nevertheless it gives the Minister far more discretion than I would think is proper. It gives him powers to prevent, mitigate or eliminate pollution. The extent to which it crops up there is certainly unacceptable. It is a bad sign in any legislation when virtually in every second section one has a reference to the &ldquo;powers&rdquo; or the &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; or the Minister &ldquo;may&rdquo; and the Minister &ldquo;may do&rdquo; this or the Minister &ldquo;may do&rdquo; that. Indeed, if it simply was the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; I would be happier, but the very fact that it is delegated by and large to the Minister is a weakness in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the question of penalties either. There is no distinction in <Col N="372" /> relation to penalties. A penalty of £1,000 will be imposed or 12 months' imprisonment. That is a summary offence. The penalty of £10,000 or five years' imprisonment is for an offence on conviction. This refers to all types of ships and that includes small boats and large ocean going liners and factory ships. Obviously, £1,000 or 12 months' imprisonment is a very different thing to one type of corporate operation compared to a person who, in fact, is an owner or has leased a boat for whatever purpose. Such person could be subject on summary conviction to the same punishment. There is need for some grading or some differential in penalties to ensure that it is not simply the smaller operator who obviously would be responsible for a much smaller polluting effect who could be treated in the same way as somebody responsible for major pollution.</P>
    <P>We know of the cases of the <i>Torrey Canyon,</i>  the <i>Amoco Cadiz,</i> the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> and the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> closer to home. These were colossal disasters and to deal with them would cost a fortune in the first instance. To think that somebody whose ship was responsible for such disasters would be subjected simply to a £1,000 fine certainly boggles the imagination. There should be greater flexibility in the penalties that are imposed.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with section 31 in relation to dealing with a body corporate. How do you imprison a body corporate? Who, in fact, is responsible? Are all the directors, managers, secretaries and all of the others that make up the body responsible? Do they go to prison? Is that the intention of the legislation? How can that be achieved? What exactly is the body corporate? If the owner is a shareholder, how is the legislation going to deal with it? Are we suggesting that there can only be a prison offence for an individual who can be targeted, and then that there would be fines imposed on a body corporate? In terms of practical implementation of the penalties, I would like to know how that is going to operate?</P>
    <P>To my mind the legislation has a fault in that it does not go far enough and that it allows exemptions. It does not provide <Col N="373" /> sufficient resources. However, the legislation is extremely necessary even in the emasculated form that it is here before us because there is a huge problem of pollution. We see the condition of our beaches every summer and the amount of sewage that backs up on the beaches. We see the volume of plastic washed up with the high tide and left on the beaches. We know of the danger in swimming on any of our beaches. There is hardly anybody who will swim on an east coast beach facing the Irish Sea and Sellafield. That is just not on at present. They are afraid for their health.</P>
    <P>The sea environment for us must remain a very major area of concern. There is a huge industry to be exploited and developed there. We were certainly very early in dealing with the fishing industry and, indeed, the tourist industry. Deep sea water angling has become a major industry in this country at present. It has enormous potential for development. We are a peripheral nation. That is one of our strengths and one of our weaknesses but as a peripheral nation we have the vast Atlantic beyond us. We are the first country of mainland Europe that faces that Atlantic. For us those seagoing liners and the factory ships are of particular concern.</P>
    <P>Factory ships are something else. They are able to spend months at sea and obviously in that length of time spent at sea they gather an enormous amount of rubbish. It may not be fully toxic but some of it will be toxic. Certainly in the whole fish processing business that goes on in the factory ships, there is a lot of waste material. Some of it will not be toxic but some of it will be toxic. It will take some monitoring to ensure that that is policed and that these ships provide certain facilities, either of storage or of dealing with the waste created. Of course, eventually they will come to Irish harbours and then they will be looking for disposal facilities. That is where the resources will be required. The legislation puts an onus on the harbour master to ensure that facilities are available to deal with this type of situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="374" /> We cannot emphasise sufficiently the importance of ensuring that pollution does not occur in the Atlantic Ocean. I am afraid it is almost too late for the Irish Sea. The Irish Sea is almost gone past the stage where we can do anything about it. There is now a major reprocessing plant in Sellafield where the majority of the British nuclear industry is based. We have all heard of the cases that have been linked with that in terms of cancer and leukaemia in our country and we have the largest centre of population in Dublin facing Sellafield. There is also the question of disease in the fish in the Irish Sea at present. That is one aspect.</P>
    <P>There have been many leakages and radioactive emissions from Sellafield. We are always told, of course, that Sellafield is no threat and that the level of radioactivity emanating from it is within scientific acceptable standards. There is always a statement as though it were a positive thing that it is scientifically monitored and that it is within scientific and acceptable levels. But acceptable to whom? That is the point. It is not acceptable to the people who are living in the area. We know what happened with Chernobyl when there was not sufficient protection in place. The whole surrounding area, not just central Europe but as far away as this little island, which is literally thousands of miles away, was affected by it.</P>
    <P>Now we have a further proposal. There is a proposal not only that there will be a continuation of the reprocessing plant in Sellafield but also that there be a new nuclear dump placed in Sellafield. That has been proposed by the British nuclear authority not on the grounds that it is the best place &mdash; because the evidence indicates that Sellafield is not a stable area &mdash; but because it is the most suitable in financial terms. It would have cost £1 billion extra to site this proposed nuclear graveyard in the original area it was designed for in Scotland because of the distance involved. Instead, they have gone for good old Sellafield because it was closer both to the British nuclear industry and handier for ships coming <Col N="375" /> from Japan and elsewhere. We are talking about a colossal development which is estimated to be more or less along the same terms as the development of the Channel Tunnel. That is the type of major development that we are talking about and it is going to be in Sellafield. That means we are going to have ships sailing the Irish Sea with all sorts of waste radioactive material to this final graveyard where it is going to lie for how long? Who knows? Sellafield is not the most stable area in the British Isles. We can never tell in ten years, 100 years, 1,000 years or 10,000 years what will happen to the area. There could be an earthquake or leakage. How can you guarantee that all that material is not going to get into the sea? We should have all that covered by this legislation.</P>
    <P>All the ships carrying the nuclear waste should have to notify the Irish authorities where they are coming from, where they are going and what they are carrying. It is time we made the Irish Sea a nuclear-free zone. That is the only way we can get rid of Sellafield. I do not see why we cannot make the surrounding territorial waters around this island nuclear-free. If we allow the development proposed by British Nuclear Fuels to continue at Sellafield, then we are going to have the greatest combined reprocessing plant for radioactive material and the greatest nuclear waste dump anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>The world's waste will be transported on the Irish Sea and we will be the recipients of all that that entails. Certainly, they are not likely to be beneficial but very detrimental. I ask the Minister to make sure that we avoid that pollution. We can avoid it. We all know it is not just potential pollution but probable pollution because of the existing fact that there have been a number of serious emissions from Sellafield to date despite all the assurances we have been given. If we increase and multiply enormously the amount of radioactive material coming into Sellafield then naturally we multiply the chance of nuclear disaster in the area. So, let us say that no shipping carrying <Col N="376" /> toxic material or radioactive material can pass through Irish waters. Let us do that.</P>
    <P>We are a nuclear free country. We were proposing at one time to introduce a nuclear plant for energy in this country. However, there was a tremendous explosion of opposition and we decided against it. I bet there is no Minister who was fighting for it at that time who would now stand up and say that he was right. Ireland became a nuclear free zone. We are not using it for domestic energy or for any domestic purposes. Let us now declare the surrounding waters a nuclear free zone. The only way we can do that is to ensure that no nuclear activity is brought into the area. The normal way for bringing it into the area is by sea. My plea to the Minister would be that he would amend the Bill to provide for a nuclear free zone in the Irish Sea and the surrounding territorial waters of the country.</P>
    <P>The Bill will put responsibility on our local authorities and they should be made clearly aware of the impact of this legislation. If they are dealing with a town which is a port that is where the responsibility will rest eventually. They will find themselves in need for providing greater harbour facilities and greater waste disposal facilities. At the present time we do not have a toxic waste disposal facility in the Republic. We have to face up to that, but that would be for our own purposes. Now we find ourselves having to deal with international levels of toxic waste which we did not think would be required.</P>
    <P>Every local authority would need to be informed about the situation. The first thing would be to provide resources so that each local authority would be able to update its own disposal of raw sewage and not pump it into the sea. It certainly is an anomalous and a contradictory situation that while we are pumping raw sewage into the sea we are telling those who are using the sea that they must not do that or discharge any other obnoxious material into it. They must bring it to shore. If they bring it to shore, what do we do with it? Where do we put it? That matter is not addressed in the Bill. We <Col N="377" /> do not have the necessary facilities, nor have resources been put in place for it, so we are going around in circles. I am concerned that all of these exemptions will mean the Bill will lose much of its effectiveness and unless we can ensure effective implementation what is the sense of passing the legislation?</P>
    <P>We discussed at length the Derelict Sites legislation in this House and I remember bringing up the same point. Was the Minister for the Environment going to provide the resources to ensure that a register of derelict sites was put together and also the staffing to ensure that the people responsible for such sites were identified, that penalties were imposed and so on. It did not happen. Now we have the local authorities complaining that they cannot implement the law. They have neither resources nor extra staffing to do it and the extra burden of work is considerable. How do you clean up the environment if you do not put in place the structures for doing so?</P>
    <P>We have a situation where we have pollution caused very largely by oil. The major cases were referred to: the <i>Exxon Valdez,</i>  the <i>Torrey Canyon,</i> the <i>Amoco Cadiz.</i>  These large tankers carrying oil were obviously not working to required specifications to ensure that they were able to travel the seas in satisfactory fashion. We should shift the responsibility in such cases. Remember we are implementing domestic law and international conventions. We should shift most of the responsibility to those large companies. The &ldquo;Seven Sisters&rdquo; are getting away with murder. They have a monopoly of the oil distribution and most of its production also but what responsibilities are they accepting? Their actions pose the greatest danger to the flora, fauna, fish life and wildlife in the sea. They have caused most of the disasters. We must get back to them initially to ensure that all shipping is up to specified requirements and that it is written quite clearly into international law &mdash; and, indeed, it should be referred to specifically in our domestic law here &mdash; that they have the basic and the initial <Col N="378" /> responsibility to prevent a disaster. Preventive action is for better than trying to deal with it and cure it later on.</P>

      <P>I am delighted this Bill is before the House. It is overdue but it is going through and it will solve many of our problems.</P>
      <P>There is dreadful worry about pollution at sea. For generations we thought, the amount of waste that could be dumped into the sea was without limit but now we realise that vast as the sea is it is not able to deal with the waste being dumped in it at the present time. Unfortunately, what is dumped at sea eventually finds its way to our shores in many cases and even if only a small percentage of it finds its way to our shores it is too much. In addition, there is damage to fish and fish life.</P>
      <P>I listened to Senator Costello speaking about factory ships. Most of the fish offal from the factory ships is devoured by fish. You have only to watch any factory ship off our shore and you will see the number of seagulls around. They are consuming that waste.</P>

    <Title>Sea Pollution Bill, 1990: Second Stage (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Pollution on our beaches is a major problem. When waste is disposed of at sea it often flows on to our shores, particularly if it is in the form of plastic bags or bottles. I sometimes think that these plastic substances should be abolished because they are our greatest source of pollution at present. Plastic may be handy for wrapping things in but it causes pollution and there seems to be no way of disposing of it. If one burns it, it becomes a toxic problem and if buried it never rots. We should consider whether the substance should be on the market at all. Is it worth its usefulness given the pollution it causes? There was a lot to be said for wrapping everything in natural products like paper and glass which could be got rid of without causing pollution.</P>
      <P>On our part of the west coast we do not have a great problem with beach pollution. I believe my own county with about 70 miles of coastline has three blue flags and two starfish awards. The starfish award is not talked about enough; starfish will live only in water that is 100 per cent clean and clear which we have on the west coast. We are very pleased with that.</P>
      <P>I would also like to congratulate the Government and the Minister on the action plan which they intend to have fully implemented by 1992 concerning proper disposal services for all the major towns. In 1992 all those plants will be completely modernised and all sewage will be properly treated and purified before being disposed of. That is a great step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important in this Bill that we talk about fines for ships but we know that many of those ship operators sometimes only hire the boat and a crew at a cheap rate. Regarding one pollution case in the south of Ireland I wonder if the local <Col N="380" /> authority or the Government were ever compensated for the cost of cleaning up an oil spillage. Some international law should ensure that every ship going to sea be bonded to cover the maximum fine in the event of a spillage; it is all very fine trying to levy ships but if they do not have the money to pay the fine what can be done? If they are men of straw, which in many cases they are, just as a car owner has to have insurance to cover all situations that might arise, a bond should be imposed so that if ships cause a problem there will be money there to pay and instead of pursuing individuals in the shipping business it will be possible to pursue their bond holder or insurance broker or company.</P>
    <P>We already have Acts which govern oil pollution. We all know that as the world becomes more industrialised more dangerous substances are being carried at sea and we must take cognisance of current trends in the shipping industry namely the marked increase in the size of ships and in particular of oil tankers. Those huge oil tankers should be able to pay if they cause a problem; they have the money but there may be many ships carrying dangerous substances that may not be in a position to pay fines and we would have nobody to pursue in the event of a spillage. Section 10 allows the Minister to prohibit or regulate the operational discharge at sea of oil, oil mixtures, obnoxious liquid substances carried in bulk, for example, hazardous chemicals, hazardous substances carried in package form, sewage or garbage. The territorial water boundary is only a 12 mile limit and we should have legislation that would cover areas beyond that. Twelve miles is a very short distance. If pollution occurs 13 miles out it will cause great spillage damage and a ship-owner could escape prosecution because the ship was outside that limit. The pollution would flow in nevertheless and we will have to ensure that ships outside our limit or ships limping into our harbours may be dealt with under legislation if we become victims of pollution fallout.</P>
    <P>Section 26 allows the Minister following a maritime casualty to take such <Col N="381" /> measures as he considers necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate grave and imminent danger to the coastline, or related interests, for example, fisheries activities or tourist attractions from pollution or a threat of pollution. The Minister is entitled to recover the expenses incurred in such intervention from the owner of the ship. I would like to see some insurance bond or warrant being introduced. People running those ships often hire them from nameless companies and one could travel around the world to trying to find out the identity of the ship-owner. Very often they employ crews of cheap labour from Third World countries who are not officially recognised. A boat could be in bad repair and if there is an accident and the crew get off safely, that is welcome, but we will have to tighten up our regulations to claim against these people. It is no good having £10 million fines or prison sentences of five years or both on conviction or indictment if the prisoner has no money to pay up. It will cost the country money to keep these people in prison and we may not be able to get any money out of them.</P>
    <P>It is important if this legislation is to work satisfactorily that an insurance bond be insisted upon. Ships pose more of a danger to human life ultimately, than the motorist or truck driver who must carry adequate insurance to cover all eventualities. Now that pollution has been identified as a grave problem, the onus should be on the ship-owner to carry insurance so that fines can be paid.</P>
    <P>Attention has been focused on the threat to fish stocks by oil discharge and by other forms of garbage, such as plastics, synthetic ropes and nets. We know from our own fishermen that nets are frequently lost in storms. Nowadays nets and ropes are made of non-biodegradable material such as plastic or nylon which in large quantities can cause trouble to other ships by getting caught in rudders, etc. I do not know how we might monitor losses of nets and ropes but a monitoring system would be useful particularly after storms; it would be of service to fishermen also if some nets and <Col N="382" /> ropes could be recovered. Such losses of equipment cost fishermen a lot of money but they do not have boats large enough to track them down.</P>
    <P>Loss of ropes and nets therefore, cause pollution and constitute a danger to shipping. I would like to see this matter addressed by the Sea Pollution Bill. Otherwise I am delighted with the Bill. It complements previous action taken by the Government in relation to the environment. Over the last quarter of a century we seem to have let our environment deteriorate seriously but I am pleased that that trend has recently been reversed not least by greater public awareness. Every town and village has an air of cleanliness about it and people are beginning to recognise that rubbish and pollutants should not be tolerated, but disposed of in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of this Bill a ship coming into harbour can be checked but will it be the harbour authority or the local authority who will ensure that the job is done? We may need legislation to establish where pollutants will be disposed of when ships have been cleaned out and if it is the responsibility of the harbour or local authority. Disposal of noxious substances may be very difficult; it is already impossible to dump ordinary domestic refuse anywhere around the country.</P>
    <P>Many people talk about toxic waste but many of the same people drive a car that does not use unleaded petrol nor do they instal convertors. They may generate more toxic waste than a factory giving employment and subject to some pollution control. It is time we established what toxic waste is; cigarette smoke is described now as toxic and the word is being used indiscriminately. We know there is nothing more poisonous than the fumes of a car and instead of bandying about with this, the Minister should introduce some means of measuring toxicity. We need a monitoring system to provide us with regular readings of the levels of toxic substances being disposed of. I would like to see these suggestions taken up, otherwise I wish the Bill free passage through the House. Waste disposal at sea <Col N="383" /> creates problems for our shorelines, for our fishing industry and for our tourism industry, especially for water sports. If tourist attractions are threatened many people's livelihoods will be jeopardised, together with our natural environment.</P>

      <P>Is mian liomsa fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo, an Bille um Thruailliú na Farraige, 1990. Is é cuspóir an Bhille seo ná truailliú na farraige le hola agus le substaintí eile a chosc, éifeacht a thabhairt don Choinbhinsin Idirnáisiúnta chun truailliú na farraige ó longa a chosc agus éifeacht a thabhairt don phrotocol a bhaineann le hidirghabháil ar an mórmhuir i gcás substaintí seachas ola.</P>
      <P>As members of an island community most of us visit our shores during the year and the too frequent presence of oil and other pollutants is a factor we could do without. Public awareness of the problems resulting from oil spillages and sea pollution has grown rapidly in recent years. This awareness has unfortunately and regrettably been generated by several tragic experiences. Public representatives need no reminding of the stranding of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> in 1967 or the stranding of the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> in 1978. These tragedies give us vivid warning of the possibility of environmental disasters which have to be guarded against.</P>
      <P>The first requirement, therefore, is to tighten up on preventive measures at national and international level so that such tragedies do not occur again. Shipwrecks have always posed dangers but the consequences now are far worse in a world that lives on oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of cleaning up pollution is also very considerable. In the case of the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> it cost £54 million in 1978 to clear the pollution from that disaster. Surely prevention is better than cure and it is reasonable to ask ourselves to what extent we can prevent strandings and spillages by means of legislation and international conventions. Sensible international conventions and sound domestic <Col N="384" /> legislation as is contained in this Bill should be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>International conventions and domestic legislation have an important part to play in maintaining safety at sea, in reducing the risks of accidents and the incidence of sea pollution; protection from pollution by ships is vital. This has to be done on an international and global basis and this Bill gives effect to such an international convention and the related protocols. Lingering doubts arise, however, as to how international conventions and protocols are to be enforced and this is the vital issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill as a measure which attempts to regulate, control and eliminate the pollution of our seas and oceans. Our awareness of the magnitude of marine pollution and the scope of the problem must be matched by the realisation that a country such as ours cannot solve all coastal pollution problems through national action and measures alone. Regional and international co-operation is necessary to deal effectively with sea pollution. There is a strong case for a European Community initiative to establish a European coastwatch on the lines of the French coastguard patrol service, so that coasts all round the European Community can be protected and the arrangements provided for in MARPOL and in this Bill properly implemented.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill as indicated in its Long Title is to enable this country to make provision to prevent pollution of the sea by oil and other substances, to give effect to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships of 1973 as amended by the Protocol of 1978 and to give effect to the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil. The International Convention of 1973 as modified by its Protocol of 1978 is known worldwide, as the Minister previously indicated, as MARPOL 73/78.</P>
    <P>The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Bill goes on to say:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> The main objective of MARPOL is to reduce to a minimum, and in certain cases prohibit, the operational discharge of marine pollutants from ships through the establishment of operational discharge criteria and procedures and construction and equipment standards. In addition, ship design features are prescribed to minimise the outflow of oil in the event of an accident. Provision is made for a regime whereby violations of the international rules and standards are prohibited and punished with sufficient severity to discourage future violations.</P>
    <P>The Convention itself as indicated by the Minister in his speech to the House comprises five Annexes which govern (1) the prevention of pollution by oil, (2) the control of pollution by noxious liquid substances in bulk (3) the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, (4) the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships and (5) the prevention of pollution by garbage from ships. The International Convention of 1969 and its Protocol of 1973 provide that following a maritime casualty contracting parties may take such measures on the high seas that may be necessary to prevent, mitigate and eliminate grave and imminent danger to their coastlines or related interests from pollution, or threat of pollution by oil and other substances which are liable to create hazards to human health, to harm living resources and marine life, to damage amenities, or to interfere with other legitimate uses of the seas.</P>
    <P>MARPOL and the Bill deal specifically with pollution from ships; the old idea that whatever you disposed of at sea would be dispersed in the big wide oceans is no longer valid. A number of examples have already been given by Members of the House of the kinds of problems arising from such careless activity. The National Academy of Science in the USA has established that each year 6.5 million tonnes of litter are dumped overboard from ships. A more recent estimate states <Col N="386" /> that five and a half million containers are thrown overboard from ships every day and of these 700,000 are plastic. It is no wonder, therefore, that plastic causes such havoc to marine life.</P>
    <P>Plastics, as the Minister indicated previously, are non-biogradable and once thrown into the sea are extremely persistent and potentially harmful if ingested by seabirds and marine mammals. I, therefore, welcome the provision in the MARPOL Convention which prohibits the disposal of plastics at sea and stipulates that they must be deposited in receptables at port. I urge the Minister and the Government to provide the necessary resources and facilities for port authorities and in some cases local authorities to discharge their functions under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Finally, I turn to the principle that the polluter pays. This principle is not expressly provided for in the Bill but it is a principle that should be accepted by the Government in relation to oil pollution at sea. Until now the oil companies have made the rules; now it is Parliament's turn. Over the years oil companies have built larger and larger tankers to provide themselves with cheap transport which makes good economic sense. However, a larger tanker is a larger pollution threat and I would like to see enshrined in this Bill the principle that the owner of the oil is the person to be made responsible when things go wrong. If the owner is made responsible he will take care to charter or purchase top quality ships. He will ensure that the qualifications of master mariners, crews and pilots employed by him are of the highest and that crews have the necessary navigational skills.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill will play a vital role in protecting our country's maritime environmental heritage but the real issue will be the extent to which the international community enforces agreed standards and conventions. Until it does so the risk of further accidents such as the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> and the <i>Christos Bitas</i> will remain with us to haunt us. I welcome the main provisions of this Bill which <Col N="387" /> incorporate very worthwhile conventions and protocols.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of this welcome Bill, as stated in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum is to enable the State:</P>
      <P>(i) to ratify the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973; (ii) to accede to the Protocol of 1978 modifying that Convention; and (iii) to accede to the Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in the cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil, 1973.</P>
      <P>Such action by our Government is appropriate and I do not think any of the previous speakers have suggested that we should do other than support and welcome this Bill. There might be one or two sections we might like to see modified but, basically, we are all in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own childhood, not all that long ago, when I spent time around the pier at Dún Laoghaire although one was aware at the time of many of the matters that are the subject of this Bill, none had the immense impact they have now. At that time, oil was not recognised in this country as a substantial source of power. We were still in the days of the great Shannon scheme and other hydroelectric schemes, the derivation of power from turf and so on, which made up a considerable portion of our energy base. Now, of course, oil provides about 70 per cent of our energy base. This has been repeated in far bigger economies than ours. This is the situation in three great economies &mdash; Germany, Japan and the United States. That in turn led to the enormous growth in tanker traffic carrying oil from such areas as the Middle East; other contributory factors to the growth in traffic by very large capacity oil tankers were the oil crisis of 1973 and, perhaps to an even greater extent, the closure of the Suez Canal in 1956. These huge tankers are several times larger than the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth which we think of as huge ships. <Col N="388" /> Yet they are dwarfed by these enormous tankers. We saw the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> disaster off the French coast and the recent Alaskan disaster which show what can happen to one of these ships. Neither of the ships I mentioned was a large capacity tanker. There is an enormous pollution problem at sea but that was very hard to envisage in those early days of my childhood when I watched the mailboat coming in and leaving Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>On a more mundane basis the age of plastics, again associated with hydrocarbons, is a recent development. We take plastic very much for granted now but, not too long ago they were almost unknown. A combination of possible oil spills and the disposal of plastic garbage are two of the greatest causes of pollution.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is possibly the most polluted cess pit in the world. It is polluted by chemicals, by ships' garbage and, perhaps most of all, by the deliberate disposal of chemical, noxious and toxic substances in the past and the continuing ongoing disposal of radioactive materials. This is appalling and I hope this Bill will play some very small part in beginning to alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>I understood that there was an agreement between the Irish Government and the United Kingdom Government that a maritime inspector would be appointed for the Irish Sea. I wonder what progress has taken place since then. Perhaps the Minister would comment on it.</P>
    <P>Not so long ago, we used to think there was a certain amount of pollution in the sea, and there was. Along the beach at Booterstown and Killiney beach every so often things came in from the sea. In fact, it was often quite exciting for the children to walk along the high tide mark early in the morning and see what had been washed up. The situation around all our coasts today is very different. Instead, one is likely to see an oily slime discharged ultimately from some passing ship, perhaps far distant, or alternatively a bobbing mass of plastic garbage.</P>
    <P>Even years ago there was pollution but the main cause was the sewage going into Dublin Bay. Even then the problem was <Col N="389" /> not so serious because there had not been the enormous increase in the population of Dún Laoghaire and surroundings which occurred in the last 15 to 20 years. An enormous improvement has taken place since the treatment plants were set up under the new, very expensive but very worthwhile sewerage schemes. We have regular counts of E-coli and various other indicator substances around the coast from the general Dún Laoghaire area &mdash; from Booterstown, Salthill, Dún Laoghaire itself, Sandycove and Killiney &mdash; and since the new works came into operation the improvement has been dramatic. Dublin Bay is being restored to the excellent state it once enjoyed.</P>
    <P>We are concerned about the pollution of our beaches and we have many excellent beaches which were given the Blue Flag awards. I am glad to see that the number has increased between 1990 and 1991 &mdash; we now have 67 such beaches. I know one of these beaches very well &mdash; Killiney beach. This is one of the prettiest and most attractive beaches in Northern Europe. Indeed, the view from the Vico Road is sometimes compared with the view of Naples. It is a beautiful beach and well deserves is Blue Flag. If this Bill helps to ensure that the excellent quality of that beach is maintained, it is a worthwhile environmental improvement from which we and all the families and children who go to beaches in Killiney and elsewhere will benefit. We are lucky indeed. It is a disadvantage, at times, to be the only State in the European Community which is an island. There are difficulties from the point of view of communications and costs and so on, but one tremendous advantage is that we have magnificent beaches and hopefully this Bill will play a large part in helping to ensure that these beaches are not likely to be as contaminated as they otherwise might be.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what we are really considering here in the MARPOL 73/78.</P>
    <P>(i) the prevention of pollution by oil;</P>
    <P>(ii) the control of pollution by noxious liquid substances in bulk;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="390" /> (iii) the prevention of pollution by harmful substances carried by sea in packaged forms or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons;</P>
    <P>(iv) the prevention of pollution by sewage from ships;</P>
    <P>(v) the prevention of pollution by garbage from ships.</P>
    <P>All these things will prevent and alleviate the pollution which otherwise might occur to our magnificent beaches. When we go to a beach in the west of Ireland, we would consider it to be crowded if we see another person there. If we compare that with the situation in most of the United Kingdom, France or Spain, we realise we are really very lucky. It would be a shame if our beaches were polluted. A seriously contaminated beach is a most expensive operation to deal with and we are seeing that now. Some of the beaches I know myself, along the magnificent sea coast of the Gulf of Arabia, the Persian Gulf, have now been polluted not just for a mile or two but for several hundreds of miles. For all the wealth of that area and all the technological resources that are available it will be an immensely expensive task. It is a task which, in fact, they will never in all likelihood be able to complete successfully over the coming years. It will probably be some decades before the compensatory powers of nature itself, extended though they will be by this disaster, will finally begin to restore the beaches in that area to the state they were in only a few years ago.</P>
    <P>Senator McKenna, among others, has referred to sea birds. Oil and plastic are terribly detrimental to the sea bird population. We have seen the tragic sight of these birds smothered in oil or caught in plastic. Again, anything that can reduce this, either from the point of view of the cruelty involved, or from the point of view of the beauty of the environment, is more than worthwhile. This Bill, is a major step forward in that respect.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a huge responsibility, of course. Not only are we the only island nation in the EC but, of course, the sea <Col N="391" /> area which now comes within our jurisdiction is far greater than that of any other European state. This sea area is tremendously important to us already, from the point of view of fisheries, and it has great potential importance in relation to the possible mineral and hydrocarbon resources. Although far too expensive, at present day prices, to consider extracting, they are potentially there. We have the remaining large structures capable of containing substantial amounts of hydrocarbons. It is important on the one hand that we realise this fact and, secondly, that appropriate environmental measures be put in place at a very early stage rather than, perhaps, too little too late. Again we have both a responsibility and an opportunity and this Bill has a role to play.</P>
    <P>As Senator Fitzgerald has pointed out, it is important that this Bill be accompanied by some other appropriate Bills or followed by them in due course. It is no use bringing in legislation stating, for example, that you cannot dump oil from your boat at sea if the appropriate facilities are not provided at our harbours. These are the sort of matters that we must look to. Legislation which effectively cannot be enforced or is impracticable, is not very good legislation. So one assumes that in due course secondary or follow-up legislation will accompany or succeed this Bill.</P>
    <P>Everyone talks about oil tankers, but one of the most worrying features of the present day ship traffic is not the oil tankers. In relation to the number and voyage routes of world tankers, and the fact that they very often pass by the shores of this island, we have been very lucky indeed. There has not been, so far, a major oil disaster. Let us hope there never is. The nearest were those off the Cornish and French coasts but what has been happening over the last perhaps two to three years is that the bulk carriers have also come into use, and the maritine authorities have been very slow to face up to this situation. They came into use originally following the closure of the Suez Canal and are now a feature of sea <Col N="392" /> freight. There has been a very worrying rise in disasters involving these ships. They now account for something like 30 per cent of all major sea-going disasters. Many of them are quite inexplicable, huge ships, perhaps 200,000 or 300,000 tonners, sometimes disappearing without trace and without warning.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some evidence that the actual construction of these ships, particularly those built more than 10 years ago, involves potential spreading of rust in certain vital parts of them. Under certain circumstances, if they are attempting to sail rather too rapidly into heavy seas, the strain suddenly becomes too great and there is a sudden catastrophic failure in the stress mechanisms or protective mechanisms in the ship's hull. The ship simply breaks up almost instantaneously. It is a cause of obviously great worry, from an insurance and shipping point of view, but it also has considerable significance in terms of this Bill. If one of these bulk carriers is carrying noxious materials, a very sudden rapid and severe disaster could occur which might be much more difficult to cope with than some of the potential oil pollution situations. There are aspects to navigation at sea and to ship safety.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take all possible opportunities, at EC level, to ensure that the excellent environmental legislation coming in is also accompanied by appropriate shipping legislation. There is considerable need for new and up-to-date international shipping regulations. It may seem at first that this is rather irrelevant to us. We have, unfortunately, all too small a shipping fleet. We are nonetheless in a geographical situation where a large part of the world's shipping capacity passes by our shores and our coasts and through our waters. It is of considerable importance that we play our role in ensuring there is legislation which would contribute towards the safety of these ships and reduce the likelihood of disasters at sea and severe potential pollution of our coasts.</P>
    <P>In the modern world this is something which has to be done through international conventions and co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> The EC is in a particularly strong position to do this, but the legislation has to be enforced worldwide. Today, a ship may be owned by financiers in one country and registered in another; it may operate out of a third and be crewed by people from a fourth country. Unless we have very comprehensive international cooperation and legislation it may be extremely difficult to ensure that appropriate standards are maintained.</P>
    <P>I would like to relate this Bill to our national environmental action programme. It is a very comprehensive, good programme and very well described in this the first Progress Report and Environmental Action Programme. We can and should all agree with that. It covers many aspects of our environment from the point of view of awareness, which is perhaps the most important, at the beginning. Air quality, water quality, inland waters, the marine environment, agriculture, forestry and many other aspects are covered.</P>
    <P>As regards the marine environment, the steps being taken &mdash; some of them belated &mdash; include the environment action programme which should eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns here within the next decade, admittedly at a huge cost of £400 million.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects which are very worthwhile in this programme, progress on the coastal scheme, in relation to the Irish Sea, the dumping at sea programme and the waste disposal in harbours and beaches. All these relate to this Bill which must be seen as just one part of what one hopes will be a comprehensive programme, relating to the sea and, in particular, to the prevention of pollution at sea which is so very relevant in this country. I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>This is progressive legislation inasmuch as it sets us on the course towards protecting our marine environment. It is now almost a cant phrase, and certainly a cliché, to say that our environment is really all we will be able to pass on to the next generation. It is our heritage and one we must guard. My <Col N="394" /> background is in islands. My ancestors moved from Wicklow to Omey Island in 1325, some generations later they moved to Inishturk, some generations later again moved to Lettermore in County Galway, and in recent times they moved to Dingle in County Kerry.</P>

      <P>I have a long history of interest in islands, in the sea and in the seaboard. Before I got involved in my present activities I was very involved in aquatic sports, particularly subaqua diving. Therefore, I have a love of the sea. Even at that time, pollution was brought home to me in a very serious way. My experience of diving has been in the sandy polluted waters off the east coast. The difference between being 20 or 30 feet under the surface in the Atlantic compared with the Irish Sea is extraordinary in terms of colour and cleanliness. I have seen many people after their first experience of the sea. People have become anaesthetised looking at the surface of the sea. The movement of the water is mesmerising and has its own magic. That is as nothing to the effect of the undersea life which people like Jacques Cousteau have brought to a wider audience. That is really what we are protecting. An extraordinary number of world figures have chosen to try to highlight the need for protection of the marine environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where we probably failed is in bringing home to people how precious and important is our marine life and the subaqua world of flora and fauna. It is nice to see flora and fauna mentioned in the Bill, specifically. One aspect of pollution that concerns me is that while there is a great sense of protection and awareness of open season and closed season on birds and mammals, an amazing number of people think nothing about going out in a boat with a gun and shooting everything in sight. That is appalling and it shows a <Col N="395" /> lack of commitment to the fauna of the sea, including the birds.</P>
    <P>The various definitions in the Bill, particularly of flora and fauna are also interesting and useful. The lichens and mosses which are some of the base parts of the biological circle need to be protected. They are part of what is not being protected at the moment. The Bill, which is competent legislation, is not nearly comprehensive enough in that it does not address many of the areas that require to be addressed. I am very committed to the idea of legislation which enables us to implement international conventions. In fact, I have regularly criticised this and other Governments for their lethargy in ensuring that international conventions are brought into legislation and implemented. It is good to see that being done in this case. However, a breakdown takes place, for instance, with the registration at ports of convenience of vessels who seem to be doing that in order to avoid complying with regulations of other countries. I would like the Minister to say if we are required, under European directives, to ensure that all ships registered in European countries comply with a minimum set of regulations. Is that the reason why other ships are registered outside the Community? That is my understanding of the case. A chain is as strong as its weakest link and a disreputable, irresponsible ship owner who does not wish to comply with the regulations required in boat building or in specifications of ships can register in what we call a port of convenience. I should like to ask the Minister if we have, under this legislation, any authority to stop coming into our European waters any ships registered in countries which do not require the implementation of the minimum specifications required by international conventions. If that is not the case those ships will be registered in ports of convenience thus defeating the whole purpose of the Bill. There is no point in our having legislation which is unenforceable against half the ships in the world. That is my reading of it but I <Col N="396" /> may well be wrong about it. The Minister should respond to it in detail.</P>
    <P>We will be the only island in the European Community by this time next year when the Channel Tunnel is opened. There will be land access to all countries in the community except Ireland. That is a very precious thing. It is something we can be proud of and need to protect. We are failing to do so at the moment.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Senator Conroy said about the difference between a beach in Ireland and one on the Continent and how we are less careful about looking after our beaches. I do not agree with him. I walk on a beach most Sundays and I am quite impressed by the care people take of their environment. I am also impressed by the outstanding work being done by certain local authorities, in particular Dublin County Council, the one I know best. During the height of the summer on Sunday afternoons they not only had waste disposal points but they had a bin and litter collection on the beach in places like Donabate and Portmarnock. For thousands of people to see a local authority doing that on a Sunday afternoon raises two questions, first, should it be necessary for them to do it? It should not be in a perfect world; people should take their litter home with them. People should realise that disposable nappies should not be left at the nearest available point. They should be taken home and disposed of properly, not left at the beach. The fact that collections are made by the local authorities raises an awareness and educates people with regard to the need to protect their environment. It has a spin-off effect and they are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with noxious emissions such as tar chemicals, etc. Over the weekend I spoke to the Irish manager of a large international carrier of chemicals. His company are meticulous about ensuring that they comply with all regulations. They carry chemicals on land. Unfortunately one of their carriers recently overturned in the Bantry area and caused a serious spillage which went into the waters of Bantry Bay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> The reason I raise this is because I would like to put on record his views as an industrialist who has no connection with politics, local authorities or whatever. He said he was extraordinarily impressed by the quick and efficient response of Cork County Council who immediately put booms in the water and set in place the necessary operation to clean up the spillage. They did it most effectively. He would regard himself as an expert in the area and he said he was delighted with the operation. We all know that Bantry has had more experience of this than anywhere else but nevertheless they did it so effectively that he said he would like an opportunity to put on record his appreciation of their work and that is what I am doing now.</P>
    <P>He also said &mdash; and this is a point which should be taken on board by those who query the effectiveness of local authorities and whether they can compete effectively &mdash; the cost to his company was very competitive and he could not argue about the final bill he received from the local authority. He felt he could not have done it any cheaper had he been in control himself. It is good to have that on record and to know that our local authorities have got this sense of awareness.</P>
    <P>If we want to see what can happen in an irresponsible world that does not care about its environment we can look at the Mediterranean. I do not know about other people in this House but I would not swim in the Mediterranean. I would walk alone on a beach but I would not go into the water in most parts of the Mediterranean. It was the middle of the world in Roman times and hence the title the middle of the terrain or the middle of the world. It has now become the sewer of the world in more ways than one. What has happened to that beautiful see is appalling. The level of pollution is dreadful. It happened because of uncontrollable greed, unrestrained commerce and too much trust in the entreprenurial zeal of those who would build on our coasts, dump in our seas and take without care for the environment.</P>
    <P>I would take a very strong line with the Green environmentalists who do not <Col N="398" /> want development at any cost. I believe in rational restrained and controlled development and I stress &ldquo;controlled&rdquo;. Is the Minister happy with the level of penalty envisaged in this Bill? I know the size of most harbours and channels in this country but as far as I know it would take one of these super tankers moving at normal speed approximately four miles to stop. In many situations at sea you can see for four miles ahead but in many you cannot. It shows how appallingly close to disaster they could come when moving chemicals throughout the world. The Bill makes it clear that we are dealing with the requirements for substances carried in packaged form. Can the Minister explain if that means containers? I am not clear about this legislation and this is a question I am asking. I do not like asking a question to which I do not know the answer. My grandfather told me years ago not to ask questions unless I knew the answers. I do not know the answer and I am seeking information.</P>

      <P>There is not much point in having specifications for noxious chemicals carried in containers on board ship if the same chemical substances can be carried freely in the hold of a ship. I would appreciate if the Minister would deal with that in his reply. It is the weakest link in the chain and is a typical example of where something could go wrong. People will not carry containers; they will simply put them into the hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not understand how this will operate in international waters. I know there are various laws of the sea, conventions, etc. Are we dealing with pollution which can take place outside our territorial area? Do we have power to do anything in such situations? As far as I know, all the oceans of the world are under the control of the various laws of the sea. I am not quite clear about how our jurisdiction extends beyond our area but I am sure <Col N="399" /> that will be addressed during the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I was reared in the same parish as Senator Fitzgerald, in a fishing port. I often wonder whether we have ever taken time to educate our fishermen on the need to protect and care for the environment. It was never part of a skipper's course. I remember checking that some years ago. Nobody mentions to them that they need to have a sense of responsibility for marine life, which is where they find their livelihood. It has never been addressed as part of their responsibility. It is wrong if they only take from the sea. It is important that they be made to feel they have a responsibility too. These laws are there for their sake also. We do not want people to find a way around the legislation.</P>
    <P>I was talking recently to the proprietors of a hotel near the town of Dingle in a very scenic area. They told me that every Sunday afternoon during the summer season and more irregularly during the winter season, they round up a group of local children to go down to one of the coves which is in a backwater near Smerwick and gather up all the plastic nappies which have been dumped into the water. For the sake of their business which is a hotel business they organise that clearup on a regular basis. That is a dreadful reflection on people who go to the beach for a day and just leave that sort of rubbish after them. Plastic is non-biodegradable. It will be there for generations and will cause pollution.</P>
    <P>In speaking about the environment I always refer to the new generation of carers for the environment who were created by my profession and by my members, teachers in national schools. The introduction of the new curriculum in 1971 brough back something that was lost for 20 years, namely, the subject of nature study. A very good friend of mine, a member of my professional union and a family friend as well Leo Hallissey, in the west of Ireland has been working with <Col N="400" /> the Department of the Environment on a project to develop the use of aquaria in different places around the country. What is so great about the work of Enfo is that they use simple things like lichen, rocks and crabs. They are not taking the beautiful fish you can see in any Chinese restaurant. They take the sea life that is there and it is important that people see shell life in an aquarium as much as anything else.</P>
    <P>Marine life includes more than just large fish. It includes the bivalves, anemones, urchins and so on. It is now fair to say that most people who came through the primary school system in the early seventies have a greater interest in and knowledge of the environment than those who came before that. I came through the educational system without knowing the names of trees or being able to identify leaves. As a teacher I had to educate myself in flora and fauna. It was an extraordinary experience in the early seventies to re-educate myself with the children I was teaching.</P>
    <P>It is good to be able to say something positive about politicians after the hammering we have taken over the past few months but there is a growing number of politicians who are sincerely &mdash; I do not use that word too often &mdash; committed to caring for the environment. I would put into that group of people that much battered man at the moment, the Taoiseach, who has shown an extraordinary interest in the environment. No-one can take that from him. His interest in it is praiseworthy.</P>
    <P>There are two industries based on the sea. The first one is fishing. We have failed in our fishing industry. Our fishing industry is not creating the level of employment it should. For example, for any person working at sea in European countries there are approximately nine to ten land jobs. In Ireland for every person working at sea there are fewer than two land jobs. If I could coin a phrase, we are exporting fish on the hoof. We should process the fish and then <Col N="401" /> export it to the huge European market. We have failed to do that. If we do not control pollution and develop the industry we will lose out in all sorts of ways. The area of pollution is a responsibility which should be shared by the fishing industry. They should be seen to have a role in ensuring that the marine environment is protected from pollution.</P>
    <P>We have an extraordinary length of coastline with a variety of beaches, rocks and cliffs. We have the Mountains of Mourne, the high Cliffs of Moher and the beaches on the west coast. There is every kind of beach and cove, be it sandy or rocky. There are a variety of island communities. They are worth protecting.</P>
    <P>I visited many of the islands off the west coast. Each one has a subculture and magic of its own. Each one has something to offer to tourism. There is a group of people who want to keep the west undeveloped and keep the sea as something that is there for the person flying in for the weekend from Frankfurt. It is there for the people to use wisely, whether they make their living from it or use it as a source of pleasure.</P>
    <P>What we have to offer to the European Community, and one of our great advantages, is clean seas. The Greenpeace slogan of clean seas, sweet water and clean air is something we should aspire to. This Bill is a move in that direction, although it is not as comprehensive as I would like it to be. We need to develop in a controlled way the fishing industry and the tourism industry based on the sea. I am aware that Bord Fáilte would like to see a marina every 35 miles along our coastline. That would be somewhat excessive. I do not want us to be totally overrun with commercial development but it is important that development takes place within the constraints of appropriate legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>Island communities depend on a clean and unpolluted sea in order to find a living. I shared my classroom growing up in Dingle with the last generation of children who were born on the Great <Col N="402" /> Blasket Island. It is a memory we will not forget. There was a sense of a loss. We are now trying to build interpretative centres and revitalise in some way the life which existed on that island before 1953. I would hate us to see the same thing happen in the inhabited islands along the west coast, Inishturk, Inishbofin, Omey Island and so on. Some of them are deserted at this stage. I am sure, Senator Doyle will talk about the Saltees.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I might spell it out in a bit more detail. In Ó Faoláin's book about island life and the sea and also in Synge's poems and dramas based on the sea, there is an overriding sense of salt &mdash; the Irish word is &ldquo;goirt&rdquo;, saltiness &mdash; which permeates the life and culture of the islands and that is the sense in which they depend on the sea for their existence and survival. They can only have that existence if there is a safe, unpolluted, healthy environment in which they can make a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They did not. We are now reaching a situation where all the islands could be depopulated because of pollution. I recognise that Senator Doyle and others are keen to say a few words on this legislation. Senator Doyle represents a coastal constituency but I represent the world as I keep stressing to Members of this House. My constituency extends right throughout the globe and I have a global interest in sea pollution which is why I raised the question of pollution outside the jurisdiction and how we might address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the legislation but I wish it was somewhat more comprehensive. I always welcome moves by Ireland to <Col N="403" /> implement the various conventions. There are many other conventions which we have conveniently ignored, for instance, the Montreal Convention on CFCs which is one of many to do with the environment. Aerosol cans are one of the items one sees floating beside plastic disposable nappies in the coves and beaches and we should address that point also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will continue my discussion with Senator O'Toole on how sea pollution was the cause of depopulation of the Blaskets later. I concur with him on the tragedy of the depopulation of our small island communities around our coasts. Many of them were depopulated before pollution of the seas became a big issue but this point is well made nonetheless.</P>
      <P>This Bill must be given a general welcome. I suspect like all maritime or marine Bills it was an extremely difficult Bill to draft and even as it stands it is a legal minefield because that is usually the case when international maritime regulations are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as we know ratifies what we refer to as MARPOL 1973-78 and accedes to the 1973 Protocol relating to Intervention on the High Seas in cases of Marine Pollution by Substances other than Oil. I would like to ask a question I asked four years ago when I spoke in the Dáil on the Second Stage of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987. What has happened to the Civil Liability Convention, 1984? Why is it not before us now to ratify? In 1987 we ratified the Civil Liability Convention, 1969. That took 18 years to make it to these Houses to be ratified. In 1987 we surely could have ratified the 1984 convention. We had the exact type of legislation that would have enabled us to do it, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill at the time. I would have thought this legislation would have lent <Col N="404" /> itself to ratifying the 1984 convention, particularly when this Bill amends portions of the 1987 Bill. I cannot understand why the Minister has reneged on bringing forward the Civil Liability Convention, 1984 which has major implications for this Bill, the 1987 Bill and the whole area of responsibility in relation to damage from ships and oil pollution, etc. I would like an explanation from the Minister.</P>
    <P>I checked with the Department this morning when I was trying to refresh my memory on this lest the 1984 convention had slipped through the Houses between 1987 and now, and I was reliably told &mdash; I would take anything from Minister Wilson's office as being reliable &mdash; that it is in the queue to get into the Dáil. In 1987, I was told it was in the pipeline. Four years later it is in the queue. I would accept that if we did not have this legislation which would have allowed that convention to be ratified because it deals with other matters immediately pertaining to it. It was a major omission on the Minister's part not to use this legislation to ratify the Civil Liability Convention, 1984, given the implications of not doing so. I look forward with interest to the Minister's response to that point.</P>
    <P>This Bill ratifies a convention. I would like an assurance from the Minister that the wording in the Bill is exactly similar to the convention it purports to ratify. There were major criticisms of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 1987 and the conventions that were ratified therein because the parliamentary draftsman or the Minister decided to word the ratification of the conventions in the Bill differently from the exact wording that was in the conventions at the time. The maritime legal experts pointed out the enormous dangers they are in doing so.</P>
    <P>Not having read the detail and the exact wording of the conventions involved in the Bill before us &mdash; one would want to have very little else to do for a long time to digest the words used <Col N="405" /> in that &mdash; I would like an assurance from the Minister that the words used in relation to the conventions we are discussing here today are the exact words in the original convention documents. We do not want to create a legal minefield that would take years and years of haggling and hassling through the courts of this land and elsewhere to sort out. The only people who would benefit would be the legal profession and not those we are trying to protect under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I am concerned about the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; in the Bill. I say this because there were major problems with the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; when the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> incident was being processed. The word &ldquo;owner&rdquo; is defined little bit better than it was in the 1987 Bill. I spoke on the Second Stage debate in 1987 on that Bill and recalled the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> disaster. When the matter of damages was being considered it was discovered there was a parent company involved. There was also an operating company and finally the ship had been chartered out to a seperate company again. In terms of the operators of the ship or those responsible for any disaster there was a pick of four different companies from which to decide who was responsible or liable at the time.</P>
    <P>I would like an assurance that this Bill, taking as an example the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> story, would cover the four possible definitions of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as was determined in the courts in the case of the <i>Amoco Cadiz.</i> It goes further than the 1987 Bill but I am not sure that we really tie down the case that was exposed in terms of the different levels of ownership in the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> case and the disaster that happened at the time. Basically we do not want anybody, owner, skipper, parent company, operating company, charter company or flag of convenience outfit to slide out from their responsibilities because of some legal wrangle over the definition of &ldquo;owner&rdquo;. I am sure the <Col N="406" /> Minister agrees with me and I look forward to his assurances as to the interpretation of &ldquo;owner&rdquo; as defined in the definition section of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the definition of &ldquo;ship&rdquo;. I have no difficulty with what is in the Bill; it is what is not in it that causes me concern. It was an education for me to realise how far fish farming and aquaculture had developed in terms of the structures in which the different species being farmed are contained. Effectively the structures used in our socalled fish farms are all but ships given the definition used here for &ldquo;ship&rdquo;. I understand &mdash; I am subject to correction if my understanding is wrong &mdash; that aquaculture and fish farming is not included in this Bill. Any pollution, effluent or garbage discharged from the activities of fish farming into our waters are not included in this Bill. If my interpretation is correct it is an enormous omission. Some years ago when talking about fish farming we were talking about an area of sea which was coralled, maybe netted or staked in, and the operation was contained therein. Some of what passes for fish farms today are effectively boats. They are big, wooden solid structures of one kind or another that are permanently anchored or moored off our coast. They would seem to come under the term &ldquo;ship&rdquo; as defined. I await with interest the Minister's reasoning as to why, given the difficulties alleged to have arisen by pollution from our intensive fish farming operations, they are not contained in the Bill. In fact, it is an important issue. It is important both to the success of fish farming and to the prevention of pollution of our seas. A section dealing with fish farms is needed.</P>
    <P>May I ask the Minister whether dredging of our harbours, given that the Bill refers to the prohibition and discharge of oil and other substances &mdash; the definition of other substances is oil, oily mixtures, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances, sewage or garbage &mdash; is covered in the Bill? Is dredging, particularly the <Col N="407" /> dredging of our estuaries which is quite a common occurrence, and the dumping of the dredged spoil on to banks in shallow waters around our coast, covered in the Bill?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a report prepared by the county councils of Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford on the water quality management plan for the Suir, Barrow and Nore estuaries. This is but one of the many excellent water quality management plans the Department of the Environment are requiring local authorities to prepare. I would like to put on record the views of local authorities on dredging and the implications of it. Paragraph 730 of the report states:</P>
    <P>In view of the importance of shipping to the local population centres and the susceptibility of the estuary to sedimentation it is envisaged that major dredging operations will be necessary at intervals in certain areas.</P>
    <P>It mentions particularly Cheekpoint and the Barrow estuary between New Ross and Cheekpoint. The report continues:</P>
    <P>While such operations will present some direct qualitative impact on estuarine waters, dredging may also have an effect in dynamic terms since it can mask a national cycle of events which could otherwise have taken place or induce uncharacteristic behaviour patterns.</P>
    <P>Any given regime will tend towards a state of equilibrium in relation to the natural sedimentation and erosion processes. In this complex channelised estuary there is a degree of associated instability and a suddening deepening ...</P>
    <P>I translate &ldquo;sudden deepening&rdquo; to mean &ldquo;dredging&rdquo;</P>
    <P>...or enlargement of a channel within a reach will at once produce local changes in velocity and flow patterns together with a completely new <Col N="408" /> pattern of accretion and erosion. This will be reflected in turn by variations in the sediment transport quantities which will affect areas upstream and downstream of that originally altered. The minute clay particles which constitute mud flocs provide large surface areas for rapid absorption of organic pollutants and there may be a built up of high concentrations of such pollutants in mud shoals even through the concentrations in the water above is well within permissible limits.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>Dynamic changes brought about by dredging may result in the release of anaerobic matter into suspension and increase the consumption of dissolved oxygen. Obviously any major dredging operation has the allied problem of ensuring that spoil grounds do not constitute to any deterioration in present conditions.</P>
    <P>In fact from this area of our coast the dredge or spoil is dumped on the bank flats between New Ross and Ferrypoint in the Barrow estuary. Fairly large scale dredging was, in fact, carried out in the sixties at New Ross. The report continues:</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;at present dredgings from Waterford Harbour are dumped in the deep sections of the King's Channel &mdash; the amount dumped there in 1984 totalled 29,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The dredging operations going on around our coast and in our estuaries for very good reasons could have a major impact on sea pollution generally if they are not tightly controlled within the ambit of this Bill. I would like assurances from the Minister that these operations, necessary and all as they may be, come within the control of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The report continues:</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a satisfactory dumping area the King's Channel in view of the depth of water <Col N="409" /> available and the weak currents in this reach. These dredgings contained small but measureable amounts of List 1 substances (mercury, cadmium and organhalogens) and of all the metals for which standards have been set... including arsenic and nickel.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are admitting that these are the type of toxins they are dredging from our estuaries, from the mouth of our rivers and harbours and dumping further out on the mud flats. The report adds:</P>
    <P>Continued monitoring and analysis of such dredgings is necessary to quantify the various constituents and to determine whether the source is polluted.</P>
    <P>Before they know whether the source is polluted they are, in fact, dumping the spoil of the dredging out further at sea. The report continues:</P>
    <P>Care must be taken not to apply large quantities of metals particularly, or other contaminants to the estuarine bed where their fate is still largely unknown.</P>
    <P>And so say all of us. I make the point rather strongly in relation to the dredging procedures around our coast. I do not think any of us have given sufficient attention to this procedure that has developed as very necessary from the local authorities' viewpoint and from the viewpoint of the management of the harbours and allowing shipping channels in and out of the harbours. However, from a sea pollution point of view, and from a marine aspect, I am not so sure that the activities have been properly monitored and that we know what pollutants are being dumped out to sea.</P>
    <P>On this point section 36 deals with the amendment to the Continental Shelf Act, 1968. Apparently, the continental shelf which is responsible for so much good around our country and has had such an impact on our climate, water temperatures and the flora and fauna of our <Col N="410" /> coastal waters, has been taking quite a battering for all sorts of reasons, not least because successive Governments have failed to provide the capital necessary for a primary and secondary and, indeed, tertiary treatment of sewage as well as industrial and farm effluent from the land source.</P>
    <P>Indeed, local authorities we must remind ourselves are responsible for managing the waste created not only by the human population but by the animal population and from the industrialised and commercial sectors. Section 36 states that the Minister for Energy, in consultation with the Minister for the Marine, may make regulations prohibiting or regulating the discharge of any oil, oily mixture, noxious liquid substance, harmful substance, sewage or garbage. I know the word is &ldquo;may&rdquo;. We have had many a debate in the House about that word, &ldquo;the Minister may&rdquo; do this or that, and not the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do this or that.</P>
    <P>As it was important enough to put this in the Bill, I assume the Minister in certain circumstances will be making regulations which will protect our continental shelf. We must ask the Minister to indicate whether increased moneys will be made available to speed up the provision of treatment plants that are needed in so many areas around our coast. At the moment a multi-million pound water treatment programme plant is being installed in Wexford. We have just finished one in Enniscorthy and I imagine some of my colleagues from other areas around the country will be able to indicate in their maritime constituencies the progress that has been made. It has never appeared to be politically popular to put much money into the provision of sewage treatment plants; it has been low on the political agenda of successive Governments. I am not making a political point, because all Governments in the last 20 or 30 years have been too slow to put in the proper treatment plants for sewage and, <Col N="411" /> indeed, other effluent from our centres of population.</P>
    <P>How, under section 36, does the Minister intend to direct the local authorities who will have to continue emitting raw sewage and not properly treated industrial effluent until the Government provide the funds for the treatment plants? I would be very interested to know the implications of section 36 for our local authorities. Section 7 (1) (a) refers to emissions from a pipeline. Untreated sewage and other effluents go into our waters around our coast from pipelines. This is a very important section that will impact heavily on local authorities. Can I take it to mean, in fact, that we will speed up our sanitary services programme, particularly in the maritime counties and in all our counties, because inland waters suffer proportionately just as badly because the dilution effect there is less than in the coast? Can we take it that there is a message in amending the Continental Shelf Act that the Minister intends to pursue local authorities and that before he does that he will, in fact, ensure that they have the wherewithal to provide the necessary treatment before any effluent is discharged into our coastal waters?</P>
    <P>On coastal waters and on the harbour dredging &mdash; before I leave this particular point &mdash; could I ask where this Bill marries with the Marine Institute Bill, and that marries with the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and who, in fact, has the responsibility for the protection of estuarine waters? I welcomed all the three Bills and have spoken on all of them in the House. There is an area of confusion as to who has responsibility for the protection of the environment in our estuaries. Certainly at the Environmental Protection Agency Bill stage &mdash; and it is not that long gone through this House &mdash; we did not get a satisfactory answer from the Minister and I put this point. When I spoke on the Marine Institute Bill, the confusion had just become apparent to <Col N="412" /> us at that stage because of the claims in that Bill to be responsible for our estuaries out to a certain point. In this Bill I take it that from the coast out at different points, in fact, pollution matters and breaches of same are going to be dealt with under this particular Act. I would like to know how those three measures and to a certain extent the Radiological Protection Act, which set up the radiological protection agency in terms of nuclear and radioactive discharges, fit with the other three? We seem to have four pieces of legislation, all with vague responsibilities for our estuary waters and our immediate coastal waters, but it is none too clear where the ultimate responsibility lies. I would appreciate very much if that matter could be clarified.</P>
    <P>I would like also to refer to the whole vexed area of limitation and liability for pollution damage. I know oil pollution is not the only issue dealt with in this. It is the total gamut of sea pollution. Other speakers have dealt very eloquently with the need to protect our coastline and the importance of our beaches and our marine environment generally. I would totally concur with what they said there. To go back to the oil pollution, which I suppose is the most technical and legally difficult area, there are a few questions I would like to ask. As the Minister is aware, the right to limit liability is given to ship owners because of the enormous risks which shipowners are exposed to in the modern world. You are into multi-million pound claims not only in terms of the value of the ship but the potential damage that can be done particularly with the bulk carriers which Professor Conroy referred to earlier.</P>
    <P>Ship owners insure their liability in mutual protection and indemnity associations known to us generally as the P and I clubs. The London P and I clubs between them insure more than 90 per cent of the world's tonnage each year and bear the first £750,000 of any claim against any of their members. Claims are <Col N="413" /> then pooled between the clubs up to about the £12 million mark and that relates to the £10 million fine that the Minister refers to later on in the penalty section of the Bill. After the £12 million cut off, the excess of any one claim falls on reinsurance underwriters with whom the London group of P and I clubs have placed their insurance. The London group of the P and I clubs are now insured for £1,000 million in excess of the £12 million for any one claim. That indicates the multi-million pound risk industry that we are talking about when we talk about oil pollution generally and the complications in this area. So great are the risks to which ship owners are exposed that the professional managers of these P and I clubs are discussing whether they can continue to offer unlimited cover, which has always been a feature of P and I. These managers seriously believe that there is a danger that some day they will be faced with a claim which will go through the present limits of cover and the present limits at the moment are over £1,000 million. The mind boggles. It is hard to even comprehend the implications of it.</P>
    <P>The limitation of a ship owner's liability has to be considered against this background and the right to limit liability should be virtually unbreakable to provide the element of certainty which is necessary when attempting to negotiate adequate reinsurance cover. Generally, the test which is applied for entitlement to limit liability is the absence of any actual fault or privity. I think the Minister is probably well aware of these arguments in maritime legal circles. As the legal profession has confirmed to the Minister, these words have been fruitful causes of litigation for many years, the absence of actual fault or privity. If limitation on liability is accepted in principle, which I feel it is, the right to limit should be more or less unbreakable to ensure that certain risks are, in fact, insurable in terms of oil pollution damage generally &mdash; of all sea pollution damage, but particularly oil <Col N="414" /> pollution damage. For that reason the more modern tests applied in recent conventions is that the entitlement to limit liability should be contingent on the ship owner and that he or she did not commit an act or omission with the intent of causing the damage which gives rise to the liability, nor that he or she acted recklessly or with the knowledge that such damage probably would result.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a lot of these issues will be cleared with the limitation convention of 1976 when that comes up for ratification. I would ask the Minister, along with the point I made earlier on about the civil liability convention of 1984, as to what is happening the limitation convention of 1976? It is most important in this particular area in terms of the right to limit liability, in terms of proper insurance cover and in terms of being able to enforce the polluter-pays principle if people are properly insured when we are into this vitally important area. We need only look at the damage that has been done to our coastline over the years in various catastrophic incidents and look at the <i>Alaskan</i> and the <i>Amoco Cadiz</i> and the others to realise just what damage can happen. I ask the Minister to indicate to me what is happening the limitation convention of 1976, and how he feels it could impact on this most important area of the serious risk of multi-million pound claims for oil pollution damages generally?</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill deals with powers of detention of ships if certain regulations are not met and if certificates cannot be issued in terms of faulty equipment or, indeed, of the structure of the ship itself. Again, in maritime legal circles there are major concerns about the powers of detention both in the Oil Pollution Act as it now is and, indeed, as proposed in this Sea Pollution Bill, 1990. The powers of detention appear to usurp the role of the Admiralty Marshal. We are into the whole area of the international maritime organisation and, apparently, the IMO could find us in <Col N="415" /> breach of the civil liability convention which, to my knowledge, does not contain this detention power. I also understand that the equivalent UK legislation &mdash; particularly in relation to the Oil Pollution Act but also in terms of sea pollution &mdash; does not contain the detention powers as we have taken them unto ourselves in this Act. I do not criticise the Minister for doing that but I would like assurances that the procedures being used to introduce detention of ships on our coasts for civil breaches will stand up in courts of law. I have no argument with criminal breaches or criminal problems. They should be detained, and anything possible thrown at them. In terms of the civil breaches I seriously question whether the powers of detention under this particular Bill will stand up in courts of law. Other nations, for whatever reason, have decided not to proceed in the manner we have here in relation to this particular issue.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the Second Schedule for a moment. One of the main purposes of the Oil Pollution Act, in fact, was to ensure the compulsory insurance of any oil tankers in our waters. We can have no argument with that. If in such a case the tanker is insured and an oil pollution accident occurs, could the Minister say in which circumstances an inspector or harbourmaster would be entitled to detain the ship? If there is limited liability and if they have proper insurance cover, if they discharge their responsibilities to the extent of their liability and according to their insurance cover, why or how could a ship be detained? Effectively, a ship could be detained indefinitely under these provisions as the procedure for court determination of the entitlement to limit liability could, in fact, last for months under this particular section, if that was going to be contested. According to section 13 (2) of the Oil Pollution Act, which forms part of the Second Schedule of this Bill, the ship could never be released but left to rot in <Col N="416" /> port. This is the view of the maritime legal people.</P>
    <P>We need to look much more closely at what we are proposing in this particular area. Where a court has determined that a person who has incurred a liability for pollution damage is entitled to limit his liability or that such a person has paid into court a sum of not less than the amount determined by the court to be limited liability &mdash; in other words, if the polluter concerned has discharged his applications in terms for paying for any damages done &mdash; surely he or she, the owner, would be entitled to have the ship released even if he or she could not prove he was entitled to the limited liability, if they have completed their obligations.</P>
    <P>Again, I point to the civil liability convention of 1984, which will impact on this particular area. I think without that convention being ratified we are in extremely difficult legal waters in trying to pursue our powers in claiming a detention of ships when they are in breach in civil cases.</P>
    <P>Again, in criminal cases, I have no argument with what is being proposed there. Could there be any confusion between the definition in role of harbourmasters and inspectors in this legislation? We have been over this before in different areas, but the last Bill was very ambiguous in this area. The marine lawyers were delighted with the opportunities that are there for them if they are ever challenged or have to take a case in this area. Given the role we entrust to harbourmasters and inspectors, I do think there is an ambiguity in the terms of reference. Even in this Bill to a certain extent, I think you can interpose the word &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; for &ldquo;harbourmaster&rdquo; in many of the sections. Could I have an assurance from the Minister that this will not cause problems?</P>
    <P>There are excellent sections in the Bill providing facilities for the disposal of waste, garbage, oil, sludge, etc., in our ports and harbours. I have major concern <Col N="417" /> about entrusting any further responsibilities to local authorities without indicating how they are going to pay for them.</P>
    <P>We have had a lot of legislation that reads well and sounds well, but which ultimately passes the buck to local authorities to implement. Local authorities are no longer financially autonomous since the removal of rates. I do not have to tell the Minister that with the block system there will be little left for providing disposal facilities in Kilmore Quay, Wexford Harbour, Duncannon Port, Cahore or Courtown and all the many ports we are so pleased to have along the Wexford coast, for example, but for which we cannot afford even minimal maintenance at the moment. We are already letting down the seafaring community in terms of our ability as a local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the maritime constituencies can be asked to accept more responsibilities which this Bill imposes on them, unless the Minister provides the wherewithal for them to deliver. I know the Minister makes provision in the Bill for allowing charges for different breaches of the regulation. I hope the &ldquo;polluter pays&rdquo; principle is clearly underlined in the Bill, but I do not think it is strong enough. It needs to be beefed up so that there is no doubt that those who damage and pollute our seas and our coastline will pay, and the moneys will go to the Central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The local authorities need proper funding to provide disposal facilities at our ports and harbours that are under the authority of local authorities at the moment. Iarnród Éireann's only port is Rosslare port and it will be up to them to provide the wherewithal for disposal facilities in their port. I am not too sure if there are any Office of Public Works ports. I thought they had all been handed over to the Department of the Marine, but I stand to be corrected on that. Office of Public Works ports are referred to in <Col N="418" /> the Bill. The biggest end of the responsibility will be with the Department of the Marine to provide these facilities. I do not think local authorities can be expected to provide the type of facilities we must insist on to keep our seas clean from the seafaring and fishing community, and the oil tankers particularly. With modern technology, those at sea for days will have a natural collection of refuse, garbage and effluent of one kind or another. Assuming they have the proper containers to store it for a limited period, when they berth, when they moor, there must be facilities for them to empty the containers and rid themselves of their waste, effluent and garbage generally. How that will be provided for the small ports when some of our large fishing vessels tie up there I do not know. The Minister must stand behind the local authority or the Bill will not be effective.</P>
    <P>What is the position in relation to this Bill and the Oslo Convention? How do they marry? I will not go into detail on that. The Minister is in a much better position to detail to me the relationship between the Oslo Convention and this Bill. I imagine it is a very close one and it will be all the better for that. Why, under section 4, in peace time, are warships excluded from the Bill? We can all accept that during war and during troubled times we are not going to get into the nitty gritty about warships and throwing the odd bit of effluent over the side. I wish they would not, but one can assume it will happen. But in peace time, why should warships be treated any differently to the rest of shipping traffic in our very busy waters around this small island? I do not think that is acceptable.</P>
    <P>Are fishing protection vessels warships? Are they excluded? I hope not. I hope, in fact, that the vessels of State and the vessels that are protecting our coastline should be leading by example and that they are included. Could we hear from the Minister what the status of fishery protection vessels are under this <Col N="419" /> legislation? How are radioactive discharges into our sea being treated under this Bill? Will they be treated with the seriousness that is necessary? Are the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues pursuing a policy of zero radioactive discharges as the technologies become available to retrofit in the case of plants which are emitting radioactive discharges at the moment?</P>
    <P>With reference to Abbotstown and the fisheries research centre, is there a commitment anywhere in this Bill to ensure permanent staffing at the levels commensurate with the island nation and the important seas around our coast? I know they are getting £2 million for contract staff work in the next year, but we seriously need permanent staff at Abbotstown to make it the institution we would all like it to be.</P>
    <P>Finally, I think the wonders, the mysteries <Col N="420" /> and the beauty of marine life enthrals and fascinates us all in different ways. During the week I was looking at a wonderful programme on the Great Barrier Coral Reef and the flora and fauna there. As other speakers have very eloquently state, there is a particular onus on us as legislators to protect the enormous marine resources around our coast so that they can be sensitively exploited and we leave them in a better condition for the next generation than we inherited.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill although I have some major concerns about the legal implications of the sections I have outlined and I look forward to the Minister's response to same.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>
