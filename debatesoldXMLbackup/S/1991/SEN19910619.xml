      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The particular difficulties experienced by those two teacher schools which through the loss of a teacher are reduced to one teacher and to request that the enrolment figure for the retention of the second teacher be reduced from the current figure to 28 pupils and that such schools be categorised as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hederman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to proceed with the cycleway around St. Stephen's Green as prepared by Dublin Corporation in 1980 and as discussed with the Office of Public Works at a meeting on 21 April 1983.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the light of the report adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the case of Mr. Raoul Wallenberg to express to the Soviet authorities in <Col N="966" /> Moscow the wish of the Irish people that they should: (1) reopen the file of Mr. Raoul Wallenberg and his driver, Mr. Vilmos Lanofender, and to state unambiguously what has become of them; (2) to allow an international commission made up of historians and other experts access to all the relevant archives and (3), presuming that they are alive, to return them immediately to freedom and their families.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to take the necessary steps to make safe the pier and breakwater in Ballycotton harbour, which are in a very dangerous condition following the storms in 1990.</P>
    <P>I regard the matter raised by Senators O'Toole, Hederman, Norris and Raftery as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator O'Toole's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Hederman, Norris and Raftery may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take all stages of item No. 2, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, 1990, to conclude not later than 6 p.m.  We will have a sos between 6 p.m. and 6.30 p.m.  It is proposed to take item No. 14, Motion No. 54, from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.  At 8 p.m. it is proposed to take Committee and Final Stages of the University of Limerick Bill.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to indicate to us the programme of legislation from now to the end of this session and if he has indication at this stage when this session will end. Secondly, may I express my concern at the discourtesy shown by the Minister for Education in the House last week to you, a Chathaoirligh, and to members of the staff and to say that this is something <Col N="967" /> which was watched by many thousands of people on television and it certainly did not reflect well on this House.  I would like that sentiment to be put on the record of the House.</P>

      <P>This is the third week we have asked the Leader of the House to give an indication of the business he intends taking between now and the summer recess.  I also asked last week for clarification of the position of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and when we are going to come back with Report Stage of that legislation.  It is important that we check, particularly in regard to legislation which is going to take research and work by those Members involved in it.  I have no involvement in the local elections but I made the point last week that, being realistic, we must recognise that the Minister and other people are involved in the local elections and if that is creating a delay, fair enough. Equally, if it is not going to be taken until August or September we should also know that.  We should at least have some indication of the position.  We recognise that because so much was promised in terms of changes it is going to take a lot of time &mdash; that is readily admitted &mdash; but we need to go that bit further with it.  We should have clarification also of the sitting days from now to the end of this session so that people can plan what debates they may be contributing to and anything else that might concern them.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if we could have a debate on small investors who are finding their entire life savings gone with fly-by-night brokers who just walk away with their money or go into liquidation?  I believe we need to change the law in this respect and to beef up the Fraud Squad. Could we have a debate on that soon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if it is proposed to have a debate in this House on the reports that are emerging that Colonel Gadaffi is once again threatening to deliver arms <Col N="968" /> to this country.  We ought to know the position.  We appear to be used as a pawn between Tripoli and London and the Irish people greatly resent the fact that Colonel Gadaffi appears to wish to punish Britain again by importing instruments of death into this country.  There was a motion in my name, at the time the <i>Eksund</i> was discovered to be carrying arms, calling for the breaking off of diplomatic relations.  If this is the situation, the Leader of the House should transmit to the Government the strong feeling that it is inappropriate to have diplomatic relations with a country that is acting in so barbarous a fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask if the Leader of the House would agree to a debate at some stage on the serious situation in Kuwait.  There have been a number of people executed and obviously there have been considerable abuses of human rights &mdash; reports are coming out of such abuses.  Considering the western world gave so much support to the situation that obtained in Kuwait some time ago, that country is obliged to ensure there are normal human rights in their state.  I am very concerned about the reports that come out recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, as some of my colleagues did, what business he intends us to engage in between now and the recess.  I would like to further ask him if he can give us an approximate date when he believes this House will rise this term? May I again ask the Leader to inquire from the Government about the foreign affairs committee which was sought by Members on all sides of this House.  We were told a couple of months ago that the Government had agreed in principle that such a committee should be established and we looked forward in anticipation to it.  We have been reading various reports in the newspapers concerning the Taoiseach's attitude to a Member of the Dáil, which matter I will not get involved in here, it is none of our business, but the Leader would allay disquiet if he could inform us as soon as possible what are <Col N="969" /> the Government's plans in relation to the establishment of that committee.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer very briefly, as Senator Manning did, to the business of the House last week because I was the person in possession on the Fine Gael side on the order in question last Thursday morning.  I would like to point out to the Leader of the House that the business was simply an order dealing with regulation of suitable conditions for part-time workers and that the Minister, Deputy Ahern, when he came into the House, in making his speech felt it only took two paragraphs to deal with the issue.  This was sensible, because it was not a Second Stage debate nor was it a substantive motion.  Equally, when I spoke on behalf of our side, it was for three or four minutes.  It should have been anticipated that the business would have take perhaps 20 to 30 minutes.  For that reason, I cannot understand the petulance of the Minister for Education in regard to the events of that morning.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House to ascertain from the Minister for the Marine when appropriate legislation may be introduced to cover a situation which has bedevilled the south-west coast, that is, the wrecks on our shoreline.  For example, in our area we had the <i>Kowloon Bridge</i> and the <i>Bardini Reefer,</i> which is blocking Castletownbere harbour, and the <i>Ranga</i> that came ashore in Kerry. Even though it is an environmental protection matter, it is not covered under the Environmental Protection Agency legislation which is currently been dealt with.  If necessary, new legislation should be introduced to cover that.  We are becoming a graveyard for wrecks along our coastline.  In Galway not too long ago beaches and scenic areas were polluted. New legislation will have to be introduced to cover this problem.  I ask the Leader to ascertain from the Minister for the Marine what can be done and to expedite legislation to cover this matter.</P>

      <P>De bharr na dtuairiscí atá foilsithe le cúpla seachtain anuas, ó <Col N="970" /> thaobh na Gaeilge de, ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Cheannaire a thóg mé go minic cheana.  De réir tuairisce amháin níl ach 10,000 cainteoir ó dhúchas fágtha i nGaeltachtaí uilig na tíre, agus tá curtha leis sin ag tuairisc eile a deir nach bhfuil fágtha ach 20,000, ar a mhéad, agus teorainneacha na Gaeltachta ag dul fad le lár na Gaillimhe.  Is í mo cheist ná cén uair a bheidh díospóireacht againn don Teach go léir chun ceist na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a phlé go fírinneach sa dóigh is go mbeidh a fhios ag pobal na hÉireann an fhíorstaid ina bhfuil an Ghaeilge.  An bhfuil sé i gceist aige, mar a d'iarr mé cheana, cruinniú a shocrú chun go mbeimid in ann labhairt faoi seo sa Seanad go luath?</P>

      <P>I am delighted my colleague Senator O'Donovan has taken such a deep and personal interest in my wife's home town of Castletownbere. Long may it continue.  I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has had any response to my query last week on the Order of Business in relation to the activities of the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier and whether he has any further information for the House.</P>

I would also like to ask the Leader if he has any information about the foreign affairs committee which has been referred to already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning and <Col N="971" /> Senator O'Toole asked about the programme of legislation for the rest of this session.  I have to say to Senator O'Toole that I have never refused to give information to the House on a future programme of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>It has always worked out approximately as I have indicated.  We will have the Environmental Protection Agency Bill as soon as possible after we come back in the first week in July.  We will also have to complete the Competition Bill, the Products Liability Bill, the Sea Pollution Bill and the Courts (No. 2) Bill.  They are Bills indicated to me as concluding in this session.  The indication, therefore, is that we will certainly be sitting into the third week of July or possibly the fourth week of July. That is something for the Whips to agree on.</P>
      <P>Senator Raftery asked about the insurance problem and I totally support him.  This House gave considerable study to the insurance regulatory system to eliminate this problem and it was very thorough in dealing with the Insurance Bill.  It was reckoned at the time to be the most important Insurance Bill for 50 years and it was primarily to cover the kind of events the Senator is talking about today.  While I share the Senator's concern, at this point I have no proposals for a debate on that matter.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris and Senator Ryan raised the issue of Gadaffi and Kuwait.  I have no proposals for debates on these matters and I cannot give the Senators any assurances in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Staunton asked about the business of the House for the weeks ahead and I have given my reply to that.  He again asked, as did other Senators, about the foreign affairs committee.  The position, as I understand it, is as I outlined last week.  My information was that the committee would be established and that there would be Seanad representation on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to Senator O'Donovan's <Col N="972" /> query, I will certainly ask the Minister for the Marine &mdash; he will be here with us shortly &mdash; about the problems of wrecks along our coastline and find out if there is legislation in the pipeline in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Ó Foighil, we had a díospóireacht here last March.  My recollection is that we had only four or five speakers, so I do not propose to have a further debate at this point.</P>
    <P>I have no response for Senator Mooney on the Anglo-Irish Parliamentary tier, but when I have information on the matter I will give it to him.</P>
    <P>Senator Hourigan asked about health services; I have no plans for a debate on that.  He also inquired about the foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <P>Senator Hanafin referred to what happened here last Thursday.  I have no comment to make on that matter.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag cur in aghaidh an ailt seo, mar creidim nach chun leas na tíre ná na gluaiseachta comharaíochta agus comharchumannachais a leithéid d'alt a bheith istigh i mBille a bhaineann le hiascaireacht.  Tá cúig cinn d'fho-ailt ann agus sa chéad cheann tá sé ráite gurb é Aire na Mara atá le tús a chur le comharchumann réigiúnach iascaireachta, sin é an fhoclaíocht atá tugtha anseo, níos mó ná ceann amháin, agus is í an aidhm atá leo siúd ná jab áirithe a dhéanamh ó thaobh iascaireachta ar na lochanna agus ar na haibhneacha.  Anois, anuas trí stair na tíre seo tá an-tábhacht ag baint le <Col N="973" /> comharchumainn agus tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach do mhuintir na tuaithe go speisialta, d'fheilmeoirí, do lucht iascaireachta, is é sin, iascaireacht amuigh ar an domhain.  Tá sé tábhachtach do ghnáthphobal na hÉireann atá ag brath ar chomharchmannachas le dul chun cinn eacnamúil a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Thar na blianta seo uilig bhí bealach oibre, <i>modus operandi,</i> inghlactha i gcónaí, le go gcuirfí comharchumann ar bun.  Tá an Bille seo ag dul glan díreach in aghaidh chóras na gcomharchumann agus gach dá seasann comharchumann dó, gach aidhm dá raibh ag comharchumann, gach meon dá bhfuil ag gluaiseacht na gcomharchumann, maille lena bhfealsúnacht. Is í an bhunfhealsúnacht atá ag comharchumann ná go dtiocfadh sé aníos trí na daoine iad féin, mar is iad an gnáthphobal i gceantar ar bith nó i dtír ar bith a chuireann gluaiseacht chomharchumainn ar bun.  Níor chuala mé riamh i mo shaol gur tháinig Aire Stáit nó Rialtas ar bith sa tír seo nó in aon tír eile chun tosaigh ag brú chóras comharchumannachais ar phobal ar bith, bíodh sé ina phobal iascaireachta, ina phobal tuaithe nó ina phobal paróiste nó réigiúin.  Tá bealach nó nós imeachta seanbhunaithe, seanléirithe agus seanfheicthe againne sa tír seo; tá córas ann atá inghlactha agus, an chéad lá gur léigh mé an Bille seo, bhí mé díomách, bhí alltacht orm go bhféadfaí Bille mar seo, in ainm an chomharchumannachais, a chur os ár gcomhair, mar, an rud atá ráite in alt a 1, go bhféadfadh an tAire ceann a bhunú, sin duine ann féin ag dul amach ag bunú comharchumainn. Má tá i gceist ag duine rud mar sin a dhéanamh nó ag daoine teacht lena chéile faoi, tá bealach ceart leis sin a dhéanamh, agus tá bealach inghactha leis sin a dhéanamh, ach ní fhéadfadh Aire ar bith ná duine ar bith eile teacht amach agus a rá go bhfuil an tAire ag dul ag bunú comharchumainn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bhí cuid againn sa Teach seo bainteach le comharchumainn le blianta anuas agus bainteach freisin le bunú comharchumann, ach ní fhaca mé riamh aon fhear ná aon bhean ag teacht isteach agus ag scríobh síos agus a rá, &ldquo;Tá comharchumann á bhunú agamsa&rdquo;.  É féin ag rá sin. <Col N="974" /> Ní féidir le duine comharchumann a bhunú leis féin.  Dá dtiocfadh, mar shampla, na hiascairí uilig le chéile, iascairí locha nó abhann, cruinniú mór a bheith acu, bailiú isteach i halla mór éigin agus go dtosódh duine ag caint agus a rá, táimid bailithe anseo inniu, ba bhreá an rud é da mbunóimis comharchumann.  Sin é an bealach a bhféadfaí dul.  Bheadh cainteoirí ann ó chuile thaobh, daoine a rá gur mhaith an smaoineamh é comharchumann a bhunú, gur mhaith an rud é gan rud áirithe a dhéanamh a bheadh i gceist againn lena aghaidh.  Cén fáth go mbeadh sé á bhunú?  Tuige a mbeadh sé ann?  Glacfaí leis sin.  Ansin phléifí na fáthanna éagsúla go mbeadh sé ann agus phléifí go ginearálta na rialacha a bheadh i gceist, cén toradh a bheadh air, cén chaoi a rachfaí i mbun oibre.  Bheadh plé ginearálta ag chuile dhuine a bheadh i láthair ar bhunú an chomharchumainn, bíodh sé ina chumann pobail nó ina chomharchumann réigiúnach, nó ina chomharchumann déiríochta nó iascaigh. Ba chuma.  Sin é an bealach.</P>
    <P>Deir an Bille i leith an Aire féin, &ldquo;he shall establish co-operatives&rdquo;.  Tá muintir na tíre seo agus gluaiseacht na gcomharchumann sa tír seo agus ar fud an domhain, go deimhin, glan in aghaidh an phrionsabail sin.  Má tá sé ag iarraidh rud a bhunú, níl le déanamh aige ach dul amach, cruinniú a ghlaoch mar dhuine phríobháideach ní mar Aire.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé ceart go mbeadh Aire Rialtais ag dul amach ag bunú comharchumann. Ní shílim gurbh é sin riamh an aidhm a bhí taobh thiar de ghluaiseacht na gcomharchumann.  Is cuma céard iad na haidhmeanna atá aige nó céard iad na fáthanna atá ann, níl sé inghlactha, dar liomsa, agus dar le go leor daoine eile, go mbeadh Aire Rialtais ag bunú comharchumann. Tá sé a rá go dtéann sé féin amach, go ndéanann sé féin fiosruithe, go mbíonn sé ag caint le daoine agus, mar a deirtear in alt a 2, go ndéanann sé an rud a fhiosrú ar bhealach ar bith a cheapann sé is fearr é a fhiosrú.  Sin anois an fear aonair, an duine aonair ag brú a thola féin agus a smaointe féin ar dhaoine eile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> Má táthar ag iarraidh go mbunófaí comharchumann ar an gcaoi sin chun cúrsaí iascaireachta a chur chun cinn, tá mise ag rá anseo inniu go dteipfidh air. Ní éireoidh le comharchumann iascaigh den chineál seo: ní fhéadfadh go n-éireodh leis, mar níl sé bunaithe ar an bprionsabal ceart.  Deir an Bille chomh maith &mdash; an rud is mó atá ag cur as dom &mdash; go bhfuil cead ag an Aire deireadh a chur leis an chomharchumann.  De réir ailt a 2 anseo, &ldquo;The Minister may, after such investigation or inquiry as he thinks fit, by order, revoke or amend an order made under this section.&rdquo;  Céard is ciall sin?  Tá súil agam go míneoidh an tAire dom é, mar an tuiscint atá agamsa air sin go bhfuil an tAire in ann deireadh a chur le comharchumann, le hordú, de réir na bhforálacha sa Bhille a bhaineann le comharchumainn.  Beidh sé in ann rud ar bith is mian leis a dhéanamh mar go bhfuil na comharchumainn faoi réir an Bhille seo.  Má chreideann an tAire nó duine ar bith, go bhfuilimidne ag dul a ghlacadh le comharchumann de réir fhorálacha an Bhille, ní amhlaidh an scéal, mar ní fhéadfaí glacadh le huimhir a 1 ná a 2 ná bheith ag súil le go gcuirfí comharchumann ar bun sa chaoi a bhfuil an tAire ag iarraidh é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ba bhreá liom cinnte lántacaíocht a thabhairt do bhunú comharchumainn ar mhaithe leis na hiascairí seo uilig, ach ní féidir liom an tacaíocht sin a thabhairt de réir an leagan amach seo.  Is é an tAire é féin atá i gceist anseo, ach tá a fhios agam nach n-aontaíonn daoine ar an taobh eile liom.  Bhí cuid acu ag rá an lá cheana gur cineál ardsagairt mé ó thaobh na gcomharchumann agus rialacha a mbunaithe. Ní ghlacaim leis an fhealsúnacht atá anseo mar is fealsúnacht an Aire atá ann; tá an tAire ag iarraidh a mheon a chraobhscaoileadh i measc na ndaoine faoin tír, agus a rá leo: &ldquo;Anois tá sibh i gcomharchumann, agus cuirfidh mise deireadh leis an gcomharchumann am ar bith a thograím, nó déanfaidh mé leasú cibé bealach is mian liom&rdquo;.  Is breá liom smaoineamh siar ar bhunú comharchumann agus ar an bpáirt a bhí ag cuid againn ina mbunú, agus 300 duine a fheiceáil <Col N="976" /> bailithe isteach i halla, idir iascairí, lucht tógála tithe agus mhná tí Gaeltachta &mdash; is gluaiseacht phobail é comharchumann. Bailímid isteach iad agus mínítear na rialacha dóibh, an córas a bheidh ann, an rud a bheidh ceadaithe, an scairchaipiteal a bheidh ann, an méidh a bheidh le híoc agus an bhallraíocht a bheidh i gceist. Baineann sé sin uilig le bunú comharchumann.</P>
    <P>Is é dlúth agus inneach an ailt seo a 4 ná go dtugann an tAire cumhacht dó féin an rud seo a dhéanamh.  Ní féidir glacadh leis sin mar chuid den alt agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil mé ag rá go bhfuil mé in aghaidh an ailt seo uilig.  Níl mé in aghaidh comharchumann iascairí a bheith ann, ach bíodh sé ann faoi rialacha agus phrionsabail an chomharchumannachais. Freisin, nuair atá sé seo á bhunú, in uimhir a 3, deir sé go mbeadh sé ann le haghaidh na carthanachta amháin.  Is é an tAire é féin atá ag socrú céard le haghaidh aidhmeanna an chomharchumainn. Cén chaoi a bhféadfaí comharchumann a thabhairt ar rud a bhfuil an tAire féin ag leagan síos na rialacha ann? Tá sé ag rá cén chaoi a mbeidh an comharchumann ann, cén fáth a mbeidh sé ann, céard iad na rialacha faoina mbeidh sé ag feidhmiú.  Sin atá á rá aige in alt a 3. Tá sé ag rá fiú amháin gur carthanacht a bheidh ann &mdash; eisean atá á rá.  Ach ní eisean a shocraíonn na rudaí seo; is iad na scairshealbhóirí, na daoine a thagann le chéile iad féin i ngrúpaí chuig cruinniú, ach tá sé á shocrú anseo ag na státseirbhísigh agus ag an Aire: &ldquo;Déanaigí seo, déanaigí siúd, déanaigí an riail seo a chomhlíonadh, bíodh sé seo agaibh&rdquo;.  Ní comharchumann é sin.  Cén fáth nach féidir comhlacht carthanachta a bhunú, mar shampla?  Cén fáth go gcaitear úsáid a bhaint as gluaiseacht na gcomharchumann chun an deacracht seo a shárú?</P>
    <P>Dá mbeadh an tuiscint cheart ag an Aire agus ag a státseirbhísigh ar chomharchumannachas, ní bheadh siad ag iarraidh é a bhrú ar dhaoine ná ní bheadh siad ag iarraidh rialacha a thabhairt isteach nach mbaineann go bunúsach le gluaiseacht chomharchumann ar chor ar bith.  Arís, tuigim go bhfuil gá le rialacha i gcomharchumann.  Is cuma cé acu, <Col N="977" /> comharchumann nó comhlacht atá ann, bíonn rialacha ag teastáil, mar is éigean bonn ceart, dlíthiúil a bheith faoi chuile shórt, ach, má thugtar Bille Rialtais isteach, tá bunús dlíthiúil leis.  Níl Acht Rialtais ann ná cumhacht Rialtais le comharchumann a bhunú.  Tá Achtanna ann cheana féin, agus níor ghá aon reachtaíocht a bheith ann le haon chomharchumann, mar a déarfá, a chosaint, ná aon reachtaíocht nua a thabhairt isteach le go mbeadh an tAire i gceannas ar chomharchumann.</P>
    <P>Tá Cláraitheoir na gCuideachtaí Carthanachta, nó Registrar of Friendly Societies, ann.  Níl fáth ar bith ann nach bhféadfaí teacht isteach chuig cruinniú iascairí sna réigiúin agus a rá: &ldquo;Anois, tá rialacha anseo, seanbhunaithe, sean-chleachtaithe, inghlactha ar fud an domhain agus seo iad.  Más gá dúinne mar ghluaiseacht rialacha breise a thabhairt isteach nó rialacha a bhaineann go díreach leis an rud atá ar bun againn a thabhairt isteach, tá cead againne é sin a dhéanamh&rdquo;.  Tugtar rialacha speisialta ar a leithéid.  Bíonn an gnáth-format ann agus na rialacha go léir scríofa air agus, ina dhiaidh sin, más rialacha speisialta iad, tugtar iad sin isteach, cuirtear os comhair chruinniú cinn bhliana nó chruinniú speisialta na mball uilig iad &mdash; ní os comhair an Aire ná na státseirbhíseach. Is iad na baill uilig a shocróidh go nglacfar leis seo.  Má tá rialacha ann faoi scairshealbhaíocht, nó faoi cá mhéad duine a bheidh ar an gcoiste nó faoi cé hiad na hiontaobhaithe, na trustees, tagann sé sin ón urlár, ón mballraíocht. Ná bíodh an tAire nó an tAcht ag cur rud éigin anuas orthu.  Caithfidh sé teacht aníos, ó na daoine féin, agus sin é an fáth a bhfuil mé a rá nach bhfuil an tAcht seo ag teacht le córas comharchumainn.</P>
    <P>Faoi alt a 4 den Bhille, tá ordú le bheith ann go mbeadh iontaobhaithe ceapaithe ag an Aire le tús a chur leis an rud.  Ní gá don Aire iontaobhaithe a cheapadh le tús a chur leis.  Tá na comharchumainn féin in ann é sin a dhéanamh.  Tá an bhallraíocht féin in ann é a dhéanamh agus níl fáth no réasún go mbeadh Aire Rialtais ag ceapadh rudaí do chomharchumainn atá <Col N="978" /> ag feidhmiú faoi rialacha atá seanbhunaithe agus atá inghlactha le breis agus céad bliain.  Sin é an fath go bhfuil mise go bunúsach in aghaidh ailt a 4 anseo go huile agus go h-iomlán.</P>
    <P>I ngach cuid de fho-alt a (1) go dtí fo-alt a (5) tá rian an Aire le feiceáil.  Níor chóir go mbeadh sé le feiceáil i mbunú an chomharchumainn ach go mbeadh rian na ballraíochta le feiceáil.  Dá bhrí sin tá me ag iarraidh go mbainfí alt a 4 amach.  Go deimhin féin, b'fhearr ar fad an Bille a tharraingt siar agus é a dhéanamh i gceart, is é sin, comharchumann a bhunú i gceart nó an focal &ldquo;comharchumann&rdquo; a fhágáil as ar fad agus ainm éigin eile a thabhairt air.  Ná bíodh sé in ainm chomharchumainn nuair nach comharchumann é.  Agus ná bímís ag cur rud ar aghaidh don phobal le glacadh leis nuair atá sé, cheana féin, socraithe faoi alt a 4 go bhfuil an tAire ag dul ag ceapadh iontaobhaithe.  Níor chuala mé ariamh é i ngluaiseacht chomharchumainn. Seo fo-alt a 5.</P>
    <P>The Minister may appoint persons to fill vacancies among the trustees so designated and he may remove any such trustee from office.</P>
    <P>Tá sé go huile agus go hiomlán i n-aghaidh prionsabail, fealsúnacht agus aidhmeanna chomharchumainn.  Tá sé dochreidte go bhféadfadh Aire a theacht agus a rá, &ldquo;Ainmneoidh mise na hiontaobhaithe agus má thiteann duine ar bith amach is mise a chuirfidh duine ina áit&rdquo;. Sin atá raite anso i alt a 4, agus tá an tAire in ann duine a bhaint as oifig, iad a dhífhostú, iad a chur amach.</P>
    <P>Is é an chaoi a oibríonn comharchumann ná vóta amháin ag gach duine agus má tá fear ar bith ag iarraidh a bheith ina iontaobhaí cuirtear a aim ar aghaidh. Bíonn cruinniú ann agus vóta faoi rún ann.  Ansin bíonn a fhios cén duine a bhéas mar iontaobhaí.  Ní gá don Aire iad a ainmniú agus níl aon mhaith don Aire a rá nach bhfuiltear á dhéanamh ach le tús a chur leis an rud.  Nuair a bhíonn an gnó sin déanta is féidir leis an bhallríocht <Col N="979" /> dul leis.  Ag ballraíocht an chomharchumainn an ceart na hiontaobhaithe a cheapadh. Caithfidh mé cur in aghaidh alt a 4 go hiomlán.</P>

      <P>Agus má bhí Fine Gael le cur in aghaidh an Bhille is ag an Dara Céim ba cheart é sin a dhéanamh.  De réir mar a thuigim an scéal tá an Chéim seo ann le leasuithe a mholadh, ní le cur in aghaidh aon Bhille go hiomlán.</P>
      <P>Tá go leor cainte déanta ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil agus níl i gceist agamsa bheith chomh fadálach leis.  An rud a rith liom nuair a bhí sé ag caint ná that some people look at things and say &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; but that in this case the Minister looked at structures that never were and said &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Because it is well known that we had a protracted or difficult dispute here and that the solution to that dispute would have to be unique or innovative. It amazes me that the Fine Gael party who, not so long ago were calling for an end to this dispute and a settlement are now trying to hinder a settlement on which there was general agreement among the parties involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The area I live in probably is the area in which this dispute was most bitter.  The message I am getting is that they have examined the Bill in detail, that the structures suit the purpose for which they were designed and that they are very anxious that this becomes law as soon as possible because they think that due deliberation has been given to it.  The anglers who are involved in this dispute are happy with the structures.  It surprises me that Senator Ó Foighil, who is dealing with co-ops for a long time like myself, does not see that in this circumstance there has to be an instigator.  There must be a <Col N="980" /> structure that is there <i>pro tem</i> until the boards of management are established. In the normal way this would not be an issue but here, obviously, it is.  It also amazes me that the Senator cannot see that the reason for the charitable status is the no dividend rule that applies to organisations with charitable status.</P>
    <P>I welcome this section.  I welcome it as the section that broke the log-jam in this dispute, that set up structures that people could relate to, that established the principle of one man, one vote, which is the core principle in co-operatives.  This was very important to those involved in the dispute.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the opposition to the innovation here.  We are always being lectured by the Opposition about their perception of our lack of innovation.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist amháin a chur ar an Aire, tríd an gCathaoir.  An bhféadfadh sé, b'fhéidir, barúil ar bith a thabhairt dúinn, cá mhéad comharchumann a bheadh sé ag ceapadh, a bheadh i chuile cheantar iascaigh nó bhord iascaigh, i chuile réigiún iascaigh.  Mar a dúirt mé, tá mé ag cur in aghaidh an rúin seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá a lán ráite ag an Seanadóir Ó Foighil inniu agus ar an Dara Céim mar gheall ar an mBille seo, ar na comharchumainn agus ar spiorad na gcomharchumann, ach is é mo thuairim nach bhfuil an ceart aige.</P>
      <P>I support this section.  I do not see how the provisions of the Bill are contradictory to the spirit of the co-operative movement and why the body which is being instituted under the Bill cannot be seen as a co-operative body.  Section 4 (3) says that a society established for the purposes set out in subsection (1) of this section shall be deemed to be established for charitable purposes only.  That seems to be very much at the centre of the co-operative ethos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further in the Bill, section 5 says: &ldquo;the Minister, with the consent of a society, or a society with the consent of the Minister, may amend or revoke the rules of the society&rdquo;.  It is open to change the society. As we go on, section 6 talks about the trustees, that they are responsible for the <Col N="981" /> management of the society.  In section 7 (3) we come to the core of the co-operative argument.  It states &ldquo;The holder of an annual share certificate of a society for any year shall be an ordinary member of the society for that year on the grant of the certificate&rdquo;.  The question arises, is it a society of members or for members? That may be what is causing part of the problem in relation to the argument.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ó Foighil that the farmers and the fishermen have been very well served by co-operatives in the past but I really do not understand why it is necessary for a group of people to assemble to form a co-operative.  The co-operative society was based on the initiative of one man, Sir Horace Plunkett, and the Department of Scientific Instruction, which was founded by him brought the co-operative movement to the country.  It is at the heart of Government as well to bring co-operatives into the country.</P>
    <P>I did not accuse Senator Ó Foighil of being a high priest of the co-operative movement, I believe he has not taken orders as yet.  I said he belonged to the high church of the co-operative movement. I know that the Senator feels he is a custodian of the soul of the co-operative movement and the soul of the co-operative spirit and for that he is to be applauded, but I believe the co-operative we have here fulfils the criteria which are required.  This point was made by Senator Ó Cuív.  If the terms of this Bill were satisfactory for the vast majority of anglers in the west of Ireland and the country as a whole, why are they not satisfactory for Senator Ó Foighil?  They were the people who actually demanded the setting up of this body.  The Minister acceded to that request and he is to be applauded for the fact that he brought an end to a very acrimonious dispute.  I do not have any difficulties about section 4.</P>
    <P>I ask Senator Ó Foighil in his defence of the co-operative movement, what does he recommend we put in place of this section?  How does he imagine we could regulate the affairs of fisheries in the country by deleting, as he wishes to delete, sections 4, 5, 6 and 7?  It interests <Col N="982" /> me that he did not also ask for the deletion of section 8 which talks about corporate membership about which I raised certain queries on Second Stage and about which I would have reservations. I am quite happy to support section 4 and I await the Minister's comments with interest.</P>

      <P>It is hard to know where to start trying to make sense of this legislation. I regret I was unable to be present last Thursday.  I can assure the House my views are totally opposed to the entire Bill.  There is an element of nitpicking by picking out sections and opposing them, but it is being done for a very good reason.  We are making a statement in doing that in itself, apart from any contributions that have been made in regard to the sections.  We have to cast our minds back to a few short years ago when the Minister's predecessor introduced the 1987 Bill in the Dáil and subsequently the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, and I know the same tolerence will be extended to me.  You are impartial and I appreciate that.  When the legislation that necessitated this subsequent legislation was being introduced to both Houses, the Minister for the Marine at the time assured both Houses &mdash; I was shadow Minister for the Marine &mdash; that he had the support of all the angling bodies, both trout and coarse, for what he intended <Col N="983" /> to do.  That subsequently proved to be untrue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what we are dealing with and I will abide by that.  The legislation we have before us, particularly the establishment of the co-operatives which is dealt with in section 4, is a result of the present and previous Governments' attempt to deal with the outcry and the anarchy that exists in trout and coarse fishing because neither the anglers nor their representatives accepted the previous legislation, the 1987 Act. Instead of coming here with section 4 which in a sense is the core of the Minister's attempt to regularise the anarchy that exists in a very important area, a natural resource area, I would have liked the Minister to offer to us the repeal of the 1987 Act.</P>
      <P>I know this co-operative concept was accepted by the various representatives of the angling groups around the country. Senator Ó Cuív, on the Minister's behalf, was being a little disingenuous when he suggested that all the various bodies and interest groups agreed with what is now being done.  The plain fact of the matter is that they do not.  We have had such turmoil for many years, such bitterness, in certain parts of the country more than others, and within all the groups interested in inland fisheries generally, that there is an enormous reluctance to raise the issue to the same level again. There is great concern about what we are doing here today, about this legislation and about the whole co-operative concept that the Minister is trying to foist into this area now.  It is not the answer to the huge problems that I accept exits in this area at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need now a repeal of the 1987 Act. Let us think and talk about it.  Let us move when we know exactly what we want rather than take what appears to be fire brigade action to appease different <Col N="984" /> groups throughout the country.  I admire the Minister's ability.  We differ politically but the Minister is a man of great intellectual ability and I cannot accept that he is satisfied with this gobbledygook legislation which seeks to resolve a problem by adding another layer of chaotic bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>My colleague has already explained his concerns about the abuse in section 4 of the concept of a co-operative.  I share that concern.  Horace Plunkett must be turning in his grave at what we are trying to do here today.  How dare we call it establishing a co-operative.  Call it that and the Minister will appease the factions. Issue a share certificate in what? One cannot issue a certificate in something one does not own; one cannot issue shares in regard to something one does not own.  Most fisheries are leased.  How does this square with the concept of private property in the Constitution?  The question of land and fishing rights is a vexed one.  We have many examples of that.  There will be the makings of an excellent play for John B. Keane if we continue with this chaotic legislation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister's common sense and his great experience as a legislator.  The Minister knows what we are trying to do is to gloss over a very difficult problem that exists because a Fianna Fáil Minister misled the Dáil and the Seanad some years ago and informed us that the angling societies at the time, trout and coarse, were satisfied with his proposal.  They were not and the rest is history.  We are now trying to undo the damage that was done.  I ask the Minister to repeal the 1987 legislation.</P>
    <P>My interpretation is reasonable given what happened subsequently.  I ask the Minister to look long and hard at what he is attempting to put through this House and at what he is parading as a resolution to a very difficult problem in relation to inland fishing generally.  Let us not go from bad to worse.  We are adding probably the most complex layer of all to what has been described by NARA as a jigsaw.  What will the shares <Col N="985" /> issued by the co-ops represent?  Senator Dardis put it quite succinctly when he asked: &ldquo;Are they co-operatives of members or for members?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Senator that specific issue of shares will be dealt with under the sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about co-operatives and their establishment under section 4.  A co-operative without shares will not be worth establishing at all.  Will the Minister explain exactly how they will function?  Without the shares, co-operatives are not worth establishing under section 4 so we need go no further. They are both inter-related intrinsically.</P>
      <P>What are the Minister's views on the constitutionality of what we are trying to do?  Will this be the legislation on which President Robinson will cut her legislative teeth, as it were?  Will it be referred to the Supreme Court?</P>
      <P>The views of very eminent people both inside and outside the legal profession &mdash; I do not profess to have any legal qualifications and I want to make that quite clear &mdash; are that we are on very tricky ground here.  They call into question the constitutionality of what we are attempting to achieve in this area.  There are many private fisheries.  Will they need a share in a co-operative to fish in their own fishery?  Will they be bound by section 4 and all that entails in relation to any fishing activity they wish to engage in?</P>
      <P>The point has been made that co-operatives were established to serve the interests of the members, either to help market the produce or goods of the members or as a second tier in the value-added area of the primary produce.  How will the co-operatives envisaged under section 4 relate to the concept of co-operatives as we now know them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 4 the Minister will empower co-operatives to raise and disperse funds.  Is the Minister satisfied that <Col N="986" /> the correct avenue for engaging in development is directly through these individual co-operatives, or should it be higher up along the chain of command in order to have proper co-ordinated development and proper control in relation to the development?  If the money raised through share certificates is only to be matched pound for pound in terms of development and a co-operative is not in a position to raise sufficient moneys, will the Government not invest in that fishery on the basis that they cannot match pound for pound any Government involvement, or is there an assumption that sufficient moneys will be raised through this procedure and that is all the money that will be forthcoming from the public sector?</P>

      <P>An chéad rud is mian liom a rá faoin óráid &mdash; agus óráid ab ea é &mdash; a thug an Seanadóir Ó Foighil uaidh ná ní raibh aon rud nua ann nach raibh ráite aige cheana féin ar an Dara Céim.  Cheap mise go mbeadh rud nua le rá aige, b'fhéidir leasú scríofa síos aige, ach níl aon rud scríofa aige.  Thug sé léacht dúinn ar fhealsúnacht an chomharchumannachais, nach raibh na comharchumainn seo chun leas na tíre ná chun leas na gcomharchumann. Chuir sé an-béim ar fad ar an Aire.  Anois, chuir mise in iúl don Seanad an t-am deireanach a bhí mé anseo coicís ó shin, go raibh socrú déanta agam leis na hiascairí, gurbh iadsan a d'iarr orm na comharchumainn seo a chur le chéile.  Bhí siad ag tnúth le cuidiú leis an iascaireacht intíre agus nuair a shocraigh mise ar an scéim seo dúirt siad go mbeadh siad sásta airgead a thabhairt chun an fhorbairt seo a dhéanamh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dá bhrí sin, cén chaoi a mbeadh daoine ciallmhara ábalta a rá go raibh mise ag brú ar éinne, orthusan a bhí toilteanach teacht le chéile liomsa agus an scéim seo a léiriú ionas go mbeadh siad ábalta cuidiú lena gcuid oibre agus a gcuid airgid le forbairt na hiascaireachta sa tír seo.  Dúirt siad go raibh nós imeachta ann, go raibh córas inghlactha ann.  Tá, agus tá a fhios agam gur éirigh le comharchumainn agus <Col N="987" /> gur theip ar chomharchumainn.  I mbeagnach gach cás bhí duine nó beirt b'fhéidir ag brú ar aghaidh le comharchumann a bhunú.</P>
    <P>Anois, is focal an-tábhachtach é &ldquo;inghlactha&rdquo;. Bhí mise ag plé leis na deacrachtaí seo le breis agus bliain, agus tá na bunphrionsabail atá taobh thiar den Bhille seo inghlactha ag na daoine atá ag gníomhú mar iascairí.  Ghlac mé comhairle, fiú amháin, leis an ICOS.  Tá nath sa Bhéarla mar gheall ar sheanmháthair agus uibheacha agus ba mhaith liom dá mbeadh an Seanadóir Ó Foighil toilteanach smaoineamh ar an nath sin mar ní féidir leis-sean aon rud a mhúineadh domsa mar gheall ar chomharchumannachas, agus tá sé sin ráite agam cheana féin, mar tháinig duine de na bunaitheoirí as mo chontae féin chun cuidiú le Horace Plunkett agus AE, file agus scríbhneoir clúiteach.</P>
    <P>Maidir le hiontaobhaithe, tá a fhios ag an Seanadóir, agus rinneadh soiléir é, nach mbeadh siad ann ach go dtí go mbeidh an comharchumann ag gníomhú as a stuaim féin agus modh bainistíochta acu féin, agus vóta ag gach duine go bhfuil scair aige ag toghadh an bhoird sin.</P>
    <P>Tá mé buíoch den Seanadóir Ó Cuív as an méid atá ráite aige.  Chuir sé ceist orm faoin méid comharchumann a bheidh ann.  Thig linn ceann a bheith againn i ngach réigiún.  Tá mise ag smaoineamh ar réigiún amháin atá an-fhada ar fad, thiar theas ó Luimneach agus a chríochnaíonn i mo chontae féin ag pointe na Sionna agus b'fhéidir go mbeidh dhá cheann ansin; níl sé sin socraithe againn, ach rachaidh mé i gcomhairle le daoine roimhre.  Mar a duirt an Seanadóir Ó Cuív, &ldquo;bitter strife&rdquo; a bhí ann.  He said he was aware of what happened in his own area and welcomed, which is one of the strong points, the innovation in this Bill which helped to break, as he said, the logjam.  He also emphasised the importance of participation and the one man, one vote presence in this mould-breaking exercise.</P>
    <P>I was grateful for the support of Senator Dardis.  I am glad that in his <Col N="988" /> opinion &mdash; he gave a mature and considered opinion &mdash; it was not contradictory to the co-operative spirit and emphasised strongly, as did Senator Ó Cuív, the democratic process incorporated in the Bill.  He referred to Horace Plunkett who came to my area long before co-operatives were heard of in other parts of the country even though some people may set themselves up as <i>custos animae</i> or keepers of the soul of the co-operative movement.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle came in to oppose and said that in regard to the method employed, a statement was being made by the Fine Gael Party.  This could have been done by tabling amendments and would have given me an opportunity to assess them and see if, in any way, I could make use of them.  I want to emphasise that this Bill did not spring like Athena fully armed from the head of Zeus.  It was as a result of a long, evolutionary process, of very pompilus debate and discussion when cognisance was taken of every possible point of view.  Every association was met and their points discussed, including the one mentioned by Senator Doyle.</P>
    <P>She called this section of the Bill fire brigade action.  I would not like to own the house that was on fire for 18 months and wait that long for the fire brigade to arrive.  What is before the House is as a result of long and serious discussion with the people who wanted a means by which they could contribute to the development of the inland fisheries.  They saw this as a way by which it could be done.  It is not true to say that my predecessor misled anybody.  He may himself have been misled.  He may have thought he had support when he did not.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the shares is to give an opportunity to provide for the development of inland fisheries to the people who said that was what they were most anxious to do.</P>

      <P>It would not give them power to decide on policies of development or decide on what should or should not be done, nor would it give them <Col N="989" /> power to elect their own board of management, decide their own business or receive money from the State in the first instance.  It would not do any of those things for them and that is the whole purpose in having the co-operative.  This is at the request of the fishermen.  I want to emphasise that.  They want to contribute. They want to organise and decide on policy in their own area.  They will also have power to vote for members of the regional boards in the various areas.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised the matter of constitutionality.  Needless to say, I had consultations with the Attorney General and he assured me that the Bill, including section 4, is in accordance with the Constitution and it is with great confidence that I ask Seanad Éireann to pass it.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his considered reply.  Under this section, will the same rules apply to all co-operatives or can they be varied, region to region?  Are we talking about a national set of rules to be applied to each co-operative? Through the co-operative structure that is now being set up, can rights be conferred over areas that the co-ops will not own?  How can you confer rights over land and fisheries that are not owned by the co-operatives?  Issuing certificates does not give the individual fishermen, anglers or co-op any rights over areas they do not own.  In some areas they own them.  In most areas they lease them.  There are many fishing areas that are not structured as yet.  They are neither leasehold, private nor public fisheries.  How will we be able to confer rights over areas that the co-ops do not own and still be on the right side of the Constitution?</P>
      <P>This section is unworkable.  Fishermen and anglers were looking for a formula to resolve the problems of the 1987 Act. Initially the co-operative structure appeared to be the best formula to get off the hook that they and the Minister had been hoisted on over the 1987 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The anglers have said that by the time their discussions with the Minister and his officials had been processed through the parliamentary draftsman and the <Col N="990" /> Attorney General had a go at different parts of it, what we will present back to them is not quite what they had envisaged. They had a co-operative structure in mind but what we are handing back to them is not what they had in mind.  What we are putting in place is unworkable, undemocratic and will be proved to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a set of rules and, written into the Bill, will be procedures for changing the rules, if necessary, from place to place.  There is no ownership right attendant on this.  It is not a question of ownership.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle said that we worked on a scheme but when the Bill was put together it was not what had been agreed. This is wrong because I brought the Bill to a meeting in Portlaoise where there were people from the four provinces.  I went through it with them and agreed the exact format of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I did not understand the Minister's response to a question I asked previously.  Will the same rules apply to all co-operatives?  The Minister responded to that but I was not quite sure what he meant.  Will there be a national set of rules laid down by him that will apply to all co-operatives which can subsequently be altered at the request of a co-op by order of the Minister.  If I owned a fishery, which I do not, would I have to have a share certificate to fish in my own fishery?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question but I will answer it again.  A set of rules will govern the co-operatives, not laid down by me but a set of rules agreed with the fishermen.  There are structures incorporated in the Bill to enable the rules to be amended.  The Minister and the co-operative, acting in unison &mdash; it does not matter from what side the initiative comes &mdash; can change them.</P>
      <P>With regard to the share certificate, the co-operative working in the area will democratically decide, by a 60 per cent majority, whether a share certificate is needed to fish in a particular area.  I think that 60 per cent is a solid kind of majority to look for and must be an indication of the will of the people in that area.  We regard much less than 60 per cent as a democratic majority.  The people who vote will make the decision for all the fishing in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 4 deals with the establishment of fishery co-operative societies.  I know why the Minister is attempting to establish those co-operatives. I accept also that anglers generally have agreed to the concept of co-operatives to resolve the present impasse.  It is something I would prefer to have done rather than to repeal the 1987 Act.  I understand that this is a formula for getting us off the hook in regard to the licence and, at the same time, getting funds through a structure which can be rechannelled into the development of inland fisheries.  What we are setting up has been called a co-operative structure. <Col N="994" /> It is not a co-operative but perhaps it does not matter if we call it something that everybody is happy to call it.  Even a club structure at district and regional level, with ministerial input and matching of Government funds, would be able to develop fisheries to the same extent provided there was a vehicle for collecting money from their members.  The only vehicle through which one can collect money at the moment is through a licence fee and that brings us back to the present difficulty.</P>
      <P>This is a mechanism for collecting money in another guise in an organised, structured way and reinvesting it in the development of fisheries.  It is not a co-operative. It may be a formula for resolving the anarchy in coarse angling and trout angling at the moment, but let us not abuse the concept or the whole philosophy of co-operative societies with what we are trying to do.  Perhaps, if by putting a name on something we resolve a major issue, one that has been a huge dilemma, it may be excused.  However, we need to be frank about what we are doing.  We have a formula for a solution to a problem but it is not the setting up of a co-operative, so I think it is a misnomer.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ceist eile a chur ar an Aire.  Nuair a rinne sé a thuras, nó a oilithreacht, más maith leat sin a thabhairt air, síos go Port Laoise, an raibh an Bille seo ina láimh aige nó na rialacha comharchumann?  Nó an raibh an Bille i bpóca amháin agus na rialacha le haghaidh bhunú comharchumann i bpóca eile?  Céard a d'úsáid sé?  An tuiscint atá agamsa ón méid atá ráite aige ná go raibh sé i gceist aige comharchumann a bhunú.  Dá mbeadh duine ar bith ag bunú gluaiseacht ar bith, abair craobh den GAA nó de chomhar creidmheasa, thabharfá rialacha an GAA nó chomhar creidmheasa leat agus mhíneofá iad do na daoine a bhí bailithe timpeall ort.  Ach, céard a rinne an tAire anseo?  Chuaigh sé go Port Laoise agus thug sé Bille leis.  Ar thug sé rialacha comharchumann leis?  Ba mhaith liom a fhios sin a bheith agam, mar, murar thug sé rialacha comharchumann <Col N="995" /> leis bhí sé ag iarraidh rud a dhéanamh a bhí indéanta.  Ní fhéadfaí comharchumann a bhunú gan na rialacha a bheith aige, gan gach rud a bhí faoi réir na rialacha a phlé arís agus arís eile, ach níor deineadh é sin.</P>
      <P>Maidir leis an Seanadóir O Cuív a rá liomsa go raibh cineál leisce orm nuair nár chuir mé isteach sa rud seo ach cur in aghaidh alt a 4.  Níl aon bhealach go bhféadfainn leasú a dhéanamh ar alt a 4 mar creidim, faoin gcóras comharchumainn, nach bhféadfaí é a dhéanamh. Ní fhéadfá leasú a dhéanamh ar alt a 1 go dtí a 5 ar an gcaoi sin.  An t-aon bhealach go bhféadfaí leasú a dhéanamh faoin mBille ná é a tharraingt siar go hiomlán agus ainm nua a chur air.  Feicfidh Seanadóirí, de réir mar atáimid ag dul ar aghaidh, nach bhfuil sé ag dul de réir rialacha comharchumann, a bheag ná a mhór.  Mar a dúirt mé leis an Aire níl mé in aghaidh an phrionsabail go mbunófaí gluaiseacht a chuirfidh deireadh leis an aighneas seo.  Maidir leis an Seanadóir Ó Cuív tá na tithe céanna siúlta agamsa freisin le cúpla seachtain.  Ní raibh mé sa bhaile go deas ciúin nuair a bhí seisean ag dul thart ar na tithe.  Bhí mise ag dul thart orthu freisin agus níor luadh comharchumann liom in aon chor. Dúradh liom go raibh siad ag iarraidh deireadh a chur leis an aighneas, agus tá sé sin cinnte.  Tá mise ag iarraidh fáil réidh leis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bímis réidh leis, ach ná húsáidaimis struchtúr comharchumainn le rud a dhéanamh nach cóir a dhéanamh.  Dar liomsa níl sé ceart de réir dlí ná de réir an Bhunreachta go mbunóimis comharchumann agus go rachadh an tAire síos go Port Laoise le Bille in áit rialacha comharchumainn.  Mar sin, tá mé ag iarraidh freagra uaidh an raibh rialacha comharchumainn aige ag dul ansin, ar mhínigh sé na rialacha, agus ar ghlac na daoine le rialacha.  Ansin, má deir sé liomsa gur ghlac siad le rialacha comharchumainn, glacfaidh mise leis go bhfuil an Bille seo i gceart.  Má deir sé liom gur thug sé Bille dóibh in ionad rialacha ní féidir liom glacadh leis agus sin an fáth <Col N="996" /> nach bhféadfainn aon leasú a dhéanamh ar an reachtaíocht.</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle gave the essence of what we are about and she is perfectly right.  It is a method by which the people involved agreed to help the funding and development of inland fisheries. That is what the section is about.</P>
      <P>One of the big complaints during the long, sometimes tedious, careful and punctilious negotiations, constantly raised by all associations representing fishermen was that their voluntary work and investment, the money they collected for the development of inland fisheries, was not in any way appreciated.  I saw this particular scheme as a way of showing such appreciation.  The volume of work they do, and have done, is unbelievable in their commitment to a sport which they love.  Also incorporated in this Bill is a provision for corporate membership which helps the clubs and which they welcome.</P>
      <P>Bhí áthas orm an méid seo a chloisteáil ón Seanadóir Ó Cuív go raibh taithí aige ar chásanna san iarthar nuair nár oir an struchtúr a bhí ag ICOS do chomharchumann éigin.  Nuair a bhí sé ag caint an lá faoi dheireadh dúirt sé go raibh gá sa chás seo, ar aon chaoi, le coincheap nua agus sin an méid atá againn anseo.  Bhí an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag caint faoi rialacha. Dúirt mise leis gur phléigh mé an Bille seo, gur leasaigh mé an Bille seo tar éis an chruinnithe sin a bhí agam leo i bPort Laoise.  Tá leasuithe anois sa Bhille a tháinig as an chruinniú sin agus beimid ag teacht ar ais go dtí alt a 5.  Tá mionscrúdú ar na rialacha in alt a 5, agus bhíodar siúd sásta go raibh mise ar an mbóthar ceart.  Beidh cainteanna eile agam a thúisce agus a bheidh an Bille seo ina Acht, sínithe ag an Uachtarán, mar gheall ar na ceannteidil atá luaite in alt a 5.</P>

      <P>Caithfidh mé teacht ar ais mar níor fhreagair an tAire an cheist a chuir mé air.  D'fhiafraigh mé de go neamhbhalbh, nuair a chuaigh sé go Port Laoise le labhairt le slua iascairí a bhí bailithe le chéile agus é ar intinn aige <Col N="997" /> comharchumann a bhunú, an raibh rialacha comharchumann aige lena míniú dóibh, rialacha atá ann le blianta fada, agus go bhféadfaí iadsan a leasú de réir a chéile, nó an ndeachaigh sé ann agus gan aige ach an Bille.  Ní ionann Bille agus rialacha comharchumann, agus sin é an bhunchúis go bhfuil mé in aghaidh seo.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Ó Cuív, bhí amanna ann i ngluaiseacht na gcomharchumann go raibh na struchtúir as dáta, mícheart agus go mba chóir iad a athrú. Glacaim leis sin go hiomlán ach cé a rinne na hathruithe sin?  Cé a rinne na struchtúir sin a athrú?  Tá bealach faoi rialacha comharchumann chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Is féidir riail speisialta a mholadh ag cruinniú speisialta, agus é a dhéanamh ar an mbealach sin.  Níl aon rud agam in aghaidh rialacha a athrú de réir a chéile, ach is é a deirim ná nach féidir comharchumann a bhunú gan rialacha a bheith ann i dtosach báire.</P>
      <P>Tá sé ráite ag an Aire anseo, &ldquo;The Minister shall by order establish fishery co-operative societies in different regions&rdquo;. He is going to do it.  É féin, an tAire.  Agus cén chaoi ar féidir leis dul síos go Port Laoise agus Bille ina láimh aige agus gan a fhios ag na hiascairí céard a bheidh á dhéanamh aige?  Ó thaobh ailt a 4 den Bhille, sin an deireadh, sin an dlí. Ní féidir le grúpa iascairí teacht le chéile agus é seo a athrú.  Is féidir leo rialacha comharchumainn a athrú, ach níor tugadh dóibh iad.  Níor inis an tAire domsa fós an raibh rialacha aige nuair a chuaigh sé go Port Laoise.  Ar ghlac siad leo agus, ansin, ar bunaíodh comharchumann ann, nó an amhlaidh go bhfuil sé ag fanacht go mbeidh dlí aige anseo agus lámha chuile dhuine ceangailte, mar tá sé ráite go soiléir anseo gurb é an tAire a bhunóidh na comharchumainn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been circling this one point for over an hour.  It has got to the stage where one should inquire from the Chair whether there is anything in Standing Orders to allow us to move on from this point.  On at least two occasions the Minister has said, as Gaeilge agus as Béarla, that under section 5 (3) the <Col N="998" /> Minister, with the consent of a society, or a society with the consent of the Minister, may amend or revoke the rules of the society.  How clear do Senators want it? If Senator Ó Foighil means that the rules of this society are not in accordance with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society he may well be right.  However, it is not any less a co-operative because it is not under the umbrella of the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society.</P>
      <P>As to whether this Bill is unconstitutional, that is not for this House to decide. That is for the President to decide, if she wishes to refer it to the courts, or for Senator Ó Foighil if he wishes, outside this House, to bring a case to the courts to establish the constitutionality or otherwise of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Mar a dúirt an Seanadóir Dardis, is dóigh liom go bhfuil an díospóireadht seo imithe ar aghaidh an-fhada. Ach díreach cúpla pointí, the ICOS are not the arbiters of what is a co-operative society.  Basically, what would be involved is registration with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and he is the person who would decide if the rules were admissible in that context.  If Seanadóir Ó Foighil remembers correctly, the Gaeltacht co-operatives were obliged by Roinn na Gaeltachta to consult ICOS for grant purposes before we changed our rules but we did not have to take their advice.  I did not hear an Seanadóir Ó Foighil creating a racket when co-operative societies attached themselves to plcs as a vehicle to overcome some of the capital deficiencies that exist in co-operative societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many types of co-operative societies.  There is a co-operative society, Shannonside for example, where three co-operatives form one co-operative society and the rules of eight members and so on go out the window.  Therefore, a co-operative society is a very wide concept. Any eight people, for their own private purposes, can form a co-operative society.  Because an Seanadóir Ó Foighil has a certain concept of a community co-operative, with which he and I are <Col N="999" /> familiar, but which in law has no standing, it does not mean that is the only type of co-operative society that exists.</P>
    <P>Is it the case that the use of the words &ldquo;co-operative society&rdquo; offends An Seanadóir Ó Foighil?  In other words, this is a solution to the fishery problem and if it is purely the words &ldquo;co-operative society&rdquo; that offends him I cannot understand why he did not propose a simple amendment to use other wording for the same structure.</P>

      <P>We all accept that the public is entitled to have clear provisions set out in any legislation which covers areas which could affect their rights.  I come back to a point I made a few moments ago.  Under the 1980 Act, which established the fisheries board, a most detailed procedure for the compulsory acquisition of fisheries was included, a most detailed, convoluted and difficult procedure.  For obvious reasons we are dealing with a very difficult, emotive and most complex area here.  Will the Minister confirm that this Bill will override all that section in the 1980 Bill that deals with the compulsory acquisition of fisheries? Effectively, this Bill will then give control of such fisheries to these so-called co-operatives.  We need to clarify that point.  Yet, the controls in relation to the co-operatives themselves are dealt with only very summarily in the Bill.  It does not deal in depth with the control of the co-operatives themselves.</P>
      <P>Apparently many of the provisions of the 1987 Act were taken from the 1980 Act covering fisheries boards.  Whereas those boards were tightly controlled under the 1980 legislation much of the control over the co-operatives has now been left to be covered by rules to be made later by the Minister.  We are getting into a very contentious area here. We question whether we are entering a constitutional minefield in the formula we are adopting to resolve the present problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister occasionally becomes defensive when we question exactly what we are doing and the whole concept of a <Col N="1000" /> co-operative structure.  This is done with the best intention in the world because all of us want to see a resolution to the present anarchy in relation to the trout and course fishing and all the problems a Fianna Fáil Minister caused when he foisted the licence system on us.  I accept what the Minister says, that his predecessor, Deputy Daly, may have been misinformed in terms of what would be acceptable to the angling societies.  It would not be constructive to go into that now but the House was misinformed for whatever reason; I accept the point the Minister makes in relation to Deputy Daly and why he did what he did at the time.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister confirm that NARA accept the legislation before the House today?  If so, why are they now appealing to the Minister and to his common sense? They state that in this legislation common sense has gone out the window.  That is the view of NARA &mdash; the National Anglers' Representative Association.  I am nervous lest the impression be given that all anglers are totally satisfied with the legislation before the House today because that smacks of what the former Minister, Deputy Daly, told both Houses on 16 December 1987.  The House adjourned the following day.  We sat into the small hours of the morning and it was quite contentious.  I recall Deputy Desmond O'Malley's contribution in this House and the other House at the time. Are NARA satisfied with what the Minister is putting in place now?  Why are they suggesting that with this legislation, and I quote, &ldquo;common sense has gone out the window&rdquo;?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the March 1991 newsletter. After the Minister met them in Portlaoise, after the Bill has been circulated and, indeed, after amendments were taken on board in the Dáil, it is still their view.  It is an area that has enormous potential which has been neglected by successive Governments of all political shades over the years.  Look at the salmon <Col N="1001" /> review group and ask what happened to their report &mdash; it is gathering dust somewhere. Many Members on all sides of the House, are interested in this area and those of us who have an interest in it have bothered to find out the opinions of anglers and indeed the legal people to resolve an appalling situation.</P>
      <P>First, where are we in relation to the compulsory acquisition requirements of the 1980 Bill?  Have they now gone out the window?  Have they effectively been overridden with the result that the control of such fisheries will automatically now go to co-operatives?  How does that square with our private property rights in the Constitution?  I am afraid I do not understand.  Second, are NARA fully behind what the Minister is presenting to the House today?</P>

      <P>I appreciate what Senator Doyle said about the present Minister for Defence and the then Minister for Fisheries.  I want to strongly emphasise the second point because it is important. This Bill, soon to be an Act, has nothing at all to do with ownership.  I would like that to be fully understood by the Members of this House and by Members of the Oireachtas in general.</P>

As a matter of fact, the note I have here says the same thing &mdash; the Bill has nothing to do with ownership or control of fisheries.  The 1980 Act the Senator was quoting from remains intact and in place as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not be so foolish, after my negotiations with fishermen, to believe that my Bill commands universal <Col N="1002" /> approval.  Substantively, the Bill is acceptable to the fishermen.  There are raw nerves and I do not want &mdash; to quote Shakespeare &mdash;&ldquo;to rub the sore when I should be bringing the balm&rdquo;.  I am bringing the balm, or doing my best to bring the balm, against some opposition, to this sore and it was a severe one.  My hope is &mdash; and I have emphasised the words &ldquo;comhar na gcomharsan&rdquo; and &ldquo;co-operation&rdquo; very strongly &mdash; that we will be able to bring together all the people who, while they may be at cross purposes with others, are in their own ways anxious to develop the inland fisheries.  Members of this House and the Members in Dáil Éireann can play a strong role in helping me to apply the balm and not to rub the sore.</P>

Shílfeá leis an rud atá á rá ag an Aire ansin gurb é mo leithéidse atá in aghaidh na n-iascairí agus go raibh mé in aghaidh socrú a bheith ann.

    <P>Maidir leis an pointe a rinne Seanadóir Dardis, teastaíonn uaim go bpléifí é, is cuma más uair a chloig nó trí huaire a chloig a bheidh i gceist.  Más maith le Seanadoírí géilleadh agus é a dhéanamh, déanaidís é.  Tá mise ag rá agus tá sé ráite ag an Seanadóir Ó Cuív cheana féin nuair a dúirt sé i mBéarla, any eight can get together and found a co-op.  Glacaim leis sin.  Dá mbeadh ocht n-ainm lena leithéid, &ldquo;the Minister and the following seven people shall establish a co-op,&rdquo; glacfainn leis sin.  Ach ní hé sin atá sa Bhille seo.  &ldquo;The Minister shall by order establish a co-op&rdquo;&mdash; sin an rud atá mise ag caint faoi.  Níl sé ag bunú comharchumainn ar an mbealach a ba chóir comharchumann a bhunú.  Níl d'aighneas ann ná d'argóint agamsa ach an rud amháin sin.  Tá a fhios agamsa, a Sheanadóir Uí Chuív, go bhfuil <Col N="1003" /> go leor saghsanna comharchumann ann. Bhí mé ag plé le comharchumann pobail, le comharchumann tithíochta agus le comharchumann déiríochta.  Tá comharchumainn ag plé la hadhmadóireacht agus le hoibrithe, agus tá rialacha acu go léir.  Is é an rud atá mé ag rá ná nach bhfuil sásamh ar bith le fáil as an mBille seo.  Níl buanseasmhacht ag baint leis agus ní sheasfaidh sé mar chomharchumann.</P>
    <P>Beidh sé ar an taifead sna blianta atá romhainn gur cuireadh Bille tríd an Teach seo inniu a rinne díspeagadh ar an gcóras comharchumainn.  Níl sé bunaithe de réir nósmhaireachta agus ní féidir é a oibriú.  Níl sé de réir an Bhunreachta go mbunófaí comharchumann mar sin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>One can only stand and admire the tenacity of Senator Ó Foighil. The angling club of which I am the chairman is affiliated to NARA and certainly, there were reservations expressed by NARA about this Bill.  One of them was that development work would be within the scope of the Bill and they wanted it to be specifically fisheries development work that would be covered.  That is done by amendment &mdash; fisheries development work is covered.  There were also fears within NARA that corporate membership could be used, for want of a better word, to hijack the groups.  The Minister on Second Stage gave us an assurance that that would not be the case.  Certainly, from my reading of the Bill, on the basis that corporate membership would have only one vote there is no danger of them being in a position to take over the co-op.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other matter that arises was the rights of riparian owners.  I am in that position; I am a riparian owner.  My rights are vested in my local angling club and they are the custodians of my water.  I must say that over a long number of years they have protected the water and the immediate environment to my absolute satisfaction and I am quite happy to go along with the arrangements that exists today.  The Minister in his Second Stage reply also gave an assurance that riparian <Col N="1004" /> owners would be able to continue to enjoy fishing their own water; I think I am correct in saying that.  The effect of this Bill is that people who were not able to fish, who would not fish, for very good reasons, got back onto the water and are in a position to fish.  If it achieves that objective, which indeed it has achieved, it is to be applauded.  My only hope is that the period of neglect which intervened in waters like the Corrib and so on will not have done irreparable and permanent damage to those waters and that we and our children will be able to continue to enjoy that facility and the marvellous asset that is there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>My belief is that Senator Ó Foighil is very negative in just opposing this section and other sections. As the Minister said, over the past year and a half he has travelled the highways and the by-ways of Ireland.  He has met everybody in connection with angling, his door has been open to everybody to try to solve the problem.  The Minister has come forward with a Bill.  I have had representations from people in Kerry, from Listowel, and they were quite satisfied with the Bill.  They have no objection in the world to it.  All they want is that we go along and do our job and get this Bill implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald Mr. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The trouble with any Bill is that you will never get 100 per cent of the people in favour of it.  You will always get a small percentage of people who will oppose it.  If the section is changed to suit Senator Ó Foighil and Senator Doyle there could be many people in the fishing community who would totally disagree with that.  At the moment I am quite happy with the situation and I congratulate the Minister on what he has done in getting a general consensus.  I am not saying that everybody fully and totally agrees with the Bill; nobody is ever 100 per cent satisfied with <Col N="1005" /> anything but I am satisfied that the general consensus is to get this Bill through the Dáil and Seanad.  If I recollect properly, when it went through the Dáil I do not think there were any objections by the Opposition to the Bill or to sections of it.  My belief is that just to be against a section is absolutely negative.  I think we should move on.  The matter has been well discussed.</P>

      <P>Senator Ó Foighil referred to the fact that this was worthy of debate.  Certainly, I am always in favour of debating matters as long as the debate is fruitful.  But because of the &mdash; I cannot call it amendment &mdash; cur in aghaidh by an Seanadóir Ó Foighil, there are two stark simple choices here today. By deleting section 4, with or without sections 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10, the Bill becomes a total impossibility.  Therefore, you have two choices today; namely, because of the lack of amendments and the structure of the opposition, you retain the rod licence, or you proceed with the Bill.  I know that those involved in the dispute, those living on the lakes, particularly in the areas I pointed out before, the great lakes in the west of Ireland, would thank anybody for delaying enactment of this legislation and for continuing the rod licence dispute that went against many of the traditions, particularly of that part of the country.  There are no other choices facing us today.</P>
      <P>This debate has become totally sterile, totally futile, and I would appeal to the Opposition Senators to see that and to facilitate the passing of this Bill, thus putting an end once and for all to a very protracted dispute that caused great hardship and strife in many areas.  No legislation we pass here, no Constitution, nothing whatever, is going to last forever. But I would have to say that I see in the basic concept of this Bill structures &mdash; call them what you want &mdash; that marry the requirements of the inland fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I cannot understand cén chaoi nach féidir a thuiscint go gcaithfidh sa chás seo gurb é an tAire a leagfaidh amach na comharchumainn a bheidh le bunú mar go gcaithfidh sé a chinntiú nach mbeidh na comharchumainn nua <Col N="1006" /> cosúil le comharchumainn i rudaí eile, mar shampla, comharchumann déiríochta &mdash; níl comharchumainn deiríochta ar fud na tíre, níl siad ag clúdú chuile cheantair.  Ach sa chás áirithe seo, caithfidh sé a chinntiú go bhfuil comharchumann iascaigh ag clúdú gach ceantair agus nach bhfuil dhá chomharchumann ag clúdú aon cheantair amháin.  Is é an taon bhealach chun sin a chinntiú ná go ndéanfadh an tAire an leagan amach ó thaobh bhunú comharchumainn de.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh na n-iontaobhaithe, na trustees, de, ar ndóigh, tuigeann an Seanadóir Ó Foighil chomh maith liom féin, gur rud <i>pro tem</i> é sin, an cineáil ruda sa ghnáthbhealach a dhéanfadh an sagart paróiste nó ceannaire pobail nó Pól Ó Foighil féin nó mé féin, a leithéidí sin i bpobail, i dtionscnamh comharchumainn.</P>

      <P>There are other alternatives to what Senator Ó Cúiv has just suggested.  Without section 4, without the whole concept of co-ops, we could consider just repealing all the 1987 Act. There is a gesture in what we say.  I accept logistically the point the Senator makes: that if in theory section 4 was taken out and between us Senator Ó Foighil and I managed to defeat the might of the Government side of the House there this afternoon and jeopardise what the Minister had in mind in terms of resolution of the licence problem, we could always resort to repealing the 1987 Act.  We all know logistically the outcome of pressing a vote on this section, which we will be doing very shortly.  You can go and gather the troops now while I speak for a minute or two.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have one major area of concern still, and I thank the Minister for his patient response to a difficult issue.  I hope he appreciates we are teasing it out because <Col N="1007" /> we foresee problems down the road when this Bill is enacted.  We want a resolution that is workable, democratic and, above all, that will ultimately appear to be constitutional. I think all those three factors are in question at the moment.</P>
    <P>How could any co-operative structured as in this Bill deny the Minister or even the Acting Chairman the right to fish in his own fishery by a vote of over 60 per cent?  How could they do that and not come into conflict with the relevant sections in the 1980 Act which deal with compulsory acquisition of fisheries?  I am afraid, with due respect to the Minister's response to me, that those two points do not square.  Effectively, in this Bill we are giving rights to co-operatives over areas they do not own.  If 60 per cent or more of the membership can decide that you or I or the Acting Chairman or any person fortunate enough to own a fishery cannot fish in our own fishery, I am afraid I cannot accept that does not infringe the relevant section of the 1980 Act which deals with compulsory acquisition.  We are conferring rights on co-ops over areas they do not own and that is very questionable constitutionally.  I await the Minster's response with interest.</P>

B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an réasúnaíocht ceart agam, de réir an Aire, ach ceapaim fós go bhfuil mé in ann rudaí a thuiscint agus tuigim ón reachtaíocht seo nach féidir an comharchumannachas atá faoi bhrat Aire na Mara anseo a chur ag obair.  Tá mé ag cur in aghaidh an ailt seo go huile is go hiomlán.</P>

      <P>Thar aon chuid den Bhille is é alt a 5 is mó a chuireann díomá orm ó thaobh ghluaiseacht na gcomharchumann arís.  Tá sé ráite go soiléir anseo i &ldquo;Rules of the Society&rdquo;: &ldquo;The Minister may make rules for the regulation of societies and such rules shall constitute the rules of each Society from its establishment&rdquo;. Tá sé sin seanbhunaithe ar an bprionsabal a raibh mé ag argóint faoi um thráthnóna, is é sin &ldquo;the Minister may make rules&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Arís, le dul ar ais go dtí córas comharchumainn ar bith, ní hé an tAire an duine a chuireann an ghníomhaíocht ar bun le comharchumann a bhunú. Is é an pobal atá bainteach le comharchumann, is iad na daoine atá mar chuid den structúir: tagann siad le chéile, glacann siad le rialacha agus annsin cuireann siad rialacha dá gcuid féin i bhfeidhm.  Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint ar ball d'admhaigh sé é sin, dúirt sé &ldquo;níl na rialacha leagaithe síos agamsa&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Cén fáth mar sin, go bhfuil Bille le dul tríd an Teach seo go ndeirtear ann &ldquo;the Minister may make rules for the Society&rdquo;. Na rialacha go léir atá luaite aige tá siad le fáil i rialacha atá ionghlactha do bhunú comharchumann in áit ar bith sa tír.  Tá sé an-deacair go bhfuil Bille á chur tríd an Teach againn inniu agus gan a fhios againn cé na rialacha a bheidh ann.  Bí ag caint faoi mhuc a cheannach agus é i mála &mdash; tá sin déanta.  Is í an argóint atá ag an Aire go dtiocfaidh sé ar ais ag caint leis na hiascairí agus go socróidh sé na rialacha leo.  Ní shin é an chaoi le comharchumann a reachtáil nó a dhéanamh agus deineann sé ansin i bhfoailt a 3 &mdash;&ldquo;The Minister with the consent of the Society or the Society with the consent of the Minister may amend or remake the Rules of the Society&rdquo;.  Sin buaille marfach go bhfuil an cumhacht coinnithe ag Aire, tar éis an cumann a bheith bunaithe, athruithe a dhéanamh.  Dúirt sé i dtosach nach gcuirfeadh sé rialacha ar bun gan dul i gcomhairle leis na comhaltaí.  Tá sin ceart, ach ba cheart é a dhéanamh sul má thabharfadh sé an Bille seo isteach agus a fhios againn go léir céard iad na rialacha. Anois deireann sé &ldquo;tar éis do rialacha a bheith bunaithe, tar éis an coiste bainistíochta bheith ag feidhmiú, tar éis do iontaobhaithe a bheith ainmnithe, tar éis gach rud a bheith déanta agus, abair tar éis trí nó ceathair de bhlianta síos an bóthar is féidir na rialacha a athrú&rdquo;. Abair nach bhfuil an tAire Wilson mar Aire na Mara; tá duine éigin eile mar Aire na Mara.  Níl aon bhaint aige le bunú an chomharchumainn beag no mór, níor thuig sé céard a bhí ann, níl baint dá laghad aige leis agus tá cumhacht aige faoin mBille seo dul isteach go comharchumann agus na rialacha d'athrú.  Is féidir leis comhairle a fháil ó na daoine más maith leis, sa chomharchumann féin ach fiú, gan a gcomhairle tá sé in ann é a dhéanamh é féin.</P>
      <P>Arís, in alt a 4 &ldquo;the Minister may appoint no more than two persons to be members of the management committee of a society in addition to the elected members&rdquo;.  Buille báis do aon choinceap de chomharchumann é sin.  Cumhacht a bheith ag an Aire, a haon, rialacha a athrú má thoilíonn sé agus, a dó, go mbeadh cead aige beirt a ainmniú ar an coiste bainistíochta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl an comharchumann sin de réir nósmhaireachta ar bith &mdash; níl sé daonlathach. Níl sé de réir aidhmeanna ná fhealsúnacht chomharchumann agus sin é an fáth go bhfuil alt 5 ar fad san áireamh agam. Agus ná bí ag ceapadh gur chóir dom leasú a chur isteach.  Cén mhaith bheith ag caint ar leasú, mar, dá molfainn leasú <Col N="1013" /> b'fhéidir nach mbeadh cead ag an Aire aon athrú a dhéanamh.  Cad is fiú é?  Tá gach rud socraithe agus dulta tríd agus tá an tAire in ann na rialacha a athrú, agus cead aige beirt den bhord bainistíochta a cheapadh.  Níor tharla sé sin riamh, ar feadh m'eolais, i stair na gcomharchumann ar fud an domhain, go raibh cead ag duine a bhunaigh comharchumann daoine a cheapadh ar an mbord bainistíochta.</P>
    <P>Más é sin an rud a raibh na daoine sásta i bPort Laoise sásta leis, níor thuig siad céard a bhí á rá nó ní raibh choincheap ná tuiscint acu ar cad is comharchumann ann mar níl aon chomharchumann ann a thabharfadh cead an lucht bainistíochta bheith ceannaithe ag an Aire in am ar bith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Sa chéad dul síos, is mian liom a thaispeáint don Teach go bhfuil anseo, in alt a 5, creatlach na rialacha. Tá siad inspéise go leor, (a) go (i), agus tugann siad le fios na sórt rialacha a bheidh againn, céard iad na pointí a chlúdaíonn na rialacha.  Mar a dúirt mé cheana nuair a bhí an díospóireacht ann roimh an vóta, más gá na rialacha a athrú ní féidir iad a athrú gan aontú an chomharchumainn.  Tá sé sin soiléir ó alt a 5 (3): &ldquo;with the consent of the Society&rdquo;. Tá sé sin ann.  Tá an tAire agus an comharchumann ceangailte le chéile, cosúil le dhá ghabhar.  Ní féidir leis an Aire rud ar bith a dhéanamh gan cead an chumainn.  Ní féidir leis an gcomharchumann aon rud a dhéanamh gan cead an Aire.  Tá sé sin daonlathach, a deirimse. Deirimse go bhfuil sé chomh daonlathach le Abraham Lincoln.  Sin é mo thuairim féin &mdash;&ldquo;le toil an chomharchumainn&rdquo;&mdash; alt a 5 (3).  Mar gheall ar an mbeirt a ainmniú, tá sainmhíniú ar &ldquo;daonlathas&rdquo;, agus tá sainmhíniú ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>De réir mar a thuigimse &ldquo;daonlathas&rdquo; níl an Seanadóir Ó Foighil ag caint go daonlathach.  Tá cead ag an Aire an bheirt a ainmniú.  Toghadh mise go daonlathach, toghadh an Taoiseach go daonlathach sa Dáil, agus thug an Taoiseach go daonlathach an post seo domsa.  Dá bhrí sin tá an daonlathas ann.  An dualgas is tábhachtaí dá bhfuil ar Aire, nó ar Bhall <Col N="1014" /> den Dáil nó den Seanad, ná féachaint chuige, má thugann an tAire airgead an phobail do chomhlacht nó do ghluaiseacht ar bith, go n-úsáidfí an t-airgead mar is cóir.  Níl sé daonlathach gan súil a choinneáil ar an airgead poiblí, ar an gcáin a thugann an pobal don Rialtas chun obair an Rialtais, obair an phobail, a chur ar aghaidh.  Dá bhrí sin, deirim go bhfuil sé mar dhualgas ar gach uile Aire féachaint chuige go mbeidh airgead an phobail slán sabháilte, agus usáidithe sa chomharchumann chun, sa chás seo, iascaireacht intíre a chur ar aghaidh.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá, agus go mbeadh sé scríofa, nach ionann an dearcadh atá ag an Aire ar an daonlathas agus an dearcadh atá agamsa air. Níl an bheirt againn ag dul an bealach céanna ó thaobh an daonlathais de, a bheag ná a mhór.  Is trua liom gur mar sin atá mar ní fiú leanúint leis an argóint nuair nach bhfuil an bhuntuiscint eadrainn ar céard is daonlathas ann.  Is é mo thuairim féin gurb iad na daoine féin ag teacht le chéile a chuireann ann é.  Má tá sé in ann stad a chur le daonlathas sa tslí atá luaite agam, toisc go bhfuil sé ina Aire agus go bhfuil sé tofa ag na daoine, tá ré nua dhaonlathais tagtha chun cinn sa tír seo.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 6 to 13, to delete subsection (1) and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a)  Every ordinary member of a society for a particular year shall, if ordinarily resident in Ireland, be entitled to vote at an election held in that year for members of the regional board for the region which includes the society's area but, in the case of the election for any year subsequent to the first election, after the commencement of this Act, only if he had also been an ordinary member for any two other years since the previous election.</P>
      <P>(b)  Every former life member of Iontaobhas Iascaigh Intíre Incorportha (The Inland Fisheries Trust Incorporated) who registered under section 58 (4) of the Fisheries Act, 1980, in the register of a regional board and who is ordinarily resident in Ireland on the date fixed under the Fisheries Act, 1980, for the receipt of nominations at an election held for members of the regional board by which the register is maintained, shall be entitled to vote at that election.</P>
      <P>(c)  This subsection shall not prejudice the operation of section 13 of the Fisheries Act, 1980.&rdquo;.</P>

    <Col N="1017" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is in the hands of the Members of the House. It is an amendment to enable certain people to have certain privileges restored to them which they had lost.  The former Inland Fisheries Trust was dissolved under section 35 of the 1980 Fisheries Act.  Section 58 (4) (a) of that Act provided, however, for persons who are life members of the former trust to be enabled to register free of charge with one of the regional fisheries boards as trout, coarse fish or sea anglers.</P>
      <P>Section 59 of the Act provided for the life member to enjoy certain benefits in relation to fisheries owned or managed by the central and regional fisheries boards. Under the Fisheries (Amendment) No. 2 Act, 1987, the registration arrangement for trout and coarse fish anglers ceased to exist and the registers then became registers of sea anglers only for whom no licences were needed.  Licences were introduced for trout and coarse fish angling and the electorate for the board were to be comprised of the licence holders as the House knows.  That is the case in relation to salmon anglers and always has been.  Accordingly, the arrangement whereby life members could be included in the electorate free of charge was terminated.  The 1987 Act provided for the benefits relating to fishing on board waters to be continued and improved for the life members.  I am leaving those arrangements in place.</P>
      <P>Since announcing my proposals last year with regard to the new system as set out in this Bill, I received several representations from Members of this House, from Members of the Dáil and members of the public seeking to give some recognition to the life members in this new system.  When we were debating this in the Dáil I gave an assurance on Committee Stage, and also in this House on Second Stage, that I would give the matter sympathetic consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The substance of the amendment now before the Seanad is that I am providing for life members to have their entitlement to be included in the board's electorate restored to them and I am proposing to <Col N="1018" /> amend section 14 (1) of the Bill accordingly. This amendment ensures that life members are entitled to vote in board elections whether or not they are members of the co-operatives.  They will not, however, have any entitlements in relation to the election of co-op management committees or ballots unless they become ordinary members of those co-ops.  It is a recognition of certain life members who gave a substantial sum of money for the development of fisheries and in my opinion they deserve some recognition for this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this amendment.  On Second Stage I raised the matter of the rights of the life members of the Inland Fisheries Trust. There was some concern about the fact, as the Minister has rightly said, that they voluntarily invested a substantial amount of money at the time and their rights were maintained under the establishment of the fisheries board.  I am pleased that this is included.  If I am correct, originally they had to register with a particular board in a particular area.  While one might have been resident in Leinster one had the option to register with the western board.  Will that still be the case?</P>

It is another step the Minister has taken to build up trust again between anglers, particularly anglers who over a large number of years have made voluntary contributions at various times to the development of their own fishing waters.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the abject failure of the Coalition Government in face of the deterioration in crime, lawlessness and vandalism and in particular for its failure:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to increase the gardaí to their full strength of 12,000 as promised in the election manifesto;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to review the policy on policing in rural areas and to &ldquo;restore a realistic Garda presence there&rdquo; as promised; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to deal with the bail situation which has not worked effectively for many years.</P>
      <P>The level of crime is of great concern. There is no doubt about that.  We hear this as we canvass for the local elections. The people are afraid in their homes, on the street and even at work on certain occasion.  The Minister has tried over the past number of weeks to convince us that the level of crime is reducing but the public are aware of the deterioration in the problem and the seriousness of it.  It is a measure of the people's despair that they do not report many petty crimes. They are convinced that nothing can be done and therefore many crimes go unreported and do not appear in the Minister's statistics.  Many people, as we experienced while canvassing, are afraid to open their doors after 7 or 8 o'clock at night &mdash; they are afraid of who might be outside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that, for different reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is in good humour.  We hope he will respond positively.  There are a number of reasons why crime is on the increase.  These must be tackled.  Unemployment, at present 250,000, the level of drug abuse and the lack of educational opportunities for <Col N="1022" /> people in deprived areas, if allowed prevail will lead to an increase in crime. While this is not an excuse for crime, these social problems must be tackled and it is up to the Government to do so.</P>
      <P>We need more gardaí in towns and rural areas.  The Minister recently announced that 1,000 gardaí will be recruited over the next three years.  He did not highlight that 1,000 gardaí will also retire.  The number of gardaí is standing still while crime statistics deteriorate. There were 11,400 gardaí in 1985 while after the recent recruitment in 1990 there were 10,500 gardaí.  There are 900 fewer today than there were in 1985.  How will the Minister deal with the increase in the level of crime?  Our motion calls for an increase in the number of gardaí to bring them up to the full strength of 12,000, as was promised in the Programme for Government.  This is one way in which an improvement can be made.  If the Garda strength continues to be reduced and our laws are not changed there will be more crime and our people will have less protection. What is the point in balancing the books and getting our current budget deficit and balance of payments in order if people are afraid to walk the streets?</P>
      <P>Old people are afraid to leave their homes at night.  People's homes are broken into.  Even young people are being attacked as they alight from buses at night.  The Minister might make light of this as regards us knocking on doors to canvass but I assure him that old people in their homes do not see this as a flippant subject.  We hear daily of attacks on old people.  I know of a person living alone whose family are in the UK.  Lately, he opened the door at 11 p.m.  He was tied up and terrorised for two hours before having a small amount of money, something like £25, stolen.  Thankfully he got over his experience.  The number of attacks on elderly people has risen in recent times and this must be stamped out.  We have a responsibility to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the resources of the gardaí and the State should be used to allow the elderly and vulnerable members of our society to live in peace and security.  They deserve to feel safe in their homes and in <Col N="1023" /> our midst.  We must protect them against ruthless thugs who think nothing of viciously assaulting, raping and sometimes murdering their victims.  These attacks destroy their victims and make the rest of their lives a living hell.  They leave an indelible scar both physically and mentally on the unfortunate old or vulnerable person.  These attacks usually trigger off a deterioration in health which, in many cases, prove fatal within a short period of time.  I pay tribute to the gardaí and those citizens involved in the neighbourhood watch and community alert schemes.  They do a fantastic job.  These schemes should be developed.</P>
    <P>Old people living alone should have the facility of a telephone.  Many of them cannot afford one.  The Department of Social Welfare should provide money for this purpose.  When the old person passes on, the telephone could be withdrawn. Old people should have it for the required period.  They have contributed to the nation and have paid their taxes.  They worked hard and should have security, comfort and peace of mind in their declining years.  The Minister should restore a realistic Garda presence in rural Ireland to combat crime and he should honour the promise he made to do so.</P>
    <P>The growth of juvenile crime should be of extreme concern to the Minister.  In 1989 there were 2,178 convictions against persons under 17 years of age.  That was almost two and a half times the 1985 figure.  In other words, juvenile crime has risen almost nine times as fast as adult crime in the second half of the 1980s.  In spite of the rise of juvenile crime, no juvenile detention facilities were created and the number of cases in residential care has dropped.  This has serious implications and we must get to the core of the problem.  We must deal with the issues which create this problem: the level of unemployment, drugs and the lack of education opportunities in deprived areas.</P>
    <P>No Garda juvenile crime statistics are available for later than 1989.  The figure from Smithfield Children's Court where approximately half of Ireland's juvenile <Col N="1024" /> cases are heard, suggests the rise has continued in the nineties.  The number of major warrants issued up to 9 May 1991 was 433 &mdash; up from 403 in the same period last year.  In 1989, almost half of all juvenile convictions were for burglary, with larceny listed as second.  Justice Hubert Wine estimates that the number attending his juvenile court sessions in Dún Laoghaire where 35 warrants have so far been issued this year, is up by at least 50 per cent on last year.  He said that the situation at the moment can only be described as desperate and alarming. Recently an eight year old, a ten year old and 12, 13, 14 and 15 year olds were sent out to the street where they are a menace to our community and a danger to themselves.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem with regard to handling such offenders.  A person like this will frequently be visited by a plethora of professionals.  He will probably be first visited by a health board social worker followed by a school attendance officer, a garda juvenile liaison officer, a probation officer, probably a solicitor and maybe a priest and teacher.  The Government task force in 1980 recommended that there should be a child care authority with responsibility for all issues affecting children in these difficulties.  The responsibility for problem juveniles should be handed over to one person who would be responsible to the child care authority.  The Minister should take this recommendation on board.</P>
    <P>Recent reports show that drugs are making a major comeback on the streets of Dublin.  This comes at a time when a Garda management directive cut the number of plain clothes gardaí in Dublin by 100, and has virtually eliminated the presence of the Drugs Squad and Crime Prevention Unit in many parts of the city.  In his address to the recent annual conference, the Garda Representative Association leader, John Ferry, voiced his concern as follows:</P>
    <P>The decision by the Garda Commissioner cuts the number of plain clothes officers in Dublin by almost 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> It means that officers who had been working on drugs squads in many Dublin stations have returned to uniform duties, giving drug pushers a free reign in many parts of the city.  The decision also cuts down on the number of armed officers available for duties such as protection, bank escorts, and crime investigation.</P>
    <P>The hardest hit areas are some of the city's toughest crime spots.  The undercover drugs squad based in Store Street station, which had a strength of five, has been cut to three by the directive.  In the city centre station of Pearse Street, the CPU which tackled crime on tourists and targeted specific crime sprees by criminals in the Grafton Street area will have to be disbanded.</P>
    <P>Other areas hit include Kevin Street station, where the CPU had dealt with a serious heroin problem in the Thomas Street area.</P>
    <P>The directive instructs uniformed gardaí, who had been working in plain clothes, to return to uniform duties.</P>
    <P>It is plain that it is necessary to ensure that the growth in drug trafficking in Dublin is cut and that a proper presence of gardaí on plain clothes duties as heretofore is restored.</P>
    <P>White collar crime is growing in modern society and it will undermine our system of justice if such criminals get away with it while people committing other crimes go to jail.  Ireland's inability to prosecute white collar crime corrodes the social philosophy on which our democracy is based.  It is vital that the current investigation into alleged corrupt practices in planning is an absolute success. It is not sufficient just to see a few prosecutions.  All who are responsible, at whatever level, must be brought to justice.  We should consider the appointment of a continental-style examining magistrate with extensive evidence gathering powers.  Fine Gael have called for this.  Such a magistrate might be given the power to grant amnesty to those involved in minor offences if evidence <Col N="1026" /> from such people will bring larger offences to light.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael call on the Government and the Minister to immediately introduce legislation to reform our law to enable us to tackle white collar crime.  We should make fraud a criminal offence whether committed by an individual or a group. We should make provisions to require people in certain circumstances to provide potentially self-incriminating evidence. White collar crime has now become extremely sophisticated.  A country as small as Ireland cannot afford to have on constant standby the necessary concentration of high skilled staff resources of the required calibre to detect such crimes.  White collar crime is an area in which there should be a pooling of resources between the European states.</P>
    <P>The third section of our motion is that Seanad Éireann condemns the abject failure of the Coalition Government to deal with bail which has not worked effectively for many years.  It is now almost 17 months since five men went to rob the Bank of Ireland at Athy, County Kildare. When confronted by the gardaí at the scene, a shoot-out ensued.  One of the raiders died, two were wounded and members of the public and gardaí were injured.  The lessons from Athy have to do with our bail laws and whether people who are likely to recommit crime should be granted bail, whether the Government should call a referendum to change the bail laws.  Of the five people who went to rob the bank in Athy in January 1990 two were on bail.  They had already been caught by the Garda and were charged with very serious offences.  They had been allowed out on bail on these charges.  If the courts had discretion two years before that, the Athy robbery would never have taken place.  One life would have been spared and the serious risk to many others would have been taken away.  This should be the real lesson of Athy and of so many of the other armed robberies and crimes committed by those on bail.</P>
    <P>There is a constitutional problem.  In 1966, the Supreme Court rejected a proposal by the High Court that an accused <Col N="1027" /> person's bail application should be considered along with his likelihood to commit more crime.  The Supreme Court said that the provision was unconstitutional. Times have changed enormously since the Supreme Court made this decision in the O'Callaghan case. The breed of armed criminal operating in our society today is much more violent, callous and organised than his counterpart of 25 years ago when the Supreme Court made its decision.  Granting bail for serious crimes for the current breed of organised criminals is an opportunity for them to build a nest egg for when they come out of prison.  They have no compunction about committing more crime.  The likelihood of rearrest does not put them off.  Neither do the provisions for consecutive sentences in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  This only deters petty criminals.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael believe that the bail laws urgently need to be tightened up so that the courts will not have to free people who are likely to commit further serious crime.  It is accepted that our bail laws are the most lax in the world.  In 1989 the number of crimes committed by persons on bail was 2,647.  A constitutional amendment is necessary and should be introduced to restore discretion to the courts.  The Government must, as a matter of urgency, arrange for the necessary referendum to change the laws.  It is unfortunate that the Government missed the opportunity to do this next week in conjunction with the local government elections.  The provision for consecutive sentences in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 had a deterrent effect on petty criminals but had no effect on serious crime.</P>
    <P>A new approach to Garda interrogation should be taken on board by the Minister for Justice.  The right to silence when suspects are being questioned is a relic of the last century when individuals had no access to free legal aid and when punishments were much harsher.  Moreover, as it stands, the right is currently a major obstacle to gardaí in their investigations into organised professional crime.  A suspect can refuse to answer <Col N="1028" /> questions, or give any explanation whatsoever, about matters which are put to him in the course of his interrogation. Experienced criminals do this as a matter of course and subversives are adept at doing so.  While the abolition of this right would greatly help Garda investigations, it would also protect suspects in cases where over-zealous police officers might try to extract confessions.  The abolition of the right to silence would remove the importance of obtaining a self-incriminatory confession in many investigations.</P>
    <P>The right of silence was introduced at a time when an accused was rarely represented in court and could not give evidence but today the rules are only helping an increasing number of professional criminals to avoid conviction.  The new system should simply mean that it would not be an offence to refuse to answer questions or give an explanation but an adverse inference could be drawn from this on particular issues.  This mirrors recent legislation introduced by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The present right to silence does not protect self-incrimination in a variety of statutory offences, especially offences against the Road Traffic Acts, like drunk driving, where suspects may be required to provide blood or urine samples and where they may later be convicted of the offence.  Likewise the genetic fingerprinting Bill obliges the subject to provide a DNA sample and if he does not do so, the court will be allowed to draw an inference from that.  In revenue cases, a person being investigated cannot use the right to silence to mask giving potentially incriminating answers to the tax inspectors.</P>
    <P>Criminal interviews should also be video-recorded to protect the gardaí from false allegations and ensure that the rights of individuals are protected during detention.  This would also provide the courts with a true picture of the realities and difficulties facing the gardaí under such circumstances.</P>
    <P>I now refer to something I brought up in the Seanad on numerous occasions, <Col N="1029" /> the policing of the open borders post-January of next year.  Criminals, including drug and arms traffickers, will have free movement throughout the European Community.  Ireland will be exposed to this and we should urgently address this issue to protect our society.  I know the Trevi Ministers met on numerous occasions regarding this but nothing concrete came from their deliberations.  I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to inform us of plans for the harmonisation of laws and sanctions in relation to criminal activity throughout the Community, post 1 January next.  If harmonisation does not take place, we will give a platform to criminal elements to concentrate their presence in countries where laws and sanctions are least severe and farm out their activities to other countries in the EC.  Similarly criminals will concentrate their activities in areas where police manning powers, abilities and equipment are weakest.</P>
    <P>What plans are being made to ensure that there is consistency in the EC countries regarding police performance? What arrangements will be made for co-operation between police authorities from country to country bearing in mind that there will be free movement of people across borders?  Will police jurisdiction end at national borders or will hot pursuit be accepted?  These issues must be addressed before next January.  I ask the Minister to use this opportunity to inform the House of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have failed to improve the situation.  They failed to increase the strength of the Garda to the promised level of 12,000; they have failed to protect the people, particularly the elderly against the rising level of crime; they have failed to use the opportunity of the local elections and the Presidential election last November to ask the people to change the Constitution to allow the law in relation to bail to be changed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I join my colleague, Senator Neville, in calling on the Minister for Justice to address those questions raised in the <Col N="1030" /> motion which, for all law-abiding people, must be disturbing.</P>
      <P>Many years ago the term &ldquo;daylight robbery&rdquo; was a figure of speech, a term used by people in ordinary conversation in a lighthearted or jocose way but, unfortunately, in Dublin in 1991 it is a reality, a brutal and frightening experience for many people.  This House must be made aware of this.  In order to combat this unfortunate trend the number of gardaí should, as a matter of urgency, be increased to full strength, or even more, as was promised.  In addition, the courts should be equipped to meet the pressure of business where necessary and our Constitution, as Senator Neville said, should be amended to grant protection to the vast majority of our citizens.  As it is, the Constitution is invoked in the main by criminals who have no respect for the Constitution or for the laws of this State. It is surely time that the vast majority of people who live, work and contribute to the development and evolvement of this State had a Constitution which gives them protection in their everyday lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem which is causing a great deal of worry is the Garda presence, especially in rural areas.  Many citizens are becoming nervous and this is obvious as one goes around canvassing, as I and many of my colleagues have been doing. It is sad to drive up a laneway or boreen in the middle of the day and find, in a peaceful sylvan setting, the door locked because elderly people are nervous and cannot trust people to drop in, as was the tradition over many generations and centuries.  That underlines the need, especially in rural Ireland, for more mobile equipment, more cars, jeeps and, perhaps, a wider variety of mobile equipment for the force.  If the Minister and the commissioner in their wisdom withdraw more sergeants from the various small towns and remove the gardaí altogether from the villages, there is an onus on them to indicate the steps and facilities that will be offered to replace the presence of gardaí in the local station.  The public, especially the elderly and those who are vulnerable, should be able to relax and know that the State offers some <Col N="1031" /> protection and is concerned about the welfare of ordinary citizens.</P>
    <P>What are the commissioner's plans for greater mobility of the force?  Will greater resources be allocated to ensure that gardaí can move swiftly to tackle criminals from some Dublin areas who swiftly and effectively sweep into rural areas and commit violent crimes of robbery and assault on elderly people in their homes? This was a rarity in rural Ireland but in the last decade it has been creeping in. The penalties for such crimes should be stepped up.  Now that we have a Minister of State with responsibility for law reform many of the penal codes should be reviewed and upgraded to deal with crimes.  For habitual criminals the penalties for second and subsequent offences should be severe.  For first and second time offenders we should, as a State, expend more money on rehabilitation. We should endeavour to rehabilitate what we might call the new criminals.</P>
    <P>A short time ago we had a very interesting debate on the penal system and the prisons.  We should have more prisons, not for the sake of having more, but so that the Minister could segregate categories of prisoners with a view to more effective rehabilitation and to spending more of the State's resources on ensuring that offenders coming into the system will not be there habitually because of recurring offences.</P>
    <P>In previous legislation there was a provision for on-the-spot fines.  It would be useful, if only to ease the pressure on the courts, if at least some of the minor offences were handled by on-the-spot fines.  Perhaps that would have the effect of releasing gardaí who spend many hours in court.  There is no doubt that fines should be rationalised.  When one reads the provincial newspapers and sees the different fines that district justices hand out one is hard-pressed to know what is the most severe penalty.  I read this week where a person was fined a three figure sum for sounding his car horn in the middle of the day.  I do not know what damage that caused to the environment but it was an extraordinary decision <Col N="1032" /> under some obscure Act.  At the same time people are fined little more than shillings for offences involving vandalism or injury to persons.</P>
    <P>While district justices have great freedom it is difficult for ordinary mortals to follow their trend of thought or to appreciate their priorities in relation to what constitutes an offence or, indeed, the kind of society they would like to maintain.  I know it is not easy but I hope the Minister in his new policy of law reform will look closely at the idea of rehabilitation and will try to have a cohesive system where not only everybody would be equal before the law but, as far as possible, the penalties would fit the crimes.  I would like to see leniency for first time offenders but after that the law should be very majestic and powerful.  I have absolute confidence in the members of the Garda Síochána; they do an excellent and, at times, a dangerous job.  I hope they will have every available equipment within our resources to make their job more efficent and effective.</P>
    <P>The commissioner should be more adventurous in setting up pilot areas, in trying out different methods and equipment and in examining the effectiveness of those schemes to combat crime, especially serious crime.  In the various divisions under the control of the Minister and the commissioner it should not be too difficult to assess the effectiveness of different policing policies for short periods of six to 12 months to see how best the resources of the State can combat the activities of the people who are making a fat living from crime.</P>
    <P>I also have a special commitment to the aged and the disabled.  I worked in a voluntary capacity in those areas all my adult life and, indeed, since I came into this House.  I know members of the Garda who are public-spirited people and who share that commitment.  However, the State does not sufficiently protect the aged and the disabled and it is absolutely unpardonable that there should be barbarous attacks on elderly people in their homes.  In my own county some months ago a number of thugs broke into the home of an elderly man in his seventies <Col N="1033" /> during the day and beat him up with an iron bar.  He sustained broken arms and legs.  The penalties handed out to those people should have been more severe. People will do such things for £5 or £6 gain.  We must address those serious crimes because under our Constitution the vulnerable in our society are guaranteed the protection of the State but when you look at the way the Constitution works it is the lawbreakers who have first claim on the protection of the Constitution and it is high time that was changed.  The majority of our citizens have a right to be protected and the Minister has it within his competence, capacity and power to do something about it.  It is not good enough to see it as a nine day wonder when one reads of such events in the weekly newspapers. Most of those horrific crimes appear only in the provinicial papers and I hope that the Minister and his Department will monitor them.  Invariably, either a jazzed up plea of insanity or drunkness seems to let people off with a lot.</P>
    <P>I hope, in his review of the legal code, the Minister will find new ways of protecting the most vulnerable in our society.  I support this motion and hope the Minister will secure additional resources to put more mobile equipment on the roads to assist the gardaí in combating those dangerous criminals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;noting the action being taken to increase Garda numbers, improve policing arrangements and deter the commission of offences by persons on bail, supports the continuing efforts of the Minister for Justice to curb crime, lawlessness and vandalism.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In listening to some of the comments from the other side, one would get the impression that we live in a very lawless State.  I wonder if this motion, having <Col N="1034" /> regard to the fact that we are now facing into local elections, is something of a political gimmick and I am not being derogatory to speakers on the other side. Since his appointment to the Justice portfolio the Minister has done excellent work in many fields.  I would like to cast the minds of the Members on the other side back to when the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition left office in 1987 when armed robberies were nearly a daily occurrence. Many of the facts and figures quoted here give a false and improper impression. When one considers the amount of legislation that the current Minister introduced over the last couple of years and also the legislation being proposed by the Government, they must be complimented and lauded for their excellent efforts in combating crime.</P>
    <P>We must accept that crime has been in existence for the past three or four thousand years and will continue to be in existence.  The purpose of the Government and the Minister of the day is to ensure by constant revision and review of policies that crime can be held in check. It will not be wiped out overnight; in 20 or 30 years' time I am sure, if the Seanad is still in existence, we will be debating the problems of crime.  I have the highest regard and praise for the work of the current Government and the Minister in question.  In 1987 when the Labour/Fine Gael Coalition left office this country was on the verge of bankruptcy and having regard to the financial constraints imposed on this Government and the last Government, we in Government are doing an excellent job.</P>
    <P>The number of Bills the Minister has brought before the House in a short time indicates the concern of the Minister and the Government in relation to law reform generally, for example, the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989, the Larceny Act, 1990, the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Bill and so on.  Those have all been dealt with by the present Dáil and that clearly indicates the commitment of the Minister and the Government to law <Col N="1035" /> reform and to constant review of the system.</P>
    <P>The motion by Fine Gael which I oppose proposes an increase in Garda numbers.  The increases of Garda numbers, in itself, will not automatically ensure that we will see the end of crime and violence.  If that was the case I am sure the Minister would put another 3,000 or 4,000 gardaí on the street immediately. That is only one process and it must be clearly stated that a significant number of gardaí &mdash; about 500 &mdash; have been put on the street over the last two years. Another aspect that deserves credit is that because of constant review by the Department about 200 clerical staff have been employed by the Department of Justice, thus releasing gardaí who had been doing administrative and office work.  This must be lauded.</P>
    <P>In the 1991 budget, £10 million has been set aside for the provision of modern sophisticated equipment so that the Garda will be a better and more viable force in their fight to combat crime.  In the budget this year alone £40 million was provided for capital expenditure.  I compliment the Minister for some of the programmes he has set out for this country. He was recently in Bandon, in my constituency, opening a new Garda divisional headquarters.  Some weeks later he was in Cork city opening another headquarters and I understand there is a major job in hand for the provision of a new court-house and Garda divisional headquarters in Dún Laoghaire at a cost of £3 million.  This clearly indicates the concern of the Minister and the Government in relation to the ongoing review and reform of legislation, the updating of the Garda and so on.  The Minister and the Government must be complimented.</P>
    <P>Senator Neville praised the success of the Neighbourhood Watch and the Community Alert Schemes, and I would concur with him.  A large number of those schemes are operating successfully throughout the country.  Listening to comments voiced by some of the Senators, one would think that the communities in rural areas are being <Col N="1036" /> neglected.  I live in a rural constituency and from my knowledge, both as a practising lawyer and a person living in a community, over the past four or five years elderly, weak or underprivileged people seem to sleep easier because the policies being put forward by this Government are working well.  People complain to me that the gardaí in our area are over-vigilant.  The songwriter and singer Jimmy Crowley of Stokers Lodge fame wrote a song about the over-activity of the Bandon special squad.  In fairness, from my knowledge of gardaí throughout a rural constituency, they are doing an excellent job and there are no complaints of which I am aware, of lack of co-operation by the Garda.  As someone who deals with many accident claims, I am aware that the Garda are on the spot day and night and are always willing and available to co-operate.</P>
    <P>I would like to refute the political point made because of the forthcoming elections, that many rural Garda stations are being closed and that this Government are neglecting rural Ireland.  This is totally untrue.  In my view the number of gardaí in rural Ireland, where crime is much less than in the cities, is adequate to deal with the problem.  It has been under constant review by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I laud the Minister for his recent announcement to recruit 1,000 gardaí between 1992 and 1995 and also for extending the training period in Templemore. That training period has been almost trebled.  Therefore, the garda coming on the street is much more educated, more sophisticated and more geared to tackle the serious crime this country is facing in the line of drugs and so on.  I am not saying there are no problems here, particularly in cities like Dublin and Cork.  There are black spots in certain areas, like vandalism to cars, which must be kept under constant review but, by and large, the Minister, the Government and the Department officials are doing a very good job.  I am delighted to note that over the next few years extra gardaí will be made available.</P>
    <P>Another example of the Minister's <Col N="1037" /> concern and regard for more policing was the extension of the retirement age.  Last year in the region of 350 extra gardaí, senior people with good experience, were allowed to stay on at their job.  This is another indication of the concern of the Minister and of the Garda.  From commissioner down, the Garda are doing an excellent job and must be complimented for their great work.</P>
    <P>One hears criticism in relation to bail. The right to bail is a constitutional right given to any person who is taken into custody and a referendum would have to take place to remove that right.  The Supreme Court is the guardian of the Constitution.  On who occasions in the recent past this matter was referred to the Supreme Court and on each occasion the court upheld the constitutional and basic right of a person held for questioning to have the right to bail.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, have worked extremely well. This Act clearly sets out that a person who is out on bail and commits a crime will automatically, if convicted, be forced to serve concurrent sentences and this, in itself, is a deterrent.  In 1984 approximately 8,500 people on bail committed crimes.  Last year that figure dropped to about 2,500 people, in the region of a 75 per cent decrease.  This decrease over the past four or five years shows that this matter is under constant review.  I would be concerned that anyone on bail should commit any crime.  It is an outrage against society.  This matter is being kept under constant review by the Minister and the Department.  The calls by the Opposition for a referendum on the bail issue are not warranted.  The Supreme Court, the guardian of the Constitution has, in the past upheld the constitutional right of individuals seeking bail.</P>
    <P>Over the past three or four years the Minister, his Department and the Government have spent millions of pounds on updating equipment and providing the Garda with sophisticated recording systems, such as computers to ensure that much of the time wasted on filling out forms and filing records can now be spent by gardaí on patrol duties. <Col N="1038" /> This is a step in the right direction.  In the speeches we have heard so far on this motion, one would be forgiven for wondering if there was any evidence to support what the Government are doing.  I could spend a week explaining how the Government and the Minister, on different issues, are taking steps in the right direction to combat crime and to provide more gardaí on the streets.</P>
    <P>Nobody complimented the Minister for his excellent work over the Christmas period when, as a result of his direct intervention and as a result of the vigilance of the Garda, as many as 100 lives were saved because of the clamp-down on drunken driving.  There were fewer accidents and the Minister is keeping this under review.  His stern action and strict enforcement of the law in this respect has ensured that there are fewer accidents on our roads and fewer deaths.  Yet, we hear nothing from the Opposition to compliment the Minister on that.</P>
    <P>The garda being recruited at present are joining the best police force in western Europe.  The number of serious crimes prevalent in the mid-eighties had decreased substantially as a result of Government policy.  In my view the problems with regard to crime are being tackled extremely well.  This Minister has also proposed new legislation to ensure that the penalties for drunken driving will become more severe and rigid in that in the near future it is proposed that the alcohol limit for driving will be reduced. The vigilance of the Garda and the special squad dealing with road traffic offences and so on is paying dividends.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Minister must be given the highest praise.  In the mid-eighties members of the party who moved this motion &mdash; and the Labour Party &mdash; said we should not put people in prison.  On the other hand, we heard a previous speaker say we do not have enough prisons.  That indicates the type of disjointed approach by Fine Gael-Labour Coalition in the mid-eighties up to 1987.  This Government are doing a good job and this Minister is keeping the <Col N="1039" /> situation under constant review.  In my view, he is a considerate Minister.  He has put through much legislation over the past two years and he has more legislation which he intends to bring before this House.  That clearly indicates he is doing an excellent job and he must be complimented.</P>
    <P>I am opposing the motion being put down by Fine Gael and recommending that the amendment suggested by me be accepted by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Senators O'Donovan, Neville and McDonald for contributing to this debate.  I would like to thank, in particular, Senator O'Donovan for the fact that he has put this whole question into perspective.</P>
      <P>Crime is an understandable source of concern in all societies.  The fact that our community is, in relative terms, more crime free than many others obviously provides no grounds for complacency. Recognising crime as a problem in our community certainly does not, in other words, mean we have come to accept it as an inevitable feature of modern living or regard it as something against which we are unable to take effection action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have always listed the fight against crime among their top priorities and I reject any suggestion that <Col N="1040" /> we have failed to counteract it.  In particular, I want to reject the type of fear which was being generated here in the House by Senators Neville and McDonald among our old, the less well off and the infirm in our society in rural Ireland in relation to attacks on the elderly.</P>
    <P>I want to clarify the situation and say that in 1985 the crime figures recorded that there were 453 attacks on the elderly in this country; in 1990 that figure had been reduced to 51.  Even one attack on the elderly is unacceptable but to try to paint a picture, as was being done by Senator Neville and Senator McDonald, of a lawless situation prevailing around the country is not doing justice and is, I believe, creating an atmosphere of fear and concern for those in our society who deserve not to be subjected to that.  As I say, even one attack on the elderly is one too many and we are striving to tackle that problem.</P>
    <P>Even at the height of the financial stringencies forced upon us in restoring order to the public finances the Government have always been fully committed to the funding of measures to tackle crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  For the record, let me list a number of specific measures which this Government have taken in this area.</P>
    <P>By the end of this year 500 extra gardaí will have been put on our streets since July 1989 as a result of recruitment and the release of gardaí from office work through the civilianisation programme.  I will be coming back to this later in my contribution, but I want to say that these 500 gardaí are part of the current 1,000 recruits.  The last people in this present recruitment programme will be going through the training college by Christmas and we are already advertising for further 1,000.  Over 120 gardaí in Dublin alone have been assigned to community policing duties, which have been instrumental in promoting better Garda community relations and preventing crime. Cork, Limerick and Galway have also benefited from this programme which will be extended shortly.  In order to strengthen the management of the Garda Síochána &mdash; a very important aspect in <Col N="1041" /> the management of any organisation, especially an organisation of approximately 11,000 men and women &mdash; some 660 promotions in its ranks have been authorised by myself and the Government since November 1989.  In the past 18 months 195 civilian staff have been taken on to release gardaí for outdoor duties and a further 55 civilians will be taken on for this purpose before the end of the year.  Again, let me elaborate slightly.</P>
    <P>It has been my policy since becoming Minister for Justice that gardaí should be used for the purposes for which they were recruited and for which they were trained, that is, to be out on the beat preventing crime and dealing with the general public.  They were not recruited as clerical officers and should not be doing the tasks of clerical officers.  That is why I am engaged in this recruitment of 250 civilians to replace and release the gardaí from their desks and get them out on the beat.</P>
    <P>A sum of £10 million is being provided in this year's Estimate to upgrade Garda equipment of every kind.  By the end of this year £40 million will have been spent on the current Garda building programme. This was touched on by Senator O'Donovan and I want to assure him that that programme will be continuing in the years ahead.  Further contracts have been released.  A contract has been released, for example, today in the Dún Laoghaire area where approval has been given for the contract for a new courthouse and Garda divisional headquarters there.  The Garda have been operating in very bad accommodation and we will have a brand new headquarters completed there within about 15 million.</P>
    <P>A new divisional headquarters is being built in Cork city.  Senator O'Donovan referred to the new divisional headquarters in Bandon.  We have had a new divisional headquarters in Cavan and a new district headquarters in Balbriggan, a new station in Watercourse Road, a new divisional headquarters in Mullingar, all opened within recent weeks; and, just as they are being opened, new contracts <Col N="1042" /> are being issued because we are committed to ensuring that our gardaí will operate in the most modern and efficient premises to allow them to provide the type of service to which the general public are entitled.</P>
    <P>Garda juvenile liaison officers and public service vehicle inspectors have been put on the seven day roster to enable evening and weekend working by these members of the force.  The juvenile liaison officers service is being totally reformed and a national office to oversee this service was set up last December.  Community based initiatives to rehabilitate young offenders have been set up in Dublin and Limerick and will be extended elsewhere.</P>
    <P>For those juvenile offenders for whom custodial education is the only option, my colleague, the Minister for Education, intends to provide 45 extra places by September at the Ard Mhuire site in Lusk, County Dublin, that is 36 places for boys and nine for girls.  The Minister for State at the Department of Health, Deputy Chris Flood, presides over the new interdepartmental committee of officials from his own Department, Justice and Education, who are dealing with this and all other aspects of the treatment of juvenile offenders and young people at risk.  A Garda schools programme is now in place in 14 Dublin schools and will, be extended to other population centres shortly.  I will be announcing the details of that extension tomorrow at a passing-out parade in Templemore from which we will see a further 80 gardaí coming on to the streets of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There has been a major response to Neighbourhood Watch schemes with over 1,046 schemes now in operation covering 202,000 households approximately. Of course, we have Community Alert as well, which is the rural equivalent of Neighbourhood Watch, with approximately 250 schemes there.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to the proper resourcing of the Garda Síochána had led to noteworthy success in the fight against crime.  The level of recorded indictable crime in the Dublin metropolitan area decreased by approximately <Col N="1043" /> 8 per cent in 1989 as compared with the corresponding figures for 1988 and provisional figures indicate that the level decreased in 1990 by a further 3 per cent. Tentative figures for the first five months of this year show an increase in crime in certain areas.  Although it is far too early to conclude that these figures are firmly indicative of a longer-term trend, we cannot obviously await confirmation of trends before we act.  I want to make it quite clear &mdash; because it does not always emerge from media and other coverage of the situation &mdash; that the Garda authorities have already put specific measures in place to counteract the increased incidence of crime in certain parts of Dublin city, in particular.  These measures include the use of additional patrols and checkpoints, greater deployment of plainclothes surveillance units and the targeting of Garda resources to meet specific anti-crime needs in particular areas. For example, in some areas the gardaí are riding on the DART.  Garda authorities are satisfied that these measures will prove effective in tackling the problems, especially drug-related incidents which have given rise to concern in certain Dublin suburbs of late.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made in several fora lately to specific areas which are allegedly down in terms of Garda activity on the ground.  DMA East Division is one example cited.  That division is, in fact, a good example of the swift response taken by the Garda authorities in our major cities to emerging problems.  DMA East has a new chief superintendent since the turn of the year.  He has three able superintendents and 440 other members of the force reporting to him, which is roughly on a par with the Garda strength in the area in recent years.  In the past three weeks the division has been augmented by a new nine person Garda task force which is concentrating its efforts on burglary, larceny from cars and drug-related offences in the area.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;copycat&rdquo; car burnings problem in DMA East, which is a new phenomenon, has received particular attention from the gardaí in this division and three persons <Col N="1044" /> are now before the courts in this regard. Furthermore six additional gardaí are being scheduled for assignment to this division next week, three in Cabinteely and three in Shankill.  This can hardly be characterised as inaction by the authorities.</P>
    <P>As I said, only yesterday I announced the provision of a new Garda divisional headquarters and courthouse at the Adelphi Centre, Corrig Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, at a cost of approximately £3 million.  The new station will be purpose-built to meet the requirements of the Garda Síochána and will provide the gardaí with all the facilities necessary in a modern divisional headquarters.  In addition to the public office and general office accommodation, the station will have modern communications facilities, a dining and recreational area, showers, locker rooms, briefing and conference facilities and a modern cell block.</P>
    <P>The project will also provide new and improved accommodation for sittings of the District Court at Dún Laoghaire.  The new courthouse will be located alongside the new Garda divisional headquarters and will include adequate office accommodation, a public waiting area, consultation facilites, public toilet facilities and a solicitor's room, all of which will be a vast improvement on the existing courthouse accommodation.  In addition, and in line with my recent undertaking to the Irish Association for Victim Support, the new courthouse will also include a separate room for the use of the association. I believe very strongly that for people who on occasions find themselves as victims of crime and have to go to a court there is already enough trauma in that situation and that we should provide as far as possible a room in the courthouse where they can have an opportunity to relax in advance of going into the actual court building and into the court itself, so that they can feel comfortable and feel they are not the people on trial; they are the victims and the victims should be assisted.</P>
    <P>The overall project for the provision of the new Garda divisional headquarters and courthouse will be completed in an <Col N="1045" /> exceptionally short timescale.  The detailed design and the legal formalities are being finalised at present with the developers of the site, Dillon Associates Limited, and the entire project will be completed in approximately 15 months from now.</P>
    <P>Senators have raised three specific items in the motion before us this evening &mdash; Garda numbers, rural policing and bail procedures.  The Garda Síochána are in the forefront of the battle against crime. Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have made it my priority to maximise the number of gardaí on the street to ensure that the force has the resources it needs to do its job of protecting the public from the wrongdoer.  The objective is not just to increase the strength of the force until some magical number is reached, but rather to ensure that the Garda Síochána is provided with the level of manpower required to deliver an effective police service.</P>
    <P>I have already announced that, following on the recruitment of 1,000 Garda trainees over the past few years, a further 1,000 will be recruited over the period 1992 to 1995.  We have a newly-refurbished Garda college and a training course for trainee recruits to the Garda Síochána that is the best in Europe, if not the world.  We have been recruiting to the maximum capacity of the Garda college and are continuing to do so.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that everybody here fully understands that last point.  Irrespective of whatever ultimate strength is appropriate for the Garda Síochána, Garda recruits are currently passing through the college in Templemore as fast as its capacity will allow.  The new initial training course is much longer than heretofore &mdash; 62 weeks as compared with 22 weeks under the previous system &mdash; and, therefore, there is a significant time lag before new recruits become full members of the force and available for police duty.  However, this training programme is essential to provide us with young gardaí who are fully trained and have all the skills they need for policing work in modern society.  The Government are fully committed to the Garda <Col N="1046" /> recruit training programme and there is no question of taking short cuts to artificially boost Garda numbers in the short term.</P>
    <P>Recognising the current need for fully trained gardaí, the Government have not relied solely on recruitment to increase Garda numbers.  As a further measure, the services of 350 experienced members of the force are being retained by means of a temporary extension of the retirement age for garda sergeants and inspectors. This extension, which I first announced in November 1989 for a three year period, is being extended for a further year, up to 31 December 1992.  The combined effect of the Garda recruitment process and the extension of the retirement age will be to keep the strength of the Garda Síochána at the desired level in the coming years.</P>
    <P>However, I would caution against getting too immersed in a debate on just Garda numbers.  I am convinced that our emphasis in the future must not relate simply to adding more and more manpower to the ranks of the Garda Síochána, but rather to making the best possible use of the manpower already available to the force.  It is this consideration which underlies the Government's civilisation programme and, indeed, the decision of the Garda authorities to review the policing arrangements for rural areas to make them more responsive to community needs.  It is recognised internationally that there is a point at which it is simply wasteful and extremely non-productive simply to throw more police manpower at the crime problem.  Not only does crime demand a much wider community response &mdash; because crime is not simply a policing issue &mdash; it is also necessary to ensure that the police resources available are used to best effect.</P>
    <P>The rural policing plan submitted to me by the Garda authorities is not, as some have suggested, a cost-saving exercise. It involves substantially more, not less, expenditure on rural community policing.  What it aims at is substantially improved contact between the Garda and <Col N="1047" /> the communities they serve in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring an adequate and realistic Garda presence in rural areas.  First, I want to get gardaí in rural as well as urban areas out from behind desks to do the job for which they were recruited and trained.  Under the proposals being considered at present they will have more transport, new computer facilities, additional civilian clerical back-up and will see the abolition of outdated record-keeping.  For example, the number of forms to be filled at a Garda station will be more than halved from the present number of about 60.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there will be no closure or downgrading of Garda stations.  On the contrary, the plan entails the renovation of rural stations and Garda houses, specifically to encourage gardaí to reside in the communities they serve and with all the security and reassurance for local residents that implies.  These proposals would guarantee to the general public that their local station will be open during those hours if it is officially due to be open.  At present the opening hours of rural Garda stations can be unpredictable, with many of them closed for up to a quarter of their official opening hours.  This is something I am determined to redress.</P>
    <P>Those who make a great play about the new proposals leading to severe restrictions in the opening hours of rural Garda stations might do well to inform themselves fully about the situation on the ground before making further inaccurate comments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I consider it vitally important that expert advice received from the Garda authorities as to how rural community policing might be improved should receive full consideration, and I do not intend to be deflected from my examination of the plan on the basis of misleading comments as to what is involved. Of course, full consideration will be given to all the views that have been put forward, both inside and outside this House, before any final decisions are made.  The Garda associations have already given <Col N="1048" /> the opportunity to put their views to the Garda authorities and to me and I can assure the House that I will weigh very carefully the views of all interested parties before finalising the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>My major concern at this point is to reassure the rural community, some of whom &mdash; for example, the elderly &mdash; may have been unnecessarily distressed by the misleading and in many cases, unfortunately, politically motivated statements which have been made.  Let there be no doubt about it &mdash; the aim of the Garda plan is to make their communities safer from the activities of criminals.  The aim is to devise ways in which the Garda services in rural areas can be improved. Let me repeat, there is no hidden agenda in the Garda plans for rural policing and I deplore the irresponsible comments being made which suggest otherwise.  I would like to state it one more time, and hopefully for the last time.  The plan ensures the ongoing operation of Garda stations which may have been under threat of closure by previous administrations.</P>
    <P>The proposers of this motion also disregard the facts when they allege failure on the part of the Government to deal with the bail situation.  The best deterrent against crime, including crimes committed on bail, is where persons who engage in such criminal acts know that there is every chance their wrongdoing will be detected and that they will be brought to justice and punished.</P>
    <P>Contrary to recent public statements, including the implication in the motion before the House, the situation regarding crimes committed on bail is actually improving.  In 1983, before the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, was passed, 8,295 offences were committed by persons on bail.  Last year the comparable figure was 2,494 &mdash; a drop of about 70 per cent in the number of offences committed.  In the period 1987 to 1990 the pattern is one of steady decline in the figures.  The importance of the 1984 Act is that it provides that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed by a person on bail must be consecutive on any sentence <Col N="1049" /> passed or about to be passed on him for a previous crime.</P>
    <P>While the number of offences committed by persons on bail has shown a very significant decrease, I accept that the commission of 2,494 such offences is still a matter for concern.  My approach on this matter, and in relation to crime generally, is to give the Garda the necessary resources and to give the courts, subject to approval of the Oireachtas, the necessary legislative powers to deal with particular offences, consistent with the administration of justice.  However, proposals under which non-convicted persons could be locked up in prison while awaiting trial would require very careful consideration.  I am continuing to monitor the situation to see what further can and should be done in this area.  If I am satisfied that further measures are needed, I will bring forward appropriate proposals.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that the Government's commitment to reform in the criminal law area is very clear.  A number of important Bills have been enacted recently: the Prohibition of Incitement to Hatred Act, 1989; the Larceny Act, 1990, which updates and refines the law on receiving; the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, which provides for very strict controls on the supply and posession of dangerous weaponry; the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, which provides for the taking of bodily samples for DNA and other forensic testing; and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990, which redefines the offence, gives recognition to the seriousness with which sexual assault offences should be viewed and makes marital rape a crime.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Damage Bill, 1991 which proposes to replace the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, and to penalise the unauthorised modification and accessing of computer data is before the Dáil at present.  More recently, I introduced the Courts (No. 2) Bill, 1991, which, <i>inter alia,</i> allows District Court summonses in summary cases to be served by post.</P>
    <P>I hope shortly to be in a position to publish a Criminal Evidence Bill which, <Col N="1050" /> among other things, will provide for the admissibility as evidence in criminal cases of business and computerised records.  I will also shortly publish a Bill to provide for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of drug trafficking and other serious crime as well as the prevention of money-laundering.</P>
    <P>A Juvenile Justice Bill will be introduced by me next year to update the whole illegal approach to young offenders.  In the meantime I am invoking the powers conferred on me as Minister for Justice under the 1908 Children Act to bring in new rules of court which will change the regime in regard to the attendance of the parents or guardians of young offenders at juvenile court hearings.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission are at present conducting a comprehensive review of the law on dishonesty and fraud and their report, when published, will be receiving my early attention.</P>
    <P>In relation to a number of the other points mentioned by Senators, may I say, in relation to the whole question of rehabilitation of offenders, that I share the Senators' concern in relation to rehabilitation and it is my policy and the policy of this Government to try to stop persons who have committed a crime from continuing on the path of crime.  It was with that in mind that I reorganised on a national level the juvenile liaison service, because we want to ensure that our young people, if they have been tempted into their first brush with the law, rather than immediately being put into jail, should at that stage be helped and encouraged to get off a possible life of crime.  It is with that in mind that we have the schools project operating now in Dublin and extending to other areas.</P>
    <P>The whole question of on-the-spot fines and the general question of courts was touched on.  I want to say to the Seanad that I had the pleasure yesterday of introducing into the Dáil a new Courts Bill, which increases the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court from £15,000 to £30,000 and of the District Court from £2,500 to £5,000 and which increases the number of High Court judges, the number of Circuit Court judges and the number of <Col N="1051" /> District Court judges.  I was able to tell the Dáil yesterday about the new small claims procedure which has been established and which has been requested for many years in this country.  Later this year, I will be introducing legislation also to establish a Court of Civil Appeal.  All of these steps are aimed at making our courts more accessible to the general public and ensuring that there will not be undue delays in dealing either with civil or criminal matters.</P>
    <P>On the question of different policing experiments which was touched on by Senator Neville, may I assure the Senator that that is what we are looking at in relation to using Garda manpower in rural community policing &mdash; to ensure the absolute maximum benefit for the people and to ensure that our people will get the service to which they are entitled.  I can assure the Seanad also, in relation to post-1992 Europe and the necessary cooperation between this Government and the Garda Síochána and the police forces around Europe, that all necessary actions are being taken.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in commending the amendment proposed by Senator O'Donovan to the motion before the House.  The Government's record in relation to providing adequate resources for the Garda Síochána is above approach.  We are ensuring the most effective use of available resources in the fight against crime and vandalism both in urban and rural areas.  The sustained programme of law reform we are pursuing is proof positive of our commitment to ensuring the safety of our people from the criminal and the wrong-doer.</P>

      <P>At the outset when this Bill and the previous University Bill came to the House the connection between it, teacher education and teacher training was something that was of major concern to many of us.  We made strong representations to the Minister and I am glad to put on the record that the Minister responded to them by this section.  It states:</P>
      <P>The University, in relation to the performance of its functions, shall have due regard to the preservation, promotion and use of the Irish language and to the preservation and development of the national culture and in the training of teachers it shall have due regard to the teaching of the Irish language.</P>
      <P>It is important to note that is now in the Bill and it is the reason there has been universal support for it.  The point which gave worry to many people was that it could have a long term effect on the preservation of the culture and the language. I wish to record my views on that point.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to express my satisfaction that this clause has been inserted in the Bill in section 10.  I should point out that the two new universities established by our native Government do not have an Irish entry requirement in the matriculation certificate. In fact, we have now got the strange situation that the only university institutions which have an Irish matriculation requirement are those established by a foreign government.  I presume some clause will be inserted for those who will take the teacher training course in the University of Limerick and that there will be some requirement for Irish for those entering for these courses.  It is a fact that if we do not have a matriculation <Col N="1053" /> requirement for Irish entering university level, schools will not simply teach it up to leaving certificate standard.  We might need to think again in terms of the new universities having a requirement for Irish for matriculation purposes.</P>

      <P>I welcome the remarks of both Senators.  Senator O'Toole put on record his approval of section 10.  When I was here on Second Stage many of the Senators referred to that matter.  Senator Murphy said he and the other Independent Senators had commenced when the university Bills were going through on the apparent lack in the general ethos of the colleges for Irish and Irish culture. That was during the general election period of 1989.  If the Bills were not passed that day the two University Bills would not have been enacted into legislation and the subsequent graduates would not have been able to receive their awards from a university.  The view of the Seanad even though Senators had extreme reservations about that aspect of the Bill, was that they did not wish to deprive the young people of their chance.</P>
      <P>I recall clearly the comments made that day because they were very forceful.  In fact, I commented that the debate in the Seanad was much more searching and comprehensive than the similar debate in the Dáil.  When it was mooted that we would have these Bills the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, came to see me one day and said that many of the Senators had talked to him about the need to have in the legislation a distinct reference to the Irish language and culture and asked if I would keep it in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two events coincided.  We had the remarks on the record of the House, mainly of the Senators during the course of the debate on the two new universities. As far as I remember, Senator Murphy and Senator O'Toole had tabled amendments. As I said on the previous day, we were slightly guilty of plagiarism but the end result was fortunate.  There has been much favourable comment and I am pleased with the reaction here.  The level <Col N="1054" /> of debate was very comprehensive on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Senator's concern about the Irish entry requirement, section 3 transfers the teacher training functions of the college to the university and states that they shall be performed by the university in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Minister, after consultation, directs.  This section will allow the Minister of the day to ensure, for example, that the current level of Irish in the teacher training courses is maintained and developed.  It will also allow the Minister to ensure that the current Irish entry requirement for the teacher training courses is maintained. That can now be done by order and regulation and that is what will be done.</P>
    <P>The very fact that this section has excited so much response, both in the Dáil and in the Seanad, and such widespread attention &mdash; perhaps not so much in the public media but among those involved in the colleges and in education circles generally &mdash; will have its own reaction in the courses in the University of Limerick.  I would like to think the injection of specific requirements of specific students with needs in Irish, etc. will in itself have a knock-on effect in other courses, on the culture and the ethos of the college.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank the Seanad for their speedy consideration of the Bill but the speed did not detract from the comprehensive nature of Second Stage in <Col N="1055" /> particular and also the debate today.  It is just two years since we had the other university legislation and we had elections that time also.</P>
      <P>I want to thank Senators for their consideration and to note that it is a stage along the way of a coming together of teaching training establishments of various kinds.  For the young people of the country it means more university places, it means a broadening of the base of the University of Limerick, I want again to pay a tribute to Thomond College, to Dr. Jim Christian, his staff and the various governing bodies who have been in charge of the college.  I hope their traditions and ethos will continue in their new arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem of one and two-teacher schools in various places around the country has been discussed at length by the Minister and myself on more than one occasion.  It has also led to much consideration in small communities around the country.  I want to say immediately that in putting this matter down on the Adjournment I am aware of the Minister's views and the Department's views and I am certainly aware of the views of teachers and communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a consensus on the need to give some from of support to the smaller schools.  I want to put it clearly on the record that small schools &mdash; I am talking about the one and two-teacher schools particularly &mdash; are dotted throughout the country and are interwoven into the fabric of rural society in Ireland.  They are the focal point of hundreds of Irish villages.  Without a doubt the national <Col N="1056" /> school has been a constant factor in rural Ireland for a century and a half.  These schools have been symbols of learning, of continuity, progress and stability and they are an enduring monument to a continuing development in education at primary level since 1831.</P>
    <P>I am addrssing tonight the difficulty which arises from the threat to close down such schools.  There is a view, to which the Minister will readily subscribe, that one and two-teacher schools are excellent in their own way.  Every school is different.  I want to put it clearly on the record that because a school is small it does not mean it cannot provide the same level of service as a large school.  There is the question of maximising resources at different levels in different places and that has to be looked at.</P>
    <P>The one-teacher school creates a particular difficulty to which I will come back and which the Minister has referred to on a number of occasions, namely, of one teacher dealing with all areas of the curriculum. The point to which I am directing attention tonight is when a two-teacher school loses a teacher and becomes a one-teacher school.</P>
    <P>When a school goes from a two-teacher to a one-teacher school the community begins to think of the death a the school, or thinks the school is on its last legs. People begin to move out and transfer their children to other schools.  Consequently, one-teacher schools are closed down.  That is a pattern we have seen in many places.  I was talking to people in two-teacher schools who thought they were going to lose a teacher next year and they said to me that in that event there are already four families who indicated they were going to move their children to another area.  A one-teacher school can provide an excellent service. It is where there are 26, 27 or 28 pupils that the difficulty arises in trying to cope with all the different problems that arise.</P>
    <P>The closure of a local school, in terms of other social aspects is a devastating blow to any area and it has adverse effects on the community generally.  It is the beginning of the pattern of emigration, it is the beginning of the breakdown of the <Col N="1057" /> rural fabric, the beginning of the breakdown of the rural infrastructure.  As Tussing said, the one constant factor in every village is the national school.  There are more national schools than there are churches.  GAA pitches or Fianna Fáil cumainn.  The national school system is a widespread organisation and I am proud the members of my union are to be found throughout the country and are so closely involved with the community.  It is also important to put on record that the distribution of population in Ireland is different from that of any other European country.  Only in Ireland do you get a couple of houses here and there, up hill and down dale.  In other countries towns tend to be built around a certain area. The cost of rural electrification in Ireland was very expensive because of the distribution of population.</P>
    <P>The distribution of the primary education service in Ireland is very extensive because of the large number of schools. When you realise that there are 3,500 primary schools in the country as opposed to fewer than a 1,000 post-primary schools, it gives us some idea of how widespread is the primary education system.  Because they are part of each community one-teacher schools need to be supported in the sense that they need to be given every opportunity to have a second teacher.</P>
    <P>We have to accept that one-teacher schools are disadvantaged in many ways, not that there is any conspiracy to retain their disadvantage.  Educationally they are under extraodinary pressure to deliver in the large one-teacher school. When I say large I am talking about schools with more than 20 pupils.  They are the schools I am concentrating one tonight.  The Minister indicated on a number of occasions that one-teacher schools are, in effect, disadvantaged, perhaps not in an economic sense but disadvantaged in their own way.  They need a comprehensive support programme of positive discrimination.  What do they want?  They want more teachers, more caretaking services, more access to remedial and special education.  Those <Col N="1058" /> are the issues on which they need support.</P>
    <P>I am homing in tonight on the staffing area.  As an immediate step I call on the Minister to reduce the retention figure from 28 to 25 pupils.  That means, in effect, that the two-teacher school, which has numbers down to 25, will retain those two teachers, and at the stage when it becomes a one-teacher school if the numbers continue to fall at least it should be below the 25 figure.  It should be 24 or fewer and at least there will be some possibility of teachers coping with those levels of enrolment.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that the task of teaching eight different curricular class programmes to 28 pupils is an impossibility, physically, intellectually and every other way for one teacher.  It just cannot be done.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to intervene at this point and help out.  I should have said at the beginning that my professional colleague, Senator Mullooly asked for some time to speak on this matter.  I ask that he be allowed five minutes at the end and perhaps the Chair would indicate to me when I have five minutes left?</P>

      <P>Many I say before Senator Mullooly gets to his feet I have just got a note from the office of the Whip to say that I must go when the bell rings.  I will not rush this because I can come back.  I want to explain that I have been asked to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take about three or four minutes more.  I know that there are schools in Senator Mullooly's area he wishes to talk about.  I had talks with people from the Clooncagh area outside Strokestown where they have their own difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put some positive points on the record also.  If we are talking about staffing, it is as well to mention it as a difficulty but I want to establish that it is simply a difficulty and that progress has been made.  Under our wide-ranging and <Col N="1059" /> intensive discussions under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we managed this year to put together the response to the need for staffing in our schools.  The schedule we came up with, the first schedule to the programme, is the best schedule that has issued to primary schools for over a decade.  There is no gainsaying that fact. It is the biggest improvement in the staffing figures for over ten years.</P>
    <P>In the case of the two-teacher schools the improvement which we made on the appointment level by reducing the figure from 33 to 30 and also by ensuring that 29 was the maxmium class size means that any school with 29 pupils will get a second teacher.  That is the biggest improvement that size of school has had for 25 years as far as I could check in the past couple of days.  There is significant progress of my teaching organisation in those schools would accept that.  I ask the Minister today to take it a little further.</P>
    <P>We are also looking at a new schedule to take effect from September 1992 and we will be looking again at this area.  We should have it as an objective to reduce the 28 retention figure to 25.  Is it possible we could make some progress in this area in the context of disadvantage during the current year?  I also ask the Minister to put on the record tonight a commitment regarding her position in these staffing negotiations for two-teacher schools in the course of next year's discussions.  I ask her to respond as favourably and as positively as possible.  I would like to give five minutes of my time to my colleague, Senator Mullooly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="Mr. Mullooly Mr. Mullooly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mullooly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank my colleague, Senator O'Toole, for sharing his time with me.  I want to support very strongly the case Senator O'Toole has made for the small schools.  There is very little I can add to the case he has made. I know the problems of small schools having taught in a two-teacher schools for over 30 years.  There are particular problems in small schools but there are also great advantages.  Children who are <Col N="1060" /> educated in smaller schools, the one and two-teacher schools, are very mature at the end of their primary school education. They are far more mature than children who are educated throughout their primary education in a one class situation.  The brighter children have the benefit of hearing what is going on in the senior classes as they move up through the school.  They become familiar with the terms they will be using as they move into new classes and that is of great benefit to them.</P>
      <P>In our recent debate on education I referred in particular to the problem of one-teacher schools and I made the very point Senator O'Toole made during the course of his contribution that the larger of the one-teacher schools should be designated as disadvantaged.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that the teachers who teach in these one-teacher schools are doing great work.  They work extremely hard and are very dedicated people, I would like to reiterate the tribute I paid to them in the debate on the education motion.</P>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Senator O'Toole that it would be of tremendous advantage if the retention figure could be reduced from 28 to 25.  I know the Minister is sympathetic to that case.  She has stated on a number of occasions that she agrees with us that a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio is probably the most progressive step that can be taken at any time in education in that the ideal is a one-to-one situation.  We will never have that but no matter how few pupils a teacher is teaching there are always one or two who will need a little more individual attention than the others.  The fewer pupils in the class the greater the degree of individual attention that can be given to the pupils who need it most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the case made by Senator O'Toole.  I am particularly familiar, as is the Minister, with the situation in Clooncagh, national school in my own parish and I realise the difficulties that exist there.  I also realise how helpful the Minister has been in explaining the situation to the deputations who met her in relation to that school and the difficulties with <Col N="1061" /> which she was confronted.  I thank Senator O'Toole and the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke) Mary O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Senators for raising this matter.  I must have met the deputation from Clooncagh about ten times.  They have been most patient but most persistent also.  When Senator O'Toole was speaking I was thinking of Goldsmith's poem &ldquo;The Deserted Village&rdquo;:</P>
      <P>Ill fares the land, to hast'ning ills a prey.</P>
      <P>Where wealth accumulates, and men decay;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The village school and what it means to an area, often not even a village, is a sign of vibrancy.  More than that, it is a sign of hope that there will be young people coming and going, learning their lessons and life about a place.  When one goes to the west of Ireland one is often aware not only of the new schools that have been built but also of the older schools left in what seem very isolated places; the ghosts of the former pupils seem to hover over the area and one thinks what life must have been like when it was peopled with children.  Of course, children are a sign of life.  We will leave the post offices out of it tonight but to me the schools are the greatest sign of a community spirit no matter how small the schools.  When I came into the Department I became slightly alarmed during the first and second year when I noticed a great spate of callers to my house on Saturdays who had been informed their schools were to be amalgamated and closed down and this was <Col N="1062" /> happening without me knowing about it. We got that sorted out and now if there is no wish from a community for such an amalgamation, we do not go ahead with it.  At secondary level it is different.  They need a range of subjects, they need science laboratories and all sorts of things you cannot have in a much smaller school particularly in the context of the curriculum.</P>
      <P>The programme provides for a further improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio in the years 1992 to 1993.  Talks will begin on that very early.  I am very open to see that within those talks for the pupil-teacher ratio of 1992-93 we will have a specific item on the agenda for a reducation from the figures of 28 to 25.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another day's work.  The Senator has asked me some questions and I will deal with them now. My position in regard to the one-teacher schools is that they should be retained as much as possible.  The follow-on of that is to take a very close look at the tenor of those schools and how they can best do their business.  If that shows there should be a reduction in the figure of 28, if that is where the difficulty &mdash; and it would appear to be &mdash; we would have to look at the implications and how we could remedy it.  I suggest to the House that, as the matters for this coming September are already notified and allocated, they must be left for this year but in the autumn term will take a look at those schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that Senators O'Toole and Mullooly said about schools being disadvantaged is correct.  Disadvantaged schools are now judged under particular criteria and under different headings and have teachers allocated on that basis.  As both Senators acknowledged the pupils have a warm, intimate relationship with their teacher or teachers.  There is interaction, in that hte desks are so close they are being inadvertently educated as they can hear what is going on.  The close <Col N="1063" /> friendships made and the feeling of community involvement are very good and, in their own way, have great advantages.</P>
    <P>There is also the downside in one-teacher schools with the range of ages from four years to 12 and the range of abilities within each age in one room.  It is complex enough teaching a class with a range of abilities without dealing with all age groups with their differing range od ability.  It must require extraordinary skills on the part of the teacher involved. There are also the worries if a child gests sick or anything happens while the child is at school and the teacher is the sole adult present.  While it is nice to be mistress of your own emporium it is still a worrying situation and one that needs to be looked at more precisely than we have been doing with regard to the general pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>I take the Senators' general points about the PTR, the panel and allocations. These go on their way as they have always done in a fairly regular fashion.  It is for the good of everybody.  To treat schools when they get down to those numbers and are faltering between two teachers and one teacher is making the exercise too scientific when it may mean closure of a school.  Realistically, if numbers fall too low it is just not feasible to keep a school open but if we wish to retain community vibrancy I suggest there is a need to treat this issue in a particular way.  I accept that both Senators have addressed this issue and appreciate the reduction already made, which was due to what the INTO put forward.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> My position is that I am in general agreement with what Senator O'Toole has said.  How could one not be?  The suggestions are educationally sound.  The schedule for this September has gone out but I suggest soon after that we look at that issue in particular way as distinct from the other staffing schedules which will be proceeding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes. I am positively disposed towards it.  I feel that that issue could be looked at in the 28 to 25 pupil size.  I smiled when Senator Mullooly said that one-to-one would be the most favourable.  It would drive pupils and teachers daft.  I would not like it all day long and I am sure the pupils would not like it.  There would be no escaping that eagle eye.</P>
