      <P>I have notice from Senator Neville that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure that the extension to St. Mary's national school, Askeaton, is constructed in 1992.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to rebuild the old Model School in the grounds of the Department of Education in Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
      <P>Le iarraidh ar an Taoiseach Billí an Oireachtais a thionscnamh i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla as seo amach.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Neville and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Neville's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Costello may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> I regret I have had to rule the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>The business for today is Item No. 1 &mdash; Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann. In regard to this matter I do not wish to impose a limit on the speaking time. However, in the knowledge that there may be many Senators wishing to speak, I ask that there would be an element of brevity if at all possible; but that is a matter totally and absolutely for the Senators. We continue Statements on the Role of Seanad Éireann to 6 p.m. We will have a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m. and from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. we will continue with Item No. 10, Motion No. 40.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed to me about the duration of the Order of Business last week. I want to say that last week I attempted, because it was our first day back, to afford a reasonable opportunity to everybody. I ask for the co-operation of all because if the Chair does not get that type of co-operation then the Order of Business will become the day's business as occurred last week. Therefore, I ask the Members to give me co-operation and I will be glad to reciprocate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair knows he always has the co-operation of this side of the House on these matters.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business, first I would like to thank the Leader of the House for the speed with which he responded to this debate today. I would like to ask him if he would, as requested last week, give us a more precise programme of the business to be taken this session and if he would let me know the current state of the Altamont Bill which has left this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, last week I asked the Leader if he would countenance an early debate <Col N="215" /> on Northern Ireland. It is clear there is a major change of British policy underway. It is clear there is a political vacuum. It is high time that we in this House at least had an opportunity to debate what is a matter of great importance to all of us. I am sure there is all-party support for that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It would facilitate the Order of Business if we did not have to repeat the same questions week after week. I am sure you will appreciate that. Again, I have to begin by repeating a question I asked last week and that is if the Leader of the House would outline for us the programme of legislation which is to be initiated in this House during this session. I would like a simple list, either today or tomorrow, on that.</P>
      <P>At the moment the proposed changes in the Treaty of Rome are going to have a major impact on the many aspects of Irish life &mdash; monetary, financial, political and social &mdash; and it is high time that we had a specific debate, not just on developments over the past six months as we already had, but a discussion on the proposed changes in the draft Treaty as it is at the moment. There is no point in having this debate after next month when it will be signed, sealed and delivered; now is the time the parliamentarians can have an input into it. I ask that we have an early debate on the proposals that are included in the draft Treaty. We indicated last week that we wanted certain movement on some of the items of legislation and we will be pushing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I propose that Item No. 42 be taken today and, secondly, may I ask the Leader of the House to give us an indication of the position in relation to the introduction of the Animal Remedies Bill to control the use of the angel dust and indeed the situation in relation to the proposed legislation regarding the control of dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>At a time when there is much comment and controversy about <Col N="216" /> the hoarding of treasures, which would appear to run counter to the recent legislation, may I take this opportunity to ask the Leader of the House to convey the appreciation of the House of the magnificent gesture of the Hunt family in donating a priceless collection to the State? It will enhance very greatly the city of Limerick and indeed the State as a whole. It is marvellous to see a family, who by and large are not extremely wealthy, making such a magnificent gesture. One of the items of this collection is one of the 30 pieces of silver. It is very appropriate in this day and age that there be comment on that type of money. It is a magnificent gesture by the Hunt family and it is appropriate that this House should acknowledge it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if it is proposed in the coming term to have a specific debate on the health services? The reason I raise this matter is that since the summer recess, or rather since our last sittings last year, not alone has there been no improvement but there has been a notable deterioration in the sense that waiting lists continue for a whole range of services, ranging from by-pass operations, orthopaedic care, etc. I would put it to the Leader of the House that this must be a national priority area and something worthy of discussion by this House. I commend it to him as something that will give people confidence in the role of the Seanad if they know a matter like that is being debated here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>May I again raise the issue of the banking system in this country? I acknowledge that the Leader's response last week was that it could be discussed under economic issues. However, I am now quite sure there is a major level of discontent among Irish people about the hidden charges being operated by the banking system particularly in relation to mortgages and the pressure being put on people to engage in other activities, as well as the charges being operated for people going to their bank managers to discuss loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of all, it is very appropriate on the day that is in it &mdash; a day that we are talking about reform of the Seanad &mdash; that the Leader of the House would respond to my request, given the fact that there is no ministerial responsibility in this matter, that statements by Members be allowed to express their concern on this major issue in the very near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>During the prayer before the Order of Business and which is enjoined on us by Standing Orders I was wondering whether the august personage to whom our daily entreaties are addressed is listening at all, in view of the awful state of the country? I think the Leader of the House might well refer this matter to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to see whether this ritual should be continued.</P>
      <P>Tá ceist eile ar an gCeannaire. Tá ráfla millteanach ag dul timpeall go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta chun éirí as oifig ar fad. Dá mbeadh an scéal seo fíor chuirfeadh sé brón agus briseadh croí ar Ghaeil. Ba mhaith liom go ndeimhneodh nó go mbréagnódh an Ceannaire an scéal sin, mar tá sé an-tabhachtach go deo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader of the House to allow time to discuss what I consider to be a major problem at the moment, the disposal of toxic waste. We have people marching out at the gate and all over the nation and especially in the part of the world I come from. There is a lot of controversy up there over the siting of an incinerator to burn toxic waste. People are suggesting that it be sited elsewhere. It is a matter of national concern and I ask the Leader to have it discussed in this House. If the disposal of toxic waste can be discussed at every crossroads, I think it is a subject that should merit discussion in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Má cheadaítear dom, ba mhaith liom chomh maith tacú le Senator O'Keeffe. The banking system is now arguably the single greatest disincentive to enterprise in this country. It has got away scot-free for years as it operates its cosy cartel. I agree with Senator O'Keeffe that we should have a full-scale debate on the appalling cartel that masquerades as a banking system in this country.</P>
      <P>In the light of the decision of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to abolish the Advisory Committee on Development Co-operation, I ask the Leader if he will allow us to have a debate on this extremely important issue if for nothing else than to allow those of us who are embarrassed by the shameful position our Government have brought us to at least to register our disapproval. We have now the most mean-minded Government in western Europe in terms of overseas aid. It is an issue that has sneaked through successive Oireachtas and successive years without a serious discussion and I ask the Leader to allow a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to move an amendment to the Order of Business &mdash; and I hope that the Members opposite, in their increasing capacity to think freely and independently, might actually get as far as taking a decision to allow a Bill to be printed without approval from higher up the system &mdash; that Item No. 8 be taken at the commencement of business. This entails the publication, not the debate, and printing of the Bill entitled An Act to establish a register of Members' <Col N="219" /> interest. If Item No. 8 is taken first and assuming it is not opposed, it will take no more than ten seconds. I cannot understand the continuing resistance to it and I hope it is not a symptom of how seriously Seanad reform is being taken. I move formally yet again, as I will every week until it is agreed, &ldquo;That Item No. 8 be taken at the commencement of business.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join the other Senators in asking for statements on the banking system because constituents are definitely complaining about hidden charges and so on. As public representatives, we should be able to discuss these matters. I should also like to say that I take grave exception to Senator Murphy's remarks. They were unnecessary and most mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Chair will agree with me that whatever about the rest of us, God is well able to look after him or herself.</P>
      <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper in my name about Nicky Kelly. Does the fact that you allowed an Adjournment debate on the matter rule this out for discussion for another six months? It does not. I just wanted to clear that up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Private Members' business is not repetitious of an Adjournment motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not clear on that. Senator McKenna congratulated the Hunt family on their munificence. That is very appropriate. It was a very remarkable donation. On that cultural level I am sure, a Chathaoirleach, you will find it appropriate briefly for us to send our congratulations and best wishes to a former Member of this House, Brian Friel, on the production of <i>Dancing at Lughnasa</i> in New York. This is not a trivial matter. After all, a play of that standard and excellence reaches an enormous audience and becomes a showcase for the Irish people in New York and <Col N="220" /> I am sure the people would wish that message to be sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to point out that we agreed in the past that the traditional practice in the House was that words of congratulations and words of sympathy in appropriate cases were to come from the Leader of the House. While you may very rightly send your good wishes, we must remind ourselves of the function of the Leader of the House in this matter. It is also correct that he should be advised on such matters before he comes into the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand reproved. I was aware of that ruling in regard to messages of condolence but I had not realised it was for congratulations as well. That seems to be quite logical. If there was any discourtesy, I apologise to the Leader of the House for that; but I am sure he will consider it appropriate that a message be sent.</P>
      <P>Finally, may I formally second the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House the same question I asked him the last day, namely, if he would see what items of the business intended for this session could be initiated in this House as distinct from being initiated in the Dáil. I would like to have a positive answer to that question. There is agreement on both sides of the House that we have a debate on the banking system. Everybody would agree that they certainly have been operating a monopoly in a cartel to the detriment of the farming community, the business community and indeed to private borrowers as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the reform of the Seanad, a matter we are about to discuss, it is a pity we cannot discuss current issues, such as the proposal that the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation be abolished by the end of this year. The reason that is given is that it would save money, but there is no money <Col N="221" /> really spent because all the members are there in a voluntary capacity. It is a very independent body and has pointed out the fact that Ireland is at the bottom of the table in terms of the ratio of development aid to gross national product. That is a matter of current concern that it would be well worhtwhile our being able to debate here in the House.</P>
    <P>Finally, I second the proposal by Senator Upton that we amend the Order of Business to take item No. 42 at the beginning of business for the reasons I mentioned the last day. The Companies Act refers specifically in section 194 to penalties to be imposed for non-disclosure of interest by directors and certain individuals, and I can name one, Michael Smurfit, has now indicated that he did not disclose his interest. It is a matter of concern for this House that inquiries are being established but that the ultimate stage towards prosecution, where the law specifically demands it, is not being implemented. I would like to second the motion that item No. 42 be taken as the first item on the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of Senators, Senator Manning included, asked for a programme for the session ahead. As I indicated last week, we have a number of important pieces of legislation which have been published. I mentioned the Patents Bill, the Health (Family Planning) Bill, Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill, the Roads Bill, 1991, an Electoral Bill which is a local government Bill, the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, the two Education Bills &mdash; the Dublin Institute of Technology Bill and the Regional Technical Colleges Bill. We have a Criminal Damages Bill and one that is just about to conclude in the Dáil, Liability for Defective Products Bill. There is a long list of ten or 11 Bills that are expected to be published in this session. That includes a Bill that has been referred to by Senator Upton. In fairness to him, he has been consistent in asking for the amendment of the Animal Remedies Act, 1956. It is a Bill which effectively increases the penalties for abuse of <Col N="222" /> animal medicines. He also asked about the legislation for the control of dogs. That is legislation, Senator Upton, that will require you to put a lead on your Rottweiler or some of the tough little terriers that you keep in your place. We also have an Industrial Development Bill, a Criminal Law Bill, a Housing Bill and a further Local Government Bill modifying and speeding up planning appeal procedures. There is a fairly long list of Bills there for us. I can assure the House, as I have said many times, that Senator Wright, the Government Whip, and I will be actively pursuing the initiation of Bills in this House. We have been consistent in this matter and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning referred again to a debate on Northern Ireland. I have no plans in regard to that matter. The Senator knows my views on the subject. I still live in hope that talks will start there. The Senator also asked about the Altamont Bill. I can inform him that Dáil Éireann has been asked to concur with Seanad Éireann in its resolution communicated to it in July this year to consider setting up a joint committee of both Houses to deal with the Altamont Bill. When we hear from the Dáil we will select our people from the Seanad for that committee.</P>
      <P>I have given a reply to Senator O'Toole regarding initiation of Bills. He specifically asked for a debate on proposed changes in the Treaty of Rome. I understand his concern and it is probably something we will endeavour to take on board as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given a fairly detailed reply to Senator Upton's queries. I cannot take Item No. 42. Senator McKenna had comments; they were not questions. In reply to Senator O'Reilly, I have no proposal at this point in time &mdash; but it might change &mdash; for a debate on the health services. Senator O'Keeffe has been extremely consistent in looking for a debate on the banking system. I agree with his interpretation: I suggested some time ago that we would take it and perhaps <Col N="223" /> we would incorporate it into a debate on the economy. From what I read in the papers, what my colleagues tell me and what I know myself, I am of the view that such a debate would be appropriate to the House. I can assure Senator O'Keeffe that I will take it on board and have that debate, or statements as he called it, as soon as possible in the House.</P>
    <P>I have no comment to make in regard to Senator Murphy's comments. Senator McGowan again has raised an important matter, the question of the disposal of toxic waste. It is particularly relevant to his county and is something I will consider and come back to him on the matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Brendan Ryan asked for a debate on overseas aid, as did other speakers. I will consider it, but at this time I have no proposals. However, as I said, it is something I will think about and consider over the next few weeks. Item No. 8 deals with a register of Members interests. Senator Ryan knows that I, no more than many other Senators, have nothing to hide. We do this at county council level, but I have made the point that it is specifically referred to in the new Programme for <Col N="224" /> Government and obviously the Government will, in time, do something positive in regard to this.</P>

      <P>Senator Kiely has given support for a debate on the banking system. Senator Norris raised the question of Nicky Kelly, which was indeed on the Adjournment here last week, and he seconded the amendment to the Order of Business. Senator Costello referred to overseas aid, which I have already mentioned. That concludes the questions, a Chathaoirligh. The Order of Business, as I understand it, is that we take Item No. 1.</P>

      <P>That is not the reason. On the Order of Business last week when agreeing to arrange a debate on the role of the Seanad I expressed my approval and that of my colleagues for the general proposal. I also stated that a full and open debate would be beneficial if approached and I know it will be, in a responsible and constructive manner.</P>
      <P>The powers and functions of the Seanad are enshrined in the Constitution enacted by the people in July 1937 and in operation from 29 December 1937. The duties and responsibilities attaching to Members of the Oireachtas is well defined. The Oireachtas is clearly a very important part of our democratic system. I agree fully that as Members of one of the Houses of the Oireachtas from time to time we should examine our role and improve the working of the House if at all possible, mindful of our responsibilities under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution states that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State is hereby vested in the Oireachtas. No other legislative authority has power to make laws for the State. Each House of the Oireachtas exercises its powers and performs its functions through the voice or the decision of its Members. In our democracy the Houses of the Oireachtas are, as we all know, accountable to the people in the hierarchy of accountability and the people are the sovereign authority in the State. As Senators we have a very important role to play in the affairs of this nation and it is no harm to remind the House or our importance from time to time. The Constitution sets the parameters within which the role of the Seanad must be considered. While allocating equal and complementary powers to each House in some areas, Articles 31.2, 14, 12, 10, 33.5, 35.4, 28.3.3º, 21.2, 46.2 and 24 allocate to Dáil Éireann superior parliamentary authority in relation to certain matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to reform, we must be realistic in our approach. The concept of the Seanad should be stressed. It is not a carbon copy of the other House but it should endeavour at all times to carve for itself an individual, definite and distinctive role. Consequently, in the areas of legislation and, in particular, in financial areas we must accept that the powers of the Seanad are, in general, less than that of the Lower House and that the Dáil is the main organ of the legislative <Col N="227" /> machine. The Dáil has superior constitutional powers in regard to non-money Bills in so far as a Bill to amend the Constitution may be initiated in the Dáil only and a Bill, in certain circumstances, may be deemed to be passed by both Houses by resolution of the Dáil pursuant to Article 23 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Dáil has superior parliamentary authority in regard to the finances of the State and this arises from its exclusive power to initiate money Bills. However, the point should be made that the Seanad, by resolution passed at a sitting at which not less than 30 Members are present, may challenge the certification by the Ceann Comhairle of a Bill as a money Bill.</P>
    <P>In order to fully understand the role of the Seanad we must go back to the concept behind the Constitution of 1937 and the subsequent enactment of the Seanad Electoral (Panels Members) Acts. In October 1937 during the Second Stage debate of the 1937 Act the then President and Minister for External Affiars, Eamon de Valera, said &ldquo;We were far from favouring a Seanad which was going to be a reproduction of the primary House&rdquo;. He said that in choosing a Seanad formed on a location basis, &ldquo;we did that because we believed that it might be possible on that basis to get a Seanad which would not be a mere reflection of the primary House&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Obviously the fundamental aim was to obtain a body of persons possessing specialised knowledge and experience that would play a watchdog and a revising role in regard to legislation. Of the 43 Members elected from the five panels, at least 16 must be elected from candidates nominated by the various nominating bodies. In the present Seanad, 24 of the Members were so elected. As you are aware, in relation to the 43 elected Members the legislation stipulates that each must have knowledge and practical experience of his or her particular panel. Add those 43 elected Members to the six Senators elected by the Universities and to the 11 nominated by the Taoiseach <Col N="228" /> and you have a Seanad with a great diversity of talent and with specialist knowledge. This is the case in the present Seanad. We have the excellent specialist knowledge of various Senators in all areas of life whether it be education, the trade union movement, industry or agriculture. It is no harm to point out that we also have a great divergence of opinion which many times leads to interesting and very fruitful debates.</P>
    <P>Looking back, for example, to the people nominated by the various Taoisigh over the years you will find such fine people as Stephen McGonagle, Séamus Mallon, John Robb, who was with us all for a long time and Bríd Rogers. They all added greatly to the dimension of the Seanad. Others come to mind for example, Brian Friel who was mentioned here today and people with specialist interests and knowledge such as Eamon de Buitléar and George Eogan. I remember sitting on this side of the House many years ago with an eminent person in financial matters, Ken Whitaker. I just mention those people in passing as being very important people and indicative of the wide variety of nominations made by the various Taoisigh over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>Since my appointment as Leader of the House I have always endeavoured to have Government Bills initiated in the Seanad as has Senator Wright. Our track record in this area speaks for itself. Bills initiated in the Seanad have been debated fully and in great detail. The obvious advantage of debating a Bill in the Seanad is that whereas many Bills are debated in the Dáil under a time restriction, the Seanad has traditionally allowed the debate to run which means that Bills are debated thoroughly.</P>
    <P>Another area where we can carve a greater role for the Seanad is in the automatic debating of joint Oireachtas committee reports. We have done this very successfully over the last number of years. I mention the report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities whose statutory role in vetting <Col N="229" /> EC directives is all the more important with 1992 just around the corner.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many Senators are dissatisfied with the Standing Orders relative to public business in Seanad Éireann. Many Senators consider Standing Order 29 to be too restrictive and some favour the introduction of what is referred to as a topical hour. As Leader of the House I have endeavoured to provide a mechanism for discussing what might be described as a sudden emergency or topical events by the more frequent use of Statements. We have been very successful in this area.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion often put forward is that Question Time or some form of Question Time similar to that in the Dáil might be introduced in Seanad Éireann. On a cautionary note while accepting that there might be merit in the suggestion, I must point out that in view of the constitutional provision that stipulates that the Government shall be responsible to Dáil Éireann, difficulties would definitely arise. I have no doubt we would experience difficulty regarding the availability and accountability of Ministers. It has been suggested, not very often thankfully, that the Leader of the House might act in their stead. The obvious disadvantage is that the follow-through queries or supplementaries which are the strength of Question Time would largely be lost.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise again that the role of the Seanad is not to be a carbon of the other House and it is not appropriate to attempt to make it such. The role of the Seanad lies not in following identical lines to that of the Dáil or in seeking to have all of the procedures of the Dáil introduced in the Seanad. For the very reason referred to above in relation to a Question Time or form of Question Time, the introduction of reforms similar to those recently adopted in the Dáil, including the selection of up to three different matters on the motion for the Adjournment and the introduction of grievance time might not be feasible. I am sure many Senators will refer to those ideas and I look forward with interest to what they have to say.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="230" /> I refer to the exclusive role of the Seanad as a forum for the introduction of Private Bills. We have had two recently, the Altamont (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill and the Limerick Markets Bill. As Members are aware, this mechanism was largely unused since 1978 but came again to the forefront in the last Seanad. Those two Bills have passed through Second Stage in this House.</P>
    <P>I look forward with interest to hearing the views of other Senators. Members' contributions will be noted carefully, hopefully, many of them will be used by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to improve the working of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to place on record my thanks to the Leader of the House for the speedy way in which he agreed to take this debate and for allowing it to be an open, ongoing debate for this session. People on all sides of the House can put forward views which I think are increasingly strongly held about the need for change.</P>
      <P>I do not think any one of us has the panacea or the magic list of changes that will do all we want to do, but at least let us all hear each other's ideas. I am glad, in spite of Senator Murphy's question, that there is no Government representative as such in this House. This is the business of the Seanad. It is business that we should be able to agree on and implement without &ldquo;Big Brother&rdquo; Government being involved more than is constitutionally necessary. It was useful that the Leader of the House at the outset put the debate into its proper constitutional context and indicated the constitutional parameters which limit our scope of action in the House. It is better to start this debate in a sober, realistic way rather than to put forward a range of proposals which have no chance of being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is not about apologising for the fact that we have a second chamber. It is about ensuring that this Chamber gives value for money, has a role that is realistic and provides better legislation for our people, better safeguards for the public <Col N="231" /> interest and an assurance that issues of public importance will be debated speedily and in a responsible way. Those are the things we want from a proper functioning Seanad. They are things we are not getting at present from this House but, hopefully, at the end of this debate we may at least know how to go about getting them. If we as a House can fulfil these objectives we need not worry. Nobody should say then that this House should be abolished.</P>
    <P>There are many people outside and maybe some even who have been Members of the House who would raise serious questions as to the future of the House as it is at present constituted. I am very heartened by the signs on all sides of the House of a new openness to change as far as we are concerned. We will be judged on this by the urgency we bring to this debate and on whether we take ourselves seriously as parliamentarians and take this House seriously. If we do not take the House or our role seriously, then who will? That is what this debate is largely about.</P>
    <P>This debate is set in the context of changes in our understanding of what democracy means. Democracy is not static. Our understanding of the term has grown and expanded over the past decades. In all areas of our society as a people and in all our institutions we have become a more open, participative and sensitive society. Nobody would deny that. This has happened over the past number of years. In virtually every major institution today there is the need and very frequently the willingness to give a greater sense of accountability and answerability. We are conscious today of phrases such as &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo;, &ldquo;gender discrimination&rdquo;, &ldquo;minority groups&rdquo;, &ldquo;regional discrimination&rdquo; and so forth. These issues are important. They are very much part of our expanding sense of understanding democracy. They are on the agenda of any serious political movement today. All of them <Col N="232" /> aim at enriching the concept of democracy. This debate is about asking ourselves how this can alter its procedures towards that same goal.</P>
    <P>If we look at the way in which Parliament has developed in this century, we can see enormous power in the role of Parliament. When this State was founded and when our forebears stood in this House 70 years ago, Parliament had very few competitors. It had to work within the confines of the Constitution but it did not have to share its law-making function with any extra-territorial body. There was no EC; no pooling of sovereignty; there was no other body making the laws which would bind Irish people. There were no social partners when this Parliament was set up, framing policy with Government to the total exclusion of both Houses, indeed to the total exclusion of members of Government. There were no social partners deciding the major aspects of public policy. When this House was set up the courts had yet to expand their role to the extent that today there are many people who virtually see the courts as almost the fourth House of the Oireachtas. There were very few organised pressure groups when this Parliament came into existence. There were always the various churches, one in particular, and there were different groups which could make their point of view known but there were not the organised pressure groups to the extent that they exist today, groups pursuing their sectoral interests often backed by formidable financial resources.</P>
    <P>When we go back to that time we can say that legislation, for the most part, was comparatively simple. It was a simpler time. It enabled the ordinary Members of the Houses to understand the basis of most of the legislation that was processed through the Houses. When this House was set up there was not the powerful mass media that we know today, a mass media which, among the many things it brings to public life, is a sense of often creating the agenda, a sense of frenetic activity, a sense of setting the agenda rather than reporting it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> In the situation of that time Parliament had a relatively powerful role but every year of the past 50 years has seen a weakening of that position as far as the Houses are concerned. The phenomena I am referring to are not just a feature of this country. They have happened in virtually every country, every democratic system we care to look at. Again, we start with the first point I mentioned, namely, the growing internationalisation of politics. When we, as a Parliament, stop to think about the changes which are proposed for this House and for the other House in the ongoing development of the European Community the implications are quite enormous. How often do we think about the consequential loss of power and position, of the sidelining of our Houses of Parliament, consequent upon the developments that are taking place? We are going into all of this with our eyes open, with very little public debate but at least we have had referenda which have backed the various developments and so forth. I believe we have paid very little attention to the effect of all of this on the future development of this and the other House.</P>
    <P>The concept of the corporate State is something which has been growing in other countries as well. The corporate State is virtually made flesh in the institutionalisation of the dialogue with the social partners where in a sense the major sectoral groups sit down with Government over the heads of the elected representatives to decide public policy. It is a process which has, to a certain extent, brought results. There must always be dialogue within any Government or any political party and the major social interests groups in society but it is a very bad development that this dialogue becomes institutionalised and virtually takes the place of the policy-making process which should rightfully be decided finally in the Houses of Parliament. This is something which Governments like because it is not particularly messy, it involves small numbers of people, it can be manipulated by both sides and it produces results but in terms of the place of Parliament and our role as politicians <Col N="234" /> it is something which has extremely dangerous long term and even short term consequences.</P>
    <P>Again, we are looking at the position of pressure groups in all countries today. They have become more and more powerful, often more and more insidious. There was talk in recent times of golden circles, of people being on the inside, of having inside information, of knowing where exactly to put the right word in the right ear to get the right result. This has probably always happened and always will happen but we are at a stage now where a large proportion of most major business budgets is spent on the business of persuading governments to do what that business wants, of pressure of that sort. That also takes place outside of the scrutiny which Parliament is there to give, away from the consultation with the elected people and again is something which in all countries has damaged the position of Parliament.</P>
    <P>Most Bills which come in here now are very complex. We in this House have performed very well on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. We have had the Companies Bill, the Insurance Bill. There is a range of legislation coming through the Houses today which is enormously complex. The case hardly needs to be made for in-built expertise in the Houses of Parliament to enable Members to scrutinise legislation in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the factors. I have mentioned the internationalisation of politics, the growing complexity, the role of pressure groups. The power of the mass media also has had an extraordinary effect on the place of Parliament. In the old days here the newspapers would report in great detail what happened in the Houses of Parliament. Indeed in the time of Parnell it was the reporting in the <i>Freeman's Journal</i> and the other newspapers almost verbatim of the debates at Westminister which enabled Irish people who perhaps had not been to school to have these debates read out to them in their villages and towns throughout the country which gave them a very detailed grasp of the issues and the personalities <Col N="235" /> involved. That day has long since gone and there is no point in complaining about it.</P>
    <P>The media today has a great tendency to simplify issues. The sound bite rules. If you cannot say it in 30 seconds then it is not worth saying. We all know that complex issues cannot be reduced to 30 seconds, that all politics is not a presidential confrontation between two or three major political leaders. Unfortunately more and more of the media tends to present political debate and conflict in those terms. Again, it is something we have to live with but it has done great damage to the rest of Parliament. Why should we sit here today talking at great length perhaps about a subject that does not grab a great number of people when a short statement or an abusive statement or an outrageous statement is more likely to be reported. There is a change which the growth of media power has brought about. We have been well served by our media in this country, radio, television and most of the newspapers in that they have a responsible attitude but nonetheless they, too, are part of this growing development. Of course we have mentioned the growing role of the courts but that is not for this debate today.</P>
    <P>Our problems are very little different from those of most other countries. The difference, however, is that we in Parliament have not fought back. In most other countries parliamentarians fairly early on recognised what was happening and recognised they had an obligation to fight back, to win back power for Parliament, that if they were not going to fight for it nobody was going to give it to them.</P>
    <P>This brings me to what I believe is the nub of the problem we are discussing here today, our lack of belief in ourselves as parliamentarians. We should never forget that it is Parliament that is sovereign, not Governments. We have the right in the Constitution to make our own procedures, to adopt new roles for ourselves, to set up whatever committees we wish in this House. All that is needed for the most part is the will of the House. <Col N="236" /> Yet, all these years we have waited for Governments to give us the lead, for Governments to come in and make changes for us. We have waited in vain, and we will wait in vain if we expect Governments to do it. We will wait in vain until we decide what changes we want and set about implementing them ourselves.</P>
    <P>It is a fact of political life, and we all know it, that no Government welcomes a strong, busy, effective, inquisitive Parliament. All Governments feel they know best, that they have the best experts, that they have thought out the problems fully, that they have had full consultation with all the people who matter. We could write the script ourselves as to how Governments feel on these matters. They do not want committees sending for Ministers, sending for civil servants. They do not want competition from well briefed TDs and Senators who again will hold up the legislation, ask awkward questions. They do not, in fact, like spending too much time in the House. We all know that to be a fact. Ministers regard themselves as very busy people. I am talking about all Governments, so I am not making this a party point. We see the way in which some Ministers have, in the presence of all of us, virtually treated the House with contempt, racing through scripts paying little attention, making it clear that it is a bore to be here and they cannot wait to get out.</P>
    <P>We see the steady succession of junior Ministers coming in, sent in to do a job, often knowing nothing of the legislation which they are expected to pilot through the House. I am not blaming them in particular. They are sent in. We cannot expect them to lead a crusade which effectively will make their lives more difficult and that is what we are seeking to do. We are asking for this particular crusade, this change, the net effect of which will be to ensure that Governments are more carefully criticised and scrutinised, that they are more answerable, that Minister will have to spend more time in the House, that they will have to take it all more seriously. Why should we expect them to lead that battle, if it <Col N="237" /> comes, it will come from within this House itself.</P>
    <P>Various questions are raised by a debate like this. One of the first questions which is raised is whether we need more powers as a House. The Leader of the House did indicate the constitutional parameters within which we must operate. Personally I do not think it is a question of greater power. I do not think any greater powers are necessary for this House to perform more effectively. Again, the Leader of the House made a very important point at the beginning of this debate when he pointed out that in many respects this House is subordinate to the other House. That is only as it should be and it is enshrined in the Constitution. Members of the other House are directly elected. It does express and represent the sovereign will of the people as expressed through elections. Certainly it is not our job to frustrate the other House. We would not be a good Seanad if we, as we are at present constituted, saw it as our job to harry the other House, to frustrate, to make life difficult for the Government on a non-issue basis. That happened in 1934 when there was a very different Seanad, different in composition, the elections were held at different times from Dáil elections and there was a conservative majority in this House against Mr. de Valera's radical majority in the Lower House. On that occasion the Seanad did set out to frustrate the will of the Lower House and Mr. de Valera, as we all know, brought in a Bill to abolish the Seanad which the Seanad, as again we all know refused to pass, not unreasonably, I suppose, but which became law 18 months later. Looking back on that, I think that Mr. de Valera was absolutely right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the occasions where I find myself in agreement with the late President de Valera. He brought in a Bill to abolish the Seanad <Col N="238" /> and I think on the arguments of the day he was right. You cannot have a situation where there is conflict between the two Houses. We do not have to push for extra power, we do not have to be in competition with the Dáil. It would be a foolish move towards reform to go in that direction. Broadly speaking, the powers we have in this House, the powers which we largely do not use, are similar to those of many of the other second Chambers in the European Community. There are eight second Chambers within the European Community and in all of them the emphasis is on the detailed scrutiny of legislation, the emphasis is on the initiation of legislation, the emphasis is on providing the widest possible degree of debate on public issues. Each of the eight second Chambers in the European Community &mdash; and I have not strayed away from that &mdash; see their role largely in the same terms in which anybody who looks at it carefully in this House would also see it.</P>
      <P>I will be making some specific proposals before I finish as to how we might enhance our own effectiveness within existing parameters. One of the questions which will undoubtedly be raised during the course of this debate is whether we should change our electoral system. I have a very open mind on that. Obviously all of us are here because of the electoral system and there is a great natural tendency, whether it is from the university seats or from the panels &mdash; I cannot speak for those who come in through the Taoiseach's nomination &mdash; for those of us who have been through the two electoral systems to be happy enough with the system which elects you, to feel reasonably comfortable within it. If we are serious about this debate then we have to look very carefully at the electoral system and see whether there are ways in which it could be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say again that the panel system here is not all that different from that which operates in a number of EC countries. It is not something that we took out of thin air and put into place here. I am not referring to the vocational aspect of it but the actual electoral college of public <Col N="239" /> representatives is not altogether different. France, Holland, Spain and Belgium all have elements of election from regional and provincial councils as part of their second Houses. Italy and Belgium have elements of direct nomination into the Upper House so in that sense there are plenty of examples which rest somewhat on the principal of an electoral college of people who themselves have been elected as a step into the second Chamber.</P>
    <P>Senator Fallon made a point and it is a key one in many ways as to whether we will be successful or not. That was that the Seanad should not be a carbon copy of the Dáil, that there is a need for a different sort of person in the Seanad, a different type of representation. However, that is a concept which I would not push too far. We are a small country. The political class, those who are involved in politics is not an enormous number. If we start looking for differences for the sake of differences, then we could find that we are down a not particularly productive route.</P>
    <P>Again it is a question which I hope will be aired over and over during this debate, the extent to which and the way in which this House should be different from the other House. This is a political House. It is a House of Parliament. It is, by definition, political and one would expect that the bulk of its Members would be politicians. Again, I would make no excuse for this. I happen to hold the very unfashionable view today, often enunciated by the late Mr. James Dillon, that, as he put it, after the priesthood, politics was one of the most noble of vocations. I genuinely believe that. Politics and the life of politics is about public service and public participation and I certainly would never make any excuse for having had the privilege of being a Member of a House of Parliament or being involved in politics and I do not go with the fashionable dismissal of politicians today.</P>
    <P>Having had the privilege of being a Member of both Houses of Parliament over the past ten years, I have the height <Col N="240" /> of respect for the vast majority of politicians. I certainly would place them on a higher level than many in other professions, other businesses and so forth, in terms of integrity and commitment and a sense of the public good which I find in Members of all parties in both Houses. Of course there are exceptions and, of course, there are people who bring politics into disrepute but when you are talking about the vast majority of politicians they are not the caricatures which we see in some of the satirical programmes, which we see in cartoons or, indeed, which have become part of the public consciousness. The fact that this has become so may well be our own fault in the sense in which maybe we represent ourselves and in which we do our work.</P>
    <P>In any event I see nothing wrong with a Parliament made up largely of politicians. However, there is the question of the panel system and without examining the fundamental of whether it should be there at all or not &mdash; and that is something which I hope will be discussed during the debate as well &mdash; and I would not be at one with the late President de Valera on the institution of the vocational panels and the way in which that was brought about, but if we have the vocational panels, as we have, it would require constitutional reform to change from that. I do not think we are into constitutional reform, we are into reform within what is possible. There is a strong case at present for tightening up the qualifications needed for nomination to many of the panels. If we require a certain expertise, then that expertise must be demonstrable in a way which is not the case at present. We all know that the rules at the moment are too lax and we could look very hard at them. It might not suit some people but if we are serious it is something we should look at very seriously.</P>
    <P>Should we retain the political electorate that I spoke about a moment ago, the county councillors and the city councillors? I would be &mdash; and Senators may say I would; they have always been very decent to me &mdash; a strong supporter, within what is possible, of retaining this <Col N="241" /> particular electorate. There is a certain security in knowing that those who vote for you have themselves been elected. They have had to face an electorate. They have been elected. They are involved in the daily nitty gritty of politics. They see how the laws which are made in both Houses, or indeed the statutory instruments which are not made in either House, operate on the ground. They are the people who are closest to the electorate and closest to the people for whom laws are made. They are familiar with the real problems. I think they are realistic. At least they themselves have their own democratic mandate. I am not sure that you would get &mdash; again within what is possible under the Constitution &mdash; a particularly better electoral college.</P>
    <P>Should nominating bodies &mdash; as Senator Norris has on occasion mentioned &mdash; be allowed to nominate Senators directly? I think that would be a bad idea. We all know how voluntary public organisations can be manipulated by small groups of people, cabals or cliques can take over. They can often be run for small groups of members. Sometimes they are more difficult to get into than an exclusive K club and almost as expensive. You can have a situation where you could have small groups, not particularly accountable, nominating members directly into Parliament. For all their faults the elected representatives can be removed. Some of them are removed at regular intervals. They are democratically accountable. I think having nominating bodies put people in here directly would be elitist in the worst sense of the word. Why should some people, because they are members of the RDS, have the right to nominate a Senator or to be parties to nominating a Senator and somebody who lives down the road who is a member of Irishtown Football Club, not have the same right? Maybe it is not a particularly good example. Maybe there could be areas of expertise but I am not sure why the doctors' union or Liberty Hall should have the right directly to nominate people into a House of Parliament. I do not see that it is better than going <Col N="242" /> through, however imperfect it is, the democratic structure that is there at present. Such a scenario is far more open to manipulation that the present system.</P>
    <P>We might reach a compromise. We might say that nominating bodies might have a certain number of votes in addition to those who already vote on the panels. That may be worth looking at there. Maybe this would inject a new element of thinking and be a compromise between the two views.</P>
    <P>I would like now to look briefly at the question of the university seats. This is a question about which I have a great deal of mixed feelings and thoughts. As we all know, university seats were there historically, in this State at least. First of all, in the Dáil of 1937, they were there largely to ensure that the unionist minority, who could vote for the Trinity TDs, would have a strong unionist presence in the Lower House. The other reason was a total hangover from Britain, that for some reason graduates were better people that non-graduates and because a person had access to third level education they had a greater stake in the country, they had a wiser point of view and so forth and so graduates were given this particular privilege. It was abolished in the Dáil by Mr. de Valera in 1937 but was brought into the Seanad. I find that on any democratic basis it is very difficult to justify the presence of university seats in this House. In fact today most graduates are disfranchised. Graduates of the University of Limerick, Dublin City University, of the Regional Technical Colleges, who have done maybe four or five years of graduate and post-graduate work, do not actually have votes on the university panels. They are disfranchised.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to justify the view that because I am a graduate and Senator Fallon might not be, that in some way I am worthy of two votes in elections and he is worthy of only one. It is a very difficult point to justify. How then do I justify the University presence in this House? I do it in very simple grounds. There have been long years of extremely <Col N="243" /> good representation from the universities. The University Senators, by and large, maybe more than most, have paid their way in this House. Different categories of University Senators have provided a voice for strong minority groups in this House from the late Senator Owen Sheehy-Skeffington to our present President of Ireland, Senator Murphy, Senator Brendan Ryan, Senator Norris, all in their own way, and many others have a distinctive point of view which has been articulated forcefully in this House, which certainly has enriched the House, which has added to the debate. University Senators have, by and large, been extremely conscientious in their attention to the duties of the House and have been among the good Senators in this House. They may not always have found favour with the Government parties of the day. They may have irritated people by their stance on particular issues, but I would be very slow, in spite of my views about the difficulty in democratically justifying Seanad representation here, to argue for any great change there. I would say we certainly should speed up the process of enfranchising those who at least fall within the categories of graduates. I would like to see the system reformed and maybe a little democratic humility from time to time from some of our university colleagues. The university panel has justified its existence and I would be very slow to change.</P>
    <P>The question of the Taoiseach's nominees was raised by Senator Fallon. This is one of the great areas of lost opportunity in this House in particular. It has probably never been used as fully as it should. We all know, being realistic, that there will be party pressures on any Taoiseach which he must live with, but up to the recent election &mdash; and I understand the problems Deputy Haughey had in 1989 &mdash; there was at least an attempt to bring in some distinctive voices from outside politics, most of whom did enrich the work of the House.</P>
    <P>We can look at people like John Robb who is an enormous loss to this House, <Col N="244" /> the voice of civilised unionism in this House, Séamus Mallon, Stephen McGonagle, Bríd Rogers, academics like George Eogan who made a very useful contribution to the last Seanad, people like Éamon de Buitléar, who again made a very valuable contribution and, of course, Dr. Ken Whitaker, who was a very honoured Member of a number of Seanad. When we look at such names we can see the value of using the Taoiseach's nominees in a way that is productive and positive as far as the House is concerned. It is a great pity that it has fallen into disrepair at present. I hope that when next there is an election the then Taoiseach will go back to the old tradition.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that simply putting distinguished people into this House means that they are going to perform very well. We all saw in the last Seanad that there were a number of the Taoiseach's nominees who certainly, to use the business phrase, did not wash their faces. They certainly did not add anything to the debates and simply did not adapt. Perhaps it was not their fault; perhaps one needs a certain sort of personality to be able to adapt and flourish and contribute in this House. Certainly, putting distinguished people in does not automatically ensure a better performance in the House.</P>
    <P>One proposal I would like to make today to Senators concerns the question of emigrant representation. There is a move afoot at present to give the vote to emigrants but I am not sure if it is going to be practical or feasible. There are many problems attached but we could certainly adopt a derivation of the French Senate procedure and allow part of our representation to come from Irish people voting overseas. It would not upset the balance of power in the Dáil but would ensure that emigrants would elect a number of people to this House. Elections could be held and three or four of the Taoiseach's nominations could be filled by emigrant representatives. We talk a great deal about maintaining contact with our Irish community overseas, of building up links, of making them feel <Col N="245" /> they have a voice at home, and would be a practical, symbolic and inexpensive way of ensuring Irish overseas representation in this House. I want to know if we could come up with a definite recommendation on how this principle might be translated into reality and I hope my suggestion finds favour with all groups.</P>
    <P>There has been some recent talk, by Senator Norris in particular, about holding elections to the Dáil and Seanad on the same day. Presumably, the purpose of this suggestion is to force people to opt for one House or the other. I see the point he is trying to make but I do not agree with him. Most other parliamentary systems allow for reasonably easy movement, depending on the will of the electorate, between one House and another. I have had the privilege of being in both Houses and while both have their advantages and disadvantages I find this House infinitely preferable; it is more civilised, debates are better and there is a better atmosphere, but I also learned a great deal during my time in the other House.</P>
    <P>My question to Senator Norris and others is whether this House is worse off because it contains people who have been in the other House and who may want to go back there? Is it a disadvantage to have people like myself, Senator Doyle, Senator Naughten, Senator Cosgrave, Senator Wright, Senator O'Keeffe, Senator Hussey and Senator John Ryan, some of whom may have served as Ministers in the other House? Those of us who have experience in the Dáil, bring that experience with us to this House. It is important to foster a living linkage between the two Houses.</P>
    <P>I do not think that great benefit would accrue if people were forced, arbitrarily, to opt exclusively for either the Dáil or the Seanad. The danger of such a requirement is that the two Houses become over-compartmentalised; and professional Senators emerge, who can build up their own base and live on that and almost cocoon themselves into one House. This would not further Senator Norris' objective of ensuring better representation in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="246" /> One frequently hears well meaning debating societies, chambers of commerce, rotary clubs and so on lament that the second House is party political. Why should it not be party political? Parties are open democratic institutions; they are the fulcrum of our parliamentary system, which would not exist without them. Parties provide the discipline and organisation which makes parliamentary democracy possible. One of the most pressing needs of public life is more people prepared to join political parties and to make use of them to articulate public policy and to change society. The party system is one of the ways open to the ordinary person seeking chance and rather than deprecate the role of political parties in this House I would like to see it enhanced and strengthened.</P>
    <P>A House without parties or in which the party element is greatly diminished could well become a House of prima donnas, of single issue people and we all know what they are like. Life is very comfortable if one has only one issue to pursue and only one constituency to please and to blazes with the rest of the community and society. Without strong party representation we would get single issue people in here in big numbers with no obligation to think about wider political and public interests and re-election for those people would depend upon pleasing the sectoral interest group which elected them originally. It is an appalling prospect.</P>
    <P>I remember as a student being at a debate in the L + H in UCD in 1964. Sean Lemass was Taoiseach, James Dillon was Leader of the Opposition, they were both present at the debate and Garret FitzGerald, then a young economist, was the third speaker, I forget who the fourth speaker was but it was a good line up. Seán Lemass made a statement then which has lived on, that a Dáil full of graduates would be a truly appalling prospect. Likewise, I feel that a Seanad full of special interest people, single issue people university people and so forth with a very weak political party content would be a bad Seanad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="247" /> We must accept and be glad that political parties are there to make parliamentary democracy work. In the early days of the State some people thought, with a certain innocence and naïveté that it would be wonderful if every Dáil issue could be decided on a free vote and indeed it was the hope of Kevin O'Higgins among others at the foundation of the State that we would have an assembly-type democracy where people might come in and make up their minds independently on every issue. However, very quickly it was seen that that would not work. The Government need a dependable majority if policy is going to be pursued in any sort of ordered way; our present structures evolved in response to need although we need to improve them drastically. Becoming a non-party political House as many people outside the House suggest we should not be an advance.</P>
    <P>Earlier I said that we should look at the vocational concept which underlies the composition of our electoral system. There may not be much we can do to change it without changing the Constitution; I am not going to talk about it now but I will listen with interest to other views on the subject.</P>
    <P>Let me mention here a few specific areas where I think reform should be effected. We will be judged, ultimately, on our skill in dealing with legislation; our prime function is to give detailed attention to Bills coming before the House. I disagree with Senator Fallon when he says that we do this very well. On occasion we do; the Environmental Protection Agency Bill is a case in point. I remember the only occasion on which I ever walked out of a House of Parliament in protest was a day here at the beginning of 1989 when there were only about 14 Members in the House because the election had not taken place. That morning Minister Pádraig Flynn came in with a Bill containing 125 sections which was put through within a couple of hours. In the afternoon Minister Albert Reynolds came in with the Central Bank <Col N="248" /> Bill. This was an equally long and complex Bill, all Stages of which were also put through this House in a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>There have been other instances of the guillotine being used in this House and it should be a fundamental principle of the House that the Leader be prepared to sit Friday, Saturday and Sunday in order to debate a Bill properly rather than have recourse to the guillotine. Once we start using the guillotine we are on a slippery slope where the convenience of Government and of Ministers counts for more than our role as Senators and the importance of the legislation. This decline has begun in recent times.</P>
    <P>I am not happy at the way in which our committee work takes place. It might well be expedient that this review look at the possibility of having some legislation placed before public committees of this House where civil servants could be brought along, as has been the case on a number of Bills that have been through the other House in recent times. A special committee could perhaps, be set up to deal with very complex legislation, but for ordinary Members here there is a definite lack of the kind of advisory backup service which would be the norm in any modern parliament. Members need such a service and it should be provided. Why, for example, should I not, as a right have access to the civil servants who draft the Bill, when civil servants are public servants? The Bill is in the public interest and I am a public representative. Why should her or his expertise be available only to the Minister of the day? Why should others not have a right rather than as a favour access to information, explanations and so forth so that there might be some level of equality when we come to examine legislation?</P>
    <P>There is need also, for much greater flexibility when dealing with Private Members' Bills. It was wrong today and on the last day for the Leader of the House to refuse to permit the printing of Private Members' Bills. What harm could that do? On the Order Paper today there is the Interpretation (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, a Suicide Bill, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, <Col N="249" /> the Nuclear Free Zone Bill, the Register of Members of the Oireachtas Interests Bill. All of these address problems that need to be tackled. Whether the Bill as published would be the answer to the problem we do not know as the Bills are not being published. These Bills should be published and there should be, as a right, time for Private Members' Business.</P>
    <P>At present the Government takes a &ldquo;dog in the manager&rdquo; attitude to Private Members' Business. It says, &ldquo;No, you cannot print your Bill&rdquo; and &ldquo;No, we will not address the particular problem.&rdquo; That is an infantile attitude for a modern parliament to adopt. We should insist very strongly on the right to print Private Members' Bills and for a specific time for debating them. The Government do not have to accept the Bill and indeed may disagree in principle with it or have something better to offer, but at least let the Bills be published and debated.</P>
    <P>The amount of time allocated to Private Members' Business is totally inadequate at present. Some weeks there is an allocation of one and a half hours, some weeks none at all, so that a major party like mine will get one or two chances only, a session to address a matter of great importance; this also applies to Independent Senators. I thought that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges had agreed that Private Members' time would be taken in a single block each week for two, two and a half or three hours, so that a complete item of Private Members' Business might be completed weekly instead of carrying it over to the following week. That would be a move towards greater opportunities for debate on Private Members' time; I am certain that much of the trouble we have here on the Order of Business is due to the frustration of many Members at their inability to raise issues about which they feel strongly and for which Private Members' time would provide some sort of outlet. That is a necessary change.</P>
    <P>I come now to the matter of the Adjournment debate. The absence of a Question Time in this House makes the <Col N="250" /> Adjournment debate vital for a Senator seeking information and greater accountability. A queue forms most days to place questions for the Adjournment when a Minister is brought in to account to an elected Member of Parliament for an action or decision; last week the case of Nicky Kelly was raised, sometimes it may be a question about a school, but it is always a matter of public importance where the Minister has some degree of accountability.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why two items may not be dealt with on the Adjournment each night. Most people do not need 20 minutes to make their case; they could make it in ten. Why not have two 15 minute sessions or two 20 minute sessions here each night? We need more slots for Adjournment debates and this reform could be implemented almost at a stroke. If it involves the attendance of two Ministers, that is tough.</P>
    <P>Another important issue that any reform committee must address is the question of debates on European issues. As a Parliament, our handling of European issues has been a national disgrace especially in the other House. We spend little time discussing matters which affect our daily lives substantially. We would all agree that the House needs a strong European dimension. Civil servants might not agree, nor the Department of Foreign Affairs, nor Government Ministers, but anybody who cares a fig for the role of Parliament and for the development of public policy knows that our treatment of European issues has been a disgrace. There is a very simple reform that this House could adopt. It could designate itself European Chamber or a Chamber which will devote a great deal of its time to discussing European issues. European issues encompass matters agricultural, social, educational and so forth. We could give right of audience and access at certain times to members of the European Parliament to enable them to participate in these debates so that there would be linkage between this House and the European Parliament to facilitate the exchange of ideas so that what European delegates learn in the Community can be <Col N="251" /> shared with us and may possibly enrich the debate here. I will be proposing that we examine in detail how we might develop a distinctive European dimension as a House. It could be done without any constitutional change if we resolved to do it.</P>
    <P>Change is also needed regarding flexibility of debate. People sometimes say when they are trying to put politicians down, that the Dáil or Seanad is but a talking shop. I would make no apology for that, it is one of our functions to be such. The derivation of the word &ldquo;Parliament&rdquo; is from the word <i>parler,</i> to talk, to discuss, to sort out differences by talking rather than by war. One of our most important functions is to talk out the great issues of our time. Why should major events be discussed fully on &ldquo;the Gay Byrne Show&rdquo;, or &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;, on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;, in <i>The Irish Times,</i>  in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in every pub and debating society in the country and not in the Houses of Parliament? We need to be a talking shop. It is our job to debate, to get the truth, to air ideas, to lead opinion and to do it not through various appearances or statements from our offices which are included as sound bytes on radio or television, but to do it through reasoned debate using the Chamber for its intended purpose.</P>
    <P>This House has all the time in the world. We have time to sit on Tuesdays or Fridays to allow for the fullest debates possible. We do not need the long breaks which are forced upon us. We could meet in September and we should have been here last September to debate many of the major controversies and scandals happening then.</P>
    <P>I take issue again with the Leader of the House on the question of Northern Ireland which I raised on the Order of Business. It is a disgrace to this House that we have not discussed the issue of Northern Ireland, still the single greatest problem facing this country, in almost a year. What is wrong with us that we are not discussing it? That is what this House should be about. I can discuss Northern Ireland on the Rodney Rice programme, <Col N="252" /> on the Pat Kenny programme, in an article, at a university debating society but in this House where there is a diversity of views I may not say anything worthwhile on that subject. I can see no justification whatsoever for the lack of opportunity to respond to major issues. We need not go chasing after every flavour of the month or become trivial in the pursuit of issues, but we should be able to respond to serious issues.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the role of the Leader of the House. The position involves a good deal of work and heavy responsibility, yet the Leader of the House is not an office holder. He does not have the status and prestige appropriate to that post. The Leader of the House should be given the status and recognition of office holder; I can say this easily from the Opposition benches; Senator Fallon could not say it. Probably everyone in this House would agree that the Leader of the House should have that particular status and if it means paying an appropriate allowance, so be it.</P>
    <P>While looking at reform we should consider links with other parliaments. We do not live in a cocoon here. All of us who have talked to parliamentarians from other countries realise that we all have the same problems. We are all fighting Governments who want to play down the importance of Parliament and with civil servants who want to rule by statutory instrument. We must all be wary of interest groups who would manipulate us. We are all faced with the difficulties of conveying the interests of the public to Government and our own views to the public. We should begin to explore links with other second Chambers in the European Community states build up a series of common meeting places and bonds so that shared experiences may mutually enrich us.</P>
    <P>These are some ideas for reform and others will surface during the course of the debate. When Senator Honan was Cathaoirleach she sought to have the House receive distinguished visiting personalities, which is something we might again raise. She also pioneered the idea of public hearings on certain issues. I am <Col N="253" /> not going to pre-empt what she might say but these ideas should be on the table for any serious debate.</P>
    <P>We have waited too long for this debate; Seanad reform has been talked about for over a decade. The time for waiting has passed. This debate gives us all an opportunity to put forward our ideas and analysis and when it is over the Seanad should set up a small representative committee to process ideas and look at specific proposals from each party within a definite time limit. That committee should then agree upon a set of proposals which, if accepted, would give this House the properties I prevously mentioned as desirable.</P>
    <P>This House must give the public value for money. It has to give itself a realistic role to ensure that our presence here means better legislation, better safeguards of public interest and that matters of major importance are publicly debated. That is quite a small agenda and if this debate helps us to achieve it it will have been worthwile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader of the House for allowing this debate to take place. Senator Manning who has been a colleague of mine for a long time, alluded in his long contribution to other times in this House which were simple times and to great changes which have taken place and to the pressure we find ourselves under today.</P>
      <P>I share the views of many Senators that this House is badly in need of reform. Member of European Parliament, Barry Desmond, tabled on Tuesday about more power for the European Parliament where he wants more openness and debate. We would want to watch how much openness and power continues to be taken from us as elected people of this nation and given to Europe. If we were to talk about reform in the context of Europe taking power from us we would need to do so with a clear head and in a non-party political way; the debate should be open to all of us as individuals without any whip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="254" /> We are elected to the Seanad by a particular method to which Senator Manning referred. It is wrong for some people outside of this House to say that we are not democratically elected because the people that elect us have already been elected by the people of this nation and are quite clearly, therefore, the voice of the people.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning talked about other ways of election to this House. There is one alternative which I have thought about and I will mention it here and in another forum if I am allowed to sit on that forum. I refer to the areas that elect MEPs. I would have to canvass Munster on this issue which would be quite comfortable although I do get support outside of Munster. I do not find criticism of how we are elected wrong and maybe there is an alternative way to elect us.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that this House should be a closed shop. Sometimes the Independent Senators seem to think that Senators who are members of political parties are specially privileged. University Senators enjoy more protection from their electorate than we do. Having said that I would pay tribute to present and past university Senators with whom I have had dealings during my years in this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning suggested that some Senators are cocooned by their membership of the Seanad and have never set their sights on other places. Clearly I would fall into that category. I had a chance to stand for the Dáil: I did not take it. I had a chance to stand for Europe: I did not take it. It is quite clear where my commitment lies. I have never regretted my decision. As a public representative for many years, I am totally committed to the Seanad, which I firmly believe in. Some of us must stand firm and be seen as solid, serving Senators. In the past I have been very critical of people who use this House for a short time and then leave. I may have made that statement in past years when I saw elected Senators, committed to this House, losing their seats on panels to people in their own party who were simply using the House to get back to the Dáil. I felt deeply hurt and my views were <Col N="255" /> quite strong. I suppose that it is a sign that I am either getting old or raving when I can forgive. It is a rare commodity nowadays.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get to you yet. It is in the Programme for Government that this House is to be reformed &mdash; Senator Murphy was confused last week, which rarely happens. They are considering reform in this House and in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The great thing about the Seanad is that, regardless of the many parties and independent Members in this House, it is not subject to party politics. I say that sincerely. In this House, I hope we behave as individuals and the House is the better for it. As Senator Manning said, we have shown we have the skill to deal with legislation. I agree with him also on how little back-up, advice and help we have as Senators. There is so much comment on our salaries and expenses that it should be known that we have just one secretary here in Dublin shared between three rural Senators. That is the back-up we have. At one time there was very little difference between Seanad and Dáil salaries. The division now is around £10,000 or so. That is far too great and it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of recent events in Irish life, which seem to have shaken everybody, no time is more appropriate than this week for a discussion on Seanad reform and what we stand for. I, like most of my colleagues, have confidence in the system and in our two Houses of Parliament. It would be sad for all of us if we were to lose the confidence of the nation this evening, because of recent events. Of course, there is room for improvement in our work, how much we do as Senators and the effectiveness of that work. I worry at times at the extraordinary amount of criticism of this House. It is up to us here to correct that criticism and to put in place the major role that this <Col N="256" /> House should play in the future of the nation.</P>
    <P>Having no Government presence here this evening, the atmosphere for this debate is more relaxed.</P>
    <P>Between ourselves we should debate, whether in committee form or otherwise, how the House will proceed when this debate is over. Only we can reform this House. When we discussed the matter some time ago, I was of the opinion that the three hour debate on motions in this House should not be broken into two one and a half hour debates again. Senator Manning made reference to this. I considered that to be crazy because there was no continuity in what colleagues had said. I understood that it was agreed at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that the three hour debate would take place on one day. That has not been established. I support Senator Manning and ask, as we both seem to be on the same wavelength, that it should be established immediately.</P>
    <P>In recent years and particularly now I cannot understand why there is no Question Time in this House. I do not mean a photocopy of what happens in the Dáil, but, to have relevance to the country and to the nation that we represent, we should be able to discuss serious matters which arise quite quickly. I would ask the Government to look at this also. Perhaps Ministers did not want to come in here for a Question Time which would be the same as in the Dáil and just a repeat of what had happened in that House. It could be quite different.</P>
    <P>The Government programme on Oireachtas reform, speaks of extended sittings of the House, extra sessions and a return to committees. It states:</P>
    <P>In future, suitable Bills will be dealt with at Committee Stage by a select committee and debates in the Dáil on these Bills will be confined to Second Stage and Report Stage. Streamlined voting procedures in committee will be introduced, so that there is minimum interruption in the flow of business.</P>
    <P>While I would support the idea of some Bills going to committee. I have seen, at <Col N="257" /> first hand, the advantage of Bills being taken by select committees. Members of this House who sat on those select committees came to the House with an extraordinary amount of knowledge to debate the Bills when we did take them here. I hope when the Government reform of the Oireachtas takes place they have select committees of Members of the Seanad as well as the Dáil.</P>
    <P>We have, of course, an inbuilt Government majority in this House which gives it a unique character in that the Government cannot be beaten because of the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. Therefore, we have less drama here than there is in the Dáil. They are biting their nails five minutes before the bell rings, wondering whether they are voting with us or against us, or whether we are voting with them or against them. The Seanad has very little such drama so there is less tension here. The late chief, Eamon de Valera, was right in his judgement on such activity. We work hard at valuable debate, with less party scoring off each other.</P>
    <P>I have also witnessed here in the Seanad in the past two years at least one Minister prepared to accept amendments in this House. We should have more of that. I ask the current Ministers and indeed future Governments &mdash; whatever their composition might be &mdash; to accept more amendments &mdash; not just Government amendments. We also have a calmer atmosphere in this House and more time to give to Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I want to put down a marker here this evening as a person in public life for quite a number of years and in this House since 1977. We have ourselves to blame for not being relevant to the people outside. Over the years we have allowed people outside this House to take from us some of the powers and decision making that should have been ours. There are people who make themselves kingmakers, who have never stood for election to any position. Self-placed people in top posts, never elected to anything, are laying down the law for all. We have seen this in the past year, and perhaps in recent weeks more than ever before. Perhaps <Col N="258" /> we, who have been elected, should take a hard look at whether we are to blame for allowing these people to take power which should belong to us. We have stood back and allowed this to happen and certainly the founders of this nation, on all sides &mdash; I am talking of a time before splits occurred, after the fight for freedom &mdash; never intended that to happen.</P>
    <P>The two Houses of Parliament, the elected Members of the Seanad and the Dáil and the county councillors, those elected by the people, should be the decision-makers in this country, and not anyone outside. It is happening more so now, with European directives and regulations. It is happening while we are here thinking we still have a hold on things. We have king-makers on the one hand and Europe dictating on the other hand. This is why we have lost some of the respect of our people which we must together try to recover. Since I was very young I have firmly believed in the political life of this nation. I believe in the political system of this country and serve it with great joy. Only by working together vigorously with no one standing in our way, can we get back the confidence of the people to continue to legislate for them.</P>
    <P>This House could play a very important role as a watchdog on EC legislation. We have not had enough debate on what is happening in Europe. If we are not informed and do not have sufficient debate on the decisions being made in Europe, what chance have the people outside this House of being brought up to date on what is going on there?</P>
    <P>It has also been said that we are supposed to apologise for being members of a political party. I, for one, will never apologise for being a member of the party I belong to. I am a bit worried at times whether it is quite the same but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will never apologise for being a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and I do not see that it ever stopped me, Whips or no Whips, Leaders or no <Col N="259" /> Leaders from saying what I had to say. I have always felt I had the freedom to say and act as an individual while hoping, at the same time that I was behaving in a responsible fashion. I can understand the independence of some people serving in public life. Some Senators seem to think they are above me because I am a member of a political party elected by ordinary county councillors. I do not see them in that fashion. I would like them to see me as an equal, if only in the political arena. They may not do so in other circles but that does not worry me. Some of the people who served in this House from all political parties, were giants, no matter how you would judge them, in their stand, their decisions, in all they stood for and the respect in which they were held.</P>
      <P>In dealing with Bills here we have a tradition of careful revision. Perhaps that is done by only a small number of Senators, but it is important that it is done. When I was Cathaoirleach we looked at our Standing Orders and I had many meetings to discuss some of the Standing Orders that needed changing. I would welcome more parliamentary committees and I would certainly welcome more debate on relevant national issues. It is sad that one of the institutions of this young nation should at times come in for such criticism and it is up to us to prove to those critics that their criticism is ill-informed. I am proud to be a Member of this House. I hope that we will set up a committee to carry out some of the reforms that are urgently needed to stop this criticism. Perhaps some of the proposals made today, or referred to, will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was the Seanad that initiated the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Oireachtas. This is important and may not be widely known. I attended that first meeting, and there was very little enthusiasm for broadcasting the business of either House. Both Houses are broadcast now and everyone is delighted. Some of those who are delighted now with the televising of their statements and who watch with great care at 11.15 p.m. were not <Col N="260" /> so enthusiastic at the first meeting when we moved that the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be televised. However, we got our way. It is a great programme and the whole nation is watching it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Taoiseach's 11 nominees. There is reason for certain members of the party to be so nominated. In the past we had people like Séamus Mallon, Ken Whitaker, Brian Friel, John Robb, Chris Kirwan and Michael Mullen. I saw and served with all those men, and with Bríd Rogers. They were good Senators. We needed them here. This was the forum that suited them and they added to this House, I regret that we have not even one of them here today. That is for another day. I hope the appointment of the eleven will not be for another few years.</P>
    <P>I referred to king-makers thinking that they have all the power and that is our own fault that this happens. It is a deadly serious matter that, on 26 October 1991, the head of a State body, making a statement at a function, &ldquo;surprised his audience by offering a definition of politicians; they are people who sit on the fence while keeping their ears very close to the ground&rdquo;. The present head of a State body made that statement this evening. He would not have made it if &ldquo;Dev&rdquo; or Lemass were Taoiseach or he certainly would not be in the job this evening. It is our responsibility to see that such statements are not made by people holding such positions.</P>
    <P>Let us now move forward as a meaningful Seanad. The commencement of this debate has been sensible I would hope some of the points I have made will be taken up at another time. I hope that when this debate is over that we will not have a long delay before carrying out whatever is to be done. It is not good enough if the Leader allows us to say how sincerely we feel about Seanad reform if, when the debate is over, nothing is done about it. I hope the follow-up from today will come on-stream shortly. I do not know whether the Cathaoirleach or the Leader of the House intends to put this matter to the Committee on Procedure <Col N="261" /> and Privileges or to another committee. I think it should go to a committee to find the best way to reform this House and make it more relevant to the people outside.</P>
    <P>Regardless of recent events and all the headlines perhaps every politician has not lost the respect or the support of the people. Recently in the local government elections I saw that strong, committed councillors, in spite of the atmosphere in which they were campaigning, had held the respect of the people they serve. Every Member here now could make the same statement, but people are concerned that we should not pass on to others the responsibilities which are absolutely ours. We have allowed it to happen and before it is too late we should get together and reverse the process. I say that as a person dedicated and committed to politics. I never apologise to anyone, I hope I will not have to in the future, for serving in public life. It is a profession I am proud to be associated with. Together we should go on and prove to the people looking at us that it is as good a profession as any other. These hurlers on the ditch who could be named, who criticise us week in, week out, and make little of us at times, have never even been elected to a confraternity. They do not have the guts to put their name on a ballot paper. I hope to be allowed to continue to serve for some years to come. I appeal to the Leader of the House or to whoever has responsibility, to set the process of reform under way immediately this debate is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">

      <P>I would like to congratulate both Senator Manning and Senator Honan on their contributions. Both of them are committed Members of this House; indeed, I have paid tribute to Senator Honan for her single-minded commitment to this House. If I have, at times in the past spoken disparagingly, perhaps in public discussion, about the calibre of representation in the political parties in this House, on more mature reflection I would like to qualify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> I am very proud to be a University Senator. Senator Manning was kind enough to talk about the contribution made from this side of the House, but whatever contribution we have made it is possible only because of the existence of political parties. In a sense we are a luxury here, a luxury of which, perhaps, our colleagues should be glad, but we certainly would not be able to perform if the whole House consisted of University graduates. The work of political parties here, reformed or unreformed, is absolutely indispensable. Indeed, Edmund Burke two centuries ago virtually claimed that the operation of democracy would be impossible without the work of political parties.</P>
    <P>Much has changed over those two centuries, but the existence of political parties is absolutely essential for the operation of our democracies. As has been implied by the two previous speakers, that is a point that must be hammered home to the public. If they are cynical about politicians at the present time, then it is their job perhaps to tell that to the politicians, or perhaps even to elect better politicians; but to extend a curse to the whole assembly of politicians is like saying &ldquo;The air is polluted; therefore we will not breathe it any more&rdquo; when the solution is of course to improve the quality of the air. So, I begin by paying perhaps a belated tribute to the party politicians in this House who carry forward the business of Government and the business of opposition and who are charged with that responsibility. It could be said that we University Senators in a way have influence perhaps without ultimate responsibility except to see ourselves being re-elected, which perhaps in my case does not arise again but sin scéal eile.</P>
    <P>I would like to begin the sustantive contribution by referring once again, as I did last week briefly on the Order of Business, to the revised Programme for Government agreed by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, published perhaps elsewhere but the full text was in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday week, 19 <Col N="263" /> October. By the way, I referred to the Progressive Democrats in this House as &ldquo;cuckoos&rdquo;. I am aware the word &ldquo;cuckoo&rdquo; is used in a general disparaging sense; it is a mildly disparaging term of abuse. But I meant it pretty accurately in the sense of Members who come into a nest which they have not built, and which indeed is their sworn purpose to abolish, but nonetheless they nestle down in the nest for their own purposes in the interim. I think that is pretty good analogy between the Progressive Democrats and the legendary cuckoo.</P>
    <P>When I suggested that, there was no mention of Seanad reform, in the revised Programme for Government. Senator Dardis countered that by suggesting that the text clearly makes reference to Oireachtas reform and, therefore, within Oireachtas reform, he says, obviously the Seanad is included. I understood Senator Honan more or less to say the same thing a while ago.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the fairly substantial part of the programme as published which deals with parliamentary reform specifies only Dáil reform; the Seanad is not mentioned at all. I would have thought that, if there were people in Government really committed to looking at legislative reform in its totality, they would have mentioned Seanad Éireann and I think its omission is very significant.</P>
    <P>There are quite detailed provisions in that section for parliamentary reform. For example, there is talk about extending the sitting hours of the Dáil, of having a select committee handling Committee Stage of a Bill in the Dáil. The reference to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges throughout that section is, in fact, a reference to the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges. Once again there is a reference to the facilities for topical debates but all the references are specifically to the Dáil. In that context of detail, the omission of all reference to the Seanad is all the more significant.</P>
    <P>The Government, the programme says, are determined to speed up progress in this legislative programme. It goes on <Col N="264" /> to refer to reform of Oireachtas procedures and it gives a long list of Bills which it proposes to introduce. It does not say anywhere that those Bills, or some of those Bills, are to be introduced in Seanad Éireann. More than once the Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, has expressed his sincerity in working for the initiation of legislation in this House. He said that he and Senator Wright work hard towards that end. Why then did they not make representations to the Government when a programme was being negotiated providing for, among other things, parliamentary reform? Why did not Senator Fallon and his colleagues use their influence with the Government negotiators to say &ldquo;Look, it is a very important part in parliamentary reform that you mention Seanad Éireann specifically&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I think it is necessary to explain what I said last week and to back up my allegation that the omission of Seanad Éireann in the revised programme is a clear admission of lack of interest in Seanad Éireann on the part of the Government partners. The revised programme is very much a Progressive Democrat programme. There are all kinds of things like jobs, tax reform, abolition of ministerial pensions, a European affairs committee, national lottery reform but it is well known that all this is Progressive Democrats party policy. They succeeded in getting a great deal of it on to the revised Programme for Government. If that is so, then the absence of any mention of Seanad reform, it seems to me, is also due to Progressive Democrats influence. It is perhaps no coincidence that the Progressive Democrats are absent from today's debate. I know that if the Leas-Chathaoirleach were listening he would probably chide me for referring to absent individuals, but, in fact, I am referring to an absent party; and I think their absence is a clear indication of their lack of interest in this House.</P>
    <P>One of the most fundamental questions in which we sitting Senators should be interested is: what is the Government's intention with regard to this <Col N="265" /> House? Why did they not mention it in the programme? Are the Progressive Democrats remaining silent on this issue because it does not suit them at present to push it? They cannot have their way in everything obviously. They have tasted the sweets of office, their power in this House, and it is very much to their liking. Perhaps there is a moratorium on their clearly expressed policy to abolish this House. Perhaps it will come around in the next heave, but in the meantime I have to say I greatly regret that the Government have no policy on this House. They simply are glad it exists as an area of patronage.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Progressive Democrats now recognise something I pointed out a long time ago: the constitutional difficulty of abolishing this House. This House cannot be abolished without disemboweling the Constitution, and those who talk in a facile way about getting rid of Articles 18 and 19 of Bunreacht na hÉireann should have looked much further into many other references to Seanad Éireann which are stitched into the Constitution and which makes it impossible to abolish this House without a new Constitution. Is that what the Progressive Democrats are waiting for? One way or the other, it seems to me the minor party in Government, who are far from minor in terms of influence, have no interest in Seanad reform.</P>
    <P>We talked about all this not so long ago. Partly in response to the Progressive Democrats clamour for abolition of the Seanad, Senator Ross and I put down a motion which was taken beginning on 3 June 1987 and which called on the Government to carry out an urgent review of the powers and functions of the Seanad and the methods of election of its Members. All that debate can be read in the issues of the Official Report following that date, 3 June 1987, Volume 116, No. 5, and subsequent issues. That debate went on for quite some time. There was a Minister present on that occasion, Deputy Flynn, Minister for the Environment, but he made a totally non-commital contribution. In effect, he kicked for touch as it were. Since in that <Col N="266" /> debate and in other debates I spoke at length on the subject, I do not propose to repeat what I said there. The most fundamental question of all, of course, is: are the Progressive Democrats right? Does this country need a second House? It must be said that there are very strong arguments for abolition, very strong arguments that this country does not really need a second House, particularly if the Dáil were doing its business properly, that it is too small and too poor to need a second House.</P>
    <P>When I was not in this House &mdash; that is the long period from 1983 to 1987 when I was absent because of a regrettable lapse of judgment on the part of the electorate &mdash; I did have some doubts about the justification for the existence of this House. It can be put very simply and it is a very broad political point and I do not want to dwell in it: second Chambers are very desirable, if not absolutely necessary, where you have a federal constitution, &mdash; as in the United States, for example &mdash; where it is highly important that the small states feel that their contribution to major matters is as valid as that as the hugely populated states. In that situation the Senate becomes the more powerful of the two Houses. It may well be that, as the European Community develops and as the smaller countries feel the lack of their own political clout through their very small numerical representation, the case will grow for a second House in the European Parliament and that the Twelve or, as they will become eventually, many, many more, will introduce a second House to compensate for that numerical disproportion as it were.</P>
    <P>Outside of those two cases it seems to me there is great force in what the Abbé Sieyés said at the close of the French Revolution and in the Napoleonic period and indeed, no man was better able to make a judgment, having lived through and under a bewildering succession of constitutions. What the Abbé Sieyés said about a second House was: &ldquo;If it simply confirms the work of the first Chamber it is superfluous; if it attempts to contradict or contend against the work of the first <Col N="267" /> Chamber it is pernicious&rdquo;. We can say there are examples of countries which abolished their Senate because it was superfluous &mdash; New Zealand, for example. Denmark abolished its second chamber for the second of the Abbé Sieyés reasons, because it felt that the second chamber was pernicious. Indeed, Mr. de Valera abolished the Seanad in 1934 because it was pernicious in his view and was working against the democratically elected first House.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about it. The very existence of a second House has to be justified. We have to advance very strong arguments in order to justify its existence, particularly in a country as small and as poor as this. Let us face it also: the whole grand vocational dream has not really worked out. This would be an ideal House and an ideal supplement to the work of the Dáil, and well worth the money spent on it, if the theory of the Constitution were reality, if the Members here were all experts in their particular fields and had no axe to grind except bringing their vocational expertise to the work of legislation. But we all know that is not so and that is not the way it worked out.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning went over some of that ground today and picked up in detail many of the reasons why it did not work out. He made a contribution which was distinguished for its scholarly knowledge as well as for its political experience. He dealt with some of the stock accusations made against the House as it stands. For example, we all know that in many cases Seanad seats are held out as compensation for failure in the Dáil or an award for long political service to parties or a springboard for a comeback to the Dáil. When I say Seanad seats are given, I mean that the electorate is so restricted that in certain cases one's chances of being elected are very high indeed if one has party favour and party sanction.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Norris I would maintain that one essential reform would be that Dáil and Seanad should be elected on the same day so that a choice would have to be made. This does not mean that the <Col N="268" /> Seanad would not be political but its politicians would clearly have opted for this House and would not be forever hankering after the other House. I felt that was about the weakest point of Senator Manning's contribution. It is a point which Senator Dooge raised as well in an essay, which I recommend to the House, called <i>The Role of the Seanad</i> which was published in a volume called <i>Essays and Memory of Alexis FitzGerald,</i> a distinguished late Member of this House, edited by Patrick Lynch and James Meenan and published by the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland, 1987. In that essay Senator Dooge&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that. The former Senator Dooge held all kinds of office in this House &mdash; Cathaoirleach, Leas-Chathaoirleach, Leader of the Government, Leader of the Opposition. The essay is well worth reading but again I thought, rather like Senator Manning's contribution today, a bit unconvincing on that particular point. What former Senator Dooge says is that it is a good thing that you have in Seanad Éireann people who have been in Dáil Éireann, people who have had ministerial experience perhaps. They can bring all that to the House. Senator Manning spoke about the intermingling of both Houses, that that was a good thing, that we were not really watertight Chambers but he knows as well as I know &mdash; and he himself is a beneficiary of this delayed nomination procedure &mdash; that many of the Members come here as a second best and have itchy feet to get back to the Dáil. In fact, they make no secret about it from time to time. For instance, congratulations are offered to officers of Seanad Éireann on their promotion to <Col N="269" /> Dáil Eireann. In regard to the former Clerk of the Seanad who is now Clerk of the Dáil, on that occasion I remember that many of the Members expressed their hope they would soon follow him to that place of bliss, etc. It is that atmosphere, I think, which is very bad for this House and which degrades the House, the fact that members do not come to it full of enthusiasm for their period of service here. They use the facilities of the House in order to make their comeback. I certainly would agree with Senator Norris that if the quality of this House is to improve an essential reform is to have elections on the same day so that people will have to make a clear choice.</P>
      <P>I followed Senator Manning very closely in his argument to have Members elected directly from vocational bodies. It was suggested, by the way, by the Seanad Electoral Reform Commission, 1959, that at least some of the Members, some of the 43, would be directly nominated, direct representatives of vocational bodies. Senator Manning suggests that this is elitist, and I think I agree. I do not necessarily object to a political electorate. I do not particularly object to the idea that the majority of Senators here are elected by people who are themselves politicians. The political business of the House must be done; otherwise this House would be meaningless, where it would be some kind of advisory body which did not have an integral part in the legislative process. I would be totally opposed to that.</P>
      <P>This House, while it need not necessarily duplicate the procedures of the other House &mdash; and that is a reason why I am sorry that the revised programme did not give all this more attention &mdash; certainly will have to be involved in legislation and certainly there will have to be a Government majority in this House. All that is true. But I have an open mind about the electoral method. I would like to see some direct representation from vocational bodies because only in that way can we restore the truly vocational nature of this Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning suggested that this House could also be the place where the <Col N="270" /> emigrant interests could be represented. Well, I have to put it on record here that I think the idea of emigrant representation is one of these fashionable things floating around, like sexual harassment. It is the flavour of the hour. People suddenly bring in emigrants or imaginary sexual grievances of 20 or 25 years ago because it is just the cant at the moment. Emigrants, unfortunately, are an eternal blot on our system of Government and so on, but I cannot see what useful purpose would be served by having lobbies of people who live in another country &mdash; by the way, I represent the plight, if you like, in which we all are: I have two daughters in the United States &mdash; but I am not in favour of people in another country who pay their taxes elsewhere, who have their whole existence in that country, purporting to be part of another country. In fact, much of the agitation for emigrant representation is a political gimmick. It would benefit certain parties in this State a lot more than others, and God only knows how it could be regulated, where you would draw the line, or what time limit you would give to an emigrant. Therefore, I am not particularly interested in that.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, I fully agree with Senator Manning when he says that the Seanad is an ideal Chamber for giving us a badly needed European dimension. I think it was Mary Banotti who brought this question up again the other day and I certainly think that the House would benefit from direct reports from our Members of the European Parliament back to this House and illuminate the appalling ignorance indeed in which we have been kept, deliberately almost, by Government decision not to have an Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs. As well as that, it would be most appropriate were we to use the House to welcome foreign statesmen. I know we have done so, but they generally have sat silently in the Visitors' Gallery when in fact it would enliven and dignify the proceedings of the House were we to decide that such people would be welcome to address us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="271" /> At the outset I talked about the University Senators' role <i>versus</i> the role of the party politician and how I wanted to make it clear that I have a high regard for the role of the party politicans, who are indispensable really. I am not sure whether we can defend the whole idea of University representation at the moment. Clearly, it is anomalous in view of the growth of third level colleges at quite a quick rate in the last several years. Indeed, it was the President, formerly Senator Robinson, who in her contribution in that summer 1987 debate on reform of the Seanad pointed out that her own <i>alma mater</i> and her own constituency at that time of Trinity College, Dublin, was not such a rotten borough as would appear at first sight because it was drawing in all kinds of third level colleges under its aegis, those who are by extension graduates of Trinity and who will make that constituency much more representative than if it had been left to the campus in College Green. The same is true of UCD and of the NUI. Already within the aegis of the two existing constituencies the electorate there is being broadened and democratised slightly but I readily concede the force of the argument which says it is totally unacceptable that, for example, the graduates of the new University of Limerick and Dublin City University should not be represented. I fully support Senator Jackman's insistent plea that the franchise be extended there.</P>
    <P>The question is: where do we go on from there? Is it logical not to give this elitist franchise, if you like, to the nursing profession, for example, to anybody who does a further course of study? Why should it be a university degree? Where do you draw the line? That is a question to which nobody has actually given any detailed thought. If the Seanad were otherwise vocationally reformed and returned to its pristine vocational idea, then the Universities would fit very well into that general background.</P>
    <P>Obviously, I accept both what Senator Fallon and Senator Manning said about the limitations of what can be done. <Col N="272" /> Senator Fallon said we must be realistic, that the Dáil is the superior House, though by some strange quirk of expression we call it the Lower House. There can be no question but that Seanad Éireann, however reformed, has to be in the second place as it were. Indeed, I think Deputies themselves would very jealously guard their proper role as direct representatives of the people. That is one reason, I suggest, maybe a subconscious reason, why there may be a reluctance to give this house a higher profile. The Dáil would be concerned and, of course, all the Ministers are themselves &mdash; at the moment anyway &mdash; all Dáil Deputies would be concerned that this House should not get above itself; it should not get uppity, so to speak. I fully accept that.</P>
    <P>I also accept what Senator Manning said, in considerable detail, about the way in which the role of Parliament has ever been more restricted through the growth of all kinds of extra parliamentary power, such as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as an example; the initiatives in social partnership, which is kind of a neo-corporatism, something I had not thought about until he said it; and the further whittling down of parliamentary power by the enormous importance of the media, by the European Parliament, by the general loss of sovereignity etc. We have to take all that as read, as it were, but within that there is still great scope for reform in this House.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator Manning was a bit disingenous when he said that it is up to ourselves to initiate reform. &ldquo;Ourselves&rdquo; is somewhat a disingenuous word in this context. &ldquo;Ourselves&rdquo; means the Government party as well as the Opposition and the Independents, and that part of &ldquo;ourselves&rdquo; does not necessarily want to reform the House. Senator Conroy does, I am quite sure, as another committed Senator, and Senators Fallon and Honan; but they are not, as far as I know, the &ldquo;heavies&rdquo; in the Government, in the political establishment. When Senator Manning says it is up to ourselves to reform the House, I would reply to that by saying there is only so much that we can do here. <Col N="273" /> We can agree to extended sitting hours and to some form of Question Time, although I accept Senator Fallon's reservations about lack of ministerial accountability to this House. There are all kinds of things we can improve on. One of the reasons there is a fuss on the Order of Business and sometimes a lot of peacock strutting is due to frustration because people want to bring up topical matters and as yet, there is no provision for doing that in the same way as now in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I want to come back to the point that government is central to reform. There is no such thing as a self-reforming Seanad. All Governments have treated this House with contempt when they want business done. I often think it is instructive that the former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was genuinely anxious to reform Seanad Éireann. It was one of his eager crusading enterprises before the hard life got to him. What he came up against, of course, was that there are powerful vested interests which do not want this House reformed. Yet, it must be reformed because, as Senator Honan and Senator Manning suggested, there is a very critical audience out there, a very critical public. Senator Honan drew attention to the undesirable criticism in many ways that this House gets but there is also a considerable amount of ignorance and apathy about the role of this House. If the Dáil is beginning to be almost only barely credible or acceptable to public opinion because of various factors, then we have to work even harder.</P>
    <P>I agree with other points such as the single issue Senator but I am not really aware of any single issue Senator at the moment. It was suggested that such a person made no real contribution to the business of the House. It is interesting, for example, that Senator Norris, whose interest in homosexual reform is perhaps the most prominent issue associated with him, is always at pains to point out that he wished to God that this issue was out of the way so that he could get on to the 101 other things which interest him. I <Col N="274" /> agree with Senator Manning on that point.</P>
    <P>While I am not altogether making a swansong here &mdash; I am very interested in and committed to this House &mdash; I have a fundamental conviction that the Progressive Democrats are out there beavering away, latching on to a fairly popular perception about this House. They would not have suggested the abolition of Seanad Éireann unless they knew they had considerable support for it. The stark alternative before us is, reform or abolition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardConroy" hpid="Professor Conroy Professor Conroy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Conroy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened on this and many other occasions to Senator Murphy right back to 1977 I would be very sorry indeed &mdash; although we have crossed swords on more than one occasion &mdash; if his talents and contributions were lost to the Seanad. He illustrates in many ways the importance of the Seanad and the role of this part of the Oireachtas, a role which is very different from that of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The Dáil is, as many Senators said, the direct representation of electors in relation to legislation. Let us face it. We are here as a Parliament to endeavour as best we can, with all our human and other failings, to see that the best possible legislation is devised, examined and finally promulgated for the good of the people as a whole. This House gives time for reflection; for a second look at legislation. It gives the opportunity under political, but not quite so acutely political, circumstances for a Government to change their mind or modify a Bill. We saw quite recently in the Environmental Protection Agency Bill the Seanad playing a very significant and worthwhile role in relation to legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I first came into the Seanad I had no idea &mdash; rather like the mass of people in this country &mdash; of the role which the Seanad played. I still retain the impression I had then. It plays a very valuable role in the life of this country in ensuring that we get much better legislation than we would otherwise. I have listened to people such as Ken Whitaker Eoin Ryan, Alexis FitzGerald and a <Col N="275" /> Minister being cross-examined during the Committee Stage of a Bill and it is a far more searching examination than he or she is ever likely to face in the Dáil. I mean no disrespect whatsoever to the Dáil but the circumstances are very different. Our legislation has benefited from the presence of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I would like to see many more Bills coming through the Seanad. Let us face it: many Bills are not really party political in any sense. They are Bills which any sensible or reasonable Government would put forward. There is a lot to be said for these Bills being examined in this House. We are a political House. I say with great respect to my colleague, and I will cross swords slightly with him immediately, not all University Senators are non-party Senators. Quite a few of them have been politically involved in parties. It gives an opportunity for Bills to be subjected to a really searching analysis and we all know of instances where Bills have been greatly improved.</P>
    <P>Moving to the election of the Seanad, it was devised in 1937 in a totally different political climate from that which exists today. It was very much the era of the corporate State when people on all sides of the various divides were urging strongly that there should be vocational representation. There are good arguments for this. Nonetheless, in practical terms it would be extraordinarily difficult to see that each and every vocational interest were represented in this Seanad, desirable though that might be in many ways.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the actual forms of election to the Seanad and the panels. They give a general division and there is no doubt that even though there may not be a direct vocational representation, anyone coming through on any of the general panels usually is somebody who has very considerable experience or knowledge in relation to vocational matters and is very often directly involved with some particular vocational body, in my own case, the CII. In the case of a number of Labour Senator colleagues it is with various unions. There is a very <Col N="276" /> considerable expert input into this Seanad which might not necessarily be readily available in the other House. A Deputy has an enormous constituency work load. I am sure we have all met our good colleagues from across the water. I remember one of them boasting to me, he was a very strong constituency man, he said. He went down at least one day a month to visit his constituency. You would last here I suppose about one weekend in any party if you visited your constituency once a month as a Deputy.</P>
    <P>We operate under very different circumstances and there is an enormous work load on Deputies no matter what party they belong to. This makes it extremely difficult for them, for example, in relation to doing home work, reading up on legislation and getting advice on it. That is compounded by a fact which is one of the disgraces of this Legislature, both in the Dáil and Seanad, that there is an almost total and absolute lack of research back-up facilities. I do not see any excuse for that whatsoever. It is in nobody's interest and it is greatly to the detriment of the ordinary citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>Despite that fact, and here the Seanad comes into its own to some considerable extent, people out of their own dedication and determination make it their business to do a great deal of non-political work, often at times unrecorded by the media, perhaps unnoticed and not immediately politically rewarding &mdash; at times you might say they might be better off from a political sense doing other things &mdash; but nonetheless in all parties there are many members who spend a great deal of time working to ensure that we have whatever knowledge they can assemble together to make serious contributions to these debates.</P>
    <P>I am enormously impressed and indeed humbled at times by the extraordinary high quality of virtually every contribution I hear in this Seanad. It compares more than favourably with Legislatures elsewhere. It is exceptionally impressive.</P>
    <P>The Seanad election is perhaps the toughest election of the lot and it is also <Col N="277" /> the most educational. As the Chair and I well know, by the time you go through the country, visit people, have a cup of tea and listen and discuss things you learn a lot you would not learn sitting up here in Kildare Street. It should be compulsory for every Minister to go on a Seanad campaign under the general panels. It would be highly beneficial. No disrespect to them, but we all learn by it. It is a very tough campaign.</P>
    <P>As regards the universities, yes it is illogical but it was not illogical in its time. It was necessary that through the university mechanism, you were able to ensure that a certain minority were <i>de facto</i> ensured parliamentary representation. That was very important. Now it is a changed world but nonetheless it played its role in its time and is to some extent still relevant, though very much less so. You get all sorts of anomalies, for example, people in the University of Limerick do not have a vote and those in another university have a vote.</P>
    <P>There are no university Members present at the moment and perhaps one should not comment when people are not here, but there are times when I would not necessarily agree entirely with some of the expressions and views of our colleagues from the university panels. Nonetheless they express views that are held, often minority views and, at times, unpopular views. Sometimes they are populist views. At times views are expressed which need to be expressed or which need to be given an opportunity for expression in the Legislature and the university provides that forum. However, it needs to be reformed. I am not speaking on behalf of the university system. I have never been elected on the university panels. I have no intention of going on them; indeed, I am not sure if I would be entitled to go on one. They have had a number of representatives who have made a very big contribution to this House.</P>
    <P>The third group are the Taoiseach's nominees. It is entirely right and proper that the Taoiseach of the day should have an opportunity to put a number of people in the House and not just for the sake <Col N="278" /> of giving the Government a majority. I wonder at times if it might not be better all round if &mdash; I hope it is not going to occur in the next year or two &mdash; there were Government defeats in the Seanad. It would be a healthier Legislature. In the Dáil they can have it on a purely direct party political basis but a little more latitude in the Seanad would be to everyone's benefit including ultimately the Government's.</P>
    <P>I take the point that the Taoiseach of the day should have the right to nominate people, for a number of reasons. There are gifted people in this House, some of whom have been mentioned already by Senators Manning, Honan and others. It is excellent that there should be some way of bringing into the Legislature people who might never be elected through the other system or who might not want to be. We could all name people who have graced this House and not only that but made a serious contribution to it. It should be the right of the Government to nominate people. There are very good people in parties who for one reason or another fail to get a seat and it is right that there should be the possibility of a nomination for them. I do not really see why, if we looked at things slightly differently, there should not be at least some possibility of one or more of those nominations going to the far side of the House. It is invidious that it is entirely Government people who are elected by any Government group. That is fine for the Dáil but for this House we could have a little latitude. That may be a minority view but I am not altogether sure that if it became the tradition it might not be a healthy tradition.</P>
    <P>It should be possible, as indeed Taoisigh have from time to time, to nominate somebody whom they want to make a Minister. One example was former Senator Dooge who was an outstanding Minister for Foreign Affairs. Mr. Moynihan was on another occasion appointed a Minister by another Taoiseach. Let us be quite clear about it. Ministers and Ministers of State as a rule should come from the Dáil. That is what is appropriate. That is what is right and necessary <Col N="279" /> but this House would benefit greatly if there was a tradition that perhaps one Minister and two Ministers of State were appointed from the Seanad as a rule, not just as an exception by one Taoiseach but as a normal procedure. If that were to happen there would be a little more balance between the two Chambers.</P>
    <P>There should be someway in which topical matters and questions could be raised in this House. With great respect to colleagues on all sides, and I am not lacking in guilt in this respect, the Order of Business used to be a very orderly and relatively brief affair. I am not convinced that the present developments, understandable though they may be, add anything to this House.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the idea that Senators should in some sense represent Euro-constituencies. We are a very small community. We are not trying to represent Ulster-Connacht, Munster or Dublin city. We are supposed to be contributing in a national sense. It is very educational for someone like myself who is from Dublin to travel all over the country. It would be far better for us all to do that. This House and its Members make a major contribution. There are improvements we could make without Government intervention. I agree with Senator Murphy that reform is necessary. If we do not start putting our heads together and proposing reforms it will probably be done for us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree largely with the contributions made by Senators Murphy and Conroy. There are a number of questions to address and it is on how we address them that the function and usefulness of this House depends. It could be said that it is either a question of the abolition of this House or the reform of the House. Listening to Senator Murphy it would be a shame to lose him from the political arena. I was sorry to hear him say that he thought this might be his last term here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed the Progressive Democrat Senators are not here and did <Col N="280" /> not participate in the debate. The question of abolition or reform of the Seanad is a live issue and it is a cop-out on their part not to be in the House. They are on record as seeking to abolish this House. We could benefit from them making an appearance, putting on record what their position is in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Murphy said that the House could be either pernicious or superfluous and that in either of those events we did not need this House. I imagine that had the Oireachtas come into existence at a different time we might not have a second House but in the historical time in which it occurred bicameral legislatures were the norm and we followed that norm. If it had happened at a later stage it is quite possible that we would not have seen the necessity for it. At the time there was a strong argument for it in terms of its usefulness, its representative capacity and its function in relation to legislation.</P>
    <P>I am not one who would propose that this House should be abolished. We have a responsibility to deal with it on two levels, one in terms of reform and the other in terms of reorganisation. I would distinguish between reform and reorganisation: reform, involving both inside and outside the present constitutional provisions, and reorganisation, what we can do to ensure that this is a better functioning House within the provisions of the Constitution. That would be the approach I would take to it rather than discussing the question of abolition or reform. It is really a question of what steps we take to reform it and what constitutional changes would be required. On the other hand, we have a more pressing requirement which is to ensure that this House is operating efficiently. That might require reorganisation.</P>
    <P>The functions of the second House were proposed in 1918 at the conference on the reform of the second Chamber by Lord Bryce. I agree with many elements he regarded as the proper functions of a second House. He identified four major areas. The first one was the revision of legislation, the ability of a second House to have a second look at legislation that had come from another House. The <Col N="281" /> second House is able to tease it out somewhat further, look at what was said in the other House and ensure that no loophole is left before legislation is passed. Secondly, not to revise legislation but to initiate it. It was the intention from the very beginning that this should be a House in which legislation would be initiated.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Conroy say that the majority of legislation which goes through both Houses is of a non-controversial nature. I do not see why roughly an equal amount of legislation could not be initiated in both Houses. The work could be divided up at the beginning of the session. The function of not only this House but of the Oireachtas would be much improved because we would be able to pass more legislation quickly and efficiently. That is a simple matter. That was the original intention in 1918 when reform of the second Chamber was being discussed.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, there is the question of what is called the interposition of delay in relation to legislation; the idea being that the second House has the opportunity to ensure that legislation which may have far-reaching effects may be delayed for a period of time. I am not sure that would be a desirable development at present. I do not think you need to delay legislation for weeks or months except in so far as some further expert opinion is required. That is a function that was probably abused by the old Seanad when legislation was delayed for long periods of time and in fact ended up preventing the Government from carrying out their business rather than facilitating the passage of good legislation. I would have some problems with that but I can see that the very process of a second House does require that a certain delay will take place while legislation is being carefully examined and teased out.</P>
    <P>Finally, it would be a forum for debate on important issues. The Upper House would have vocational expertise and representation to deal with matters of far-reaching concern that might not be early addressed by the Lower House in its day-to-day operations, being concerned with <Col N="282" /> the bread and butter of actual government. There is a wider area of both domestic and external affairs that could benefit from expert discussion, from the expertise of those who have been elected to a second House and from their vocational expertise. We need not depart very far from those stated intentions almost 80 or 90 years ago.</P>
    <P>The question we must look at is how best we can reform the Seanad and ensure that it carries out a proper function if we decide that these are roughly its functions and that it has a useful purpose.</P>
    <P>We have to look at the question of the franchise and composition of the Seanad. The question of the franchise is probably the most debatable of all. Are we going to have a confined register of voters or a universal franchise?</P>

    <Title>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:  Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Senator O'Toole on Wednesday, 23 October 1991:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann supports the following key objectives of the long term strategy for the nineties outlined in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a substantial increase in employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a major assault on long term unemployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the development of greater social rights within our health, education, social welfare and housing services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the promotion of collective and individual social responsibility in relation to discharge of tax liabilities, fair conduct in business dealings, sensible treatment of the environment and reasonable use of public services and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" />&mdash;&nbsp; the development of worker participation, women's rights and consumers' rights; and</P>
    <P>supports the implementation of the agreement on pay and conditions;</P>
    <P>and calls for the immediate implementation of the improvements recommended in the areas of education, health, employment creation, taxation and legislative reform.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Supports the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> as the means to maintain a competitive, low-inflation economy giving faster economic growth, increased employment and greater social equity;</P>
    <P>emphasises the following key objectives of that Programme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; reducing the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100% by 1993 and achieving broad balance on the current budget;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a substantial increase in employment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; a major assault on long term unemployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the development of greater social rights within our health, education, social welfare and housing services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the promotion of collective and individual social responsibility in relation to discharge of tax liabilities, fair conduct in business dealings, sensible treatment of the environment and reasonable use of public services; and</P>

    <P>agrees that all objectives of the Programme must have regard to its overriding public finance objectives if the <Col N="284" /> beneficial results in growth, employment and social equity are to be attained; and</P>
    <P>accordingly, supports</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; the approach being adopted by the Government in relation to the particular difficulties which have emerged for the Exchequer whereby discussions on the issues involved have commenced with the social partners under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>; and</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on this matter. I have to compliment Senators O'Toole and Ryan on a very broad motion with which all of us are very concerned. The only pity is that it is difficult in the time available to adequately cover all the items encompassed. I am sure in the light of events in other places today, there will not be adequate attention given to the proceedings in this House. That is unfortunate because any one of these items, education, health, the creation of jobs, taxation, legislative reform, is more than deserving of an hour and a half or three hours debate over a period of two weeks. It is time, in the light of events of recent weeks, that we focused on the real issues. That is not to minimise problems which have arisen in other places but the public believe that not enough attention has been given in recent times to the matters mentioned in the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few items which I intend to deal with but before doing so I would like to formally welcome the Minister of State to the House. However, while intending no disrespect to him, I must say it is a disappointment that for such an important motion the Government do not see fit to send in a senior Minister. <Col N="285" /> That is said with the utmost respect to Deputy Brady with whom I have always had a cordial relationship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>He can give us the programme of legislation for the next couple of months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps when he is replying, he would give us the programme. We are more than anxious to initiate certain legislation here given that he and his colleagues may be dealing with ongoing matters for the foreseeable future in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was discussed in the other House it was the Fine Gael Party alone who voiced certain reservations and voted against it on the grounds that matters which were involved in the programme had not been fully discussed, had not been brought before the party, had not been before the Dáil and had not been adequately discussed in relation to costing, to the whole question of pay across the board, and to all the matters involved. We have had good industrial relations, we have seen progress over the past number of years because we had agreements in place and that is why mutual trust and agreement achieved as a result of long negotiations and good faith should be adhered to. It should not be a case of quickly agreeing matters based on wrong figures, on wrong ideas, on wrong discussions and on wrong forecasts. In the light of recent events, one would hope that the present Minister for Finance, perhaps when other events unfold, will be better at counting heads than he has been at forecasting budgetary procedures and how this country is being run. The reality is that at the moment this economy is going steadily downhill. We have only to see the lengthening dole queues, the many young people continuing to emigrate, the many young people leaving school or university and going into long term unemployment. Many others have entered into various commitments and suddenly find themselves unable to meet those commitments. The misguided policies, the <Col N="286" /> misguided forecasts made by the present Minister and the present Government have resulted in great social upheaval and more and more people on the dole with no prospect of getting employment in the future.</P>
    <P>All of us in our constituencies have people coming at an ever-increasing rate in relation to the many social problems. In Dún Laoghaire, week in and week out, people are coming to my advice centre indicating they are now unemployed, indicating that they have several children now at home. What we are gradually seeing develop in many areas are ghettos where people have no work and no job prospects. People are finding it more and more difficult to provide for their families, to give them an education, to give them decent health standards. Their parents, people who served the country well, are being thrown out of hospitals. I had a case recently of a person in Loughlinstown Hospital who was unconscious. The hospital authorities contacted the family and asked them to remove their relative because they needed the bed. It is important that we take note of the various serious matters which are now bedevilling this country under a Goverment who are losing their authority to govern but who because of a recently scrambled together programme are going to totter on. It is important to remember that there are two sides to this Government. One side are particularly vocal and are very well versed in PR when it comes to displaying the good news but when it is the bad news they say, &ldquo;Well, the senior partner in Government are responsible for that problem and they are responsible for the low standards in high places which we have seen&rdquo;. It should be remembered that there are 15 people around the Cabinet table and all of these people make the decision. There is such a thing as collective responsibilty and maybe it is no harm to remind the public of this in relation to our Progressive Democrats who at times parade their whiter than white souls in relation to their good deeds etc. I am sure Members opposite would concur and agree with me in relation to this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="287" /> In the light of recent happenings the part of the motion dealing with collective and individual social responsibility in relation to discharge of tax liabilities, fair conduct in business dealings, sensible treatment of the environment and reasonable use of public services is very pertinent and that is why, when some of our colleagues mentioned that this should be given an early hearing, we supported them. We will continue to do that and I would think that the Government, considering that they have not too much more legislation before the House, should make time available for this matter to be discussed at the earliest opportunity. The various matters dealt with in relation to that would have the support of Members of this side of the House and also of the Fine Gael group. There may be amendments to parts of legislation and so be it. At the moment the body politic in relation to how we are viewed outside this House is suffering almost terminal decline. As was stated earlier in relation to the matter dicussed this afternoon in the light of what has emanated from the debate which took place the week before last it is to be hoped that this House can restore certain standards.</P>
    <P>This broad motion before the House deserves more attention than it will get from the national media. Any one of its items deserves all of our attention. This country is at the crossroads. If we do not respond positively in the case of unemployment, health, education, social welfare, the environment, in maintaining standards in relation to public office then our democratic system will be undermined. That is why we will be supporting the motion.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm labhairt ar an rún seo agus tacaíocht a thabhairt do rún an Rialtais. Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil istigh sa phlean a foilsíodh seachtain ó shin bunús maith oibre go cionn dhá bhliain go leith. Anois, níl aon amhras orm ná go bhfuil go leor fadhbanna ann go bhfuil an tír agus an Rialtas ag streachailt leo faoi láthair, agus <Col N="288" /> go bhfuil sé éasca a rá céard iad na rudaí ar fad ar mhaith linn iad a fheiceáil déanta, ach go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos deacra tabhairt faoi na rudaí seo a dhéanamh.</P>
      <P>Mar a dúradh anso cheana, caithfear smacht a chur ar an méid iasachtaí atá an Rialtas ag tógáil. Bhí sé de thuairim agamsa riamh nach raibh an rud á dhéanamh i gceart, agus seasaim leis sin. Mar sin, tá áthas orm go bhfuil spriocanna cinnte leagtha síos sa phlean atá foilsithe le smacht a choinneáil ar mhéid na n-iasachtaí a bheidh an Rialtas ag tógáil as seo go ceann cúpla bliain. Mura ndéanfaimid é sin beimid ag maireachtáil ar airgead ár gcuid gasúr.</P>
      <P>Tá roinnt rudaí ráite sa phlean atá thar a bheith bunúsach. Tá go leor cainte ann faoi dhífhostaíocht; tá go leor daoine ag moladh go gcuirfear task forces agus a leithéidí sin ar bun. Ach, mar dhuine atá ag plé le fada le ceist na dífhostaíochta agus le ceist chruthú fostaíochta, sílim gurb é an rud deireanach a theastaíonn ná tuilleadh cainte faoi seo. Tá gá le hathscrúdú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an bpolasaí tionsclaíochta atá ann. Tá sé ráite agamsa go minic go raibh locht bunúsach ar an bpolasaí tionsclaíochta sin mar nár fheil sé ach do thionscail ardteicneolaíochta agus nár fheil sé go mórmhór do thionscail a bhí go brath ar acmhainní nádúrtha mar bhunús leo agus nár fheil sé do thionscail ina raibh séasúr go mór ag baint leis, mar shampla, tionscal déantúsaíochta na mbróg agus an tionscal éadaigh. Tá gá le hathbhreithniú iomlán a dhéanamh ar an bpolasaí tionsclaíochta. Is ceart a chinntiú go bhfuil toradh ar an gcaiteachas airgid atá ann maidir le cúrsaí tionscail. Tá gá freisin le féachaint an bhfuil bealaí níos fearr ann chun cuidiú le tionsclóirí seachas trí dheontais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have long been of the view that there is a need for a total review of industrial policy as we have it. I am disappointed this has not taken place to date but I am delighted it is incorporated in the Government's plan of action. I think it is about time we examined all the grants, subsidies and tax breaks that are given to industry to see whether this is the most efficient way of helping the creation of <Col N="289" /> employment or are there other ways that would have greater effect.</P>
    <P>I have long maintained that the money now being put into some of the schemes would be better spent first in providing the basic infrastructure that any type of development of the economy needs, for example, roads, water and sewerage schemes and, secondly, that it would be better employed in ensuring that our energy costs and our telecommunications costs are kept down. When you reduce your unit costs in that way everybody in business benefits and you also have the huge advantage that there is no cost of applying and you do not have a whole bureaucracy built up around it. Therefore, this is something that is fundamental to the two and a half year programme and is something that must be welcomed. It will mean, of course, that some very uncomfortable decisions might have to be made affecting some of the semi-State agencies, decisions that they, I would be afraid, might oppose because each agency, as far as I can see, tends to protect its own little bailiwick.</P>
    <P>On the question of tax reform and tax collection, the introduction of an ID for everybody in the country is very important. It will protect those on social welfare who are entitled to social welfare: in fact, it will have the effect of ensuring speedier payment and processing of their claims. It will also have an effect in reducing the chances of fraud in both the tax and the social welfare system. One thing that tends to get overlooked in social welfare fraud or in tax evasion is the fact that it actually leaves less money there to provide for those who are genuinely entitled to these services.</P>
    <P>I have always maintained that those who are entitled to social welfare should have no hang-up about their entitlement to these things. I am very glad to see that the Minister for Social Welfare over the last number of years has instituted a total change and a total revolution, quietly but steadily, in the way that social welfare services are delivered to the clients of that system. There is a much greater openness in the system to give information. There is a much greater privacy <Col N="290" /> being in-built into that system and generally the people in receipt of social welfare are being treated in a much more humane way than heretofore. Step by step, year by year, they are being provided with a better service. As somebody who has many constituents in receipt of payments in one way or another, I would have to say that the delivery of the service to them has improved radically over the years and I would like to see this continued. I would like to see our whole approach to employment and to unemployment given a radical review.</P>
    <P>Mar shampla, i gcás an iarthair, tá go leor daoine ansin atá ar shochar leasa shóisialaigh nó ar an dole, mar a thugann siad féin air, i ngeall gur feirmeoirí beaga iad nó iascairí beaga nach féidir leo dóthain ioncaim a shaothrú as a gcuid imeachtaí. Is é an tuairim atá agamsa ná nach bhfuil siad seo dífhostaithe &mdash; cinnte níl siad díomhaoin. Is é fírinne an scéil ná nach bhfuil dóthain ioncaim as a ngnóthaí chun iad féin a choinneáil. Ach tá difríocht bhunúsach idir bheith dífhostaithe agus bheith gan ioncam. Bheinn ag súil, san athbhreithniú atá geallta sa chlár seo agus san fhorbairt atá geallta i gcúrsaí leasa shóisialaigh, go bhfeicfimid go gairid córas nua do na daoine seo, córas in a n-aithneofaí, nach dífhostaithe atá siad ach go bhfuil ganntanas ioncaim orthu agus faoin a dtabharfaí an Family Income Supplement mar chuidiú dóibh, rud a bheadh níos feiliúnaí i gcás na ndaoine seo.</P>
    <P>Tá fadhb mhór dhífhostaíochta ann i láthair na huaire. Bhí beagáinín iontais orm an cainteoir deiridh a chloisteáil ag tagairt don imirce. Is é fírinne an scéil &mdash; agus cinnte is é an scéal atáimid ag fáil aniar &mdash; ná go bhfuil cúrsaí gnó go dona i Sasana agus go bhfuil go leor de na himirceoirí ag brath teacht abhaile. Feicim dúshlán sa mhéid seo. Caithfimid, os iad ár muintir féin iad, féachaint le hobair fhónta a chur ar fáil dóibh agus don dream atá sa bhaile. Is dóigh liomsa gur diúltach an dearcadh é breathnú orthu seo mar ualach ar an eacnamaíocht. Sílim féin go gcaithfimid anois breathnú orthu mar shaibhreas, mar acmhainn go bhféadfaimid a chur ag obair. Tá go leor <Col N="291" /> de na daoine seo go bhfuil scileanna acu, go mórmhór in obair thógála, tógáil bhóithre agus an cineál sin oibre. Creidim féin go gcaithfimid bealaí a scrúdú chun gur fhéidir linn na scileanna, na hacmhainní agus an saineolas atá ag na daoine seo a chur ag obair sa tír seo. Déanaimid dearmad go minic go bhféadfaí a rá cuid mhaith go raibh páirt mhór ag Éireannaigh i dtógáil chuile mhótarbhealach a tógadh i Sasana le dhá scór bliain, agus is trua é nach féidir linn anois tabhairt faoi na daoine seo a chur ag obair len a scileanna, ag tógáil a leitheíd de chóras sa tír seo. Tá cás ann le hairgead a thógáil lena aghaidh seo.</P>
    <P>Dúirt mé i dtosach báire go raibh mé glan in aghaidh airgead a thógáil ar iasacht don chuntas reatha, ach sílim go bhfuil cás ann anois, go mórmhór san éigeandáil atá ann i láthair na huaire, ó thaobh chúrsaí dífhostaíochta, féachaint le hairgead a thabhairt ar iasacht chun bunstruchtúir na tíre seo a fheabhsú. Níl aon amhras ormsa mar thionsclóir atá ag feidhmiú ar an gcósta thiar gurb é ceann de na fadhbanna is mó dá bhfuilimid ag streachailt leis ná an easpa bhunstruchtúir thionsclaíochta nó an bunstruchtúr bunúsach atá ar fáil do thionsclóirí atá ag iarraidh feidhmiú lasmuigh de na cathracha móra. Tá gá leis na bunstruchtúir sin a chur ar fáil agus, a thúisce is a chuirfear ar fáil iad, is túisce a thiocfaidh borradh ar eacnamaíocht na gceantar sin. Chuirfinn cur ar fáil na mbunstruchtúr sin i bhfad níos airde ar an agenda ná mar a chuirfinn cuid mhaith scéimeanna eile a bhíonn á moladh ó thráth go chéile.</P>
    <P>Maidir le bailiú cánacha, tá feabhas mór le feiceáil ó tháinig Fianna Fáil i gcumhacht i 1987 i gcóras bhailiú cánach. Ach é sin ráite tá sé an-éasca anois ag daoine dearmad a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi, bliain i ndiaidh bliana ón am sin, gur éirigh leis an Rialtas níos mó airgid a thabhairt isteach ná mar a bhí curtha sna Meastacháin go dtí an bhliain seo 1991. Tá gá leis an gcóras a shimpliú, leis an ráta cánach a ísliú ar láimh amháin de agus na heisceachtaí nó na bealaí éalaithe as cáin a laghdú agus a dhúnadh. Is é an t-éileamh is mó ag an gnáthphobail ná <Col N="292" /> go mbeadh an córas cánach intuigthe, sa chaoi is go m'fhéidir é a oibriú go simplí agus go mbeadh daoine cinnte cá seasann siad. Tháinig bean go dtí mé le déanaí agus de bharr éileamh cánach nár thuig sí, bhí £200 cá ach íoctha aici nar ghá di a íoc. Lena chearta a thabhairt don oifigeach cánach, nuair a mhínigh mé an scéal dó thug sé aisíoc di.</P>
    <P>Caithfear an córas cánach a shimpliú ionas go dtuigfidh gnáthdhaoine é. Ní mór freisin gníomhú láithreach &mdash; agus tá sé seo luaite sa phlean <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>&mdash; ionas nach mbeidh trasnáil i gceist idir an córas leasa shóisialaigh agus an córas cánach. Ní fheicim ciall ná réasún ag baint le daoine ag íoc cánach agus ag fáil cúnaimh Stáit in aon tseachtain amháin. Is drochchóras é aon chóras atá eagraithe ar an mbealach seo.</P>
    <P>Má táthar ag smaoineamh ar rátaí cánach a athrú agus a ísliú, ba cheart díriú i dtosach báire ar an dream is lú pá. Ní ceart go mbeadh duine singil a thuilleann faoi bhun £100 sa tseachtain ag íoc cánach. Tá £60, má chuirtear an deontas breosla san áireamh, le fáil ag duine i dteideal sochair dífhostaíochta fadtéarmaí agus seasann an leibhéal díolúine ag £65 nó £70. Tá an dá leibhéal sin ró-ghar dá chéile agus chuideodh sé go mór le daoine dá mbeimis sáste na leibhéil ag a dtosáionn daoine ag íoc cánach, a árdú go mór. Cuireann sé iontas orm go minic ná déantar níos mó tráchta ar sin ach b'fhéidir nach mbíonn an oiread céanna plé le daoine in íochtar ag daoine eile agus a bhíonn agamsa. Tá go leor daoine ann gur beag an cháin a íocann siad agus ba mhór an faoiseamh dóibh é dá dtógfar glan amach as an gcóras cánach iad. Táim ag glacadh leis freisin, dá scorófar an íosleibhéal £100 do dhaoine singil go mbeadh gá len a dhá oiread sin do lanúin phósta.</P>
    <P>Chuirfeadh an gníomh seo athrú bunúsach ar an gcóras agus bhainfeadh sé amach na daoine nach cóir dóibh a bheith ag íoc cánach. Chinnteodh sé freisin go mbeadh am ag na húdaráis cánach dul sa tóir ar dhaoine a bhfuil cáin le n-íoc acu <Col N="293" /> ach nach bhfuil á íoc. Ghlanfadh an t-athrú seo morán riarachán gan tairbhe as an gcóras chomh maith le spreagadh a thabhairt do dhaoine chun fostaíocht a lorg. Bheadh an-tionchar ag an athrú seo ar chúrsaí fostaíochta agus tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an tAire Airgeadais leis an obair atá déanta aige cheana sa treo seo ionas go dtabharfar i gcrích é.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the arrangement, much as I would like to have 15 minutes. I will start by quoting the introduction by the Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress:</i></P>
      <P>This Programme is a strategy to accelerate economic and social progress in the nineties. The strategy is simple. It is to maintain a low-inflation economy with a stable exchange rate which can compete internationally and give us the highest standards of living and improved social services to which we aspire.</P>
      <P>To secure such an economy we need this partnership in commitment and co-operation between the Government and the principal economic and social interests in our society. With agreement on the objectives and means to develop our society, which this Programme contains, we look forward to a decade of progress, growth and reform.</P>
      <P>And then he goes on to say:</P>
      <P>It is the outcome of prolonged negotiations between the Government and the social partners entered into constructively by all concerned in the interests of all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He ends by warmly welcoming it and congratulating everybody. That being the introduction to the programme it seems not just a terrible shame but political, economic and industrial suicide now to <Col N="295" /> seek to undermine what had been negotiated over such a long period of time. It had been agreed as the way forward following on the previous programme that had brought industrial peace to the country. We are now just eight months into the new term and already the Government are indicating that they want a renegotiation of the programme.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that the ICTU have no mandate to renegotiate as things stand. All the unions voted in February to accept the programme put before them. They did not vote for changes, amendments or future renegotiation. Any matters to be ironed out were to be done by the central review body but there was no mandate sought or given to renegotiate the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> A unilateral statement has been issued by the Government but it is not and cannot be in negotiation to change the terms with the ICTU.</P>
    <P>This is a particularly unfortunate state of affairs given that it was the trade union movement, over the previous three years, 1987 to 1990, that bore the burden of pay restraint to get the nation's finances back in order. It is unacceptable to suggest that having done that they must now once again tighten their belts and forego any pay awards granted. I object to the fact that the amendment proposed effectively eliminates any reference to pay and conditions in the original motion. The first page of the programme states what the pay awards will be, 4 per cent in 1991, 3 per cent in 1992 and 3.75 per cent in 1993 so pay and conditions were part and parcel of the agreement made. What the Government should be addressing in this document is tax collection and job creation. It is a dangerous precedent to come out of the new revised deal between the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil that they are going to focus on tax reduction rather than tax reform. The MRBI poll in the middle of the month showed that 65 per cent of people did not want a renegotiation and the latest Exchequer figures for the past <Col N="296" /> nine months show the figures are approximately £200 million better than estimated which is a considerable improvement in the situation. This has been one of the lowest imbalances in Exchequer figures in the whole of the EC.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Government should be scared and certainly they should not be seeking to renegotiate a deal that is just eight months old which is an agenda for the next three years and also a policy agenda for the rest of the decade. I exhort the Government to put all of this panic and allusions to renegotiations aside and to accept the deal for what it is, a minimum blueprint for future development which the country requires in matters of education, social development, health and so on. They will have the co-operation of the social partners and they should now be trying to overturn something that was constructed over a long period of negotiation and that will be of enormous benefit to the community if it is allowed to stand as it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Costello has said, the amendment is unacceptable because it implies renegotiation which is simply not on. We have heard the predictable response from the nurses' organisation, from teachers in inner city schools; if there is no money there to pay these people how do you explain the millions that have recently been wasted, embezzled or whatever? There is no point in politicians saying &ldquo;We did not do that&rdquo;; they were responsible for it. The recent scandals have compounded people's refusal to believe that there is no money there. In a way it is poetic justice for our people because all along there was a kind of peasant culture said, &ldquo;Ah well, if they can make money, more power to them.&rdquo; There is now a very different mood in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both the motion and the amendment say they hope there will be a more fair discharge of tax liabilities and fairer conduct in business dealings. What is unacceptable here is not alone that there have been scandals but that no tax has been paid. This highlights again the tax burden of the PAYE worker. It is the brazenness <Col N="297" /> of politicians and of business people when confronted with these scandals that takes the breath away. There is a scene in some movie where a marriage partner is discovered in <i>flagrante delicto</i> and he says, &ldquo;I know what you are thinking but I can explain everything.&rdquo; That seems to me to sum up well the brazen attitude of politicians and businessmen in this matter.</P>
    <P>I want to draw attention to Senator Costello's motion earlier today which was not taken. Not until people are prosecuted and not until they face jail &mdash; the unthinkable has never happened in Ireland; people have not been put in jail for evading taxes &mdash; is there a fair prospect of getting a reversal of the present situation.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister for Industry and Commerce who has not spoken a great deal lately, said he hoped the revised Programme for Government would help to defuse popular cynicism and that people would begin to trust the new march of progress. I hope he is right but it may not be a radical enough measure.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cuív reminded us that many disgruntled emigrants are coming home now. It was interesting, by the way, to hear him take a different line from the Taoiseach who recently expressed annoyance that returning emigrants were coming home thus upsetting calculations about public finances, social welfare and so on. It is these disgruntled emigrants among others who will make up a very angry people. It may well be that the revised Programme for Government will not go far enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my colleague Senator Costello for allowing me to contribute to this debate. Like most people of this country I am not well versed in economic strategy or the language of professional economists but I know enough to know that money is largely a fiction, a symbolic expression of power. One does a certain amount of work and payment is represented by little pieces of paper or coinage. I work for my money and most people who do are <Col N="298" /> amazed that sections of this society appear to have endorsement for the notion that by some kind of abstract manipulation of market and by speculating in an area where virtually no energy except some minute form of intellectural energy is expended they can reap enormous sums of money.</P>
      <P>My first point is on the subject of scandals and I do not intend to go into them in great detail. We have spoken about the renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the only difference between the two almost identical versions of this motion is the question of renegotiation which is not acceptable. People have witnessed a group of privileged people lend themselves taxpayers' money and then make an enormous profit which is being placed offshore so they do not have to pay any income tax on the profits they have made out of the taxpayers' money. They are legitimately entitled to avoid paying tax on these profits and I understand that the exposure of these four people who made £8 million profit was no more than £20,000. For £20,000 expenditure they can make £8 million profit using the money of people like a single mother who has to start paying tax if she makes anything over £6 a week. That is the morality of the present situation and anybody who in that context asked me to support renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> I say to them, like Marie Antoinette, &ldquo;Let them eat caviar&rdquo;. I have not the slightest intention of supporting this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these economists placed a gloss on a letter that unfortunately made its way to the public and revealed that he was getting large sums of money for certain services, by saying that in terms of the tax considerations, his client, Pernod Ricard, would achieve a higher rate of speed with which the process would be brought to bear by the Revenue Commissioners. I would like the Minister to comment upon this notion. It ill-behoves Fianna Fáil, the Republican Party that we have now moved into a two-speed society, with one speed for those who have £2 million to grease the paws of <Col N="299" /> those who are familiar with the way in which the Government of this country apparently operate, and another speed for the unfortunate ordinary people, the Seán Citizens of this country.</P>
    <P>That explains the failure of this Government; it is not a unique failure. This afternoon I was given a book by Professor Kevin McHale from the College of Surgeons; a collection of essays, entitled <i>Imminent Peril: Public Health in a Declining Economy.</i> Health is one of the issues being addressed here. This quotation from the book seems very appropriate to Ireland. It is from Governor Cuomo of New York who said:</P>
    <P>I will talk to you about failure. Think about this. The best thing you have been able to do for four years is win a war. The best thing you have been able to boast about is destroying 100,000 lives and dropping bombs down smoke stacks. Think of this. You want to talk about failure. You cannot stand up and say to the American people: I gave you better health, I gave you more housing, I helped you build roads and bridges, I helped you educate yourselves, I lifted you from the ghettoes and gave you the same kind of opportunity I had. You cannot say that.</P>
    <P>Neither can the Government say that, despite all their vaunted concern for the poor, sick and the elderly whom the health cuts hurt.</P>
    <P>It is regularly raised in both the Seanad and the Dáil that elderly people with a short life expectancy cannot get cataract operations. There is a two-speed health service. We could look at the health of the Government and I am not surprised that they are under some strain at the moment. Should any of the Cabinet have a recurrence of any of the numerous serious illnesses which members have had, there is no question that they would be kept waiting. They would march straight to the head of the queue because they are able to pay for their health service. &ldquo;Politics&rdquo; as a representative in the United States, Barney Frank, said, &ldquo;is about who gets what and when.&rdquo; We <Col N="300" /> know who is not getting what and when they are not getting it; it is the Irish people. The golden circle of people who are ethically if not criminally corrupt are in a position to grab what they can and run and that it why it is not satisfactory in this economical and philosophical climate for the Government to seek renegotiation. They have a lot of explaining to do to the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris has done a couple of orbits of the globe to establish a political case and that is his entitlement. All Labour Senators and labour leaders and especially Senator Joe O'Toole who is to the fore in this motion, are entitled to make their case. Few people are involved in the recent abuses and in the cartel which does not prevent most ordinary citizens and workers from realising that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> is very important. The Taoiseach's introduction was accurate; it is important to have a mechanism which allows for negotiation because we do not live in a utopia where agreements do not need to be adjusted in the light of outside pressures. We are no longer a little island unaffected by Europe and by world trade. One would be going up a blind alley if one did not accept that an ordinary worker, such as a roadworker in Donegal, has an IQ so that he can think for himself and I believe that he would recognise that valuable safeguards have been built into this agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Workers in this State are well paid, whether they are in the Army or the Garda, doctors, teachers, nurses or any other category. I am in a good position to know that because I live beside the Border. Our social welfare payments are better than those in Northern Ireland. People living in the North are abusing our social welfare system, drawing pension here and paying rent for a house they do not occupy to entitle them to draw a higher pension in Donegal than they can <Col N="301" /> get in the North. We are not giving second class treatment to our workers in this programme. We do not have enough jobs. We have serious unemployment and other problems but scaremongering and waving a flag to say that the rich are getting richer and are playing with millions will not blind people to the usefulness of the mechanism contained here. It is not only useful but vital. There must be provision for renegotiation in the light of any outside developments whether it is an oil crisis or a war or inflation, any situation like the Gulf crisis or whatever. If Senator O'Toole does not recognise it I venture to say the people that he represents recognise it.</P>
    <P>I accept that Senator O'Toole is doing a first class job for the teachers, and I compliment him on it, but teachers know that stakes must be set high and he is doing that and the best of luck to him. On the ground nobody is being fooled. This country is going well at the present time considering the inflationary situation prevailing in Europe. Workers are getting harder to con and they are reasonably well off.</P>

      <P>I can see that in this House one has to watch one's time very carefully; the minutes seem to slip by. In replying to this motion, on behalf of the Government, I would like to begin by outlining the very significant economic achievements which have been made since 1987.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Programme for National Recovery</i> was put in place in 1987. During the period covered by the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> substantial economic progress was made. The economy grew strongly, while our inflation rate was amongst the lowest in Europe.</P>
      <P>The exchange rate was stable in the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Well done, workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The balance of payments showed a healthy surplus. So, what <Col N="302" /> were the factors which led to the strong growth over the period of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> between 1987 and 1990?</P>
      <P>Robust growth abroad certainly helped. This was of particular benefit to our economy, which is so dependent on international trade. It enlarged the size of our potential markets. In addition, inflation and interest rates were lower internationally and less variable than earlier in the decade. However, the real transformation stemmed from our own better handling of our economic and financial affairs.</P>
      <P>For example, we greatly improved competitiveness <i>vis-á-vis</i> our trading competitors. Moderation in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> pay agreement gave us the kind of competitiveness gains that our employment needs require. At the same time, workers' real take-home pay increased substantially.</P>
      <P>We depend for jobs primarily on what we sell abroad. Unless we can keep our cost trends in line with, if not better than, those of our competitors, we will sell less and we will allow our competitors to take more of our home market. The moderate pay agreements associated with the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contributed greatly to the progress we made on the export front.</P>
      <P>Another key contribution to progress has been the reduction in Exchequer borrowing. Taking real control of the budget was the key development in strengthening the economy. We should not forget the scale of the improvement in Exchequer borrowing that has already been achieved. In 1986, the Exchequer borrowing requirement amounted to almost 13 per cent of GNP. We were borrowing at the rate of one-eighth of our total national production; piling up commitments and storing up trouble. Firm action was taken which reduced spending and improved tax collection. The EBR in 1990 was down to only two per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with several other EMS countries we have had to face serious budgetary difficulties this year. 1991 has been a year when the startling pace of <Col N="303" /> recent economic growth has faltered. Growth in GNP is estimated to have averaged almost six per cent in 1989 and 1990; it is likely to be marginally over one per cent in 1991. This significant slow-down in growth mirrors the experience of some of our major trading partners. Indeed, the US and UK economies have had a much worse experience than our own with recession, involving a fall in both output and employment in those economies.</P>
    <P>Experience in the industrialised world this year has not been uniform. There are probably three distinct groups of countries. First, there were economies like the UK and the UK which were worst affected by the slow-down. Secondly, continental European economies such as France and Italy experienced slow growth but not outright recession. Finally, strong growth continued in Japan and in Germany which continued to see the impact of unification.</P>
    <P>It is a testament to the improvements in Irish economic performance in recent years that we followed the middle course of most of our continental EMS partners in avoiding outright recession but with growth slowing in late 1990 and early 1991. This year, growth in output is likely to be only about 1.5 cent. This is disappointing compared with the relative boom of recent years. It is less than we had expected at the beginning of the year. However, the economy has not gone into reverse, as has happened elsewhere; in fact, our growth this year is likely to be in line with the average across the EC. That is a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>Slower growth and higher unemployment have contributed to significant budgetary difficulties this year through substantially higher welfare payments and weaker than expected receipts from excise duties and VAT. Higher spending and lower than expected revenue put pressure on the Government's targeted EBR for the year. By July, the budgetary overshoot in 1991 threatened to be of the order of £200 million. Firm action was needed. Firm action was taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> To contain the emerging overshoot on our own budgetary arithmetic, tough fiscal adjustment measures were taken with a view to limiting the total overrun on the EBR to about £100 million. The indications from the third quarter returns are that this revised target will be achieved or only slightly exceeded. The Exchequer borrowing requirement will thus be contained to close to 2.5 per cent of GNP. This does not take account of the £270 million receipts from the sale of Irish Life which will reduce the actual EBR to closer to 1.5 per cent of GNP. All in all, this must be regarded as a reasonably satisfactory budgetary outcome in what has been a very difficult year.</P>
    <P>Our experience in Ireland in this respect this year was not unique. A number of our European neighbours have also had to take corrective measures when growth proved less than anticipated this year. For example, Germany, France and Italy have been obliged to introduce corrective packages to restrict budgetary overruns. Similary, in the UK, the half-year Exchequer returns released recently suggest that rising unemployment and lower than expected tax receipts will also take their outturn deficit ahead of the borrowing requirement they projected last March.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the accuracy of economic forcasts for 1991. I would remind the Senator that in the budget the Minister for Finance emphasised the particularly difficult and uncertain international background against which this year's economic and budgetary polices had to be framed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That uncertain background was allowed for in the assumptions underlying forecasts made at the time.</P>
      <P>The 2.25 per cent growth forecast on which the budget was based was in line with the forecast for Ireland by the EC Commission last December. It was slightly less optimistic than the ESRI's forecast of 2.5 per cent published the day before the budget. Forecasts by leading stockbrokers in January were in line with, or only marginally lower than, the Department's own forecast. For example, Goodbody were predicting 2.2 per cent; Solomons 2.1 per cent and Davys 1.8 per cent, later revised up to 2 per cent; Solomons 2.1 per cent and Davys 1.8 per cent, later revised up to 2 per cent. There was a general consensus &mdash; expressed in the post-budget comments of leading sectoral representatives &mdash; that the budget was prudent, not erring either on the side of excessive optimism or caution.</P>
      <P>Since January last, virtually all major forecasters world wide have scaled back their forecasts for this year. The OECD have reduced their forecast for world growth from 2 per cent to 1 per cent. The EC Commission have reduced their forecast for the Community from 2.2 to 1.4 per cent. As I mentioned already, France, Germany and Italy have also taken corrective budgetary measures this year when growth turned out to be less than anticipated. We are not the only country to have to accommodate to changed circumstances due to external factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the uncertainties inherent in economic forecasting. He even went so far as to suggest that in marked contrast to the position this year, current forecasts for 1992 might turn out to be unduly pessimistic. I would, of course, agree with the Senator that economic forecasting, particularly in a small open economy like ours, is very far from being an exact science. It depends on <Col N="306" /> a wide variety of factors, including the assumptions one makes about external growth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We should ignore them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>In this country we depend primarily for economic growth on what we can sell abroad. While the international agencies are predicting an improvement in world growth in 1992 compared with 1991, they still expect that growth in the two years 1991 and 1992 will be lower than they had anticipated at the start of this year. For example, the OECD's latest published forecast is for world growth of 4 per cent over the two years 1991 and 1992; at the beginning of this year they were forecasting 4.6 per cent. It is now predicted that growth in the UK, in particular, will be negligible over the two years 1991 and 1992 compared with a rate of growth of over 3 per cent expected at the turn of the year. Import growth in our other main export markets is expected to be lower than anticipated this time last year. In these circumstances, it is simply not realistic to expect that domestic growth here at home can be quite as strong as was anticipated when the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was ratified.</P>
      <P>Apart from the lower revenue receipts which weaker growth will inevitably entail, the higher level of unemployment arising from reduced job opportunities abroad involves extra spending on social welfare payments. This year alone this extra spending will amount to some £75 million. There will be additional costs in 1992.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole made the point that the debt GNP ratio will still fall this year despite the budgetary difficulties. This, of course, is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like everything else I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the underlying decline in the ratio this year, that is, excluding the once-off receipts from the privatisation of Irish Life, will be relatively modest. We should not forget <Col N="307" /> that Ireland still has a very high debt GNP ratio by international standards. This leaves us very exposed to external developments over which we have no control. This is one of the major reasons why the debt GNP ratio should be reduced as envisaged in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
      <P>I need heardly remind the House that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself and, for that matter, the Government amendment to the motion, recognises the importance to the economy of continuing a responsible fiscal policy. One of the key objectives for which all partners to the programme have signed on is a reduction in the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and as part of this achievement of broad balance on the current budget. We cannot afford to lose sight of this objective.</P>
      <P>To fail to reduce the debt GNP ratio as agreed in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> would risk undermining consumer and investor confidence. It could also result in higher interest rates. We must never be allowed to forget that the interest on increased borrowing has to be paid in future years and, ultimately, the extra borrowing itself must be repaid, leaving heavier burden for our children. Is this really what Senator O'Toole wants? I would doubt it very much.</P>

      <P>Despite the impact of the July package announced by the Minister for Finance to reduce the expected overrun on the Government's budgetary arithmetic, the task of framing next year's budget will still be very difficult. The outlook for the remainder of 1991 and for 1992 is still very uncertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is an emerging consensus among economic forecasters that the international economic climate for 1992 will be more favourable than in 1991, the <Col N="308" /> extent of such an improvement is difficult to predict with any degree of certainty at this stage. In framing next year's budget, the Government's overriding concern is to continue the fiscal discipline for which we have all signed on which has proved so successful in recent years.</P>
    <P>The three year <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> forms part of a longer-term ten year strategy. It is designed to promote economic and social development, to prepare Ireland Incorporated for the 21st century. It is based on the principle of co-operation with the social partners in achieving a consensus on the desirable ways and means of restructuring and modernising the economy. Such co-operation has served us well in the past. We proved the value of this approach in managing our economic affairs during the most difficult period of recovery under the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> I am confident that a similar approach will enable us to overcome our present difficulties while at the same time, maintaining stability all round.</P>
    <P>It has been fully accepted by the parties to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that macro-economic stability is vital to economic progress in a small open economy. Unless the growth potential of the economy is secured and strengthened by pursuing the sound macro-economic policies which I referred to earlier, our capacity to meet the very worthy social objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and referred to in the motion put down by Senators O'Toole and Ryan will be seriously diminished.</P>
    <P>In their motion, they conveniently ignore the underlying economic and fiscal policies which are so essential to our economic well-being. The Government motion puts the record straight in this respect. A key objective is the reduction of the national debt to GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993 and achieving broad balance on the current budget. Achievement of this objective underpins most of the other aims and objectives of the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="309" /> As the Taoiseach pointed out when he launched the programme last January, the improvement and advances in the different economic and social areas can only be undertaken if a growing economy provides the resources to pay for them. In fact, over the years 1991 and 1992 it is now expected that the loss of growth, against expectations, will be of the order of around one year's growth overall. For reasons mentioned earlier, the combined effects of this lower growth leading to revenue shortfalls and higher than expected expenditure liabilities from higher unemployment and other reasons have given rise to our present budgetary difficulties.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, bilateral discussions with the social partners are currently taking place at official level to discuss the issues to which our budgetary difficulties give rise. These discussions are taking place under the consultation arrangements provided for under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> They are continuing at present and it would be very premature and pre-sumptious of me to suggest what the outcome will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell you what the outcome will be. There is no doubt about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I am heartened by the co-operative approach being adopted by all parties to the programme to the serious financial difficulties with which all of us are faced.</P>
      <P>In tandem with these discussions, the Government are continuing with their review of every aspect of public expenditure, as part of the process of agreeing spending Estimates for 1992. The 1992 expenditure Estimates will have to be consistent with the Government's underlying macro-economic policies which I have mentioned earlier.</P>
      <P>I would like now to refer briefly to some of the specific points put forward in the motion by Senators O'Toole and Ryan.</P>

      <P>Minister, I am loath to interrupt you but as <Col N="310" /> Senator O'Toole has been interrupting you during your speech so far, as you are now going into specific points may I remind the Senator that he will have an opportunity to respond to the Minister when he has finished his contribution. I do not wish, in any way, to inhibit the spontaneity that we all know Senator O'Toole to be capable of in this House. I am just making the point that it is discourteous, if nothing else, to interrupt the Minister in the course of his contribution.</P>

        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the unfavourable international conditions, to which I have referred, employment this year will be higher on average than in 1990. This is a considerable achievement and a measure of our success in getting the economic fundamentals right. If these improvements had not taken place, employment in Ireland would probably now be falling, and might, indeed, be falling fast.</P>
      <P>Although not all sectors are faring equally well, there is little doubt that total employment in the year to date has been higher than even the high level achieved in 1990. This is shown by the strong increase in employment-related revenue so far this year as compared with the same period of 1990. Even after taking account of increases in pay rates, these figures indicate that employment has increased. Receipts from PAYE up to end-September and from the training and employment levy up to 11 October were up by no less than 8.2 per cent and 6.7 per cent respectively over the corresponding period of 1990.</P>
      <P>However, despite employment growth, unemployment has unfortunately risen steeply this year; more steeply than anyone expected. But let us be clear what are the reasons for this higher unemployment. It has been due to a cessation, if not indeed a reversal of net emigration. It is not the result of a fall in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike the 1980s, the higher unemployment this year is not due to net job <Col N="311" /> losses. Instead, it is largely the result of our demographic structure; some of the more dramatic increases in the live register this summer have been due to students temporarily signing on the live register because they could not get summer jobs abroad.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, many people equate an increase in unemployment with a fall in employment and consequently fear for their own jobs. As a result, they become more cautious about borrowing or spending money. This accounts for some of the slowing in the growth of consumer spending this year, despite more people being at work and at higher rates of pay than in 1990.</P>
    <P>In order not to miss any opportunity to reduce unemployment, the Government set up the task force on employment to draw on the knowledge, experience and ideas of all of the social partners to produce new ways of reducing unemployment. The task force's proposals will be considered by the Government and it would be surprising if some worthwhile measures did not emerge.</P>
    <P>However, we must face the reality that, because of the growth in our labour force, the unemployment picture will remain very difficult for some time to come. While the infrastructure of the economy is being developed to the size we need to cater for all of those seeking work at home, part of any fall in unemployment will inevitably be the result of emigration. If, however, existing policies are continued and a strong consensus is maintained to improve our competitiveness and build on the gains already achieved, we can look forward to a greater share of any reduction in unemployment coming from employment growth at home.</P>
    <P>While unemployment can only be effectively tackled by creating the general macro-economic conditions for sustainable economic growth, the Government and the other social partners want to ensure that the available employment opportunities are spread as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that long term unemployment is a major problem, <Col N="312" /> affecting both urban and rural areas. Where long term unemployment is particularly high in one area, there is a serious danger that a cycle of poverty and unemployment will be established which can be very difficult to break.</P>
    <P>Long-term unemployment is a complex problem which is being tackled on a number of fronts. Where people have lost the skills that would allow them to regain a place in the labour market, education or training courses have to be established to provide them with those skills. One person might benefit from a return to the education system to acquire formal qualifications. Another might benefit from a FÁS training scheme of work placement.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that any opportunities for employment creation in the local areas are developed to the full. The area-based strategy to combat long term unemployment will work on all these levels. At present, it is operating on a pilot basis in 12 selected areas of high long term unemployment. The companies will assess the needs of the long term unemployed and integrate the provision of services.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the companies, with local knowledge and the assistance of locally based voluntary and community organisations, trade unions and private sector companies, as well as the local representatives of Government Departments and agencies, will be better able to plan and implement programmes for the long term unemployed for their own areas.</P>
    <P>The companies already established are at present carrying out assessments of the needs of the long term unemployed in their areas on which they will base an appropriate programme. I am sure the implementation of those programmes will provide significant benefits for the long term unemployed and will also show that the partnerships established nationally by the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> can be effective at all levels.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and its predecessor the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> have <Col N="313" /> made significant contributions to the protection and improvement of the position of the less well-off, the deprived and the disadvantaged in our society.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years, basic social welfare increases have been above the rate of inflation, with special higher increases for those on the lowest payments. A key objective of the Government is to continue to protect social welfare payments against inflation and to achieve the priority rates for all payments by 1993. Progress in relation to these objectives, however, will not be easy given the current difficult position of the public finances. Further social welfare improvements, and indeed improvements in all policy programmes, will have to be consistent with the medium-term budgetary objectives of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>The substantial progress which has been made in improving social welfare payments over the past four years is due in no small way to the success of the Government in securing more effective control of the public finances. The biggest obstacle to further progress in social welfare would be a breakdown in public financial discipline that has been established. We cannot and will not allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>It is worth pointing out that in discussing the social dimension of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we are not talking just about commitment for the future; we can already point to a range of solid achievements in the course of the programme's first year.</P>
    <P>In the education sector the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> has already improved the quality of the education system nationwide by reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio, and in particular has allowed additional resources to be directed to disadvantaged pupils. At primary level, an additional 480 teaching posts were created in 1991: this greatly increased employment opportunities for young teachers. Of the total, 144 posts were specifically reserved for teachers of remedial and disadvantaged pupils, and for special education. At <Col N="314" /> second level, a total of 310 new posts were created of which 60 were assigned to schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged pupils.</P>
    <P>Under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> a disadvantaged fund has also been established. In 1991 an additional £1 million was provided for relevant initiatives. This enabled the Minister for Education to increase the provision for free school books at both primary and post-primary levels, and to introduce new measures to improve the staying-on rate of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>

      <P>Some of the contributors to last week's debate mentioned the pay levels of the lower grade staff in the Civil Service. The Government accept as an employer, that they have to pay rates to Civil Service staff which are attractive enough to recruit, retain and motivate staff of sufficient quality to ensure that they are in a position to deliver the range and quality of services which the public expects from the Civil Service. These rates are competitive. In talking about rates, however, let us not forget the major concessions which have <Col N="315" /> been made on the income tax front in recent years and the special arrangements made for lower paid workers in recent pay agreements. Let us not lose sight either of the limitations and discipline forced upon us by the fact that the pay and pensions of public servants in 1991 amounts to £3,422 million and amounts to over 55 per cent of current voted expenditure. The increase in the figure for 1992 will be higher still.</P>
      <P>The contributions to last week's debate included reference to the <i>Revenue 1990 Statistical Report.</i> In particular, comment forced on the small number of self-employed taxpayers recorded in the recent <i>Revenue 1990 Statistical Report</i> as having incomes in excess of £25,000.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which does not fully reflect a taxpayer's basic income since it allows for certain deductions, such as capital allowances; thirdly, they do not include proprietary directors of incorporated family businesses who are akin to self-employed but are taxed under PAYE.</P>
      <P>Allowing for these factors the number of Schedule D taxpayers, including proprietary directors, with gross incomes in excess of £25,000 for the year 1988-89 was 16,000, or 9 per cent of the total. The corresponding figure for the current year is estimated at 28,000, or 14 per cent of the total.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is appropriate for me at this stage to remind the House that there <Col N="316" /> have been some substantial income tax improvements in recent years. These include special provision for the low paid, extension of the standard band by over 40 per cent and reduction of the top and standard tax rates by 6 per cent in each case. These improvements have been of considerable benefit to the ordinary PAYE taxpayer.</P>
    <P>In tandem with these improvements, major reforms have been made to the corporation tax system in recent years. These were aimed at reducing distortions in the use of capital as against labour, and at improving overall equity and efficiency. Accelerated capital allowances are being phased out, restrictions have been placed on tax-based lending and self-assessment has been extended to companies. At the same time, the corporation tax rate structure has been simplified, with the standard rate now at 40 per cent. As the effects of the reforms work their way through the system, the aim of an increased yield from the corporate sector is being achieved. Corporation tax receipts, as at end-September last, show a year-on-year increase over 26 per cent.</P>
    <P>The recent review of the Programme for Government sets out the Government's intention to endeavour to achieve the objectives of a standard rate of 25 per cent with a single higher rate of 44 per cent in the next two budgets, involving a systematic curtailment of exemptions, shelters, allowances and concessionary tax rates.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Greencore affair, and the reference which Senator O'Toole made to possible taxation issues related to it, the Government have requested the Revenue Commissioners to carry out a complete investigation into all matters which come within their jurisdiction. The Government have also requested the Central Bank to examine the exchange control aspects of the matter at issue. It would be inappropriate for me, therefore, to comment further on this matter, pending the results of this and all other aspects of the Greencore affair which are currently the subject of investigation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="317" /> The Government has already achieved a great deal in all the policy areas referred to in the motion put before this House by Senators O'Toole and Ryan. I find fault with their motion in one major respect. That is their total disregard of the facts of economic life that there is no such thing as a free lunch. By ignoring the fiscal imperatives that underpin the programme, by even suggesting that we should behave recklessly in so ignoring the nation's ability to pay, they do us all a disservice.</P>
    <P>The Government must live in the real world. We must ensure that the country's best interests are safeguarded by prudent management of the economy. Under the programme we have embarked on a major and ambitious restructuring of society over the next ten years in consultation with the social partners. In order to achieve these ambitious goals we must live within our means.</P>
    <P>The Government remain firmly committed to the consensus-based approach which has served this country so well in recent years. This commitment is borne out by the recent initiation of discussions with the social partners on our budgetary difficulties. Hopefully, from these talks will emerge a structured response to these difficulties which will ensure cohesion between the various elements in our society and enable us to maintain the stability which is so necessary to our economic well-being.</P>

There are obvious dangers to the financial stability of the programme if public service pay costs were to continue to grow at such a rate. Increased pay spending of this order on a continuing basis can only <Col N="318" /> be afforded at the expense of other desirable public spending.</P>
      <P>There is widespread acceptance that corrective action is needed to meet next year's budgetary problems and to avoid worsening the situation. The Government are facing up to the expenditure implications of this at present. In parallel with this process they have commenced a dialogue at official level with the social partners about the issues involved. Until these issues have been teased out fully, as was indicated earlier, it would not be appropriate for me to anticipate or comment on the precise measures required. It is not appropriate that when things are not going quite as well as expected with the fiscal objectives set out in the programme, the signatories should reflect on the issues involved and make their contributions to any necessary solutions.</P>
      <P>Serious budgetary problems such as these were faced up to by the social partners on a consensus basis before and during the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> That programme put the Exchequer finances on a proper footing, a footing on which the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> itself was constructed. I have every confidence that the same consensus approach will prove equally successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>Finally, I am sure that this House will join with me in hoping for a very successful outcome to the discussions which will, no doubt, be very mature and responsible, and in doing so, will support the amendment.</P>

      <P>Whoever put this speech together, to make the point that I did not understand underlying economic directions and so on, has not put any economic concept into it. I will just draw two points to the Minister's attention. The price of oil on Budget Day was approximately $29 a barrel. They are now hoping to hold it <Col N="319" /> around $21. It is lower now than it was then. That is the reality. Who is to be thanked for what?</P>
      <P>The Minister said &ldquo;the substantial progress which has been made in improving social welfare payments over the last four years is due in no small way to the success of the Government in securing more effective control of the public finances.&rdquo; That shows a disgraceful lack of consideration for the people who made it possible for his Government to do whatever they have done: public servants, workers in the private sector and those people who are prepared to forego increases and improvements in their conditions of service, salaries and wages over the last four years. That co-operation, not Government thought, is what provided the progress&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They have nothing to say. They are simply trying to string a speech together with interruptions. Sitting in the Leader's seat at the moment Senator McGowan made a reference to Donegal road workers. I took much of my early thinking from one very famous Donegal road worker navvy who found the time over the course of the century to put many of his thoughts on paper. Mr. McGill has had a profound influence on my thinking, I have to say and I do not denigrate Donegal navvies or road workers. I respect them, I reflect their views and I represent their point of view in what I am saying here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reality of it. The reality is that when people on that side talk about renegotiation of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> when they had the audacity to put in an amendment that <Col N="321" /> was afraid to address the issue of pay and conditions of service of public servants, what they are really saying is that in order to pay for their problem they are going back to the teachers, the gardaí, the nurses, the public servants, the Defence Forces, the civil servants, okay you pay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Thank you very much. If anybody has anything of significance to say I am prepared to hear it, but I have not heard it so far. I am not inviting comments at this stage. In terms of the latest figures we are hearing from the Minister, and the Exchequer returns in September for the third quarter of the year, he goes on to express satisfaction that in this very difficult year Exchequer borrowing can be expected to turn out close to 2.5 per cent of GNP. The Minister in his speech talked about the OECD figures, about economic growth in the world, but he refused to tell us what the normal GNP percentage is in other countries. Let me quote from some of your friends in the stockbroking side of things.</P>
      <P>
        <i>(Interruptions.)</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always had this very close interest in what the other side are at, I can tell you. This is Davy's Stockbrokers in their latest edition: <i>Fiscal Policy, Public Finances.</i> I know the Minister does really like to hear this, but I would ask him to take it on board. In absolute terms he is talking about an Exchequer borrowing requirement of roughly 2.5 or 3 per cent of GNP and <Col N="322" /> how we need to improve on it. I just want to quote what the experts are saying. They are saying in absolute terms an EPR of 4 per cent of GNP would still compare favourably with the ERM average. Just for the record, that is a reality. It compares favourably.</P>
      <P>I can also tell the House that in the latest figures put out by, dare I say, NCB, that stockbroking company Dermot Desmond was formerly running, Pádraig O'Connor in his latest forecast said just a week ago that this country could easily deal with a figure of 3 per cent in 1991-92. It is also worthwhile putting on the record that from 1987 to 1990, when all the economic objectives were exceeded, we started off in 1987 with a debt-GNP ratio of more than 130 per cent; it is down now to closer to 100 per cent. I could go back and read again from the CII, from Davy's, from any of the stockbrokers, from any of the economic commentators and I would ask the Minister to answer the question he did not address. He used the phrase which we all used, that we would like to have the debt-GNP ratio at 100 per cent by 1993 but he did not have the guts to stand up and say what he thought it will be by 1993. I can tell the House what Davy's, who are no friends of mine, will say. I can tell the House what Goodbody's will say. They will say that, including the payment of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> it will be less than 105 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that we have taken it from 150 per cent in the mid-eighties down to the current rate, closer to 100 per cent. When we exceeded all expectations in the late eighties we did not come back to the Minister with a begging bowl saying, &ldquo;More&rdquo;. We stuck by our commitments and the Minister must stick by the Government commitment to pay on this one when there is a slight deviation. He has not given any figure tonight of Government costs which were not known in January of this year. All the costs, down to the last penny, were available to us. We knew the costs of the specials, we knew the cost of the increases. There has been no change in <Col N="323" /> the forecast of public service costs, not one penny extra&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that somebody is making a judgment of priorities. If you are saying to me that there is a banker in Switzerland who is sweating it out because we might not be able to pay him a few shillings next year, I will say to you, Minister, there are also teachers, gardaí, nurses, civil servants, public servants, workers and PAYE workers. They are also worried about getting their increase next year. I ask you, Minister, to make your judgment as to where the axe should fall. Let the Swiss crowd wait for a couple of more years. Yesterday, we had the latest figures of the Confederation of Irish Industry: growth and manufacturing output up this year, and forecast to be up again next year; improved international climate, export growth up to 7 per cent by next year. If you look at the business sections of today's British quality newspapers, all of them are carrying the latest figures from the Confederation of British Industry which shows a marked improvement, that we are out of what will prove to be the shortest recession in post-war history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reality is that there is not the problem with the economy that the economists have asked us to believe there is. I agree, they could tell us all the problems. The problem for the stockbrokers is very simple: that they had made a certain judgment on the value of their stocks based on a certain set of figures coming out next year. That has not happened and the way they are going to lose out is that their stocks will not be of the same value. The Minister has talked about threats to the the economy; about instability in the economy but he has failed to outline what will be the detrimental results of the blip that will be caused by an increase in public service finances next year, what that will do in the long term. I will wager the Minister that his forecast that we are going to lose one year's growth over the next five years will not <Col N="324" /> happen. I would be prepared to put money on that. There is no question about it. The economic growth for 1992, 1993 and 1994, despite what Senator O'Keeffe said last week, will be of the order we expected it to be and that we will see economic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear that Fianna Fáil have nothing to offer on this issue on the realities of it. We are heading into an area of economic growth. I have indicated that we are into an area of improved exports. I have referred to the fact that we have never had an improvement as we had over the period of the PNR. I have indicated to the Minister that this was done on the backs of workers. I have also indicated that there is no way that he will now further deepen and extend the period of attrition by coming back to the teachers, nurses, gardaí, the public servants, civil servants, including his advisers, who we would wish to see get their full pay and their full increase. A country that can put people behind bars for not paying for their washing machine, for not paying for their TV licences, for not being able to pay their car tax, a country that can deal with and apparently tolerate the levels of fraud, misappropriation of funds, the levels of tax avoidance and tax evasion, is not <Col N="325" /> going to be bailed out one more time and a poor administration will not be bolstered up on the back of the people who are achieving whatever improvement there has been over the past four years. It just is not on.</P>
      <P>The question of renegotiation is not a realistic option for you at this time. I think the Minister should end the uncertainty, calm the fears of public servants, of people in the private sector and PAYE workers, and say &ldquo;Yes, we will now pay this money.&rdquo; The only thing I welcomed in his speech was the commitment to say it was not clear whether the Government wanted to renegotiate away the money that is due and has been earned and is owed to those people.</P>

He is now going to endanger that. He will put under threat the stability of national negotiations, he will undermine the credibility of unions and management, employer and Government negotiators if he does not pay up on this one, honour his commitments, give those people what they are entitled to and ensure that we can continue a period of stability. The cowardly and outrageous amendment which abrogates completely the Government's responsibility to pay public service workers is totally unacceptable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Fahey. The issue to which I refer is the urgent need to construct an extension to St. Mary's national school, Askeaton, County Limerick. The school, which was built in the early sixties, now requires two further classrooms and one remedial room.</P>
      <P>There are 230 pupils in the school and the educational facilities include three prefabricated structures, two of which are single rooms. The other originally had three rooms and a general purpose room but only one room is now serviceable. The other rooms are inadequate for the facilities required and are out of use. The school does not now have a general purpose room and for most of the time students eat their lunch in the open air. They eat in classrooms in the event of bad weather. The Minister must agree that this is not acceptable and I urge him to ensure that the necessary funds are provided in 1992 to erect an extension.</P>
      <P>The prefabricated structures require regular repairs and the Minister will agree that this expenditure is money down the drain. The present structures are not suitable and, to an extent, the children who are obtaining education in these conditions must be considered as disadvantaged. I ask the Minister to give this matter his urgent attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The heating system is in urgent need of replacement. The temperatures in winter can be very low. He will appreciate that it is difficult to maintain proper tempertures in prefabricated buildings. In winter it can be very cold and in summer excessively warm. The pre-fabricated buildings have become progressively worse in the past two or three years and people involved in the local committee say that this is the last year these buildings will be in use because of their condition. There is doubt about one of them lasting through this winter.</P>
    <P>Local funding to construct the extension has been available for five years. Ninety thousand pounds was collectd between 1979 and 1987 and £150,000 is required from the Department to complete the construction.</P>
    <P>Class numbers have remained steady over the past ten years and it is reliably forecast that there will be an increase in the number of students because of developments in the area. Wyeth Ireland Ltd., the main industry in Askeaton, are embarking on an extensive development programme. I take this opportunity to congratulate that company for the contribution it has made to Askeaton. The organisation is embarking on a comprehensive expansionary programme which will bring more people to live in the area and thereby increase the school population. Aughinish Alumina is developing and will have the same effect. Shannon Development have informed me within the past week that they are actively seeking industrialists to commence operations on the IDA site in Askeaton. They are hopeful of a major industry setting up there and this will have the effect of increasing the population and thereby the number of pupils attending the school.</P>
    <P>In July 1988 a delegation from Askeaton met the Minister, outlined the needs of the school and expressed their concern with conditions at that time. In 1989 the Minister approved the provision of an extension to the junior school and improvements to the senior school consisting of two classrooms and a remedial <Col N="330" /> room for the junior school. It was suggested that a general purpose room be built from local funds. Improvement in toilet facilities and the heating system in the senior school were proposed. The Minister committed the Department of Education to complete the plans as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I again urge the Minister and the Government to make the necessary funds available to overcome this serious ongoing problem in Askeaton and allow the children there to have proper educational facilities such as are available throughout most of the country. The position in Askeaton is totally unacceptable. I await with interest the Minister's reply.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity the Senator has given me to outline my Department's intentions in relation to the proposed extension to the national junior school in Askeaton and to a scheme of improvements for the senior school.</P>
      <P>I accept what the Senator has said that conditions, especially in the junior school, are not satisfactory and this arises in the main from dependence on pre-fabricated accommodation. I have therefore, approved the following accommodation: a permanent extension of two classrooms, a remedial room and some ancillary accommodation for the junior school. A general purpose room is also being provided on the basis that the school itself will pay for this facility. The improvements to the senior school will include the updating of toilet facilities and the heating system. I am certain that when the project has been completed it will be a source of great pride to all concerned in Askeaton.</P>

    <P>I acknowledge that it has taken longer than we genuinely expected to complete the architectural planning. The Senator will appreciate, however, that the various stages of architectural planning for a project of this nature are necessarily time-consuming and that some matters in this regard are outside the control of my Department; for example, the local authority planning permission and indeed <Col N="331" /> other aspects of planning which can delay projects quite considerably.</P>
    <P>The Senator will be aware of and will also appreciate the volume of architectural work on hands and that each school makes a case to me and to my Department that their project is deserving of top priority. The present position is that the preparation of tender documents is in hand and these will be completed at the earliest possible date. The question of the invitation of tenders will then arise for consideration in the context of the available capital. The Senator will be aware that discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance regarding the 1992 budget. Until I know what capital will be available in 1992 for primary school buildings I will not be in a position to say when tenders will be invited for the project.</P>
    <P>I accept the urgency of the case and I fully appreciate the concerns of the chairperson of the board of management, the teachers and indeed the parents in Askeaton. I will communicate with the school authorities in this matter as early <Col N="332" /> as possible and I will advise the Senator when there are developments.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. In view of the Minister's statement, that the plans and the project are at an advanced stage, would he accept that there is an urgent need to complete his project?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that there are delays in regard to the financial situation. The planning has been completed and there will be no further delays on that score.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>That is always the biggest problem.</P>

      <P>Until such time as we establish what the 1992 budget is, it is impossible to say if we will be able to make any new starts next year. The Senator will have read in the newspapers that things are not good in regard to the public finances. I have to wait until I establish what moneys we have next year before I can say anything more definite.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.48 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 31 October 1991.</P>
