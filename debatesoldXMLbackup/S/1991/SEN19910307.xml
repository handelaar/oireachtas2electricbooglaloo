      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Keeffe that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The present state of negotiations on the sale of Irish Steel and in the event of the dissipation of international interest the proposals he has for the long term viablility of the plant.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Mary Jackman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to outline the strategy of future funding arrangements for integrated rural development, in particular the Slievefelim pilot programme in the Tipperary-Limerick area.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing <Col N="2026" /> development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    <P>Le fiafraí den Aire Airgeadais agus de Aire na Gaeltachta cén fáth nach bhfuil Seomra na Gaeilge i dTeach Laighean ar fáil, do Theachtaí Dála agus Seanadóirí le feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Keeffe, Doyle, Jackman and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator O'Keeffe's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle, Jackman and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Ó Foighil is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of Ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like again to ask the Leader of the House a question posed to him yesterday by Senator Manning and myself, and by some of us a fortnight ago, when we sought a debate in this House on Northern Ireland.  We can take time to discuss the Gulf, the Middle East, the Palestine question and all these other issues but this part of our island is an extremely pertinent, festering issue at present.  There is some urgency about arranging that a debate on the subject <Col N="2028" /> shall take place in this House.  I urge the Leader to arrange that this will happen.</P>

      <P>This is not a matter for the Order of Business.  I cannot allow questions that are not relevant to the Order of Business.  My advice to the Senator is that if he feels strongly about it, he should take it up in another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, in the light of the general concern in the House about the aftermath of the Gulf War &mdash; there are items on the Order Paper relating to this &mdash; whether a debate will be provided. Many people are concerned that Mr. Ali Hassan al-Majid is being appointed interior Minister in Iraq.  He is a cousin of Saddam Hussein and is the man who was responsible for the bombing of the Halabja community.  I would like to ask the Leader if there will be a means to express concern &mdash; because journalists are currently being excluded from Iraq &mdash; and to deal with the question of the ill-treatment of Palestinians in Kuwait.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is whether in the light of these things and the concern for human rights expressed during the debate, if there will be a debate on the aftermath of the war?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the queries about items Nos. 1, 2 and 5 raised by Senator Manning, items Nos. 1 and 2 <Col N="2029" /> relate to Private Business.  I have indicated to the parliamentary agent that I cannot take item No. 2 before Easter. That is still the position.  Senator Manning has shown an interest in item No. 5 &mdash; the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) (Amendment) Bill &mdash; for the last number of weeks and I am pleased to say that will be taken on Thursday of next week.</P>
      <P>Senator B. Ryan asked about the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. There will be Government amendments. That has been confirmed.  It is expected to be taken during the week of 18 March. The amendments will be circulated in time.  It will not be on next week.</P>
      <P>I can not say how long the Marine Institute Bill will take.  I do not think it will take too long, perhaps an hour or less.  The other matters raised by Senator Upton are not appropriate to the Order of Business.  In regard to Senator Staunton's point, as I indicated yesterday I have no plan for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris asked for a debate on the aftermath of the Gulf War.  We have done very well with debates on the Gulf War.  We have had two debates.  The other House had only one.  I have no plans at this point for a further debate on the Gulf War or the aftermath of the Gulf War.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Seanad Bill that has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 82, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purport of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad.  The only matters, therefore, that may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have <Col N="2030" /> arranged for the printing and circulation to them of those amendments.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>As Members are aware, they may speak only once on this question.  I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan, Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): The Bill was initiated in the Seanad and then went to the Dáil.  We accepted two amendments in the Dáil; both are to section 4.  We are now taking Report Stage in the Seanad for the discussion and explanation of the two ministerial amendments that were agreed in the Dáil on Committee and on Report Stages. Both amendments relate to functions of the institute.</P>
      <P>In section 4 (1), &ldquo;after employment&rdquo;, we propose to insert the words &ldquo;and protect the marine environment&rdquo;.  Indeed, the amendment had been sought by Opposition Deputies.  If my recollection is correct, I think they were also sought by Senators.  During the debate the Minister agreed to include the amendment. Protecting the marine environment becomes one of the criteria underlying the institute's general function.</P>
      <P>In section 4 (2) (f), after &ldquo;co-ordinate&rdquo;, it is proposed to insert the words &ldquo;and control&rdquo;.  That is on page 4, subsection (2), line 21.  I will explain the purposes of these amendments.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that in addition to promoting economic development and creating employment the institute should give priority to protecting the marine environment where relevant to marine research and development.  Without the addition of this explicit reference, the Bill as drafted defined the institute's remit broadly enough to encompass concerns about the protection of the marine environment.  However, in light of the expressed concerns about the general functions of the institute in the marine research and development sphere, it will now specifically refer to the protection of the marine environment.  That refers to amendment No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> The second amendment is designed to further enhance the role of the institute in the execution of their brief.  The Government intend that the institute will have a lead role in relation to Exchequer and State-sponsored funding of proposals for marine research and development.</P>
    <P>In their contributions to this debate last year, a number of Senators stressed the importance of co-ordination and control of marine research work and expertise to ensure value for money spent.  I am in full agreement with the view that there is substantial potential for success of a national programme of marine research, particularly in the context of supporting initiatives from the European Community.  This amendment illustrates and underpins the intention to provide for proper and appropriate powers and meaningful control over research and development proposals for the institute. The Bill, as drafted, and with the enhancement which this amendment represents, will ensure that there is effective control over proposals requiring funding.  The amendment will ensure that we can get the best and the most authoritative input possible into such proposals.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I commend the amendment to the House on the basis of what I have outlined.  It is my hope that it will help to reassure Senators in relation to concerns expressed earlier.</P>

      <P>Tá áthas orm bheith in ann beagáinín a chur leis an méid atá ráite agus atá déanta faoin mBille tábhachtach seo.  Tá tábhacht ar leith ag Bille den chineál seo mar go mbaineann sé go mór le hiarthar na hÉireann.  Baineann sé leis na contaetha uilig atá taobh leis an fharraige ó Dhún na nGall timpeall an chósta agus soir go Corcaigh.  Tá sé fiorthábhachtach, mar sin, go mbeadh an-tuiscint go deo againn ar an Bhille.  Nuair a bhí sé ag dul tríd an Teach seo cheana ba í an bharúil a bhí agam ná nach mbeadh mórán éifeachta leis an mBille seo mar nach bhfaca mé go mbeadh aon cheannáras as a mbeadh siad ag feidhmiú.</P>

      <P>Glacaim leis sin.  Bíonn deacrachtaí beaga i gceist le rud á chur ag imeacht ar dtús.  Ach chuir mise in iúl dóibh aréir go mbeinn ag caínt ar maidin, agus is deas an rud freisin é sin a rá leo lena chinntiú go mbeidh siad ann leis an rud a dhéanamh.  Caíthfidh mé a rá go bhfuil an fhoireann ansin an-oibleagáideach agus go bhfuil siad ag déanamh a seacht ndícheall ach de bharr nach bhfuil dóthain fostaithe ansin, tá sé an-deacair acu seirbhís iomlán cheart a chur ar fáil.</P>
      <P>Tá an leasú seo ag iarraidh go ndéanfaimis rud éigin praiticiúil chun an timpeallacht a chaomhnú.  Nuair a bhí an reachtaíocht, an Environmental Protection Agency Bill, á phlé againn cúpla seachtain ó shin, dúirt mé gur cheap mé nach raibh truailliú na farraige faoí chaibidil ag aon duine, ag aon dream ná ag aon Acht agus go raibh faitíos orm, dála Bhille Foras na Mara agus an chinn eile, idir an dá cheann nach mbeadh aon chaomhnú ná aon socrú ceart ann le haghaidh chaomhnú na farraige.  Is léir anois, de réir an méid atá curtha isteach, go bhfuil sé i gceist ag an mBille Foras na Mara go dtabharfaí aird ar leith ó thaobh truaillithe agus caomhnaithe de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa chomhthéacs sin ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Roinn na Mara as na ucht an staidéir a rinne siad agus ar foilsíodh an toradh de tuairim is <Col N="2033" /> seachtain ó shin.  Tá an-léargas tugtha sa doiciméad sin ar an méid oibre atá curtha i gcrích le tamall anuas lena chinntiú go raibh céimeanna praiticiúla á dtógáil ag an Roinn le féachaint chuige nach mbeadh aon truailliú sna farraigí atá thart timpeall orainn.  Anois, bhí sé sin tábhachtach i gcomhthéacs an ailt seo, mar chuir go leor daoine i leith Roinn na Mara nach raibh tada á dhéanamh acu agus nach raibh siad ag tabhairt aon chosaint in aghaidh truaillithe.</P>
    <P>Léiríonn an doiciméad seo go han-soiléir go bhfuil rud praiticiúil déanta agus, níos tábhachtaí fós, cruthaíonn sé nach raibh aon ghá leis an méid cainte agus cur i gcéill a rinne go leor daoine a chuaigh ar bandwagons éagsúla mar gheall ar fheilmeoireacht éisc, truailliú na farraige agus chuile shórt eile.  Cruthaíonn an doiciméad seo go bhfuil leas agus caomhnú na farraige i gceist ag Roinn na Mara agus léiríonn an toradh ar an tsuirbhéireacht agus ar an staidéar a rinneadh gur mar sin atá.  Mar sin, tá sé tábhachtach go luafaí a leithéid anseo agus go mbeadh an leasú seo scríofa isteach sa Bhille. Aontaím go hiomlán leis an mbeartas seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mBille seo cuireadh díomá orm nach bhfuil aon cheannáras cinnte ag an institiúid seo, ná daoine tarraingthe isteach acu in aon lárionad amháin le déileáil go proifisiúnta, go seasta agus go leanúnach le fadhbanna a bhaineann leis an bhfarraige ó thaobh truaillithe de agus dul chun cinn i gcoitinne. Mar shampla, tá áit lasmuigh de Brest sa Fhrainc ar thug mé cuairt air cúpla seachtain ó shin, agus a bhfuil ionad proifisiúnta do mhuintir na Fraince uilig ann.  Tá tú in ann bualadh leis na daoine is mó le rá, daoine a bhfuil na dintiúir chearta acu, a bhfuil an t-eolas acu faoi chuile shórt a bhaineann leis an bhfarraige, cosaint in aghaidh truaillithe, caomhnú agus dul chun cinn na farraige ar chuile bhealach.  Níl a leithéid againn sa tír seo agus sin é an locht is mó dá bhfuil agamsa in éadan an Bhille, mar Bhille mór iomlán i gcomhthéacs an ailt seo.</P>
    <P>Má táimid ag cur isteach leasú beag mar seo, caithfidh foireann a bheith againn, an fhoireann cheart, agus socruithe cinnte bheith ann le go bhféadfadh foireann feidhmiú agus go mbeadh a fhios <Col N="2034" /> acu go dtabharfaí aird ar cibé moladh atá le déanamh acu agus cibé toradh atá ar a gcuid oibre.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an tAire in ann a insint dom cén bhaint a bheidh ag an mBille seo leis an Environmental Protection Agency nuair a bheidh an reachtaíocht socraithe.  An bhfuil aon deighilt ann idir Foras nó Institiúid na Mara seo agus Acht chaomhnú na timpeallachta? An mbeidh siad ag obair as lámha a chéile?  An mbeídh cuid den fhoireann a bheidh ag plé leis seo ag plé freisin le gnáth-thruailliú timpeallachta nó gnáthchosaint na mara?  Chomh maith leis sin, cén socrú atá ann go mbeidh Bille na Mara ag teacht le Bille chaomhnú na timpeallachta a cuireadh tríd an Dáil le deireanas, agus an mbeidh an dá rud ag teacht le chéile?</P>
    <P>Aon rud mar sin atá le cur i ngníomh, ní mór go mbeadh socruithe cinnte ann ó thaobh foirne de.  Níl aon mhaith a rá go gcaithfear an fharraige a chaomhnú, caithfear foireann a bheith ann lena chur i gcrích.  Sin an fhadhb atá againn anseo inniu.  Chuireamar an-strus orainn féin anseo an córas aistriúcháin a chur isteach sa Teach seo.  Anois tá sé againn ach níl aon fhoireann ann le dul ina bhun.  Sin í an bhunfhadhb atá anseo ar maidin, níl aon fhoireann ann lena oibriú.  Le hais seo arís, an bhfuilimid chun leasuithe a dhéanamh ar mhaithe le leasuithe le go mbeadh siad breactha síos sa leabhar?</P>

      <P>Go raibh maith agat, a Chathaoirligh.  Is maith an rud go bhfuil me ar an aer anois.  Tá foireann sheasta ag teastáil uathu siúd mar tá a ndóthain le déanamh ag an rannóg sin.  Anois, i gcomhthéacs an cháis seo, tá mé ag rá an rud ceannann céanna agus tá faitíos orm nach gcuirfear foireann ar fáil.  Tá a fhios agam ón eolas praiticiúil atá agam ar an bhfarraige agus an chaoi a bhfuil caomhnú na farraige agus na timpeallachta ag oibriú go gcaithfidh muid a bheith cinnte de go bhfuil foireann ar fáil, go bhfuil maoiniú ar fáil le go bhféadfaí é seo a ghníomhú.

      <P>I welcome the fact that this Bill has reached Report Stage and also the fact that it is a Seanad Bill. The Bill will put in place a framework that will protect and develop marine life and the whole industry which is so important. In the amendment under section 4, subsection (1) the Minister is responding to a broad view that has been expressed in the other House and indeed by Members here.  I compliment the Minister on his readiness to accept the recommendations that have been made here.  It is very important to protect the environment so that marine life will survive.  If any of us were unaware of the importance of the legislation and the provision for protection of marine life it was very forcibly brought home to us when we saw the destruction of marine life in the Gulf War.  Most of us looked on those reports with horror.  God forbid that we would ever have a situation that would affect our marine life to that extent.  We have a lot to be grateful for.  Therefore, it is right and proper to legislate for the protection of our environment and the whole area around our coast.  It is so important for us and for future generations.  It will be some time before the full value of the legislation can be truly seen.  The amendment confirms that the Marine Institute will be the vehicle which will actually implement the technical developments and all of the important advances made in monitoring the environment and the development of marine life.  Very few of us have a full and clear picture of the <Col N="2036" /> technology and advances and how important it is to monitor disease in fish at an early stage and to monitor trends on a worldwide basis.  It is necessary to use all the technology available to protect the species at sea.  The Marine Institute is the proper vehicle for this and I welcome the Minister's response in that regard. I welcome the amendments which the Minister has so readily accepted here.</P>

      <P>I do not have anything more to add to my contribution when the Bill was being processed here in the Seanad.  I welcome the amendments and I want to point out &mdash; perhaps I should have pointed it out on the Order of Business &mdash; that we took Second Stage of this Bill here as long ago as 13 December 1989.  I was astonished when going through the files this morning to find out it was that long ago.  On that occasion I said it was important that the passage of the Bill should be expedited because of the possibility of benefiting from various forms of Community funding once this institute was in place.</P>
      <P>I want to point out this morning that this long interval of time is unacceptable. It is quite scandalous.  It is a striking illustration of the snail-like pace of processing legislation and of the urgent need for parliamentary reform.  Ironically, on the day we began Second Stage of this Bill we also debated Oireachtas reform; and I cannot think of any more forceful example of the need to reform our business here than the unacceptable pace of dealing with legislation.  That apart, the Bill is now proceeding to its final stage and I hope the institute will be set up as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for this important piece of legislation and to say how happy I am that we are now at Report Stage.  The Minister's two amendments protect the marine environment.  I think it is significant, whatever about Senator Murphy's remarks about long gaps between the different Stages of Bills, that here we are again this week with two pieces of legislation dealing with the environment, <Col N="2037" /> this Marine Institute Bill and the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, which is to come up again in a fortnight's time.  That to me is surely progress.</P>
      <P>There are worries and mixed feelings about fish farming.  Senator Pól Ó Foighil made a reference to this and I am sure the Minister has met it also.  It is, as Senator Paddy McGowan has just said, most important that we as legislators look after our seas.  We have legislation going through, but will there be the finance to put the staff and the headquarters in place for this important legislation?  Amendment No. 2 is to co-ordinate and control proposals.  Maybe &ldquo;control&rdquo; is a strong word, but I understand what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation.  This is an island nation and we do not talk often enough about the importance of the seas around us to our people.  I would worry also about a possible clash between the authority the Minister is now putting in place under this legislation and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I already had reservations about that legislation, which I made quite clear at Second Stage.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and I thank the Minister and my colleagues for putting it through this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick West</i>): First, I would like to thank the Senators for their very worthwhile contributions. While many of the suggestions that were made now and previously do not form part of the legislation, nevertheless they will be of immense benefit both to the Minister, to myself and to my officials in ensuring that the Marine Institute will be the best possible organisation for research and development in the whole area in which it is intended to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to allay the fears of Senators with regard to the relationship between the institute and the Environmental Protection Agency.  I want to reiterate that the work of the institute on marine research and development will take full account, among other criteria, of the need to protect the marine environment. It is the view of my Department that the <Col N="2038" /> work of the institute will complement the work of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I have no doubt that the two institutions will function in tandem. Indeed, I do not envisage any conflict between the statutory functions of these bodies.  I want to allay the fears of Senators in that area.</P>
    <P>I also want to state that with regard to fish farming my Department have just published a detailed account of the environmental impact to date of the most intensively fish farming areas in the State. It is known as the Gowan report and it indicates that this sector operates in harmony with its environment.  I encourage Senators to read this report.</P>
    <P>The question of the headquarters of the institute was also raised this morning. Again, I have indicated that the institute will not be an institute of bricks and mortar.  They will have a very small headquarters with a chief executive but their work will be spread among many State agencies.  The work of the institute is mainly to co-ordinate work which is being carried out in many areas independent of each other.</P>
    <P>I want to thank Senators for their contributions. Together we have ensured that we have a Bill which is well worthwhile and which will ensure that research into this very important area of marine development will be the best possible.  It will also ensure that funding will be made available both from the European Community and, indeed, from other agencies. I agree with Senators that it has taken far too long to go through the various stages but that is the situation.  Now that we have completed the debate, I have no doubt we can ensure that we will have an institute for research into this very important area, because it will be important in the future, which will be the best possible.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I take the opportunity of thanking my officials for the support, help and assistance they gave me to ensure the passage of this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before children are taken into care there should be more discussion between social workers, the local doctor and the school teachers.  That is important. I have experience of children being taken into care &mdash; I know social workers were doing a good job &mdash; based solely on the social worker's experience.  Teachers and the local doctor could be very helpful. They may not wish to get involved in such cases but they could give advice which would be very helpful.  I would like to see more co-operation in that field.</P>
      <P>It is sad that we have to have these laws; it is sad that there is so much child abuse.  We must remember that laws only work where the culprit is brought to court and fined.  Unfortunately they are not a deterrent.  They are a preventative only for those who are caught.  It may be a warning to those who are not caught if the sentences are severe enough but that does not always happen.  We must do more to bring child abuse to an end.  I do not know how we can provide more services but certainly something has to be done.  It is sad that anyone should have to be brought to court.  With the setting up of Childline and so forth, it is obvious it is a very big problem.</P>
      <P>This law is good, it is very important to have it and I welcome it but we must ensure that we have a more caring and a more preventive system so that there will be no need for this law and that children will not be abused.</P>

      <P>It would be very ungracious not to welcome this Bill, however belated it may be.  In some ways it is a useful indication of the way the Oireachtas should work, in that a very specialised piece of legislation which was introduced in the Dáil went before a select committee which worked, from my reading of sections of the debate, in a relatively non-party political fashion on Committee Stage and established a considerable consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is about time this legislation came before us.  The Children's Act, 1908 is <Col N="2040" /> too old and there are still huge areas to be discussed.  The areas which this Bill deals with and its principles are most welcome and we all subscribe to them. The fundamental principle is the paramount welfare of the child.  It would be great if we could all agree on what that meant in detail because on one issue, which I am not going to even mention this morning, the welfare of children is going to be booted around this nation for the next six weeks mostly, incidentally, by people who will never have direct responsibility for the welfare of children. However, we will hear a lot about the welfare of children over the next four to six weeks.  Nevertheless, I think we all agree that the fundamental concern of all legislation dealing with children and the care of children, is the welfare of children.  Everything else is secondary to that.  I do not think anybody disputes the intent of the greater part of this legislation to actually do that, to achieve a considerable step forward.  However, apart from being belated, there is an underlying problem that no amount of legislation can deal with.  There are two problems.</P>
    <P>The first is the adequacy or otherwise of resources to do all the things it is intended to do.  Section 5, most welcome though it is, deals with the obligation imposed on a health board to provide accommodation for homeless children and could consume millions of pounds unless, for instance, we are going to have cold, detached clinical institutional hotels for homeless children, which is precisely what homeless children do not need. They need homes, not just shelter, and therefore a fine and noble principle &mdash; I take this as one example because I have had a certain interest in the area over the years &mdash; may well not be achieved.  If adequate resources are not provided nothing maybe achieved.  We cannot legislate for resources; we can simply say over and over again to this Minister and to the Government that all the good intent, all the remarkable degree of consensus that has emerged on this legislation will be meaningless if resources are not provided to meet all the obligations and all the aspirations contained in this legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> Apart from what is contained in this Bill, there are areas of child care that are desperately in need of updating.  They are in no particular order.  I would like to remind this Minister and the Government of previous commitments to rewrite the adoption law.  We have had a single amendment to the Adoption Act which was, we were told, a prelude to a fundamental review responding to the review body on adoption.  That is as much a part of the welfare of children as what we are dealing with here and it is long promised, long delayed and long overdue and very badly needed.  I would love to hear some indication from the Minister that a review of adoption law was completed and that legislation was to be introduced quickly.  It is a major area of social reform which needs a variety of amendments.</P>
    <P>I would similarly say, perhaps with even greater passion, that the area of juvenile justice, which was originally supposed to be incorporated into a single Children's Bill was, for administrative reasons or efficiency or other restrictions, separated and brought in in separate legislation.  We have no proper juvenile justice legislation.  We still have the absolutely astonishing assumption that a child of seven and a half is capable of being criminally culpable.  There is a burden of extra proof for a child but, nevertheless, we accept the principle that a seven and a half year old child is actually capable of committing a criminal offence. Extending from that we have the astonishing situation of 15 year old and 13 year old children being locked up in a prison which is not fit for adults and which is entirely unfit for children, that is, Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    <P>I have not succeeded in getting the attention of anybody in the media or in politics in relation to the most astonishing small scandal that I have run into in recent years in the area of juvenile justice. This is a project under the general heading of Irwin House in which the much maligned religious community, the Sisters of Mercy &mdash; much maligned in the way religious orders are &mdash; handed over a convent and its grounds to a voluntary organisation which proposed to set up a <Col N="2042" /> centre for the care of disturbed adolescents. If anybody reads the newspapers in this country it is perfectly clear that one of the most painfully needed services here is a residential centre for disturbed adolescents.</P>
    <P>Let me tell this House what happened. The Sisters of Mercy handed over this building in perfect condition, and its grounds, to the Irwin House Foundation. The Irwin House Foundation tried to get funds from the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and each Department tried to say that the other Department was responsible.  Ultimately the Department of Health told Irwin House that it was really a matter for the South-Eastern Health Board.  It most assuredly was not.  It happened to be geographically located in the area of concern of the South-Eastern Health Board, but it was meant to be a national service.  If we are to have a situation where national services, because of their geographical location, become the responsibility of a single health board without funding, then we will have a ridiculous situation on our hands.  Not only did the Sister of Mercy offer this premises free of charge and in good condition, they offered to commit between £70,000 and £100,000 a year in the early years of this operation because they believed Irwin House filled a need. It would have been a specific clear alternative to the disgraceful practice of locking up children in Mountjoy Prison.  Our Government, the previous Government, the South-Eastern Health Board and the Department of Education failed miserably to respond to that proposal and that whole idea has now been dropped.  It is an absolute disgrace.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have told the story as Irwin House told it to me and they have not got any other version from any Government Department.  At least we have now got a public response about Irwin House because Irwin House was buried under a succession of carpets and Government Departments for the last number of years.  It is nothing short of <Col N="2043" /> a disgrace.  The individual concerned was among the most competent, qualified, committed people to be in charge of the work of attempting to heal the wounds of disturbed adolescents.  I would be delighted and excited, as they say, if the Minister would actually reply in detail and explain why the Irwin House project did not take off.</P>
      <P>There are suggestions of extraordinary petty inter-bureaucratic wrangling about who was responsible for what, I believe Governments are responsible for what happens in this country and they should make things happen.  We need an answer on that.  The reason I raised it is because of the fact that week after week children are locked up in Mountjoy Prison.  While it is more than reasonable to welcome what is in this Bill, and there is a lot of good in it, the fundamental question in the implementation of this legislation and other legislation is the question of the goodwill of those who are responsible for implementing it.  The sad story of Irwin House and the indifference both of politics and the media to the story does not say much for the importance of children in our society.</P>
      <P>There are other aspects of the way we deal with our children that are not good pointers towards our concern.  The level of child benefit is significantly lower than it is in many countries towards whom we are inclined to adopt attitudes of smug superiority because of what we call our commitment to family life.  One of the great Irish contraditions is the fact that our commitment to family life is largely rhetorical and rarely translates into hard cash.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The support services for families that we provide through our taxes are limited. The support services for children are limited. Our child benefit system is limited, inadequate and underfunded.  I would be happy to accept a more discriminatory form of child benefit, a generous level of child benefit, generous by multiplying it by a factor of two to three, which was taxed.  That would represent a far better system.  Our level of support for families with large numbers of children is remarkably poor and is a direct contradiction of <Col N="2044" /> what we claim to be the dominant ethos of our society.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear Senator Farrell refer to the issue of taking children into care. While I would not disagree with a detail of what is in this legislation, I am always wary of experts.  I would claim, with the arrogance of ten years of Irish politics, to be an expert on a number of matters myself.  I do not like the idea of experts interfering in other people's lives unless it is done in a clear, open and unchallengeable fashion.  Some people have suggested that the procedures for taking children into care are so complicated and so intimidating that most families, particularly where parents were of a restricted educational background, would be so intimidated they would not even know how to contest the case.  On the general issue of putting children into care, I would simply cry warning that we must be careful not to allow experts to run away with us.</P>
    <P>There are two kinds of experts.  On the issue of child sexual abuse it has taken us ten years to admit that such exists in this country.  The irony is &mdash; and it is one people ought to address on the issue of child sexual abuse &mdash; that most of what we are learning about child sexual abuse is being told to us by adults who were sexually abused at a time when some would have us believe this country was a shining model of virtue in western Europe 20 or 30 years ago.  Let us remember that.  The adults who are now telling us the shameful stories of child sexual abuse were children at the time when this country was supposed to be a model of virtue.</P>
    <P>There are also other sorts of disturbing perceptions of child sexual abuse.  I have often given an example of one in this House, because I want Government Ministers to be aware of it.  I will leave it anonymous because I would not like the individual to be identified.  At an association meeting I attended in my political capacity I was sitting in the back row and somebody raised the question of children coming home late at night in a certain area out of which came threats to young girls, out of which came child sexual abuse.  A Garda superintendent who was present said he did not like this thing <Col N="2045" /> being blown up too much because a lot of the talk about child sexual abuse was being put about by people who were seeking to undermine the sanctity of the family in Irish life.  He said that &ldquo;We in the Garda know that most sex offences against children are committed by homosexuals&rdquo;. A senior officer of the Garda Sióchána said that in public at a meeting. It was not my business to contradict him there because I was there in a capacity where it would not have been proper.  I have never named the man nor have I ever identified him.  I am not even saying whether it happened in Cork, Dublin or anywhere else.  I am simply saying that it represents a perception of the problem that is very different.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that many of the voluntary organisations dealing with child care have emphasised the need to ensure that the gardaí who deal in this area are adequately and properly trained.  It is a pity that every time we extend the responsibilities the Garda have and make a fuss of them we have to raise a fuss then about the need to have them trained. Some years ago the whole issue of properly training gardaí to deal with rape victims was gone through here.  Of course, it was wrong.  It was not their fault that they were not trained.</P>
    <P>Could we for once get away from reactive policy and have a thought out policy which says: right, if we want people to do the following things, then we train them to do the following things.  We simply do not send around a circular letter saying, from some day next month you are now responsible for X, Y and Z, go and do it.  Could we think it through and make the resources available to train people?  The Garda in most areas of social need do a remarkable job.  As I have often said, in dealing with some of the people I have dealt with earlier in my life particularly homeless people, they have shown a capacity to be compassionate and flexible that many of the statutory caring services never seem to be able to show.  I am not criticising the Garda. I am simply saying they are hopelessly under-resourced and hopelessly under-funded.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other areas in this legislation that deserve a little more <Col N="2046" /> scrutiny.  I do not want to get involved in what is necessarily Committee Stage work, but I will mention a few.  First, there is the apparent deliberate exclusion of relatives of a child from the payment of foster care allowance.  I do not know who thought that up.  I do not know what motivates it.  I would have thought the most ideal foster parent for a child &mdash; I am not making a professional judgment &mdash; the most obvious place to start, would be within the extended family of the child.  If we are to suggest, for instance, that the unemployed couple who are the aunt or uncle of a child in need of foster care are expected to take on foster care without the support of a foster care allowance which is paid to a non-relative, then I need an explanation of the logic of that position.  I would be very happy to hear it.</P>
    <P>A number of people have raised with me &mdash; and I am sure the Minister is aware of the objection &mdash; the need to make separate applications to the courts for care orders and supervision orders so as to allow the court to grant a care order or not on the basis of the evidence present and, likewise, to grant a supervision order, because it would be better if separate hearings had to be held and if the orders could be dealt with separately.</P>
    <P>There are issues about the review plans, long term care, etc. that are better dealt with on Committee Stage.  I would like to bring one specific section to the attention of the Minister, because it looks like a classic bid of the State legislating for everybody else but ducking its own responsibilities.  I refer to section 56, under the heading &ldquo;Children's Residential Centre&rdquo;.  The section says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Children's residential centre&rdquo; means any home or other institution for the residential care of children in the care of health boards or other children who are not receiving adequate care and protection excluding&mdash;</P>
    <P>The list is remarkable.  It begins with: &ldquo;(a) an institution managed by or on behalf of a Minister of the Government or a health board.&rdquo;.  As far as child care legislation is concerned, children's residential centres do not include children's residential <Col N="2047" /> centres if they are owned or managed by the State or by a health board.  What an extraordinary idea.  We are going to say that everybody else must meet all these wonderful standards but the State is excluded.  My understanding is that this amendment surfaced quite late in the other House and may not even have been adequately debated there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, then the information I have is incorrect on that specific issue.  I quote again from the list of exclusions from section 56 of the Bill:</P>
      <P>(b) an institution in which a majority of the children being maintained are being treated for acute illnesses,</P>
      <P>(c) an institution for the care and maintenance of physically or mentally handicapped children,</P>
      <P>(d) a mental institution within the meaning of the Mental Treatment Acts, 1945 to 1966,</P>
      <P>The least the Minister can do is explain the logic particularly behind paragraph (a).  I do not want to get involved in a Committee Stage debate, but there is a principle involved in this, which is that we propose to legislate for children's residential centres and we stick in a proposal which excludes all those run by the State. Is it that the State does not want to have to meet the expense of bringing these centres up to the standards it wants everybody to come up to?  Is it that the State does not believe that its own institutions would meet these standards, or what? It is a practice, incidentally, that is not confined to the Department of Health. It is the same ridiculous practice which allows the Office of Public Works to plank buildings where they like, when they like, without any reference to planning laws.  It is the same legislation which operates in a number of areas and which leaves the State exempt from the requirements everybody else has to meet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go on at length on the detail of this Bill.  I understand that a number of my colleagues will be introducing a series of amendments.  But I <Col N="2048" /> would like to hear from either this Minister or some Minister not just the intricacies of this Bill, which would be most welcome, but some news on what we are going to do about the scandal of juvenile justice and what we are going to do about the report of the Adoption Review Body, which is beginning to gather enormous amounts of dust on enormous numbers of shelves and which is desperately in need of a legislative response.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, notwithstanding the argumentative tone of much of what I had to say, I welcome the Bill, but it will only be as good as the money that is available to make it work.  I look forward to future budgets in which specific and substantial provision is made for the implementation of this legislation. However, given the niggardly attitude of this and previous Governments to obvious areas of child need, particularly in the area of mental handicap, one does not have any reason to be optimistic.</P>

      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister, Deputy Treacy, to the House, and this long awaited Child Care Bill.  I believe it is fair to say that more attention has been given over the past couple of decades to the development of economic policy than to the development of social policy.  In general terms we do not tend to have social policy: we have a series of <i>ad hoc</i> responses to emerging crises.  We saw that only this week &mdash; the Government have tactics, not strategy. We do not really have a social policy which contains, controls and deals with all of the major issues.  We have a kind of string bag full of holes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this Child Care Bill is the begining of the development of thoughtful and comprehensive social policy, and is the legislation to express that social policy. Now is the time to start getting the pieces into place.  We are standing in the centre of massive demographic and social change with encompasses change in the way we live, change in the pattern of family life and change in the problems facing our young people and, at the other end of the spectrum, our older people. <Col N="2049" /> We need to start addressing the complex issues emerging and we need to start creating a fabric of sensitive and progressive social policy.  If this Bill is the beginning of that process it is to be welcomed; it is also to be welcomed because it is a considerable step forward in an area long overdue for legislative attention.</P>
    <P>It is good that this Bill defines a child as a person up to 18 years of age.  That means some steps can be taken to minimise the unconnectedness of after care, because up to now young people have been disgorged into the system and the basic message they were getting was: OK, kids, you are all grown up now, go and survive as best you can because you do not fit into our categories any more.  That, we must hope, is no longer the message they are going to get, that now the system will continue to have some responsibility towards them and some interest in seeing that they successfully make that transition, hopefully, to gainfully employed adulthood.</P>
    <P>The Bill has good balance in many of its provisions, a good balance between the interest of children and the interest of parents and others.  One area which has been mentioned already is certainly unclear, and that is the question of resources.  The Bill is saying, let us build in a set of provisions for our children, but we are not saying how much that will cost, where the money is to come from or &mdash; and I hate to think of it &mdash; even if the money can be found.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious problem.  It means that, long before the Bill ever becomes law, professionals in the field &mdash; and they have said this to me &mdash; whether they are social workers or child workers are already shrugging and doubting that it can be effective.  They say it is great to have the law, but if you do not have the personnel or the money to enforce that law your are nearly worse off rather than better off, because you are creating a social awareness that the law is meaningless and can be flouted with impunity. Laws about drunken driving have been on the books in this country for decades, but they are less than effective until enough gardaí are put on the roads with a clear enough brief to put teeth into those laws, as happened last Christmas. <Col N="2050" /> This Bill could too easily sit gathering dust if the money is not allocated immediately and on a continuing basis to give it teeth as a law.</P>
    <P>That is one criticism which could be made; but there is another criticism, not of the Bill as such, but of the way we as a society think about children and it is one I want to make at this time.  We have a very interesting pattern of child care organisations, some go back to the Victorian era, some are rooted in religious orders and some are semi-commercial. They do a very good job, or they do several different kinds of good jobs, but they are hassled and stretched and, of necessity, they concentrate on their own particular bailiwick.  For example, a child care organisation which mainly operates in Dublin's inner city is unlikely to be able to find the time to address issues of more moment to children in rural Ireland.  That is why we need a single national body to pull together all the concerns about our children and all the expertise we have built up in different areas to match those concerns.</P>
    <P>When it comes to women's issues we have such an organisation &mdash; the Council for the Status of Women, backed recently by the creation of a new Commission on the Status of Women.  We need a similar organisation for our children and we need it very badly.  We need something we could term a national children's council so that children's rights and needs can be catered for on a national level, so that there is a lobby and a voice for children, because we must remember, children have no votes.  Otherwise, we will have individual regions and agencies concerned with children's rights and it will be a case of divide and rule.  We will never evolve a policy which revives, refreshes and reinterprets our constitutional claim to cherish all of our children equally.</P>
    <P>This calls for the creation of a national children's council.  I am not suggestion that our child care agencies be homogenised. We do not want or need that. We want them to have their own individual flavour and their own sense of mission, but we need them to add up to a powerful voice represented on national issues by an umbrella body.  None of them <Col N="2051" /> would lose and all our children would gain if they could be pulled together in a council to provide a unified voice on key issues about the welfare of children in the same way as about 70 organisations participate in the Council for the Status of Women.  This comes back to funding. If the creation of such a council was not facilitated by funding it would never happen, or it would be yet another voluntary organisation outside the harsh world of influencing policy and would thereby be ignored.  If the Government were to set up an oganisation along the lines, I suggest they would have a vested and continuing interest in listening to that organisation.</P>
    <P>My call for the creation of a national council for children's welfare is part of a wider concern I have and part of a wider criticism I must make of the Bill.  It is a Bill about children at risk or about children who are already in trouble, so it addresses a certain problem.  It is not a bad Bill, but it is not a preventative Bill. You could term it a fire brigade rather than a fire prevention Bill.  It is wrong that we should be responding after the fact to the problems of children.  If we are genuinely committed to cherishing our children then it follows, as day follows night, that we must be committed also to the creation of preventative legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a move in the right direction, but in a sense it embodies a concept of childhood as something which for the majority just happens, but in a minority of cases causes problems.  I do not believe that our laws should reflect such a constrained and uncreative view of childhood. Our laws should not set out simply to mop up problems; they should enable, empower and enfranchise our young population and those who care about them and work with them.  My party, the Progressive Democrats, will be pushing strongly for the development of proper, preventative, progressive child care legislation. If our partners in Government adopt the openness and flexibility shown by Minister of State Noel Treacy over the past few months, then we can achieve wonders.  I want to put on record our appreciation of the Minister of State's contribution to this Bill when he was in <Col N="2052" /> the Department of Health and thank him for continuing it on through the Seanad today.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the imprecision of the Bill in the area of day care and sessional care.  It is only one aspect.  When this imprecision is put to public representatives or to the Department of Health officials the response is that this will be covered by regulations.  There has been no commitment in law or in fact in regard to what these regulations may be.  I will give an example of this.  The day care services committee convened by the Department of Health reported in 1985 and most if not all of the agencies and many of the individuals involved with young children submitted to that committee. It worked out regulations and guidelines for decent day care and sessional care; but I do not see the commitment &mdash; perhaps it is there &mdash; that these will be the regulations put in place, although they should be.  They might need to be updated, but they would at least represent a basic minimum.</P>
    <P>To turn to another area, there does not seem to be a basic minimum when it comes to the training of people providing child care, the training of people inspecting the premises where child care is being provided and the training of the people in the courts who take the crucial decisions about the future of children who are already in difficulties.  That is a very wide area.  There is no point in having good legislation if that legislation is to be interpreted in the courts by judges whose mind set in relation to family and children is not informed by current thinking.  Nor is there much point in allowing child care to be provided by untrained people who are, in turn, inspected by similarly untrained people.</P>
    <P>The response to queries in relation to these matters tends to be that it is a matter for regulations.  Regulations take a long time to come and they do not always reflect what legislators assumed would be the priorities for those who passed the original law.  I am very wary that all of these considerations are being shifted into some little box labelled &ldquo;regulations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am also wary about the imprecision about lists which will be housed in the <Col N="2053" /> Department of Health in relation to pre-school provision.  This has a real potential to mislead the public.  It is provided that a person running a pre-school has to notify the health board.  I am not clear what is going to happen if they do not, but I am sure the Minister will enlighten me there.  Let us say a woman is running a pre-school.  She obeys the orders, she notifies the health board, and that is fine. Somebody in the health board writes down the notification, so she is on the books.  It seems to me that if somebody in her area is thinking about sending a toddler along to that playschool that person may ring up the health board and ask if that playschool is listed with the health board.  The answer is yes, because the person running it has obeyed the law and has notified the health board.  What worries me is that the person ringing up the health board to check is convinced that the health board has approved the operation, and that is not true.  The fact that the play school may be listed with the health board is no more a validation of the operation than a listing in the telephone book would be.</P>
    <P>There would be an inspection of these premises, but the Bill does not say what the guidelines of the inspection will be. It says there will be a list of inspected premises in the Department.  That, in turn, implies that a member of the public can ring up to find out if the premises was inspected; but nobody is saying that they have been approved &mdash; in other words, you might end up with people believing a premises has been validated when in fact it has been inspected and perhaps even found wanting.  It would be very dangerous for a member of the public to send their child to a place that has been inspected but may be in the process of closing down.</P>
    <P>Another thing that concerns me is the exclusion of health board facilities from this process of inspection.  Why are they excluded?  They should be the model on which everything else is based, and it should be possible to demonstrate that by having them independently examined. It also worries me that pre-school play groups should have to pay for the privilege of being inspected.  A pre-school play group is not a restaurant with a cash flow <Col N="2054" /> to pay for inspection.  They are run on half a shoe string.  The possibility that they would have to pay for an inspection is going to put them under a certain pressure. It will not serve anybody's interests if that pressure makes people running child care facilities avoid any contact with the authorities, because one of the things we must avoid in this area is a kind of black economy child care system.</P>
    <P>I have been told of nurseries where babies are left to cry because the places are so understaffed.  I have been told of facilities where the standards of hygiene were appalling.  I presume that parents who badly need to have their children minded at a reasonable price cannot always afford to take direct action, so they tell public representatives in the hope that this will raise standards generally. I hope it does.  I hope that in future budgets we are going to see more imaginative tax breaks given for child care so that people can afford to get proper care for their children and that the people providing the care can get real money so that, they are not cutting down on staff in order to make a buck.  Tax breaks of that kind are one thing that will keep standards high; inspection without financial cost is another help.</P>
    <P>A final point.  I have been stressing that it is not satisfactory to create a legal framework without the resources to back it up.  Nowhere is this more relevant than when we look at the provision for research.  We badly need research in this area, but without money it will not happen.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to consider the points I have made.  There are other points I would like to go into in greater detail on Committee Stage, but I am hopeful that he will make the resources available and that regulations are speedily put into place so that the Child Care Bill justifies the expectations we have of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill. It reforms many necessary parts of our existing legislation to care for and protect children.  Most of my contribution will cover the area of the funding and resources that are so necessary if we are to be sure that there will be a speedy and <Col N="2055" /> co-ordinated implementation of the Bill. I will also concentrate on the whole area of child care services, particularly within the European experience or framework. But, before that, I want to cover briefly other issues which I would have liked to have seen addressed in the Bill.  One was the establishment of a child care authority. I am sorry it did not happen.</P>
      <P>One of the persistent criticisms of the Irish child care system is that there are three different Government Departments, Health, Education and Justice, responsible for providing care for children in need.  Indeed, over the last number of months, we have had repeated calls for a debate in this House on situations that have occurred regarding teenage children where judges have thrown their hands in the air in exasperation at the lack of facilities relating to problems society throws up.  That is one area I would like to have seen addressed in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The second point, which has been addressed by Senator Keogh, is the need for the establishment of the national children's council.  It would be very important in the preventative area to have evaluation and research and a national forum for debate among child care interest groups.  This was called for as far back as 1970 by the Commission on Reformatory and Industrial Schools and, again, in 1980 by the taskforce report recommending the establishment of such a council.  At the end of the day it would be cost effective as all preventative measures are.  Finally, in relation to the reform of courts, family courts with professionally trained staff would be the correct place to deal with child care cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Day after day we listen to problems about the lack of resources in our health system.  From the funding viewpoint there are shortfalls.  Senator O'Reilly itemised the cutbacks health boards will face this year.  To take the Mid-Western Health Board we are talking in terms of a cut in excess of £2 million.  Looking at resources, and taking into account that the age of responsibility has been increased to 18 years, we are aware that health boards cannot meet the expense at present where the age limit is set at 16 <Col N="2056" /> years.  What do we do now that the age limit has been increased by two years? This will not just apply to the Mid-Western Health Board, it will be the same for health boards throughout the country.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which has not been highlighted in the debate so far which relates to difficult and disturbed adolescents.  The range of staff and professional foster servicing needed for that is crucial.  We need a counselling service for children who are emotionally damaged. The community care service in my health board, consists of child care workers, social workers and specialised foster parents.</P>
    <P>I will look briefly at social workers.  We know that the points system based on the leaving certificate results for those who want to take up social work as a career is highly competitive.  Unfortunately, many of our graduates have to go to the UK for employment.  It is not as if we do not have the personnel.  We have the trained personnel and we have the commitment from our young people because they are as idealistic now as they were in the past. Many of them choose social work but, unfortunately, they cannot get employment here.  It will be very difficult to attract them back once they get knit into a system abroad where they are highly prized.</P>
    <P>When I look at the payment rate for fostering, I find it extraordinary that foster parents are expected to look after a 15 year old child for the same amount of money as for an infant which may be £35 or £36.  There is absolutely no comparison between the cost of looking after a young baby and the cost of looking after a 15 year old.</P>
    <P>I will take a specific case study in the Mid-Western Health Board area.  For a quiet, mildly mentally handicapped boy the foster parent subsidy is nowhere near the cost of maintaining him.  It is not just physical needs, it is not just food, clothing and shelter but the whole socialisation and recreational aspect of trying to integrate that boy into society.  Obviously, this must be taken up.  I hope the Minister will be able to move towards a tiered system between the £35 or £36 for the <Col N="2057" /> infant and the cost for caring for a teenager. Any parent could tell you that it is just not realistic.</P>
    <P>At the moment it is very difficult for community care, fostering or residential care to cater for difficult children.  In particular teenagers cannot be placed.  There are borderline psychiatric cases.  It is sad but a reality, as research has shown, that the cause is nearly always related to home circumstances, abuse, the whole environment. It is not just hereditary and in nearly all cases it relates to environment.</P>
    <P>Under the present national climate responsibilities will be given to social workers, under the various health boards with appropriate guidelines, to work with child abuse.  If one is to think realistically in terms of what would be needed in the Mid-Western Health Board area, two child care workers are needed immediately. The cost, between equipment and office accommodation, would work out between £50,000 to £60,000.  The moneys that have been allocated go towards assessment.  That is fine.  Obviously, assessment is the first stage but there is a void after assessment and that is in follow-up care.  There is no extra money for that.  That is the most difficult part.  I am sad, that not just in this Bill but in other legislation, there is no follow-up.  This means funds.</P>
    <P>When one thinks of the £1 million that was set aside to implement the provisions of the Bill after it is passed, and takes the Mid-Western Health Board area, which caters for 10 per cent of the population, we are talking in terms of 10 per cent of that £1 million, or £100,000 which is very small to allow for assessment and follow-through to be carried out.  A certain percentage cannot stay in foster homes. They must go to residential care centres for specialist treatment.</P>
    <P>There are two residential care centres, both convent based, in the city of Limerick. To take one, there are 12 children there.  There are four staff plus a sister in charge.  Going through the full working day and night the ratio works out at 1:12. That ratio is fine if we are talking in terms of normal children but it is certainly not fine if we are talking about sexually abused children.  A 1:2 ratio is needed to help those children.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> Last week when I was talking about Adapt House in Limerick on the Adjournment, which caters for deserted wives and their families, I said that they had the same problem because most of their resources at the moment go towards the counselling of sexually abused children.  They are crying out for help also.  They are a voluntary body who get funding of something like £28,000 from the health board and have to raise up to £60,000 annually from voluntary contributions. It is not just health boards but voluntary bodies who are taking in the needy.  They are looking after many cases which could end up the responsibility of the health boards.</P>
    <P>Looking at the rates internationally for fostering they are far higher.  Because of the importance of the child in Irish society, three-quarters of children go into fostering.  It is a very high rate.  I hope this will continue and that fostering will not decrease because that foster parents cannot exist on that miserly £35.  The figure for the Mid-Western Health Board is that 69 per cent go to fostering.  Of the 90 children they would have about 30 to 40 would relate specifically to maternity cases, where for a six week period they would be fostered before they are put up for adoption.</P>
    <P>That is quite easy for foster parents. They look for an infant because it is economically viable and they like to work with young children.  If we are talking about fostering for the eight, nine or ten year old sexually abused child we are really talking about a different child altogether. We are talking about a need for a far greater resources and about another hidden cost, the resources needed for training programmes that are organised by a senior social worker in the Limerick area on a weekly basis for a five week span for those foster parents.  Those programmes are run on a voluntary basis at the moment.  It is a credit to the youngsters working in the health board that they actually turn up for five nights a week for five weeks to do the work.  They are told that if possible they will get time off.  They do not take the time off because they are so committed to their work.  It is not to be sneezed at that there is this tremendous voluntary commitment from <Col N="2059" /> young social workers in a Mid-Western Health Board region, who will actually do the work to help those foster parents cope with the sexually abused children they take out.</P>
    <P>People throughout the country do not realise that this happens within health boards.  It is something I hope the Minister will consider.  That enthusiasm cannot last forever.  It is there now because of the age group of those young social workers.  They will marry, have their own family commitments, they will have inroads on their free time and they will not be able to continue, week in and week out, to give their services.  It is not the money aspect of it, it is the time aspect.  It is important for the Minister to see that.  I hope he appreciates it.</P>
    <P>We will stay in the Limerick area for a moment and look at preventive measures.  Moyross, with which people will be familiar, has a huge percentage of unemployed people but there is no health board creche there.  Over the last couple of years there has been an increase from 24 per cent to 27 per cent of single parent households, and 11 per cent to 11.5 per cent of births to single parents when you add to that the families of deserted wives and the families of men in prison you are talking about one in every four children in that housing estate being children of single parents.  Who can argue against the fact that those children need pre-school help if they are to compete satisfactorily with other children?  There are no pre-school facilities in that area for all those children.  That ratio is enormous.</P>
    <P>I took the local area because we must get down to specifics.  When we get down to resources we are talking in terms of the reality of life in one health board. Has the Minister any information on child care and pre-schools?  My information is that the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child has not been ratified by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been signed and will be ratified later, as is normal with any international convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know about the later aspect of it.  The Minister <Col N="2060" /> might address it.  Article 41.2.1º and 2º of our Constitution state:</P>
      <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
      <P>The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</P>
      <P>We are talking in terms of 1990.  It is an economic necessity for those single parent mothers to work to support their children.  It is an economic necessity within the family structure for women to go out to work.  When we look to the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child we see that Articles 18, 19, 20 and 21 refer to this.  I will not hold up the proceedings by reading all the material there.  In relation to Article 18 (3) it is stated quite specifically that:</P>
      <P>State parties shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that children of working parents have the right to benefit from child care services and facilities for which they are eligible.</P>
      <P>That is spelt out there.  I look forward to having the Government spell out the measures they will take to ensure that children of working parents have the right to benefit from child care services.</P>
      <P>In relation to where we stand in Ireland in regard to child care, I will give some statistics which, unfortunately, are from 1988.  They will probably have changed slightly, but these are all that are available. In 1988, 23 per cent of women&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely) Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. R. Kiely)</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Senator quoting from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quoting from &ldquo;Child Care in the European Communities, 1985 to 1990.&rdquo;  There were two and half pages devoted to Ireland in relation to child care services, the number of children involved, etc.  In 1988 23 per cent of women with a child under ten were employed, the lowest level in the Community and 8 per cent were unemployed.  Women with children from <Col N="2061" /> zero to four had rather higher employment rates than women with children between the ages of five to nine, 25 per cent compared to 20 per cent, with unemployment rates being similar.</P>
      <P>The employment rate among childless women aged 20 to 39 was 67 per cent. Those statistics speak for themselves. Over 30 per cent of employed women with a child under ten have part-time jobs.  The average hours of work are ten to 19 for mothers employed part-time, 40 to 49 hours for mothers employed fulltime and 30 to 39 hours for all employed mothers.  I state that because things are changing in this country.  We have to look to the hidden reasons &mdash; indeed they are no longer hidden &mdash; why we have such a small percentage of women employed in comparison with the ratio I have given for the childless woman.  The reason is that the child care services are not there.</P>
      <P>When we look at where we stand regarding publicly-funded child care services, we find there is no pre-primary schooling centre in Dublin, and approximately 40 centres for travelling children, which we are pleased about.  Fewer than 2 per cent of children under three attend publicly-funded services, going to mixed age centres which take children up to six.  The services are provided entirely by private organisations and are not available for children with employed parents. I accept that it is essential that there are social work services for children who are severely disadvantaged or at risk.  That is the fact in relation to this.  I agree that those children &mdash; I referred to the position in Moyross &mdash; are most needy but it spells out where we stand.</P>
      <P>Five or six day nurseries are provided by public sector employers for their workers.  Private services do not as yet have to be approved and registered, I presume that it was the Irish Government that had an input in drawing this up for Child Care in the European Communities. At that stage it seemed that there would be registration because private services do not, as I said, as yet, have to be approved and registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that registration is not covered in this Bill.  The sad thing is that there are no statistics for private nurseries and mixed aged centres. <Col N="2062" /> There are no statistics for family day care and own home care because registration is not needed.  Are we to live in a void for the next number of years not knowing where the services exist because they do not have to be registered?</P>
    <P>There is a very big difference between registration and notification, particularly in the context of our people who, unfortunately, do not do things until they have to do them.  From a voluntary viewpoint, we really fall very short in going in and signing for things where there is no pressure on us to do so by law.  How can the Government do anything about providing child care services if they do not even know what is available at the moment?  Will they go just on notification, where you do not have specific registration?</P>
    <P>Another interesting thing is that most playgroups receive no public funds and because there is no registration, there is no information on the number of play-groups or the number of children attending them.  An estimate in 1987 suggested it is quite a sizeable figure &mdash; that 22,500 children, about 12 per cent of children between the ages of three and five, attend playgroups, and I am sure that figure has increased since then because the number of part-time workers has increased, especially women, who have to work for economic reasons.  It is stated here that the Government have recommended that child care services be provided for workers in the public sector with the Government providing physical facilities and staff running costs.  I would like to hear the Minister's response to that.  I hope the Second Commission on the Status of Women &mdash; I am sure they are very aware of this &mdash; will take up this issue and address it very thoroughly.  I hope it will be one of the main planks of their discussion while they are in session and that we will have at least an interim report very quickly.</P>
    <P>I turn now briefly to the area of quality. According to the European Community, there should be common and consistent principles and standards in this area and services providing safe and secure care should be available to children of all ages and should meet the full range of children's needs.  I am speaking not just <Col N="2063" /> of the care area but the education areas too.  Workers should have comparable pay, conditions, status and training, and the cost to parents should be consistent. A central objective policy on quality must ensure equal access for all children to that good quality.  The assessments of quality should include the experiences of children but it should also take into account parents, workers and the local communities.  I reiterate what I said a few moments ago about the child care workers.  Their work should be given the importance it deserves.  EC objectives are that appropriate pay, conditions, basic training and training for all these play group workers should be at the same level as for teachers of older children.</P>
    <P>As a secondary teacher, I find it very sad when I have to cope with illiteracy, emotional problems and all the various problems that should have been tackled down the line.  I hope within the pre-school area that that will be looked into. The child care workers should be of such quality that many of the problems that emerge later could be addressed at an early stage so that I believe that to prevent problems arising at a later stage, you must start at grass root level.  The Government have a unique opportunity here in the Child Care Bill to tackle the problem of lack of registration.  We really do not know where we are going.  Child care services should be responsible for a wide range of local needs.  I again emphasise that we need close relationships between the child care workers, parents and local communities.</P>
    <P>Sending children to playschool is a costly business, I know parents want to ensure that their children get good care and education but in most countries these costs are borne disproportionately by women &mdash; mothers have to bear huge loss of earnings or child care workers effectively subsidise costs because they have no wages and bad conditions.</P>
    <P>The key issue, therefore, is not whether we can afford the costs, because they already exist, but how these costs are allocated in particular between parents, employers and society.  If the Government are to have a comprehensive policy towards child care provision, then the <Col N="2064" /> parents, the employers and the State must have consultations.  I will not go into detail about the employers aspect but they have a contribution to make.  They are reaping the benefits and they have a contribution to make to ensure child care facilities are provided for their workers. Funding could be shared between employers, parents and the State.</P>
    <P>An interesting point is that structural funds can be applied for in this area.  We do not hear anything about this but it is written here in black and white that there is a second &mdash; and now there is a third &mdash; equal opportunities programme and that Structural Funding can be used to support the development of child care services. The Minister may ask if I think he has a crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. I would like the Minister to tell me whether he has looked for the Structural Funds.  It is stated here, and I repeat, that it has become clear that Structural Funding can be used to support the development of child care services and that such services are an integral requirement for achieving the objectives set out for the funds promoting the development of rural areas.  A main task for the third equal opportunities programme is to ensure that the Structural Funds begin to make a significant contribution to child care.</P>
    <P>Until I read this I had not seen or heard of any application from the Government to Europe within the framework we drew up in the mid-western area.  Shannon Development have been involved in the national plan but there was no reference to this at that particular time.  I remember discussing it at our local authority meetings and asking if anything could be done in that area.  I asked for this to be included without knowing it was a clear objective within the Structural Funds framework. They tell us this can be achieved in two ways.  First, the Commission should use the opportunities available to initiate child care programmes &mdash; they refer to various seminars and rural child care programmes. The aim of these programmes would be to increase awareness of child care applications for Structural Funding. The Minister must submit our applications for Structural Funding; second, to support the development of services in <Col N="2065" /> poorer regions &mdash; God knows we qualify as a poor region and we are getting poorer by the minute the more peripheral we become; and third, to develop innovative models of child care.  There is a second reference there to the fact that the relevant Commission Directorate should co-ordinate to support a programme to inform and sensitise all relevant individuals and organisations at all levels in member states to the potential uses of Structural Funding for the development of child care services.  That is three times in one sentence we have this recommendation from Europe which suggests to me that there have not been applications for something I believe is essential.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to ensure that we are in there with the other countries who, at this stage I am sure have plenty of funding available to them, getting this funding.  If we do, we will not have this problem about health board funding and the frustration of wondering whether this Child Care Bill can be implemented satisfactorily because there is a lack of funding. The Commission recently announced a first step in this process.  It is doing everything it can to facilitate.  The Commission proposed a new programme, New Opportunities for Women, shortened to NOW.  This will focus on training and enterprise and will be funded from the Structural Funds and includes the possibility of financial assistance for the development of child care services to support the general objectives of the programme.</P>
    <P>I hope I have been constructive and that the Minister will be able to tell us that he has received funding from Europe to ensure that our children will be looked after at the most vulnerable stage of their lives, the preschool stage, to ensure that existing and future problems can be addressed and that all the social problems Senator Keogh referred to that we are slow and hesitant to address will be a priority issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I want to welcome the Minister to the House and to congratulate him on his personal input into this Child Care Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this most important Bill on <Col N="2066" /> children's rights.  The Government are to be congratulated as this is a tremendous step forward in providing for the welfare and protection of children who are at risk.  I welcome the Bill as its purpose is to update the law in relation to the care of children, in particular children who are being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, or who are at risk in any other way.  The majority of Irish homes are happy homes.  Children born into them can be assured that they will be protected and provided for, loved and reared to adulthood by good decent parents.  However, there are a small number of problem situations where children are born into families where they are not welcome or where abnormal situations arise.  This Bill, hopefully, will resolve all such situations.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation in relation to the care of children is largely based on the Children Act, 1908.  It has served us well.  Many of its provisions are still in use today.  However, there have been sweeping changes in society in the intervening period which need to be reflected in our child care legislation.  Our political and administrative structures have changed.  New values and attitudes have evolved.  There is a greater awareness of the rights of the child.  While we live today in a more enlightened society, I am sorry to say there continue to be unhappy and deprived children within our midst. I understand that at any time about 2,600 children are in the care of our eight health boards.  Many are in care because their parents are unable to look after them, whether due to marital breakdown or other family crisis.  Most of these children are re-united with their families after a period of time.  Others, unfortunately, remain in care for years.  There is another group of children who come into care in more dramatic circumstances.  They are the victims of child abuse, whether it be physical, emotional or sexual.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that in 1989 the total number of confirmed cases of all sorts of child abuse known to our health boards was approximately 1,300, of which the number of confirmed cases of sexual abuse was about 500.  These figures represent an increase of some fourfold in five years.  The Department <Col N="2067" /> of Health has not, as yet, completed the collection from health boards of figures in respect of 1990.  All the indications are that the total number of confirmed cases in 1990, including child sexual abuse, will show a further increase.</P>
    <P>The figures now indicate the need for up to date and good legislation to protect children who are at risk.  While we must have the legal means to protect children whose health or welfare is at risk, it is also important to safeguard children and families from excessive interference by the State.  Many of us who have been in public life over the last number of years are aware of frightening situations where children living in unbelievable circumstances are sometimes so traumatised and emotionally shocked that they cannot speak about their experience at home or to anybody in particular.  They are unable to communicate with the police, the health centre or any other person about these happenings.  They are usually too terrified of the abuser to do so in many cases.  These situations have come to light through the school teacher or an astute neighbour.  It is only then it is brought to the attention of the health authority and the Garda.  In many cases this does not happen for the simple reason that people do not want to become involved.  This leaves the children in an uncalled for situation.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the care of these children the main thrust of this Bill is to place a statutory duty on the health board to ensure that the welfare of these children is being provided for and that they are given full protection.  The health boards will be encouraged by this Bill, as it will give them extra powers to provide child care and family support services.  It will enable them to move more quickly if children are in serious danger and to call on the assistance of the Garda.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, seriously neglected or sexually abused in the care of or under the supervision of health boards.  It will introduce arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services and revise provisions in relation to the inspection and approval of residential centres <Col N="2068" /> for children.  All these provisions are well intentioned and required, but funding must be provided in order to make sure that the procedures laid down will work. As a result of this Bill the health boards will now have a duty and responsibility to protect and accommodate these children. The Garda can intervene immediately in a family where a child is under threat and remove that child to the care of the health board.</P>
    <P>I am appealling to the Minister to ensure that the necessary finances are made available to the health boards for the provision of accommodation and the cost of care for children.  It has been brought to my notice over the past few months in Tralee, where children of a very low age group have been involved in petty shoplifting, and vandalism, that the Garda have not got suitable accommodation in which they could be placed. If it is within the remit of this Bill I would like to see sufficient accommodation created where these children could be placed.  Most of them come from broken homes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that day care means the right of the family to remain a family. It is to be appreciated that it is not the Minister's intention to destroy or to try to break up the family unit but to give the health boards responsibility to give support and assistance to families, especially families in difficulties.  In all but the more difficult cases it will leave the child at home, but under the watchful eye of the health board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of a committee within each health board area made up of representatives of voluntary bodies, in particular child care organisations, who should include a district nurse, community workers and teachers &mdash; people with a working knowledge of the area.  This committee will be set up with the intention of advising the health boards of their duty under the Bill to carry out periodic reviews of the child care and family support services within the particular area.  Here again I believe these committees should be grant aided in order to help them to provide a good service.</P>
    <P>A major portion of the Bill deals with the responsibility of the court under the <Col N="2069" /> heading &ldquo;care proceedings&rdquo;.  In cases where health boards are seeking the custody of a child they apply to the court for a care order in respect of the child.  A care order would suspend the parents' rights to custody of the child and place him or her in the custody of the health board.  To receive a care order the health board must satisfy the court that the child has been subjected to assault, ill-treatment, serious neglect or has been sexually abused, or that the child's health has been at risk or is being impaired or seriously neglected.  They must also satisfy the court that the child requires care or protection which he or she is unlikely to receive unless he or she is under the care of the health board.  In granting the care order the court must take into consideration the rights and duties of the parents under the Constitution.  More importantly, they must take into consideration the natural rights of the child. This care order would remain in force until the child reaches the age of 18 years or until it was successfully challenged by the parents or discharged by the courts because of the changing circumstances.</P>
    <P>This provision in the Bill is to be very much welcomed.  The health board can also apply for a supervision order which enable the board to have the child visited at his or her home to ensure that he or she is being cared for.  The court could also have the power to direct the parents to bring the child to a day centre, child guidance clinic, hospital or other service or help which the child might need.  A supervision order would apply for 12 months and could be renewed.  I would like to know how the Minister will carry out this provision.</P>
    <P>The court will also be responsible for a number of other matters, including the right of parents or other persons to have access to the children in the care of health boards.  The follow up provisions are also covered in the Bill and I welcome them. What happens to children in the care of the health boards or under the supervision of the pre-school services?  What happens about the standards and administration of children's residential centres which will come under the Minister for Health and, in some cases, the Minister <Col N="2070" /> for Education, something which is satisfactory and adequate?</P>
    <P>The Bill provides also for the fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment for anyone selling solvent-based products to children who use them for glue sniffing. We have seen over the past few years where a number of children and teenagers died from sniffing these products. This is provision will be welcomed by parents and guardians.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill is up to date and will go a long way towards ensuring that the rights of children are maintained and provided for.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill.  Section 1 states that the Bill be known as the Child Care Act and empowers the Minister for Health to bring the various provisions into effect by order.  It is the intention that this Bill, when enacted will be brought into operation as quickly as possible.  Section 2 defines various uses of the Bill, of which the most important is the definition of child.  At present, the Children Act, 1908, as amended, defines a child as a person under 15 years of age.  This means, in effect, that a person over 16 years of age may not be placed in health care, regardless of how desirable this might be in his or her interests.  There is a growing number of older children who would benefit from being in care, but cannot be admitted under the present law.  It is proposed, therefore, to define &ldquo;child&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill as a person of up to 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>The main effect of this Bill will be to raise to 18 years the age up to which health boards will be responsible for children and the age to which children may be admitted into care.</P>
    <P>Section 3 places a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving essential care and protection.  This is one of the most important provisions of the Bill. It imposes a clear obligation on health boards to provide child care and family support services so as to assist parents in caring for their children and to prevent children having to be placed in care. These services may include social work support for families at risk, counselling and advice services, pre-school services, <Col N="2071" /> home help and homemaker services, child guidance, day fostering, family resource centres and special projects for the young homeless, and other at-risk groups.  Thus, the emphasis is on providing support and assistance so that children can remain at home.  Only in exceptional cases are children to be taken into care.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with voluntary care.  It will enable health boards to receive into care, without reference to the courts, orphans and abandoned children, and, with parental consent, children whose parents are unable to care for them, for example, due to serious illness, sudden bereavement or family breakdown.  At present, about half of the children in care are there on a voluntary basis rather than under court orders.  While there has been some increase in recent years in the number of children entering care through the courts, I expect a significant proportion of admissions will continue to be on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>Voluntary bodies have played, and will continue to play, an important part in our child care services, in particular in the region of residential facilities.  I acknowledge this excellent work.  I wish to make special reference to the Nazareth Home in Tralee, where the Sisters of Mercy over many years have provided an excellent service.  This is now in the care of an excellent lay staff but they find themselves with serious financial problems.  At the moment they are catering for approximately 40 children but the subsidy and subvention they are receiving from the health board is certainly not covering the upkeep of the property.  At this time they are running on a substantial overdraft.  I appeal to the Minister to see if there is any way around their situation.  They are dedicated, work many hours outside the call of duty and, on most occasions, are not paid for the overtime they do.  This is wrong.  It is all very satisfactory while there are committed people, but we could reach a point where we will not get this type of worker.  For that reason I appeal to the Minister to try to resolve this situation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is up to date and will go along way towards ensuring that <Col N="2072" /> the rights of children are maintained and provided for adequately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to welcome the Bill and welcome the Minister to the House.  I am glad of the opportunity to make some comments on the Bill.  I note that it will be the function of the health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not getting adequate care and protection.  While this is welcome &mdash; I will deal with that in greater detail especially with regard to the statutory review procedures &mdash; it would be remiss of me not to indicate the serious problems with regard to the budget which the health boards have at the moment, and the likelihood that the Bill will not come into effect due to the fact that inadequate provisions will be made to introduce the changes therein.</P>
      <P>I would like to highlight a situation in the mid-west region, and especially in Limerick, where it is not possible to provide a service to a standard acceptable to the health board because of the allocation received.  Because of the financial constraints and cutbacks being imposed by the Minister for Health, not only this year but for a number of years, it is now impossible to achieve a reasonable bed provision either in the Limerick Regional Hospital or in Croom Orthopaedic Hospital. This means we have an appalling problem in our area with regard to the Limerick Regional Hospital in terms of nursing and medical care for the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are problems of long waiting lists.  I know of cases of people waiting entry to hospital for several months, up to six to eight months.  These people are often in distress and are affected by the wait that is enforced upon them because of inadequate moneys being available to provide the facilities which are necessary, desirable and expected in any democratic State.  The intolerable waiting lists are there because of a lack of important and essential specialties, such as, for example, cardiology and a lack of sufficient theatre facilities and the appalling out-patients facilities and accident emergency services.  I know of a case where somebody was sent to the Limerick Regional Hospital for treatment <Col N="2073" /> and was waiting for six hours to be admitted. The response of the hospital authorities was that they had to give priority to the patients who arrived in the hospital having regard to their need for treatment. However, one can just imagine the stress being caused to patients admitted to a hospital in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>It is envisaged in the Bill that the health boards will provide adequate care and protection for the children but to enable the health boards to do so the Minister must provide the necessary funding.  If he does not do that, the Bill will be useless. The health boards are certainly not in a position at the moment to divert resources for the provision of facilities.  I would like to emphasise that there is no point in passing this Bill if the resources are not provided by the Minister for Health to implement its very necessary provisions.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest a recommendation that the health boards be responsible for the statutory review procedures.  Duties should be allocated to the health boards by those responsible for that review procedure.  I suggest that an initial review should be completed on every child within 40 days of being taken into care and a review should take place in care at specific periods of four, six or eight months.  The purpose of each review should be to ensure that every reasonable effort is being made to provide a long term placement plan for the child who has been placed in the care of a health board.  This would be consistent with the child's interest.  At each review hearing, the health board should consider information from the parent, parents or guardian of the child, the care provider, the relevant health board personnel and the child itself if over the age of 12, and of any other person or agency the health board might consider of assistance in carrying out the review.</P>
    <P>The health board should also provide for attendance at a conference of the following people, at least 10 days before the review in the case of a child in care. They should invite to attend the parents or guardian of the child, the care provider of the child and the child who is in care if the child is 12 years or older.  The child should be fully informed of the review's <Col N="2074" /> purpose and procedures.  Invited also should be any person with a bona fide interest in the child's welfare, and other relevant persons as appropriate.</P>
    <P>The health board should at each review look at the following: the child's progress in placement and the implementation of the decisions made at the last review, if there has been one and the plans for the future.  They should review the efforts of the health board responsible for the placement of the child in order to facilitate the return of the child to the home or to find an alternative long term placement, if reunion with the parent or previous guardian is not feasible.  The health board should consider all factors which either favour or mitigate against the decision of its alternatives with regard to these matters.  The efforts of the health board responsible for the placement of the child should be directed towards locating and providing services to the parents of the child and should note the efforts and capacity of the parent or parents to provide for the child's care.</P>
    <P>During the review stability and continuity for children in care should be promoted by discouraging unnecessary changes in placement arrangements.  The health board should also provide any records of information in their possession for the purpose of the review hearing. These should be confidential to the participants of the review procedure.</P>
    <P>I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the special report of the Task Force on Child Care.  This suggested a special programme in the health board areas to deal with child care.  Again, I want to emphasise that if the finances are not provided to the health boards to carry out this work the Bill is just a series of pious platitudes.</P>
    <P>The legislation before us caters for the removing of the child in a barring order case arising from sexual abuse.  It is more appropriate that the offender be removed rather than the victim.  The Law Reform Commission have recommended this action.  Is it not punishing the victim rather than the offender to have the victim removed from the house?</P>
    <P>I welcome the view that child sexual abusers and those who physically abuse children be described as criminals. <Col N="2075" /> However, people who are involved in these activities can be very tragic figures themselves and in need of State assistance. They can come from deprived areas or sections of society where they did not have a chance in life to be more responsible. Perhaps they were conditioned by childhood experience of similar acts.  In other words, many of them may have been victims of this abuse themselves. We often see a sad cycle of events from one generation to another where the same abuses are perpetrated.  It is similar to many of our more serious prisoners who come from families who have had generations of experience of alienation and victimisation by society and find themselves continuing that sad cycle. Society has a duty to try to break any such cycle and to promote better behavioural patterns in conjunction with the needs of the State.</P>
    <P>There is a need for mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse though I appreciate the problems that arise in regard to this.  The reporting should be by way of trained professionals who are covered under the legal system in the matter of carrying out their duties.  I appreciate the difficulties that arise with regard to charges of defamation of character and the difficulties about proving in some cases that there is an offence.  There is also a need to protect people from such defamation.  It is a very thin line to walk, but it is necessary that there be mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 19 I believe the health boards should have a right of access where parents are still in control. Although sanctions can be introduced these are meaningless.  Section 25 provides for the appointment of a solicitor to represent the child.  A solicitor may not be the right person.  A health care professional should be considered as a substitute for the solicitor.  Such a person should represent the child's needs to the presiding justice and should be responsible to the judge and not to the health board.  The professional should be an aid to the judge and independent of the health board and of the parents.  He should advise the judge on the situation. <Col N="2076" /> The professional should be able to hear all sides away from the pressures of the board and report to the court on his or her findings.  It would be akin to an Ombudsman for the child.  This system could be cost effective in that it would not then be necessary to pay the legal fees often requested for such hearings.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill relatives cannot become foster parents and, therefore, are denied claiming foster parents' allowance.  It is obvious that relatives would make very good foster parents.  This change was inserted since the original 1988 Act.  It was introduced by the Minister on Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I will expand on the area of appointing guardians in court rather than having a solicitor dealing with the situation.  A guardian appointed would be reporting to the court rather than the present situation whereby a solicitor would represent the health board.  I would see guardians as professionals appointed by the court who would have a specific and independent role in relation to children subject to the hearings concerned. The main job of such a guardian would be to focus specifically on the interests of the child and report to the court for the purpose of the specific hearing. We would not intend that the relationship would be an ongoing therapeutic one but an intervention on the issue.  This role would be valuable in an adverserial legal system where the interests of the adults tend to be competing, whether these adults are parents of the children or professionals working for the agencies such as the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Guardians should be appointed by the court and operate independently, with the right to work with the children individually and to meet all relevant parties in the case, including professionals and relatives of the child, and to have access to relevant information and reports so as to get the best possible picture of the child's situation.  Guardians in other countries are often, but not exclusively, <Col N="2077" /> social workers who are experienced in particular skills in relation to child care and working with children.  This would replace a solicitor, who would have a different set of skills to fulfil his role.  The guardian should be a skilled professional who can discuss, communicate and identify the needs of the child and, more importantly, communicate the child's interest to the court.</P>
    <P>Prior to the suspension of business, I also dealt with the fact that under the Bill relatives cannot become foster parents. That deprives them of foster parents' allowance.  Relatives usually make very good foster parents because of the relationship already there between the potential foster parent and the child. Where there is a blood relationship there is an interest and concern.  One has only to look at families where uncles, aunts or grandparents had to rear children to see the success of such an approach.  Parents may have died young and left children who were brought up by uncles and aunts and because of the close personal relationship they were sometimes as good as if not better than, some of the natural parents.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to many foster parents down through the years and at present who do excellent work and contribute to society in taking children, giving them good homes, giving them a good start in life.  We cannot over-emphasise our thanks to such charitable people.  I am always amazed at the charity of people who will take a child and rear it, often without any long term guarantee of attachment.  Of course, the relationship builds up.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not the Minister's intention to try to get foster parents on the cheap. The Minister might feel that many relatives take children without requesting the foster parent allowance and that this would activate such claims.  I do not feel that this would be the case because of the thorough and strenuous checks that people go through in order to be accepted as foster parents.  In other words, if the relatives were claiming such an allowance they would have to go through these rigorous checks.  Many of them would have the care of the child as their first priority; but many of them might well need such <Col N="2078" /> an allowance, and deserve such an allowance, in order to do the work of foster parents.  I hope that this will be looked into on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 50 deals with the registration of day child care centres.  It requires that all day care centres be registered.  Does that mean that somebody who is babysitting during the day or a grandmother who is minding two grandchildren would be considered under the Act?  What are the criteria on which the Minister decides what constitutes a day care centre for children?  What mechanism is there in order to allow commonsense to prevail in these circumstances, or should there be a ceiling on the number of children who can be taken into day care, if that is the right word, while parents who because of economic circumstances are obliged to work have their young children taken care of during the day, sometimes by babysitters who might take two, three or four children?</P>
    <P>Section 48 (4) deals with fees.  I quote:</P>
    <P>The Public Offices Fees Act, 1879 shall not apply in respect of any fees paid under regulations under this section.</P>
    <P>There is a registration fee for centres. Should pre-school centres be obliged to pay a fee for inspection?  Would this not be a disincentive to register as a centre?</P>
    <P>Section 56 seems to indicate that institutions for mentally or physically handicapped children do not come under the Act.  Why are such institutions excluded?  Surely it is just as important that these centres meet the requirements under the Act as those mentioned in section 56.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to Committee Stage.  I would ask the Minister to bring forward some of the suggestions I have made as his amendments to the Bill.  They may have a better chance of success in this House than if they were brought forward on this side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some observations on this important Bill.  It is regrettable that in the Ireland of today this Bill is necessary.  Unfortunately, over the past ten years or so sexual abuse of children, not just in this country but in <Col N="2079" /> many countries all over the world, has increased and has emerged as a major social problem.  Regrettably, there has been an unprecedented rise in official reports of child sexual abuse.  It is generally agreed that unofficial figures would greatly increase the figures that are presently available.  It is obvious that huge changes are needed in our legal structure to cope with this widespread evil in Irish society.  With this in mind the Irish Government, through the Attorney General, requested the Law Reform Commission to examine appropriate changes that might be needed.  I understand that they did this under three broad issues &mdash; one was the civil law, the other the criminal law and the third was the law of evidence.  Obviously, the Bill before us has taken account of the Law Reform Commission's report in the preparation of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill has changed a good deal since it was first initiated, principally because of the work of the special all-party committee of the Dáil, which dealt with all sections of the Bill with the exception of sections 1 and 2.  Because of this, I believe it is true to say that we have a much better and stronger piece of legislation now.  All concerned must be congratulated, and in particular the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Noel Treacy, who was then Minister of State at the Department of Health and who has taken a very caring approach to all the provisions of this Bill.  Further evidence of his concern and his caring approach to this Bill is the fact that he has stayed with the Bill even though he has left the Department.  That is a further tribute to his commitment and concern for this important Bill.</P>
      <P>The explanatory memorandum which was circulated following the passing of the Bill in the Dáil was very useful.  I would like to congratulate the officials who prepared it.  The introduction reads:</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Bill are as follows:</P>
      <P>(i)  The placing of a statutory duty on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2080" /> (ii)  strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services;</P>
    <P>(iii)  improved procedures to facilitate immediate intervention by health boards and the Gardaí where children are in serious danger;</P>
    <P>(iv)  revised provisions to enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, illtreated, neglected or sexually abused or who are at risk in the care of or under the supervision of health boards;</P>
    <P>(v)  introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of pre-school services;</P>
    <P>(vi)  revised provisions in relation to the registration and inspection of residential centres for children.</P>
    <P>There are six main provisions in the Bill. The point I am making is that the health boards are involved in four of them and mentioned in a very positive and definite way.  It is quite obvious that the health boards will play a very important role under this Bill.</P>
    <P>A sum of £8 million was provided in this year's budget and £1 million of that was set aside specifically for the Child Care Bill, which is a clear indication of the concern the Government have.  I expect, as Senator Neville does, that the health boards will not be neglected in any way in funding the proper implementation of this important Bill.</P>
    <P>In all cases it is the child who is removed from the home.  I am sure that this is the correct approach in the majority of cases but I have long been of the opinion &mdash; an opinion which will be shared by many others &mdash; that ideally, as in some other countries, the offender ought to be removed from the family home.  This has been mentioned by a number of speakers.  I believe it might be preferable if the offender were removed from the family home rather than the child and therefore minimise disruption in the child's life.  I accept that this may not be appropriate in all cases, because many domestic and other difficulties may arise but nonetheless that is my view. Maybe the Minister would comment on it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2081" /> The involvement of psychologists can be very intensive.  Inevitably parents and other family members will be drawn into counselling and treatment.  This phase is very important for the rehabilitation of the family but it has the other side effect, the added cost factor in the service's delivery.  Health board workers are key people in this Bill.  The social worker in particular is paramount to the successful working of the Bill.  Social workers must be not 99.999 per cent sure of successfully detecting a child abuse case, they must be a full 100 per cent certain of their facts, of their case and of their evidence. I do not think social workers should be carried away with enthusiasm for their work.  They are human beings like the rest of us.  We can all make mistakes. They have to be 100 per cent certain, for very obvious reasons.</P>
    <P>The role of teachers is also important. It is very important that they become involved.  A teacher could well ask: &ldquo;Why should I get involved at all?  What if I am wrong?&rdquo;  Of course, this raises other interesting questions.  Dealing with sexual abuse in children is not in a teacher's brief <i>per se.</i>  The reality is that very often a child will first divulge details in the school of the abuse.  It is important, therefore, that teachers understand the problem.  Training and guidelines on how to cope sensitively and appropriately should be given to teachers.  I believe that to be necessary and I certainly feel that preventive education in schools and adequate briefing of teachers from time to time is a very important part of coming to terms with and responding correctly to the problem of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>The detection of child sexual abuse is largely about a breach of trust between the child and usually someone they love or someone they trust greatly.  Most children feel safe in school.  They may not like school but they feel safe at school. Because of the bond of trust that is there between the teacher and the pupil, the teacher is very often the first person he or she will go to about abuse.  As I said, teachers have a very important role to play in dealing with and in detecting child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>I am not surprised that the Law <Col N="2082" /> Reform Commission suggested mandatory reporting by doctors, health workers, social workers and teachers to health board medical personnel and to the Garda.  If I were a social worker or a teacher I would welcome a legal obligation to report, for the obvious reason that if I were wrong, the fear of being sued by the parents would become a real possibility.  I accept that they could land themselves in court one way or another. That, too, has problems and perhaps the Minister would comment on it.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has good reasons why he has not gone down this particular road.  Obviously the Minister has tried to take the right approach and to get a suitable balance between the voluntary and mandatory reports.  It is an aspect of the Bill that interests me.</P>
    <P>Section 13 (7) (a) (ii) refers to the medical or psychiatric examination or treatment of the child.  It has been suggested to me that after the word &ldquo;psychiatric&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or other&rdquo; might be inserted.  The point made to me was that within the health board system and within the whole child abuse system you have a full professional team &mdash; social workers, nurses, psychologists, etc.  The same amendment would obviously &mdash; if the Minister did decide to accept it &mdash; be appropriate and apply also in Part IV, section 18 (2).</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into detailed specifics of the Bill because obviously there will be some comment on those on Committee Stage.  I want to mention section 71.  This is something I welcome very much.  It proposes to make it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children where it is known or suspected that they will be abused.  In this area, provision is made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment.  That is very important.  Unfortunately, children have died as a result of glue sniffing activities and obviously something had to be done. A further provision which was introduced on Report Stage gives the Garda power to remove the substance from the child if it is being used in a public place, and have reasonable cause to believe that it is being misused by that child in a manner likely to cause him to become intoxicated.  That <Col N="2083" /> section and the changes that will be made at a later stage in the Bill are welcome.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is something that from time to time raises its head and it is only right that at all times we adhere to our Constitution.  We can, in this case, say that the Constitution does not only permit the State to intervene where children are not being cared for but it places an obligation clearly on the State to do something positive and constructive about it.  This Bill is not in any way at variance with the Constitution.  It is acting totally in conformity with the Constitution. It is doing exactly what the Constitution would like us to do and asks us to do.  The primary purpose of the Bill is to protect children who are at risk of being assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  All concerned have to be congratulated for bringing forward what is very important legislation.  I welcome the Bill and I hope that it proves very successful in the future.</P>

    <Title>Child Care Bill, 1988: Second Stage (Resumed.)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the Child Care Bill briefly.  My brevity is partly due to the fact that I am a teacher myself, if I may address the Minister through the Chair, and my obligations are to instruct the hungry little minds down in Trinity between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. I also believe that quite a lot of groundwork for this Bill has already been laid in many of the speeches and I do not wish to be tedious.  However, I have been extensively lobbied by constituents, because as the Minister will understand my constituents being graduates many of them are involved or interested in this area of child care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received briefings from the National Children's Nurseries Association, from Dr. Barnardos, from St. Nicholas Montessori College in Ireland and from a number of other groups.  First of all, I would have to say that there is a universal welcome for this Bill and I want everything I say to be placed in that context. It is generally regarded as progressive, forward-looking legislation, <Col N="2085" /> overdue perhaps, but now very definitely to be welcomed.  I also understand that the Minister did accept a number of amendments in the Dáil and I hope that it may be possible for some further amendment to the Bill to be made in the Seanad.  That is important because the Seanad is, after all, constitutionally the place where refinements should be made to legislation.</P>
    <P>I have only two or three areas of concern to which I would like to alert the Minister, and he may in fact know that I have placed amendments to this legislation already.  There are about three amendments and they deal generally in the areas on which I am going to concentrate. I am not going to engage in generalised comment upon the Bill apart from giving it a welcome and expressing some degree of concern which has been made known to me by competent authorities in this area.</P>
    <P>First, there is the question of notification and the distinction that is drawn between notification and registration.  It has been represented to me that notification only requires the child care facility to notify a health board or other Government authority that they are in operation, and this naturally leads to some concern on behalf of the responsible bodies in this area.  There seems to be very little control and adequate supervision implicit in this idea of notification &mdash; in other words, people can just set up and notify the relevant authority without passing any degree of test or being examined in any way.  For this reason registration seems to be a preferable option.  A number of us will be urging this in the form of amendments to the Minister.  Registration is essential for such pre-school services precisely because it imposes standards before the facility can be registered.  A list of registered facilities would then be available to the public and parents on the understanding that they were fit to operate. Any child from any background, advantaged for disadvantaged, has the right to care that is of a fit standard, whether in a creche, playgroup, nursery, pre-school at or near the workplace or at any childminding centre.</P>
    <P>Another point which has been made to <Col N="2086" /> me by virtually all the people who either spoke to me or transmitted documents to me is that there is a distinction which is not fully respected by the wording of this Bill: the distinction between the location, the physical plant and equipment, on the one hand, and, on the other, the competence of the personnel involved in it. It seems to me, having read through the Bill and having been advised by these competent professionals, that it is a pity that so much concentration is in the area that I would regard generally as being appropriate for by-law supervision &mdash; fire regulations, hygiene regulations and so on.</P>
    <P>Of course, an appropriate environment is necessary, but I am a little concerned that the Bill does not really address the problem of the competence or qualifications of the personnel involved.  For a service like this to be fully professional and for the Bill to work properly there would have to be some degree of evaluation of the competence of the personnel involved.  In the Bill the emphasis is almost entirely on the physical environment.  There is no concept of the kind of care and the quality of experience required.  Hygiene and safety must of course be met, but under health it is essential to consider as well as the physical health the psychological and emotional needs of the child that is influenced by the environment.  A child in a crêche, playgroup, nursery or at any child minding centre will spent the greatest part of his or her early life in that environment. The Bill, we believe, should be amended to ensure that those undertaking supervision and inspection are trained in child care, child psychology and child development and this will enable the health boards or the Department of Education to second staff to do this training or to contract in these skills from outside.</P>
    <P>I have also had it suggested and recommended to me, and I think is very practical, that there should be some provision made whereby the costs of any inspections involved should be waived or met by the health board for playgroups and so on in disadvantaged areas.  I am sure the Minister will agree with this.  Play-schools in Foxrock and Blackrock are one <Col N="2087" /> thing and the parents can afford a great deal more, but we must consider the disadvantaged areas.  I speak with a degree of feeling on this because I live in an area where there is 80 per cent unemployment. It is a great privilege for me to live in a beautiful house in an area where I have extremely good neighbours from a variety of different backgrounds; but the income, by and large, of the people in that area, if I exclude the people I have helped to suck into the area to restore houses, is very low indeed.  Many of these people are disadvantaged, but that does not mean that they do not care for their children.  It does not mean that they do not wish the very best possible provision for them.  Therefore, I feel that the cost of some of this could be borne by the health board, particularly because they may need to be more supervised in areas where there is already a level of disadvantage. I would ask the Minister to look at this problem.</P>
    <P>That is the general outline.  I will not delay the House I have to go teaching myself and also I know that other people want to get in.  I will deal with these matters specifically when we come to the amendments we have placed.  I would like to take up two other items very briefly. One is that I understand on hearsay evidence, which is not always the best, that a question was raised this morning by Senator Ryan, which I am glad was raised.  That is the question of child molestation. It may very well have been raised by other Senators, but I did not hear them, and I understood him to be attempting to lay a particular kind of rumour and that is that people of the homosexual orientation are particularly prone to this kind of activity.  I would like through you a Leas-Chathaoirligh, to place on the record &mdash; not for the benefit of the Minister because I am sure he is aware of this information &mdash; that all the scientific studies demonstrate quite clearly that children are at risk not from people of homosexual orientation.  That is not just an arithmetical situation; it is a <i>pro rata</i> thing.  They are much more at risk from heterosexual people.  It is a very tiny group of people who engage in this <Col N="2088" /> who would claim any kind of homosexual orientation.</P>
    <P>I take the example of the famous Kincora scandal in the North of Ireland.  That was a very regrettable situation from the point of view of somebody like myself because the newspapers &mdash; unfortunately, including many of the responsible newspapers &mdash; realising that they were dealing with a very sensitive area and one with which all decent people are concerned, the wellbeing and protection of the young, children, sensationalised it and described it as a homosexual vice ring.  As I am sure the Minister will recall, those who were ultimately convicted of these offences were married men with several children, whereas on the other hand at least one of the children involved emerged from this traumatic adolescence to be a gay adult.  The headlines were utterly and totally wrong.  They were maladjusted people, whose primary orientation was heterosexual, victimising people, including some who turned out to have a homosexual adjustment ultimately. I regret having to place this matter on the record of the House but I think it is appropriate that I should.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with one further subject.  I am not sure that it has been dealt with.  I hope that it may be something new.  It is the question of guardians <i>ad litem.</i>  I have been approached to put to the Minister the proposition that there should be some provision for this mechanism in the Bill.  This was made clear to me by a group called the Professional Coalition on Child Care who asked me to propose a system for the appointments of guardian <i>ad litem</i>; a description of which would be as follows:</P>
    <P>Guardians <i>ad litem</i> are court appointed professionals who have a very specific and independent role in relation to children that are the subject of court hearings.  The main job of the guardian <i>ad litem</i> is to focus very specifically on the interests of the child and report to the court for the purposes of the court hearings.  It is not intended that the relationship is an ongoing or therapeutic one.  It is contemplated solely with regard to the court and comes into play where the parent is absent through illness, death or incompetence of various kinds or is a <Col N="2089" /> party to contentious proceedings.  The role is particularly valuable in an adver-sarial legal system where the interests of the adult tend to be competing, whether these adults are the parents of the children in question or professionals working for agencies.  Guardians are appointed by the court and operate independently with the right to work with children individually, meet all relevant parties to the case, including professionals and relatives of the child, have access to relevant information and reports so as to get the fullest picture possible of the child's situation.</P>
    <P>The other countries' guardians <i>ad litem</i> usually, but not exclusively, are social workers who are very experienced and have particular skills in relation to child care and working with children.  A guardian must be a skilled professional who can assess the needs of the child and, more importantly, communicate to the court what is in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>This system first came to prominence in the United Kingdom, which is a jurisdiction &mdash; the Minister knows this, and it is something I have sometimes deplored &mdash; we tend to copy, even when this is not in my opinion in the best interests of the development of an independent jurisprudence in this country.  In this instance I think this is a good idea.</P>
    <P>The role of guardian <i>ad litem</i> was extended following the famour Maria Colwell case, which the Minister will, I am sure, remember.  I certainly remember it; it was in the mid-seventies.  In this case the girl was the subject of court action and there was obviously a problem with regard to child battering or child abuse.  This was drawn to the attention of the local authorities, but the local authorities subsequently returned her to her natural parents, who murdered her.  This was a clear case which indicated the need for this form of guardian <i>ad litem.</i></P>
    <P>It emerged in the case that no one had been specifically advocating the child's interests because of the agreement between parents and local authorities.  In other words, there is a third party &mdash; not just the parents on the one hand, the local authorities on the other, but also the interests of the child.  I think this is <Col N="2090" /> important, because this is a Bill which so many people welcomed since it places the interests of the child as a primary concern.  This case led to the enlargement of the role of guardians <i>ad litem</i> and they have now become predominantly social workers.</P>
    <P>The role of the guardian was further extended in the United Kingdom by, in particular, the new Children Act, 1989. In Ireland we do not have a tradition of the use of guardians <i>ad litem.</i>  Under the 1948 District Court Rules Act, amended by a 1955 statutory instrument, there is a provision whereby a judge can appoint a solicitor to act as guardian for children in very limited circumstances.  This could arise, for example, in the case of a road accident where a sum of money was awarded to a child and the parents were not able to act on his or her behalf for various reasons.  This very limited power, even if extended by tinkering with other laws, would not be adequate to meet the complex series of family law cases that might be involved.</P>
    <P>There is a burden of other information that I want amplified in this case, but I think it is sufficiently strongly made and I hope that the Minister may bear this in mind.  It seems to me to be a very reasonable point and I think it fits in very well with the Bill.  It may very well be that it is not possible to extend this Bill by amendment to take on board the concept of the guardian <i>ad litem.</i>  I would like to feel that it could be, but I have not fashioned any such amendment, so it would in a sense be a little bit redundant for me to castigate the Minister for not doing so.  I do think however that it is appropriate on the Second Stage of this Bill to draw to the Minister's attention the existence of something that could very well be valuable for a child and to appeal to him to consider this for this legislation.  However, if for a variety of reasons this is not possible at the moment, at least to bear it in mind as a mark of some way in which we could improve the wellbeing of children.</P>
    <P>I have to say from my experience of court that it is not just children who are marginalised in a court.  This is inevitable because legal practice is such a machine. Any vulnerable person or group will find <Col N="2091" /> their rights limited simply by virtue of the legal process.  If we can reinforce the rights and wellbeing of a vulnerable group &mdash; for example, children &mdash; by having them actually represented then I think this would be a very good thing.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would just like to commend the Minister for this very useful Bill.  I am sure it will have support from right across the House.  I do hope that he may find it possible to take on board at least some of the recommendations that have been made, particularly with regard to the question of registration as opposed to notification and the question of the general supervision not only of the facilities but of the personnel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to welcome the Bill, as other Senators have done, and indeed to compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, on his involvement in the Bill.  Even though it is a Government Bill, the input into it of the Minister, his dedication to it and his total commitment is indeed to be commended and welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Bill is a very necessary piece of legislation because obviously we are talking about reform of legislation that is nearly 100 years old.  We are talking of the Children Act of the early 1900s.  Reform is overdue, but still it is welcome.  It is unfortunate in our society that we have to have a Bill such as the Child Care Bill.  In an advanced civilised society one would wonder why such a Bill has to be there, but obviously it has.  Most children grow up in a happy family and do not have any problems.  They grow into adult life easily, have an easy run and everything falls into place.  So it should be, but unfortunately other children come into the world and it is a nightmare for them.  They end up in the hands of monsters and beaters and all that goes with that.  It is because of that situation that a Bill such as the Child Care Bill has to be enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Basically, this is a Bill to protect our children.  History shows us that the abuse of children has always been with us.  We can go back to Victorian times.  Under a lovely veil of respectability we had child labour, children going up chimneys to <Col N="2092" /> clean them.  We had child prostitution under a veil of respectability at that time. There is good evidence to show that during that period child prostitution and child pornography were indeed widespread.</P>
    <P>Today we have the same situation occurring.  We look at the situation in eastern countries, where there is talk of eight and nine year olds involved in prostitution; and there are some countries nearer to us in which child pornography is widely available.  We are in a world that is very perverted, that does not have a care, as it were, for those who cannot care for themselves.  In our own country it is not so long ago since we had corporal punishment.  I am not equating corporal punishment with child pornography or child prostitution, but I believe that corporal punishment was an abuse to some extent.  I am glad it has been removed from the Statute Book and that it has gone out of the regulations in our schools and educational institutions.  I do not believe that corporal punishment is something an adult can or should inflict on a youngster, so I am glad that that is no longer allowed.</P>
    <P>Why do people abuse children?  Some say it is because those people were abused themselves; others say it is because of bad living conditions, bad environment, alcohol abuse, unemployment and so on. But I do not think we can just identify child abuse with poverty and unemployment. I would venture to say that abuse in the respectable side of society may be more prevalent &mdash; we do not know definitely because obviously there is greater opportunity for cover-up in that area.  In areas where poverty was prevalent during the time parents were raising their children, fine people came out of those homes.  One thing they had had was a great respects for themselves and for their persons.  They developed to be very good adults.  Therefore, I do not think abuse is in any particular area of society; it can be found in all areas.</P>
    <P>Much of the way we dealt with children down through the years should be questioned, where children were placed and the care we provided for children who came under State control.  Much of it left a lot to be desired.  We placed children in <Col N="2093" /> psychiatric hospitals &mdash; children of two, three, four and five years of age.  There are many records of that around this country.  It seems an extraordinary thing to put a child into a psychiatric hospital. This Bill defines that a child is such up to the age of 18 years.  Yet over the years records will show that children from two or three years up to 16 years were placed in psychiatric hospitals.  Some will say that the reason they were there was because they were mentally handicapped or physically handicapped, but what could a psychiatric hospital do for either a mentally handicapped child or a physically handicapped child?  It was a desperate practice and I hope it is no longer happening.  I understand from section 35 of the Bill that the health boards still retain the power to carry out that type of activity.  I hope it will not happen and that that section will not be used to the extent it was in the past.</P>
    <P>People who are mentally and physically handicapped should be concentrated on in the Bill.  I will come to abuse in the home later.  People who are mentally and physically handicapped are at a greater disadvantage and at greater risk in some situations.  One thing that is apparent about the mentally handicapped and physically handicapped, particularly the mentally handicapped, is that they are very trusting.  Members of mental handicap associations, social workers and such people will confirm that those children are very trusting.  When they go into care, and not because of abuse, it is very important that the structures have in-built safeguards. I cannot see where that is covered in the Bill.</P>
    <P>One area that worries me at present when there is a lack of finance is that we may have people in those areas who are not qualified.  I hope there is not a veil covering that at the moment but that it is an area that will be looked at.</P>
    <P>In regard to people who are sexually or physically abused, there are two options: one is to remove the child, and the other is to remove the offender.  That is the way I see it.  The removal of the child can be very traumatic.  It may be the best in the end, but it can be very traumatic in that you may implant a notion of guilt in the mind of the child, and that is unfortunate. <Col N="2094" /> The child may not be in a position to evaluate the broad spectrum of what is happening.  Therefore, due to the fact that it is the child who is being removed, they may have a certain amount of guilt themselves.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the offender being removed.  I would feel happier with that. The family unit should be preserved if possible and the offender removed.  The health board have certain regulations under which they can work.  They can take out a care order.  That will mean taking the child out of the home and placing that child in foster care, institutional care or whatever.  That is an extreme measure.  I have given you the reason: it can create guilt in the child's mind, and that is an unfortunate situation. Obviously, the child has no reason to feel guilty.  The child has been the recipient of abuse and is thereby totally exonerated in so far as any guilt is concerned. Yet this can be implanted in their minds.</P>
    <P>The second option open to the health board, obviously, is a supervision order. That would be where the child would be supervised in the home.  The Bill allows for a 12 month order on that.  It is a good provision.  It is a better option than care, but one thing about that provision is that you need to have professional people to monitor that supervision.</P>
    <P>This Bill has a financial aspect to it that we may hear more about over the next few years.  Five or six of the provisions of the Bill involve health boards with the remaining provisions involving the gardaí and the courts.  In the majority of sections, those concerning health boards a financial provision will be necessary. When the Bill is passed I hope the financial backup will be there.  A Bill such as this without financial backup will not be as helpful as it could be if the finances were there to support it.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bills passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas over the last few years have been excellent Bills.  I will concentrate on those relating to local authorities and health boards.  We had the nursing home Bill, the Air Pollution Bill and so on, but none of them will deliver the goods unless the finances are behind <Col N="2095" /> them.  It is very important that legislation handed down to different statutory bodies has the backup.  With regard to this Bill I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the money is provided.  I have no doubt that there is a great commitment by the Government towards this end.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the barring order procedure developed.  It is only on a barring order that the offender can be removed from the place where the wrongful acts are being committed.  The child is left in the environment of the home but the offender is removed, thus not imposing a guilt on that child.  I do not know if that is in the Bill.  I know that a barring order can be obtained by a family at the moment.  In fact, there is an over use or abuse of the barring order at present.  It seems to be a solution for a lot of ills in the family such as assault on the wife or children.</P>
    <P>In the specific area of child abuse, whether it be child sexual abuse or battering, provision should be made for a barring order.  The health board should be able to go to the appropriate court and obtain a barring order excluding the offender from that home thereby leaving the child, the mother and other members of the family in the home.  If this is not included in the Bill perhaps the Minister could give it some consideration.</P>
    <P>If the care order option has to be taken then the institutional option should be the remotest.  If a care order is obtained by a health board a relative of the child should be chosen to take the child into care or, indeed, a foster parent.  Foster parents are a wonderful group of people. I know foster parents in my county and I consider them to be an excellent group. They make themselves available, look after children of different ages and socialise with them.  They should be complimented. I would like to place on record my sincere thanks to the foster parent group involved in the Western Health Board area for the wonderful work they are doing.</P>
    <P>Institutional care should be very far off and should not be used unless in a very extreme case or where all other avenues had been explored and found unsuitable. <Col N="2096" /> If a child is removed from the home we must ensure that child goes as near as possible to a social unit.  The social unit we know in an Irish context is the family. It is important that that child goes to a relative who is part of the extended family or to foster parents who would place them in a family type environment.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of care of children it is very important that facilities and resources are available from the start. We have to provide support for the family.  We tend to provide money and legislation after the event.  It is important to have back-up to prevent, if possible, the abuse occurring in the first place.  Child psychologists should be available.  I would like to see a marrying of the Departments of Education and Health. Activities such as pre-school and child psychology are very much an interlinking of health and education.  Support units should be available to the family and health boards should make provision for them.</P>
    <P>Remedial teachers and child psychologists are available but, for instance, if one requests dyslexia to be investigated, the health board will carry out the investigation.  I know it is not easy to establish that and it would be wrong to jump into an early diagnosis but once that condition is established you have to leave the health board area then and you have to move into the Department of Education area.  The Department of Education, particularly in rural situations, do not have a child psychologist available except when a certain number is reached.  You may have perhaps three, four, five or six rural schools with 30, 40 or 50 children and indeed a child psychologist would not be available in that whole territory.  You have to be in the region of 500 to 700 children.  I believe an interlinking of health and education services in that area is important.</P>
    <P>While that is not provided for in this Bill it is something we should look at because we have seen many cases in recent times where there seemed to be a no-mans land, that neither Department were fully responsible for a particular person at a particular time on account of a particular event.  We have seen the <Col N="2097" /> situation arising regarding who is responsible for 15 year old in Mountjoy.  I have no doubt, however, that every Government Minister has a deep passion to see to it that children are looked after.</P>
    <P>There are a number of Departments with part responsibility.  That can result in people falling between two stools &mdash; indeed not so long ago we have seen them falling between three stools.  There is room for thought regarding further legislation on this matter, because this Bill states that a person is a child up to 18 years of age.  It is important that we look at that area again to see if we can improve the situation for children who are at risk. Even though they may be involved in crime, that does not exclude them from being at risk.  This Bill covers children who are at risk.  Children are at risk in their home, they are at risk in care and they are at risk if they are involved in crime.  It does not make any difference. They can still be at risk.  We have a duty to protect them irrespective of what category or what area they are in.  If they are in care, we have as much responsibility for the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped or the young offender who has been incarcerated as we have for the child out in the family unit.  I do not think we can distinguish between one or the other in that situation.</P>
    <P>I want to mention also the voluntary organisations.  We are all very well aware of the fine work they do.  Health boards and Departments may find that there is a major drawback in that some of these groups may set themselves up and then go the health board or the Departments, saying: &ldquo;OK, we have to get the funds.&rdquo; That may not be received very well.  If the health board or the Department are not satisfied about the authenticity or indeed the good economics of some organisations, they have a right to question that.  After all, they are dealing with public money so it has to be spent properly But, by and large, voluntary organisations play a vital and a very welcome role in the care of our children.  I am quite satisfied that their input complements the State activity.  Therefore, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I hope that, following the enactment <Col N="2098" /> of the Bill, the co-operation and liaison with the statutory bodies will continue and will be enhanced and developed. There are many good people out there. People may have found for one reason or another that they now have a lot of time on their hands.  They may have reared their own families.  They may have been very involved with their families for 25 years but their families have now moved away.  These people find now that they have time on their hands.  They are healthy, 50 years of age, and they do not want to go back to work.  They are comfortable enough.  They feel they have a lot of experience.</P>
    <P>The experience and the talents of those people made available on a voluntary basis is wonderful.  It has to be encouraged because the fact that they are doing this voluntarily means they are very committed to the organisation concerned.  It is very important that the Government agencies and statutory bodies would not in any way conflict with those voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on it.  I will not go on further as there will be another opportunity to identify and comment on particular areas in the Bill.  By and large, I am very impressed with the Bill.  It is long overdue. My compliments to the Minister and the Government for bringing it forward and, hopefully, having it on the Statute Book before long.  I comment the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Finneran, I too, welcome the Bill.  It is a very important piece of legislation and, of course, it has been coming for quite a long time.  It is, as a number of Senators have said already, an updating of the 1908 Act, which is certainly quite dated now.  It is over 75 years since the 1908 Act was passed and there have been tremendous changes in society in the meantime.  It is very important that we should now update the legislation to cater for those changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The immediate short term history of the Bill relates to the UN declaration in 1959, which declared the rights of the child.  Moving on to 1985 a Child Care and Protection Bill was introduced in the <Col N="2099" /> other House by a member of my party, Barry Desmond.  That Bill, of course, fell when the Government of which he was a member went out of office.  It is fair to say that this Bill is to a large extent based on the earlier Bill with some modifications.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been extensively debated in the other House.  Indeed, it has gone through a very long Committee process on which there was broad agreement on both sides of the House.  In relation to this Bill the anxiety of everybody was to try to reach consensus and to put the welfare of children above any other considerations. It is certainly appropriate that we have this Bill now because of the problems that exist in this country in relation to children.  Approximately 2,600 children are in care at present and 1,300 of them have been victims of abuse of one type or another.  Indeed, it is reckoned that about 500 children in this country have been the victims of sexual abuse.  I gather that the abuse of children is on the increase.  It is expected that when the data becomes available for 1990 it will show an increase on the figures for 1989.  However, in relation to State intervention relating to children it is very important that the levels of intervention be kept to a minimum, a minimum which is consistent with the welfare of the children.  Certainly the State should only take children into care against the wishes of parents as a last resort.  That is a very important principle that should be adhered to in relation to how this Bill is implemented when it becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are many desirable aspects of this Bill.  First, it increases from 16 to 18 the upper age limit for taking children into care.  That is to be welcomed.  It provides for a statutory duty on the part of health boards to promote the welfare of children.  It is very important that that obligation should be on health boards and that it should be written into the law.  It deals with the question of children sleeping rough and it lays down a requirement for health boards to provide accommodation for those children.  That is to be welcomed in the context of the present problems of homeless children, particularly in the city of Dublin, where there <Col N="2100" /> are about 400 children who, at one time or another, are sleeping rough.  Indeed, it is appropriate that this Bill should be debated at this time when Fr. Peter McVerry is again drawing attention to the problem of homelessness among children and the difficulties he is having in catering for those young people whom he has sought to help over the years.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of the Bill which allow for special committees to be established by health boards to deal with the care of children.  I also welcome the fact that the Garda are to be provided with a role, in the context of this Bill, in relation to dealing with children.  It is very important that the Garda are provided with the adequate resources to allow them to be effective in dealing with problem cases in relation to children.  It is very important that, for instance, adequate resources be provided so that gardaí can be trained properly and can take the opportunity of going on appropriate courses so that they will have the necessary level of expertise to allow them to function at an optimum level in this area. I would be very anxious that the Garda authorities and the Minister for Justice would provide leave of absence with full pay for gardaí to take approriate courses, to take social science degrees if that is what is necessary, to allow them fulfil their function in relation to their new role in dealing with children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions designed to reduce to a minimum stress and anxiety during court cases which involve children.  To that end I am particularly pleased to see that judges and barristers will no longer be geared out in wigs and gowns.  Such regalia can be very intimidating for children and indeed for their parents and their families, in difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>The provisions in relation to pre-school facilities and so on are also very welcome. It is desirable that there be inspection of these pre-school facilities and that day care centres, creches and so on should be regulated.  I welcome the fact that homes for children will have to be registered. However, I also share the concern of a number of Senators who spoke earlier in relation to the deficiency in the Bill where there are no clear guidelines as to the <Col N="2101" /> level of expertise people will need to acquire in order to qualify them to run such centres.  I am very anxious that minimum qualifications are defined and very clearly spelled out so that we can be assured that all children who are in pre-school facilities of one type or another are dealt with by people who are adequately qualified to attend to their needs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill to prohibit the sale of certain solvents to children.  This, however, could be quite difficult in practice to enforce.</P>
    <P>There is a number of defects in the Bill.  One of these relates to the omission in cases where children are being placed in care of a mechanism for ensuring that the child's interest is automatically recognised and defended.  While the Bill caters for this aspect to some extent, it does not contain a provision which would guarantee such protection in all cases.  That is a defect.  I ask the Minister to look at it again and see if it is possible for him to accede to some changes there.</P>
    <P>The question of juvenile justice is not covered in the Bill.  That is a problem area that needs attention.  Many Senators have already referred to the fact that the matter of funding of the various services and facilities for children, as provided for in the Bill, has not been dealt with.  I know that the provision of funding in relation to a Bill such as this is outside the direct ambit of the Bill but it is absolutely essential that funding be provided. Otherwise the whole effort will prove to be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Bill does not deal with the question of increasing from seven the age of criminal responsibility. There now seems to be a tremendous contradiction within the law where it is possible to be a criminal at seven years and at the same time it is impossible not to be a child until one is over 18 years. That anomaly should be removed as soon as possible.  I do not see any purpose in leaving it on the Statute Book.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not cater adequately for children who find themselves in trouble with the law.  Neither does it deal adequately with the question of providing custodial facilities for that very small number of children who can only <Col N="2102" /> adequately be treated in a custodial environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal either with the social welfare rights of people in the 16 to 18 year age bracket.  Many of these people are left in a social welfare limbo. While because they are defined as children, the provisions of the Bill cater for them, there are no specific social welfare provisions for them in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see the introduction of some independent review in relation to the working of the various agencies whose roles are defined in this Bill.  It is important that bona fide complaints are investigated by an independent review body.  I am anxious that the Minister consider that question carefully.</P>
    <P>I support what Senator Norris said in relation to guardians <i>ad litem.</i>  I am anxious that people who work in the agencies and who are defined and described in the Bill should be adequately qualified.  It is very essential that these people have the appropriate level of training and expertise to allow them to carry out their functions properly.  In this regard it is important also that we carefully guard against excessive levels of enthusiasm on the part of professions and, indeed, on the part of people generally who are dealing with children.</P>
    <P>I must confess that I was very alarmed to read a report of a recent court case at which District Justice Smithwick expressed considerable alarm about a case which was reported in the last month or so.  I would be very alarmed that those type of events should take place.  I would be very concerned that it should have been necessary for a man, as distinguished as District Justice Smithwick, to have to speak in the terms he did, and to point the inadequacies, as it were, of his dissatisfaction with how a family was treated in that instance.</P>
    <P>There are one or two other points which I want to mention.  These refer to some of the things which Senator Finneran said.  I have to compliment Senator Finneran on his speech.  It was a very useful speech.  I particularly share his concern in relation to the question of children being committed to psychiatric hospitals. That is absolutely appalling.  I am <Col N="2103" /> shocked that this should still be taking place.  I am particularly concerned that children suffering from mental handicap should find themselves in mental hospitals. That is absolutely appalling.  I would urge the Minister to take appropriate action and to make the resources available so that that practice ceases immediately.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is a very valuable and worthwhile Bill.  It is long overdue. It is good to see it being debated and to anticipate that it will be law in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Child Care Bill, 1988, the primary purpose of which is to put in place a framework that gives effective protection to those who are too young and too vulnerable to defend themselves and is at the same time fair to those most affected, particularly parents and others with parental responsibility.  This legislation is long overdue.  We are, today, acutely aware of the sharply increased public concern over the care, protection and upbringing of children.  At present children's legislation is confusing, piecemeal, outdated, often unfair and in many important respects ineffective, most notably when it comes to protecting children at risk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this legislation will bring order, integration, relevance and better balance to the law, better balance not just between the rights and responsibilities of individuals and agencies but, most vitally, between the need to protect children and the need to enable parents to challenge intervention in the unbringing of their own children.  The recent well-publicised cases, including the tragic cases of Kimberely Carlisle, Doreen Mason, Jasmine Bedford and the unfortunate events in Cleveland in 1987, have graphically shown, in my view, the tragic consequences of getting that balance wrong. Eighty three years ago, the Children Act, 1908, put on a statutory basis a series of offences against children.  Ever since, it is true to say, that legislation has served us well.  However, as Senator Finneran, who is a very experienced Senator in this area, and other Senators have indicated, <Col N="2104" /> times have changed.  The concerns of recent years about the present legal framework of children have been fuelled by the tragic, and, indeed, to many, incomprehensible phenonomen of child abuse.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the law in relation to the care of children, particularly children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, or who are at risk.  The main provisions of the Bill &mdash; they are very comprehensive &mdash; are as follows:</P>
    <P>The placing of a statutory duty on health boards to provide and promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the powers of health boards to provide child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>Improving the procedures to facilitate the immediate intervention by health boards and by the Garda Síochána where children are in serious and imminent danger.</P>
    <P>Providing for the making of supervision orders in respect of children who have been assaulted, ill-treated or sexually abused.</P>
    <P>The introduction of arrangements for the inspection and supervision of preschool facilities.</P>
    <P>The revision of the provisions in respect of the registration and inspection of residential centres for children.</P>
    <P>Part II of this Bill &mdash; sections 3 to 11 &mdash; deals with promoting the welfare of children, preventing family breakdown and avoiding the need to take children into care on a compulsory and permanent basis.  This, section 3 places a statutory responsibility and obligation on health boards to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  It gives them the power to provide child care and family support services so as to assist parents in caring for their children and to prevent children having to be placed in care.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) (c) requires health boards to have regard to the fundamental principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in <Col N="2105" /> his own family home.  Thus, the emphasis must be on providing support and assistance so that children can remain at home and that it is only in very exceptional cases that children are to be taken into care.</P>
    <P>Part III &mdash; sections 12 to 15 &mdash; deals with the protection of children in emergencies. A vital part of striking the right balance is the introduction of a new emergency care order to replace the present place of safety order.  The aim here is to strike a balance between the need to protect children from harm in emergencies on the one hand, and the need to allow aggrieved parents to challenge action taken in respect of children, on the other hand.  The need for this, as I said earlier, was graphically illustrated by what happened in places like Cleveland. Thus, Part III enables the Garda or the health board staff to intervene quickly where there is an immediate and serious threat to the safety and welfare of children.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will enable a member of the Garda Síochána to remove to safety, without warrant, a child whose health or welfare is in imminent danger and where it would not be sufficient to await the making of an application for an emergency care order by a health board under section 13 procedure.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill &mdash; sections 16 to 23 &mdash; deals with care proceedings.  It will enable the courts to place children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused.  Thus, section 16 of the Bill places a statutory duty on a health board to apply for a care order or a supervision order, as the case may be, whenever it appears to the health board that the conditions for the making of such an order exist with respect to a particular child.</P>
    <P>Section 17 will enable a district justice to make an interim care order where the grounds exist for the making of such a care order, and it is necessary for the protection of the child that he be placed or remain in care pending the determination of an application for a care order.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for the making of a care order.  An important element here is the time factor of eight days, unlike the present place of safety order where no <Col N="2106" /> specific period of time is defined.  This new time factor has been inserted to help to ensure that parents are not unfairly and unnecessarily deprived of the custody of their children for indefinite periods and to give parents an early opportunity to state their side of the case to the courts.</P>
    <P>Section 19 will enable the courts to make a supervision order where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the conditions for such an order exist.  This would authorise the health board to have a child visited in his home to ensure that he was being properly cared for.  The court would also have the power to direct the parents to bring the child to a day care centre, a child guidance clinic or a hospital, etc.</P>
    <P>Part V of this Bill &mdash; sections 24 to 34 &mdash; deals with the jurisdiction, the powers and the procedures of the courts in respect of care proceedings.  Thus, section 24 will require the court, having regard to the rights and duties of parents, to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in any proceedings in relation to the care and protection of a child.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill &mdash; sections 35 to 46 &mdash; deals with the arrangements which shall be made by the health boards.  I was pleased to note that the Minister agreed to a number of amendments in the other House where the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; was changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in looking after children in their care.</P>
    <P>Section 36 of the Bill requires a health board to facilitate reasonable access between a child in care and his parents or other persons who have a bona fide interest in him.  Section 36 also provides an appeal mechanism for a person to appeal to the courts against the access arrangements offered by a health board and for a health board to apply to the courts for an order authorising them to refuse access to a named person.  At present, there is no statutory supervision of pre-schools, playgroups and other pre-school facilities for children.</P>
    <P>I welcome Part VII of the Bill &mdash; sections 47 to 55 &mdash; which provides for the introduction of a system of supervision and inspection of pre-schools, play-schools and similar services for pre-school children.  Part VIII of the Bill &mdash;<Col N="2107" /> sections 56 to 64 &mdash; deals with the introduction of arrangements for the registration and inspection of residential homes for children.  Part IX of the Bill &mdash; sections 65 to 70 &mdash; deals with the general question of administration.  Part X of the Bill &mdash; sections 71 to 76 &mdash; deals with miscellaneous and supplementary matters.</P>
    <P>There is, indeed, widespread public concern, as has been indicated by a number of Senators, about solvent abuse or glue sniffing, as it is commonly known. Section 71 of the Bill makes it an offence to sell solvent-based products to children for glue sniffing.  It will give a member of the Garda Síochána the power to seize any substance in the possession of a child in a public place which he has reasonable cause to believe is being misused by that child in a manner likely to cause him to be intoxicated.  Provision is also made for fines of up to £1,000 or 12 months imprisonment, or both.</P>
    <P>Finally, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, this Bill gives health boards, I believe, dramatic wide-ranging powers and functions, including all sorts of advisory committees and statutory duties, to look after the welfare of children who are deprived and at risk in the functional areas of the various health boards.  However, all these powers and functions and all that is aimed at in this Bill cannot be done unless the Government or the health boards give a definite budget, the wherewithal with which to carry out these new and important functions and duties.  It is simply hypocrisy to give a health board a new and important statutory function to look after children at risk and then to leave it to the health boards to find the necessary resources and finance.</P>
    <P>This, a Leas-Chathaoirligh, is a major problem with this Bill.  It is not in any way overcome by the Bill or the provisions in the Bill.  I will, therefore, conclude.  I think there is another speaker who has indicated on the other side that he wishes to speak.  I would like also to afford the Minister the opportunity of concluding this Stage of the debate.  I hope this question of finance and resources is remedied by the Government and that they will indicate during the passage of this Bill, <Col N="2108" /> and at the conclusion and finalisation of this Bill, that a considerable amount of financial resources will be provided by the Government so that this Bill can be properly implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>The Child Care Bill before this House today is timely and very necessary representing as it does, a corpus of statutory duties, powers and procedures to protect and promote the ultimate welfare of children.  Clearly, children constitute one of the most vulnerable groups in our society.  In recent years the scale of abuse to which children have been exposed has shown an alarming increase.  It is absolutely vital now to take effective and comprehensive measures to safeguard children from the unnecessary abuses to which they have been subjected.</P>
      <P>Children are a voiceless group in society.  It is only in recent years that we have become so painfully aware of the despicable violence to which they have been subjected.  Perhaps the most repulsive and contemptible aspect of child abuse has manifested itself in the various cases of sexual assault.</P>
      <P>The primary aim of this Bill is to consolidate the law in respect of the care of children, generally and specifically, in the case of children who have been the sorry victims of assault, ill-treatment, neglect or sexual abuse.  Children falling into any one of these, or a number of these, categories are unfortunately on the increase.  This Bill now places an onus on the health board to actually promote childrens' welfare where they are not enjoying a satisfactory and reasonable standard of care and protection.  Equally, the powers of the health boards to provide adequate care and family support services are considerably strengthened. The Bill also incorporates measures to improve procedure whereby immediate intervention, by the health boards and the gardai in emergency circumstances, is facilitated.  In addition, this Bill sets out to reverse the provisions to empower the courts to place children, who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or sexually abused, in the care of health boards or under their direct supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2109" /> As I said at the outset, we have witnessed a distressing increase in the incidence of child abuse in general.  As a caring and humane society, it is intolerable to allow this grotesque spectacle to continue because of deficiencies in our legislative measures.  I am happy to state that the Child Care Bill signals a mature recognition that child abuse, in varying degrees of intensity, does actually exist.  Equally this legislation reflects a sensitive but secure mechanism for those unfortunate children who helplessly find themselves in the most unspeakable conditions, often times in the confines of their own family circle.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill is graphically borne out by the fact that approximately 2,600 children are in the care of the eight health boards at any given time.  As the Minister pointed out, many of these children find themselves placed in care owing to deprivation or neglect or simply because of an inability of the parents to look after them.  This placement may not necessarily be long term or permanent. The Minister also referred to the staggering number of confirmed cases of child sexual abuse for 1989 which stood at 500 cases, an four-fold increase in five years. Unfortunately, the trend is upwards.  All the indications are that the figures will have shown a dramatic increase since 1989.  In the light of these numbers it is now imperative that the correct provisions be enacted which will take due cognisance of this phenomenon which is becoming increasingly problematic. Equally, we must have due regard to the provision in our Constitution which places a duty of care on us to safeguard the rights of the child, particularly where a child becomes the victim of sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Our commitment and concern for victims of child abuse is borne out by the fact that this Bill is the product of deliberations of a special all-party committee of the House, established with the express purpose of giving adequate consideration to the provisions of this Bill. As the Minister pointed out, this Bill is a socially enlightened and reformed piece of legislation which, hopefully, will have far-reaching implications for the welfare of children of which we are now, quite <Col N="2110" /> correctly, more aware.  In this Bill the rights of the child are accorded a preeminence and a superiority which is necessary.  The inalienable right of the child to proper standards of care has to be recognised and enshrined in the legislative provisions.  I welcome the Minister's statement to the effect that the Government have rededicated its commitment to find the necessary resources to enable effective implementation of the Bill in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P>I would now like to address, in some detail, specific aspects of the Bill.  Section 2 is significant in so far as it extends the legal definition of a child to include those up to 18 years who are unmarried.  This puts an onus on the health board to take responsibility for the growing number of persons between the ages of 16 to 18 who find themselves in adverse circumstances and who consequently may be taken into the protection of the health board.  Section 3 places the responsibility on the relevant health board to promote the child's welfare and empowers it to provide child care and family support services, having due regard to the paramount and primary welfare of the child concerned.  Equally, the health board must have particular consideration for the principle that, in general, it is in the best interests of the child to be reared within his or her own family environment. Thus, it is only in exceptional circumstances that the child would be removed from the family home and placed in external care.  If the circumstances are appropriate, it is preferable that necessary support and assistance be made available to enable the child to remain at home.</P>
    <P>Section 4 covers the area of voluntary care and will enable the health board to receive orphans or abandoned children into voluntary care without reference to the courts.  In serious situations, sudden bereavement, marital breakdown, or other family crises, with parental consent children whose parents are unable to look after them may also be placed in voluntary care.  Section 5 is, indeed, a welcome initiative which should go towards significantly improving the plight of homeless children or children who, by <Col N="2111" /> dint of circumstances, are compelled to sleep rough in the most squalid and unsightly conditions.  Section 5 now places a firm obligation on the health boards to make accommodation available for children who are without a home or who may have no accommodation, that they can be reasonably expected to occupy and who are simply unable to make their own arrangements.  Unfortunately, the number of children who have, for various reasons, been alienated from the family home, is on the increase, so I believe this statutory measure is timely and represents a positive move towards alleviating this plight.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is also a novel provision and proposes that each health board be obliged to ensure that provision of an adequate adoption service within its functional area.  To achieve this objective the health board are empowered to enter into a suitable arrangement, with a registered adoption society, to make sure that such a service is provided.  In section 7 it is proposed to establish one or more child care advisory committees to each health board area.  The role of these committees will be to advise the health boards in the performance and discharge of their functions as contained in this Bill.  These committees will comprise representatives of voluntary bodies active in child care services and people who have a particular interest or expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in section 8 that the health boards will conduct annual reviews to assess the adequacy or otherwise of child care services within their areas, while section 9 permits the health boards to enter into arrangements with voluntary bodies to provide child care and family support services on their behalf. Section 10 makes provision for grant aid from the health boards to the voluntary bodies which provide such services.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with emergency circumstances to enable the Garda or health board staff to intervene quickly where there is an immediate and serious threat to the welfare and safety of the child. Section 12 permits a garda, without a warrant, to remove a child to safety where he or she perceives an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare <Col N="2112" /> of the child and where it will not be adequate to await application for an emergency care order.  The section also makes provision to allow a member of the Garda to be accompanied by other persons in exercising this power of removal.  However, in these circumstances it is absolutely explicit that the health board must provide for an emergency care order as soon as possible. The child may be retained in the custody of the board for up to three days pending the hearing of the application.</P>
    <P>In section 13 a district justice is empowered to make an emergency care order requiring that a child be placed or maintained in the care of a health board for up to eight days where there is an immediate and serious risk to his or her safety.</P>
    <P>I would like, finally, to congratulate the Minister on all the work he has done on this Bill and also to congratulate him on his recent appointment and to wish him well.  I hope that he brings the same imagination to his new post as he did to the one he has just left.</P>

      <P>I thank the many Senators who contributed to the debate on this Bill.  Their contributions have been both informed and positive.  I am pleased with the support which it has received from all sides of the House and the generally constructive and positive tenor of the debate here.  I am also glad to say that the Bill has been generally welcomed by all of the statutory and voluntary agencies concerned with child care.</P>
      <P>A large number of issues were raised during the debate, and although time is of short duration, I will do my best to respond to as many as possible.  Other points which were raised will require more detailed consideration.  I wish to assure the House that I will consider them between now and Committee Stage where we can have further discussion on various points of detail and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of resources was raised by a number of Senators.  I accept that the implementation of the Bill will require the allocation of additional resources to the child care area.  We are well aware that the success of the Bill will <Col N="2113" /> depend on the allocation of additional resources to fund the improvement of existing child care and family support services, the development of new, preventative strategies and the appointment of additional social workers and other staff.  It will require a significant increase in spending on the child care services.  It will cost a lot of money, but the cost of not doing so in terms of human raisery and the suffering of young children would be a great deal more.  I want to assure the House that despite the hard economic times in which we find ourselves the money for improvements in our child care and family support services will be found. It will necessarily be a gradual process, but our policy of directing a greater proportion of available resources to community services will, in particular, benefit child care and family support services.</P>
    <P>The process of increasing expenditure in the child care area has already begun even before this Bill is enacted.  In this year's budget of 1991 a sum of £8 million was provided for the development of community care services.  My Government colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, has allocated £1 million of this extra allocation to the child care area.  It is intended to use this to bring forward a number of developments this year.  These include the establishment of a new unit for disturbed adolescents by the Eastern Health Board.  A similar development in Limerick is being planned by the Mid-Western Health Board.  Arrangements are under way to increase the number of hostel places for homeless young people. It is also intended to increase the number of social workers to deal with the continuing rise in the incidence of child sexual abuse.  These are just some of the examples of the initiatives that we are taking.  I want to assure the House that the Government are committed to making the necessary resources available to bring the Bill fully into operation as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators raised questions about the provision for taking children into care.  As I indicated in my opening speech the provisions in the Bill and particularly those in relation to taking <Col N="2114" /> children into care, have been very carefully drafted in the light of relevant constitutional provisions and judicial interpretations.  Article 42 (5) of the Constitution expressly provides for intervention by the State where parents fail in their duty towards their children.  The Supreme Court has ruled that while there is a constitutional presumption that the welfare of the child is to be found within the family, this may not always be the case, and there may be exceptional cases where children would be better off if they were removed from their parents' care. The legislation proposed in this Bill is to cater for these exceptional cases.  The Bill envisages the care proceedings will be taken only in exceptional cases where the parents have failed to care for their children or where there were other compelling reasons why the welfare of the child was not to be found within his family.  I do not, therefore, anticipate any constitutional difficulties with the provisions of the Bill.  I am confident that these provisions, if challenged, would be found to be inconformity with our Constitution.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators have referred to the definition of &ldquo;foster parent&rdquo; contained in section 35 of the Bill and have questioned the fact that relatives are excluded from the definition.  I would like to make it clear that there is no sinister or ulterior motive in this, nor is there any question whatsoever of us trying to deprive certain people of their entitlement to be paid foster care allowances. On the contrary, this Bill gives health boards, for the first time, specific authority to place children in care with relatives where this is in their best interests.</P>
    <P>I would refer the House to section 35 of the Bill.  This provides that the health boards, in providing accommodation for a child in care, may make a number of arrangements.  They may place the child in foster care or in residential care or where he is eligible for adoption they may place him for adoption or &mdash; and this is relevant here &mdash; they may place the child with a relative.  Thus, we envisage children being placed in the care of relatives, indeed, in many cases this might be the most desirable arrangement.</P>
    <P>Obviously, different considerations <Col N="2115" /> apply to the placement of children with relatives, or placement with foster parents who are not part of the extended family.  Health boards are required to apply very strict tests in assessing the suitability of persons to act as foster parents.  However, different approaches must be adopted in deciding whether to place a child with a member of the extended family.  That is why we have made separate provision for placement with relatives rather than incorporating it within the foster care provisions generally.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that the separate treatment of foster parents and relatives is not motivated by any desire to save money or foster care allownces.  Relatives looking after children on behalf of health boards will have to be financially assisted by the relevant board in doing so.  I am prepared to give a commitment on that to the House today and I hope this will help to allay the fears that have been expressed on this point.  It is something we can discuss in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a legal duty on certain persons to report suspicions of child abuse to the appropriate health board was raised by a number of Senators.  This is something that was examined by the Law Reform Commission in their report on child sexual abuse.  The commission recommended the introduction of such procedures but went on to say that given the advanced state of the Child Care Bill it would be more appropriate to incorporate such a provision in separate legislation rather than trying to deal with it in this Bill.  This report was accepted by the Members of Dáil Éireann when the Bill was considered on Report Stage before Christmas.  I hope Senators will agree that it would be better to leave this matter to separate legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators called for the establishment of a national children's council.  Any proposal to establish a new organisation to be funded by the Exchequer has to be very carefully considered. The Government would have to be satisfied that there is a pressing need for the proposed body and that the work <Col N="2116" /> envisaged for it could not be undertaken by any existing State agency.  I am not convinced that such is the case in relation to the proposed national children's council.  The main role envisaged for such a council is providing advice to the Minister for Health and the health boards on child care policy.  This must be viewed in the light of the fact that the child care area has been the subject of numerous reports, studies and investigations in recent years.  There is now a broad consensus among the different shades of political opinion and the various interest groups as to what needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The major work now is getting sufficient resources to bring about all the necessary changes and improvements.  I do not believe the establishment of a national children's council would help to resolve this difficulty.  On the contrary, the operational expenses of a council, which could be over £100,000 per annum, would only divert resources from the front line services out in the community where they are needed.  However, the Government are not opposed in principle to the establishment of some form of consultative and advisory body in the child care area.  If the financial situation were to improve, and the need for it were to be more clearly established, the Minister for Health could avail of powers under the Health Acts to appoint consultative bodies to establish a national advisory body on child care.  This is the legal basis for the National Council for the Aged.  However, for the reasons I have mentioned, we are not disposed towards making special provision for a national children's council in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It was claimed that Part VIII of the Bill, which deals with the inspection and supervision of services for pre-school children, does not go far enough and that we should introduce a system of registration for the services.  I have to say that I do not accept this view.  I am anxious to avoid creating an elaborate supervisory system which could interfere with family arrangements and ordinary neighbourly help.  It has been estimated that over 60 per cent of pre-school children of working mothers are being looked after by grandparents and other relatives, or by non-relatives who reside in the family home. <Col N="2117" /> I believe that arrangements of this kind, for example, should not be subject to State intervention.</P>
    <P>There are two main types of services which will be subject to statutory control under the Bill: firstly, nurseries, creches and other pre-school services which operate on commercial lines and, secondly, community playgroups and other services which operate on a non-commercial basis.  All of these services will be required to comply with regulations, which the Minister for Health will make following consultations with the Ministers for Education and the Environment. Health boards will be required to have the services inspected, and will be able to call on the assistance of inspectors from the Department of Education in the case of services which have an educational dimension.  In the event of serious or persistent failure to adhere to the regulations, the court will be able to impose fines and, more significantly, order that the services be closed, either temporarily, while improvements are being effected, or for a longer period.  I feel that these provisions are adequate to deal with any abuses that may arise in the area of pre-school services.  I do not think it is necessary to introduce a registration process, with all the expense and bureaucracy that it would involve.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in response to a point made this morning, I would point out that failure to notify the health board or to abide by the regulations would be an offence with the provision of a fine of up to £1,000.  I believe that these sanctions are sufficient to ensure that persons carrying on pre-school services will comply with the provisions of this Part of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators Ryan and Upton spoke at some length about the area of juvenile justice and of children who are in trouble with the law.  The first thing to be said is that the Bill does not purport to reform our legislation in relation to juvenile justice. That is a complex area and would require major legislation of its own.  The Government are very much aware of the difficulties that currently exist in this area, particularly the shortage of places for young offenders requiring secure accommodation.  I want to assure the <Col N="2118" /> House that this is being tackled as a matter of urgency by my Government colleagues, the Ministers for Health, Education and Justice, and their respective Departments.  Arrangements are well underway to bring additional places into use and this will greatly ease the problems currently being experienced by the courts in securing places for children appearing before them.</P>
    <P>When initiated, the Child Care Bill contained nine Parts, 64 sections on 28 pages.  After outstanding debate and dialogue over a full year in an excellent all-party committee, we achieved an exceptional consensus on improving the Bill.  It was revamped on Committee Stage to contain ten Parts, 68 sections on 32 pages. Report Stage was given a lot of time in the Dáil and every section and amendment was reappraised.  In an exceptional display of parliamentary flexibility, we further restructured and revamped the Bill.  It now contain ten clear Parts and 76 sections on 40 pages.  This is the Bill at present before this House as we conclude this Second Stage here.</P>
    <P>I look forward to Committee Stage and to participation with the Senators in achieving a positive conclusion to this very important and necessary piece of historic legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. O'Keeffe Mr. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  In raising the issue of Irish Steel I am raising the concerns, not alone of the 600 workers in that plant, but also the concerns of the families and a major number of people in the Cork area.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the takeover of this plant and the future of the plant has been the subject of stop-go over the last number of years and even at this stage we still have not quite clarified what direction we are actually taking in terms of the long term future of Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>I bring to the Minister's attention the fact that it is one year ago tomorrow that he, other senior Ministers and the Taoiseach, met to review the Korf deal and outside interests in Irish Steel.  A decision was taken at that stage to try to attract outsiders, if possible, to take over this plant on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to use this opportunity to ask the Minister a number of questions relating to issues that pertained in the past, particularly in relation to the Korf deal.  My understanding is that in 1989 the Government and Irish Steel had more or less agreed a deal with the Korf organisation. At that time the Korf organisation was to take over the mill.  They were willing to take on board a payment to the Exchequer of a minimum of £1 million per year by way of defraying the £80 million debt that hangs over that plant.  As part of that plan, the company was to be restructured and modern equipment put in place which would reduce energy costs by a half.  I understand that the knock-on effect of this take-over would have ensured the jobs of the 600 people employed there and that down the road there was the possibility of a smelter in the Shannon estuary.  This plan at the time appeared to meet the approval of the board of Irish Steel, it seemed to meet <Col N="2120" /> the approval of the Minister for Finance and, on the face of it, it looked as if Irish Steel would be in a position at the end of the day to manufacture high quality steel which could be used particularly in the German car market.  The Korf organisation had got certain guarantees from that car market in Germany to purchase this high quality steel in the manufacturing of their cars.</P>
    <P>The Minister, upon taking office, I understand took the decision that he was not quite happy with the deal as placed before him and other multinational companies were approached with a view to taking it over.  North Star for a while appeared to be a company which had an interest but at the end of the day their offer was derisory given the fact that they wanted to take over the plant for a year to see how it operated and, if it operated profitably, they would take it over but they would be demanding 100 job losses. In the intervening period there was the untimely death of Willie Korf, head of the Korf organisation.  That has now put matters further into abeyance with the result that there is a stalemate.  Obviously the concern among the workers at this stage is great.  In deference to Irish Steel management and workers, the company have shown a profit over the last three years.  Since July last year they made a profit of roughly £600,000 net.  To pay tribute to those people, they have restructured to the best possible extent within the resources available to them.</P>
    <P>I understand that management has put a set of proposals before the Minister, Deputy O'Malley, and the Department of Finance.  I would like to ask him about that proposal: where is it at?  For instance, is the Minister satisfied, given past performances in Irish Steel, that the present management have the necessary expertise to take this plant right into the nineties and beyond, and have it operating and trading profitably?  Would it be the Minister's intention if this happened to invite in, as was done with Bord Telecom or An Post, an outside chief executive to take on the mantle within Irish Steel and ensure that the marginal basis of profit that is operating at the moment continues?</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Minister is still <Col N="2121" /> in negotiations with at least one other multinational.  With the demise of Willie Korf, negotiations are now under way between the Korf organisation and another major.  German steel company known as Metallgesellschaft.  Those negotiations should be concluded at the end of April.  Can the Minister tell me that this new restructured group still has a vibrant interest in taking over Irish Steel, maintaining the jobs and ensuring the long term future of the plant?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley) Desmond J. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. O'Malley)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish Steel is based at Haulbowline, County Cork, and produces mainly structural steel sections from ferrous scrap.  While the plant may be comparatively small when compared to the large integrated steel mills of Europe, it is an important feature of the industrial infrastructure of this country, and Cork in particular.  It is also a significant employer in the Cork area with an employment level of 633 people, approximately.</P>
      <P>Following years of loss making the company have returned profits, albeit modest, for the past two financial years. Turnover in the year ended 30 June 1990 was £88.7 million, of which 87 per cent was attributable to export sales.  This almost total dependence on the export market leaves the company open to the fierce competition of the European steel market which for many years was dogged by over-capacity and low productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The restructuring of the industry undertaken during the eighties is almost complete throughout the Community and has brought supply and demand more into line.  However, the steel industry has always been subject to cyclical fluctuations and, after four years of growth, 1991 is expected to feature a downturn in production and demand throughout the entire OECD area.  Prices are depressed at present and while there are indications that prices may have bottomed out the future still remains uncertain.  The recession in world markets has an almost immediate impact on trade in Irish Steel product range which is predominantly construction-orientated and, therefore, be the first to feel the chill winds of recession.  The market for heavy sections <Col N="2122" /> in the UK and in France has shown a sharp decline and import pressure on the Community market which had been fairly low in the last few years is now becoming stronger.  The crisis in the Gulf has also exacerbated the effects of this downturn. However, it is hoped that the negative effects on economic activity arising from the recent hostilities in the Gulf will not be a long term inhibiting factor on economic growth.</P>
    <P>Over the years, Irish Steel Limited have received total Government support amounting to roughly £190 million made up of equity, grants, repayable advances and State guarantees.  Of this, £143 million has been advanced since 1982 and cumulative losses as at 30 June 1990 amounted to £96.7 million.  Needless to say, company losses and State advances of this magnitude were not sustainable and the realism of that situation was reinforced in 1985 by the adoption at European Community level of rules prohibiting State aid for European steel manufacturers.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the search for a strong external partner for the company was initiated in 1985 and intensified in 1988.  This resulted in the identification of possible partners with whom negotiations were opened.  Arising from the negotiations that have taken place with these parties, I have to say that it has not been possible, so far, to conclude an agreement for the sale of the company.  In the case of one of the parties, it will be recalled that the main promoter involved, Dr. Willie Korf, tragically died in an air accident in November 1990.  There has been no substantial development since his death.</P>
    <P>I have to say that there is no change in Government policy in relation to Irish Steel.  The Government remain convinced that the interests of Irish Steel and of their workforce, especially in the longer term, will be best served by association with a strong external partner. However, I have never taken the view that a sale should be achieved at all costs. I have always been concerned that all options be thoroughly examined and assessed so that in the final analysis the option chosen is the best one for the <Col N="2123" /> company, for the workforce and for the State.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the company will continue to be run in a way that will endeavour to help their long term future. They are taking all necessary steps to improve competitiveness in a difficult trading environment internationally. They are proposing a package of rationalisation measures covering reductions in costs, including payroll costs, more flexible working arrangements in line with best practice and more appropriate pay arrangements in large part allied to performance.</P>
    <P>A redundancy package involving about 100 voluntary redundancies is an integral part of these rationalisation measures. Obviously, there will be full consultation between the company and trade unions in relation to these proposals.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the Senator and the House that the search for a suitable partner for Irish Steel continues and that there is no question of a sale proceeding unless the Government are fully satisfied that that is the best option for the company, their workforce and the Irish taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Until such a sale can take place, it will be up to the company, their management and workforce, with the support and encouragement of Government, to continue to operate on a basis that will enhance its long term viability.</P>
    <P>In view of the query raised by the Senator about the management of the company, I think it only right to say that I have full confidence in the present management and board of Irish Steel.  They have succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the company in the past two years into a profit making situation.  Even though the profits are minute, at least it is very much better than the long succession of losses which were a feature of this company for many years.  I believe the management are endeavouring to come to grips with the problems that clearly exist there, as they do throughout the whole European steel industry, in an efficient and workmanlike way.</P>
    <P>The Senator described the position in regard to this company as stop-go.  He said that the Government's position was <Col N="2124" /> unclear and that he wanted it clarified today.  I hope I have clarified it but in case there is any doubt about it, the Government's position is, as it has been for quite some time, that they are anxious to sell this company as soon as they can beneficially do so.  By beneficially I do not mean just in terms of the return of some small part of the money that is due to the Exchequer but beneficially from the point of view of the ongoing viability of the company and their retention on a long term basis of as many of the company's employees as possible.  It would, of course, have been possible to sell this company to several buyers.  There were six different offers made in all.  The company could have been sold to any one of the bidders if we just wanted to sell it for the sake of selling it.  I and the Government could have washed our hands of it but I was not prepared to do that unless I was as satisfied as I could reasonably be about the future and I was not satisfied with a number of the offers that were made.</P>
    <P>I regret that I did not take a full note of what the Senator said in regard to proposals or, as he put it, an offer of the Korf organisation so I cannot go into each point he raised.  I thought he was going to go into it afterwards in some more detail.</P>
    <P>There are a few other comments I would like to make.  The Senator mentioned the Korf organisation.  In fact, the Korf organisation were a very small company with a small annual turnover.  They had originally put forward certain proposals at the end of 1988 or at the beginning of 1989.  After I assumed my present office I met the late Dr. Korf with a financier, who I believe was an American, who formed a major part of that offer at the time.  I asked them a number of questions about the position and about what they intended.  As a result of the meeting I had with them there was a major rethink and many of the proposals that had been put forward early in 1989 were withdrawn and the offer that had been made was very considerably amended.  It caused me, among others, to wonder on what basis the original offer <Col N="2125" /> had been put forward if most of the principal features in it were subsequently withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Senator mentioned that a smelter would be built on the Shannon estuary. When I questioned the detail of that and asked for the projections in relation to it, I was informed that that was withdrawn and that there was no question of that going ahead.  I asked to see the guarantees in respect of the car steel market in Germany which the Senator mentioned today.  On finally getting those guarantees, as they were described at the time by Dr. Korf, I found that they were not in fact guarantees at all, rather they were letters from two or three automobile manufacturers saying that if the quality of steel that would be produced at Haulbowline were adequate and if the price were the same as or lower than the price for steel produced by anyone else and delivered to southern Germany, those manufacturers would be prepared to consider buying.  I could not, by any stretch of the imagination, describe letters of that kind as guarantees of a market and they clearly were not.  I think it was erroneous, therefore, of the company concerned to allege to people generally that they did have guarantees.</P>
    <P>On the question of the payment to the Exchequer, that was subject to very heavy revision indeed and was, in fact, in the case of that company less attractive and, in many ways, significantly less attractive than some offers made by some others.</P>
    <P>I do not think it appropriate for me at this stage to go into the question of the offer made by North Star because I do not think that would be fair to them &mdash; I have only referred to the Korf offer because it was raised here &mdash; except to say in general terms that North Star is a wholly owned subsidiary of a very large company, an American conglomerate, the annual turnover which I understand last year was in the region of 43,000 million dollars, making it one of the largest companies in the world, whose resources are literally almost endless. Therefore, it would be of considerably more interest to me &mdash; and I suggest, therefore, to the workforce at Haulbowline &mdash; than a very small company <Col N="2126" /> indeed who would have had extremely small resources.  It would not be correct to say that the offer they made was derisory in any sense.  They are a successful steel company, particularly in this field of small mills, producing this particular type of product.  It is interesting to find that in their recent history in the United States they took over six companies of a roughly similar capacity to that of Irish Steel, all of which were loss-making, and turned all of them around.</P>
    <P>In my discussions with them it was also of interest to me to discover that at least one of those companies had been the property of the late Dr. Korf but had been heavily loss-making.  When they took it over they were able to transform it into a profitable company.  It is entirely untrue to say that the board of Irish Steel supported the proposal from Dr. Korf. In fact, they left me in absolutely no doubt whatever, in a most unequivocal letter which the chairman wrote to me on behalf of the board, that they did not favour that proposal.  They left me in no doubt whatsoever on that point.</P>
    <P>So far as the present position is concerned, the Senator mentioned a company called Metallgesellschaft. Metallgesellschaft became involved at my suggestion last year when I thought that, if there were going to be a bid from Germany, I would prefer that it was from a large company with considerable resources.  Before the tragic event of last November there was discussion then about the possibility of a joint venture. The question of a joint venture does not now arise as a result of what unfortunately happened last November.  I would, of course, welcome a bid from Metallgesellschaft themselves and the possibility of that may arise in the future. There are other interested parties also.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the obvious thing for both the Government and the company to do is to try to make the company as efficient as possible, thereby to secure its future in the short term as a State-owned company and in the medium and longer-term as a company which hopefully will be purchased by a major operator in the steel business who would be prepared to make whatever further investments are necessary to ensure that this plant has a <Col N="2127" /> long term future.  If I were interested in a sale for the sake of simply a sale I could long since have disposed of this company, but I am perfectly satisfied that that would not have been in the best interests of the company and of its workforce and, accordingly, of the State.  I will be happy to sell as soon as I believe that we have a satisfactory situation in which it would be wise to sell and in which it would be in everybody's interest to sell.</P>

Certainly, I am happy that Irish Steel is in good hands and that the negotiations to date have been well handled.  I am sure that as a result of this debate today those working in Irish Steel will be far happier than they have been up to now, due to the erudite explanation given by the Minister.</P>
