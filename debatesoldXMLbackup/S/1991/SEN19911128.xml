      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for improved sewage treatment in Greystones, County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Hederman of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to proceed with the cycleway around St. Stephen's Green as prepared by Dublin Corporation in 1980 and as discussed with the Office of Public Works at a meeting on 21 April 1983.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ross and Hederman as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ross' matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Hederman may give notice another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Will we have these strange sounds off-stage which are at present coming into the Chamber during the day?</P>
      <P>Yesterday my colleague, Senator Cosgrave, asked the Leader of the House about forthcoming legislation and I think he omitted, mistakenly, to give an answer.  Could he now tell me what legislation we can expect between now and Christmas and if there will be any new legislation?  Is there any legislation promised dealing with the takeover of the B &amp; I?  Would he use his influence to see that the Family Planning Bill will be initiated in this House?  This House is particularly well suited to deal with legislation of this type, even if some of the moral custodians are not present at the moment.  What plans has he in mind for the debate next week on the Maastricht Summit?  Could he also tell us if Senator O'Keeffe's crusade to have banking discussed is still alive and well?</P>

      <P>I am sure we are all glad Senator Ross has not lost his vision of the broader world or the need for fundamental reforms and is still trying to do things that will change our attitude to all sorts of things.  I am very grateful for his continuing interest in the broader issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is almost a ritual at this stage, but can we have a debate on Northern Ireland in this House soon?  Can it be an openended debate where we can talk at length about what is happening?  I do not want to recite the latest atrocity on the Order of Business every day this House meets. There was yet another horrific story last night.  I am horrified by the apparently collective decision to silence democracy on this issue &mdash; to silence both Houses of the Oireachtas.  We need to expound our views openly and at length.  Both Houses need to discuss attitudes to Northern Ireland, its problems and possible solutions. It is an issue I will endeavour to raise as often as I can on the Order of <Col N="1163" /> Business.  I am sure most Members want a serious level headed discussion on where one part of this island is going and what we can do about it.</P>

      <P>Is the Leader prepared to make time available for a debate on the transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and various toxic materials? There were two or three very disturbing reports over the last few days.  There was the accident where toxic materials were released into the environment and nobody seemed to be accountable or know what is happening.  In today's newspapers there is another very disturbing report of the gross inadequacies of the present facilities in Dublin hospitals for the disposal of toxic waste material.  For those reasons, I would be very grateful if the Leader would accede to my request on this matter.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to pass on to his colleague, the Minister for Communications, as a matter of urgency my concern at what can only be described as a mean approach to discount on stamps for Christmas cards.  This is a time when people send glad tidings, and An Post should adopt a more generous approach to facilitate people, particularly those who are less well off.</P>

      <P>Since there seems to be such a dearth of legislation, when the discussion on the role of the Seanad concludes would the Leader of the House consider taking motions for reform of the Seanad?  It would make the Leader's life a lot easier if this House functioned the way it was supposed to.  I was distressed to see that yesterday the Leader was accused of being held in contempt by the Government &mdash; I think that remark came from our bench.  Senators speak of their frustrations and say the Seanad is being marginalised.  One spoke about Mickey Mouse legislation.  It has reached a terrible stage.  I believe that it would make the Leader's life a lot easier&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Whatever we might think about our glorious and esteemed Leader, Senator Fallon, the last thing we would do would be to hold him in contempt.  He has done the best job he can.</P>
      <P>Last week I raised on the Order of Business the question of the Broadcasting Bill, as did many of my colleagues, and in the critical situation that was then facing us with the demise of Century Radio.  According to this morning's newspapers, there has been a welcome rescheduling attempt and initiative by the banks and various financial institutions to ensure that there is an alternative broadcasting medium.  Considering what happened in Century Radio and in the context of the Minister's proposals to bring forward broadcasting legislation in both Houses of the Oireachtas, will the Leader request the Minister for Communications to consider bringing that legislation into this House?  It is vital that we have an alternative national news service and the fact that Century Radio have gone under and are now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the call by my colleague, Senator Upton, for a debate on the disposal of waste and toxic materials.  We need a national plan for waste management.  This is necessary as the tipheads, certainly in Dublin, are running out of space.  We do not have any means of proper incineration nor do we have any means of dealing with toxic waste.  This is a very serious matter.  We cannot pass it on to other countries.  I ask the Leader to make time available for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>I do not think we will have any substantial legislation this term, but could we have a programme of work organised for the coming term so that we will have a substantial body of legislation to deal with?</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning and ask the Leader of the House when he will have a debate on the banking system in view of the fact that the Ombudsman's annual report on the credit institutions, published today, outlines that 76 per cent of complaints from the general public dealt with banks and the banking system.  Since the Leader, on 30 October and 6 November, committed himself to such a debate within three to <Col N="1166" /> four weeks, will we have this debate next week?</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on the North of Ireland.  It seems extraordinary, and I have said this on a number of occasions, that we are prevented from discussing this issue because of an apparent concern about the sensitivities in that part of the island. Sensitivities do not appear to be that delicate; they are still murdering people. We are abrogating our responsibility by not discussing the issue.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House reconsider his position with regard to the question of a debate on the Middle East? I ask that in the light of his apparent willingness to consider a debate on the North of Ireland which resulted from the fact that this House repeatedly requested one and there was growing support for it.  There is growing support for a debate on the Middle East.  Will the Leader give time for this debate, particularly when we had the spectacle yesterday of a Minister gloating about concluding beef deals with a plenipotentiary called the Minister for Development and Jihad?  I do not think he is to be complimented on that.  He was a representative from&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call made by Senator Neville and others for a debate on the banking system.  In common with some other Members, I received a rather substantial public relations document from the banking institutions.  Obviously, these institutions are concerned about the demands for a debate in the House.  Senator O'Keeffe started the ball rolling.  On at least two occasions the Leader promised a debate <Col N="1167" /> on the banking system.  If possible, we should be given a definite indication today when that debate is likely to take place.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader intend responding to the request I made yesterday regarding who precisely represents the public interest at the beef tribunal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Norris in his call for a debate on the Middle East for a number of reasons, but especially because of the serious reports from Kuwait about the way people are being treated.  Considering everything that went on, all the hullabaloo, the civil <Col N="1168" /> rights, etc. that were discussed before the conference, I believe it is only right that the West should make sure that people are properly looked after and their civil rights are respected.  I would like &mdash; and here I totally disagree with the Senator &mdash; to congratulate the Government on their beef deal with Iran.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning had better watch out.  I think he is moving forward.  Senator Manning asked about legislation between now and Christmas. We only have about three weeks left, 19 December is the day we have in mind to adjourn for the recess.  As I understand it, we should have the Patents Bill, the Milk (Regulations) Supply Bill and the Criminal Damages Bill.  In regard to new legislation which Senator Manning referred to, I am confident that in the next two or three weeks an important local Government Bill will be initiated in this House.  I noted what he said regarding the Family Planning Bill; I will make inquiries with the Minister.  He asked about the Maastricht Summit.  I said yesterday that because of the importance of the summit we plan next week to have a two day debate starting at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday and resuming on Thursday from 10.30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to Senator O'Keeffe's crusade and I will continue to see if I can arrange a debate on the subject in which he is interested.  I am anxious that we have such a debate and I indicated some weeks ago accordingly. Some difficulties were encountered along the way but, as far as I am concerned, I will continue to explore&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Howard referred to the banking system and also to the Goodman affair which I do not intend to comment on.  Senators Eoin Ryan and Norris asked for a debate on the Middle East and that I will consider.  Senator Neville who asked for a debate on the banking system.  Senators Costello and Upton asked for a debate on the transport of toxic waste materials.  I had not planned for that at the moment but I will consider it.  Senator Mooney referred to the Broadcasting Bill and that is something I will explore.</P>
      <P>I noted what Senator Cosgrave said regarding An Post.  In so far as Senator Hederman is concerned, I always look forward to an easy life.  My theory in life is that I prefer nourishment to punishment, but it does not worry me.  I will continue to do my job as best I can and will continue to seek legislation for this House. That remains my commitment.</P>
      <P>The B &amp; I Bill was referred to by Senator Manning.  My understanding is that the 1991 Bill will be introduced in early December.  The sale of B &amp; I, as I understand it, will not be completed until the necessary legislation has been enacted.  It will be taken fairly quickly because it is important that this matter be approved before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>Before we commence I would remind Senators that Members may speak only once on Report Stage except for the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Also on Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.  I call on Senator Kennedy and I also wish to state that Senator Costello's name has been included in this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, to delete line 20 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) death or personal injury, including consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that damage should mean death or personal injury including consequential loss or damage sustained by an injured person.  However section 1 (1) of this Bill in a major departure states that damage means only the following in regard to paragraph (a), death or personal injury without any reference whatever to consequential economic loss suffered by the injured person. The whole area of consequential losses arising from damage is, therefore, excluded and that is a very serious flaw in this legislation because it does not give it the clarity and the precision that is necessary.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I indicated to the Minister of State, Deputy Kirk, who was deputising for the Minister of State with responsibility for marketing and trade, that there are some excellent provisions in this Bill spelled out with clarity and precision.  However, in fundamental definition of the concept of damage it is lacking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an inherent and basic principle of our law, and has been for many years, indeed centuries, that if damage is caused a person can get compensation for injury, for damage to property and for consequential economic loss.  Thus, for example, a defective steering mechanism in a motor car may cause a car to crash and serious injury may result which causes a person to be out of work for a lenthy period of time.  The consequential losses &mdash; loss of earnings, loss of the use of the car, etc. &mdash; are excluded because of the wording of this Bill.  The word &ldquo;damage&rdquo; is used on its own and without any interpretation clause in this legislation. It includes a wide range of items: damages for personal injuries, for pain and suffering, for damage to property <Col N="1171" /> and for consequential and economic losses.</P>
    <P>Consequential damages are not provided for in this Bill and it appears that all the judges can do under this legislation is to look at the definition of damages contained in section 1 (1) and decide if the injured person is entitled to damages. This matter could be effectively dealt with by the inclusion of the phrase, consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person.</P>
    <P>I do not think we are asking too much of the Minister of State.  We have teased out this Bill as best we can in the presence of two Ministers of State.  Opinions were given in the Dáil on whether pain and suffering is included.  On one occasion, a former Attorney General indicated that pain and suffering was not included.  Now in this House we are told that another Attorney General says that it is included and so on.  What I am really asking for, therefore, is that the Minister would respond positively to this amendment.</P>
    <P>What we cannot do in this legislation is to give the consumer less than is contained in the directive.  The Minister of State has indicated that he feels this legislation must go through quickly because he is concerned about the European Communities and the action they have initiated against this country under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome.  It would be better to get the thing right and to achieve the clarity I referred to.</P>
    <P>This matter was examined in great detail by two law commissions &mdash; the law commission in the United Kingdom and the Scottish law commission.  Very briefly they summed up the situation in an objective way.  They say first, that under existing law a person who sustains personal injury may be awarded damages under the two main heads, one in respect of pecuniary losses, the other in respect of non-pecuniary losses.  Under the first head one is compensated for financial loss, such as loss of wages and out of pocket expenses.  For non-pecuniary losses it is usual to award compensation on a more general basis for pain and <Col N="1172" /> suffering and loss of amenity resulting from the injury.</P>
    <P>Second, the commissions state, it would be inconvenient procedurally if an injured person who wished to recover full damages had to initiate two distinct causes of action within the regime as recommended, one based on strict liability and the other based on rights in tort. I am anxious that we do not point to the negligence in tort remedy on one hand and to strict liability on the other; we should try to ensure unity of approach with regard to these two remedies.</P>
    <P>The third and crucial recommendation of the Scottish and UK law commission is that compensation for death and personal injury should be assessed in the same way under strict liability as when the claim lies in tort and in particular non-pecuniary losses should be compensated.  This means that compensation under the new regime of strict liability should be assessed as it is now done under the law of negligence and of tort and the plaintiff should be compensated in respect of non-pecuniary losses, such as loss of wages and so on.</P>
    <P>It is true to say as Senator Howard indicated yesterday that this legislation because of a small number of deficiencies could lead to much litigation in the courts.  I do not think it is good enough to rely on Minister Kirk's statement that these matters will be tested in the courts. We, as legislators, should be trying to keep these matters out of the courts and out of the higher courts in particular. Why should we take chances with legislation and risk it going into the High and Supreme Courts when we know the costs of proceedings in those courts?  The ordinary consumer cannot afford High Court and Supreme Court costs in relation to damage or injury suffered as a result of defective products.</P>
    <P>Litigation seems to be the art of making argument.  Senator Howard indicated that undoubtedly, following the passage of this Bill legal energies will be consumed by lawyers trying to draw inference and importance from the discrepancy in definitions of damage between this Bill and the EC directive. <Col N="1173" /> Indeed, there is a difference among the definitions in the original directive and the final directive and the definition contained in the Civil Liability Act, 1961. Many cases, therefore, end up in the High and Supreme Courts because Ministers and Governments are not sufficiently responsive to non-political points made at the formative stages of legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will respond positively to this amendment.  As he indicated in the other House, all wisdom does not reside on the Government side even on the best advice of the Attorney General. I, therefore, strongly urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 1 which will clarify this definition of damage which is the crucial aspect of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment and support fully the remarks made by Senator Kennedy.  We have been over this ground at least twice, on Second Stage and on Committee Stage and perhaps we will cover it again while discussing the amendment on Report Stage. This amendment is probably the most important of all the amendments tabled because the provisions in the definition of damage in the Bill are at variance with what is said in Article 9 of the EC directive.  The wording of the directive has been abandoned and we have ended up with legislation that restricts consumer rights to a greater extent than intended by the farmers of the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems anomalous to establish one set of procedures for liability and then split the legal process and establish another set in the same area.  We are dealing with what has heretofore been generally considered as a legal unit &mdash; damage covering personal injury, damaged property and consequential loss. Those matters have always been processed together under negligence, under the law of tort but now personal injury and damage to personal property will be covered by this legislation yet we will have a separate system for dealing with consequential loss in terms of earnings <Col N="1174" /> and perhaps in terms of pain and suffering. Why separate them?  We have been trying to protect the consumer and now we are going to disadvantage the consumer by imposing on them two separate legal procedures.  The first procedure will be strict liability, which is an improvement, but then the consumer must take action under tort and negligence to recover consequential loss of earnings, for example.  I cannot understand why we should adopt this disunified messy costly and confusing procedure.</P>
    <P>None of the arguments I have heard in favour of this course has been adequate. Senator Kennedy referred to a car mechanism which might prove defective and the resulting loss of earnings for somebody who would need hospitalisation and would be out of work for some time. There are numerous examples one could give, such as a defective light bulb, and we have not managed to expand the definition of electricity, although a defective light bulb could destroy a factory with the loss of earnings not only to a workforce but also to an employer.  There are 101 examples we could give to prove the need to protect consumers against defective products.</P>
    <P>Having shifted the burden of proof &mdash; evidence of damage will still be required of course &mdash; from <i>caveat emptor</i> to <i>caveat productor</i>, why should we split that again and say there is strict liability for a defective product in certain areas only?</P>
    <P>We have always adopted a minimalist approach to implementing legislation from the European Community and the international arena.  We should be improving this legislation in favour of the consumer rather than disimproving it as we are doing by invoking the proposed definition of damage.  I ask the Minister to reconsider his position in relation to this matter.</P>

      <P>Before I discuss the amendment I am conscious that the Minister was in the Public Gallery during the Order of Business and would have heard somewhat lighthearted references to the unusual title of an Iranian Minister he <Col N="1175" /> dealt with and to whom he referred yesterday in his speech.  I assure the Minister that after he left the House there was a balanced recognition of his achievement of a successful deal with the Minister with the rather unusual title.</P>

      <P>I am not being pleasant in the expectation that the Minister will relent on his continued opposition to the amendments being put forward from this side of the House, an attitude I regret.  I assure the House that this side is anxious at all times to ensure that legislation is effective, positive and benefits those whom it is intended to benefit.  In this legislation we have been constantly highlighting flaws.  We have questioned with the utmost sincerity the potential of this Bill to benefit consumers.  That is our overriding concern.</P>
      <P>We ask the Minister in this amendment to accept a simple definition that damage means death and personal injury, and includes consequential loss or damage sustained by the injured person.  We want to ensure that consequential economic loss will be covered by this legislation because it is not covered at present. Senators Kennedy and Costello outlined the loss of earnings which might arise from loss of a car, equipment or whatever. That type of consequential loss is not included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have noted the confusion of views of two Attorneys General as to whether compensation for pain and suffering is included in the legislation, a highly unsatisfactory situation.  As Senator Kennedy pointed out, if this legislation goes through without our amendment a person who has suffered loss or damage and wishes to recover consequential loss of earnings will have to undertake two distinct and separate courses of action in the courts.  That is totally unsatisfactory and that situation could be resolved by <Col N="1176" /> the acceptance of our amendment.  Without this amendment the legislation is flawed and will be of less benefit to the consumer than it might be.  I cannot understand why it is not open to the Minister to consider improving the legislation by the inclusion of our amendment. I support the amendment and the arguments made by my colleagues.</P>

      <P>This House in the past has amended legislation that passed through the Dáil, before arriving in this House in a cool, calm, less political environment than the Dáil we listened to each other. When I was on the Opposition side of the House Ministers of Senators Howard's and Senator Kennedy's party listened to me also and amendments were accepted. I agree with the points already made.  We ordinary people outside the legal world &mdash; except for my colleagues Senator Kennedy &mdash; have heard the opinions of two Attorneys General which do not seem to concur.  My concern about this Bill having passed through this House while I was a serving Member, would be that if, on foot of this legislation, a consumer found himself or herself in court faced with costs they could not afford, I would feel I had not done my duty here.</P>
      <P>I have listened to the arguments for two days.  There is no question of party politics in this but a deep concern for the general public.  We are now into the final straight of this legislation, which to me was deeply complicated, and it was with the aid of the deep knowledge of my two colleagues on the other side of the House that I grasped it.  As a Senator of 15 years I believe that the Minister, in the case of complicated legislation that will affect the general public, should be in a position to accept an amendment.</P>

      <P>I would like to express my appreciation to Senator Howard and Senator Costello for their remarks in relation to the beef deal completed with the Islamic Republic of Iran.  For clarification, the Iranian Minister who came here is the Minister for Jihad, which translates in English into <Col N="1177" /> the Minister for Construction Crusade. That Minister has been most helpful to this country and is responsible for the resumption of a major beef deal.  It would be inappropriate if any comment made by a Senator would reflect on his very distinguished position in the Islamic Republic of Iran and on the assistance he has given to me, and fellow Ministers, when I visited the Islamic Republic of Iran.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and repeat that I have given careful consideration to the views expressed in relation to this important legislation.  It may or may not be in order to say that any reference to certain types of legislation coming before this House should not refer to the Liability for Defective Products Bill, 1991 which is major legislation.  I am not referring to comments made in relation to matters other than this Bill.  I had the privilege of being here this morning and yesterday on the Order of Business and this House is being treated seriously by the Government with regard to this important Bill which could not be regarded as &mdash; and maybe I am misquoting &mdash; Mickey Mouse legislation.</P>
      <P>Regarding this amendment, I can only restate what I said regarding a similar Committee Stage amendment.  The definition of damage used in the Bill is entirely consistent with the approach contained in the definition of damage in section 21 of the Civil Liability Act, 1961. That Act is the principal statute governing liability in this country and the definition contained in it is as follows: &ldquo;Damage includes loss of property, loss of life and personal injury&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relevant section should be read in conjunction with section 2 (1) of the Bill which provides that a &ldquo;producer shall be liable in damages in tort for damage caused wholly or partly by a defect in his product&rdquo;.  When examined in this manner the provisions relating to damage are sufficient to make applicable the domestic Irish rules concerning the assessment of damage including pain and suffering, consequential loss, etc, subject only to <Col N="1178" /> the limits expressly imposed by the directive which are reproduced in the Bill. In the Attorney General's opinion the definition of damage in the Bill would have this meaning even if section 2 (1) were not there or were drafted differently.</P>
    <P>For the same reason it is unnecessary to reproduce in the Bill the last sentence of Article 9 of the directive which states that the definition of damage &ldquo;shall be without prejudice to national provisions relating to non-material damage.&rdquo;  It would be positively undesirable to do so as the effect of so doing would be to emphasise one domestic Irish rule concerning assessment and scope for damages to the exclusion of others which would be equally applicable, subject only to the limitations imposed by the directive, and would thereby risk causing confusion and uncertainty where none should exist.  It is clear, therefore, that consequential loss or damage is already covered in the Bill and acceptance of this amendment would mean the unnecessary duplication of provisions which already exist.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Senator Honan that this is the case and she need have no concern that this Bill in any way will disadvantage the Irish consumer.  The directive is a harmonisation measure and thus we should do nothing to place Irish producers and manufacturers at a disadvantage particularly in export markets where 80 per cent of Irish production is now sold.</P>
    <P>Senator Kennedy also referred to reports by two UK law commissioners. It is interesting in that regard that the definition of damage in the UK implementing legislation is as follows: damage means death or personal injury or any loss or damage to any property. Thus, the UK definition is almost identical to that used in this Bill.  As Minister with responsibility for Trade, I will not put our manufacturers at any disadvantage in Europe in relation to this legislation.  We have a major responsibility in this regard.</P>

      <P>We have to balance the overall situation.  I am satisfied under the 1961 Act that consumers' interests are well guarded and controlled.  I regard my position as Minister with responsibility for Trade as being consumer-orientated because I have had the responsibility of attending consumer council meetings in Europe where I have protected the cause of the Irish consumer on many occasions.</P>
      <P>I want to clear up any misunderstanding which may have arisen regarding the application of this Bill to compensation for non-material damage, that is, pain and suffering and consequential loss which is the kernel of this legislation.  It has been teased out in detail in the Lower House and consequential loss has also been the main bone of contention in the Upper House. It was pointed out on Committee Stage that I had stated in the Lower House that pain and suffering did not fall within the scope of the Bill and that this conflicted with my statement to this House that such non-material damage was covered by the Bill.  Damages for pain and suffering are not provided for in the directive but the definition of damage as defined in section 1 (1) of the Bill read in conjunction with section 2 (1) covers pain and suffering. We have dealt with that matter once and for all in this House and that is the situation in relation to this legislation.  I rest my case on this issue.  We have gone into this matter in minute detail and I accept that this is the proper approach to any legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Honan and I have already indicated in both Houses that where an amendment would improve a Bill I would be the first to accept it from any side of the House.  I do not regard legislation going through this House as a political matter but as one of public interest.  In that regard I accepted amendments in the Dáil yesterday which were put down by other Members of the House and supported by well reasoned and argued points.  I would do the same also in this House but in this case I cannot <Col N="1180" /> because it is not in the public interest. After all the arguments put forward, I regret I am not in a position to change my view.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues Senators Howard and Costello for the way they have argued our case here this morning and, in particular, I express my appreciation to Senator Honan who summed up our concern in a nutshell.  I was hoping the Minister would be able to respond positively but he told me outside this Chamber &mdash; and he will not mind my saying it &mdash; that he is under pressure from Europe to have this legislation passed and he does not want it to go back to the other House.  It is unfortunate that we delayed implementing this legislation for over three years so that the European Commission had to initiate proceedings against us under Article 169.  We are now rushing it through and not doing the job we should do.</P>
      <P>The Minister, on the advice of the former Attorney General, got it wrong in the other House, in regard to pain and suffering.  He has now clarified the position and he says that pain and suffering is included in the scope of this legislation on the advice fo the new Attorney General.  I am suggesting to the Minister that he got it wrong and Attorneys General have differed.  He is a brave man to admit there was division of opinion but I find it hard to see how he got it wrong in regard to pain and suffering which is clearly included in the Bill.  The definition in section 1 (1) clearly indicates that pain and suffering is included but there is no reference in the Bill to consequential economic loss.  That is what I am concerned about and I suggest that if the Minister got it wrong regarding a matter in the legislation he may be getting it wrong now in regard to the very important matter of consequential loss.  One of the leading authorities in this country in the consumer products area, Professor Alex of Trinity College, who is director of the Irish Centre for European Law, stated in a recent lecture that economic loss is not covered by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The Minister referred to UK legislation; I suggested that the Minister was copying the UK legislation and it is not the first time we have copied UK legislation. The Minister is making my point but he has departed from the exact wording of the directive.  If he was prepared to adhere and to bring forward his own amendment we would support it in substitution for our amendment.  If he used the exact words of the final draft of the directive we would be happy with that.</P>
    <P>The Minister implies that what he says in this House or in the other House will be looked at by the courts.  There is no evidence that that is so.  There are one or two cases, where for example, Justice Costello in a High Court decision involving a complicated area in regard to patent law, referred to an amendment he had proposed when he was a Member of the Lower House.  That seemed a very sensible approach by a Member of the Oireachtas who wished to have an amendment accepted by the Government of the day.  The Government of the day refused it for what they said were good <Col N="1182" /> reasons.  When Justice Costello became a judge in the High Court he had to interpret this issue and he naturally looked at what he had said in the Lower House.  In general, however, one could not have judges looking at all the extra-parliamentary material available; they do not do so.  It has been suggested to me that barristers do this but that is not true either.  They would not have time to go through all the material and memoranda associated with this matter.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed the Minister is not prepared to accept a well argued nonpolitical amendment, as Senator Honan has said.  Somebody in the Department of Industry and Commerce is telling the Minister he cannot accept amendments here, no matter how good those amendments are.  They want the legislation through and they do not want it to go back to the other House.  We, on this side of the House, must press our amendment in the interests of the consumer.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;soil,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;of hydroponic culture,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In section 1 (1) of the Bill, the phrase &ldquo;primary agricultural products&rdquo; is defined as meaning &ldquo;the products of the soil, of stock-farming and of fisheries and game, excluding such products and game which have undergone initial processing;&rdquo;. However, as I indicated on Committee Stage, the phrase &ldquo;products of the soil&rdquo; raises some very interesting questions in relation to the modern technique of hydroponics, which enables crops to be grown in vitamin-enriched sand and water.  This matter was discussed in the House of Lords where Lord Radner pointed out that many vegetables, particularly cucumbers, tomatoes and lettuces are grown by a process known as hydroponics, where the one thing not involved is soil.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, a ridiculous situation would arise if two cucumbers were exposed for sale and one fell outside the scope of this legislation while the other was inside it.  I, therefore, think that, in page 3, line 6, after &ldquo;soil&rdquo; the phrase &ldquo;of hydroponic culture&rdquo; should be inserted or some such amendment made.  Otherwise, the phrase &ldquo;products of the soil&rdquo; may well have to be interpreted, and interpretation may have to be stretched by the courts to refer to products capable of being grown in the soil, in order to extend the definition to cover hydroponically grown matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State indicated on Second Stage that he would have this matter examined.  I would urge him to accept this amendment or to propose an improved amendment of his own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment. I support what Senator Kennedy <Col N="1184" /> has said.  This is a very useful amendment. It covers an area not covered by the definition of &ldquo;primary agricultural products&rdquo; and which needs to be covered because it reflects modern horticultural development where quite a number of horticultural products are now produced in a fluid rather than in soil.  This is normal practice in County Dublin &mdash; in Lusk and surrounding areas &mdash; where market gardening takes place.  Initially, although not always, products are grown in the soil and are then transferred to a nutrient &mdash; enriched fluid, which is water. They can also be cultured entirely in fluid.  This amendment adds to the definition.</P>
      <P>We have been so very slow in the introduction of this legislation that the developments which have taken place in horticulture have not been taken into consideration in the wording of the Bill. Primary agricultural products can be produced not in the soil, but by culture in a fluid which can be devoid of soil.  I am not even talking about sand because it may be said that sand has elements of soil and soil has elements of sand.  Horticultural produce is commonly produced in nutrient &mdash; enriched water.  This section would benefit by the extension of the definition to include it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment put down by Senator Kennedy and seconded by Senator Costello.  I am not prepared to say there is a flaw in the legislation but I put it to the Minister that a very obvious gap has been identified, where a certain type of product is not included in this Bill.  It has been very clearly demonstrated that products produced from vitamin-enriched sand or water are now available and being used by consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legislation should never be brought in simply to deal with an immediate situation or envisaging only the immediate time span.  Legislators must take account of developments they know are taking place and are being expanded.  This is a typical case in which we are aware of new developments.  Products produced by hydroponic culture will be available; I am <Col N="1185" /> reluctant, at this stage, to say they will be widely available but, clearly, it is possible that there will be widespread availability in a few years.</P>
    <P>Having brought that very clear likelihood to the Minister's attention, is it not regrettable that we are bringing in legislation which will not take account of that development even though we are all aware of it.  However forlorn my appeal to the Minister might be, his attention has been drawn to this situation.  We cannot deny that these products are now available. We cannot deny that they will be available in ever increasing quantities in the foreseeable future.  Why then does he refuse to include these products in this legislation when, obviously, they should be included?  If we fail to include them the legislation will be only partially effective in achieving its proposed objective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The science of hydroponics is the growing of plants in a water solution, with an appropriate mix of nutrients suspended in the circulating water.  In other words, the process does not involve the use of soil.  As can be seen from the relevant line which this amendment seeks to alter, the definition of &ldquo;primary agricultural products&rdquo; means, among other things, products of the soil.  The directive, when referring to primary agricultural products, makes no mention of hydroponic culture.  As this process does not involve the propagation of plants in soil I have no discretion to include such products in the Bill. However, because of the close relationship between hydroponics and conventional agricultural practice, it is felt it would be a matter for a court to decide if hydroponically produced goods are covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>As Senators mentioned, this matter was not included in the directive and was not inserted when it went through the European Parliament.  We are not in a position to amend it, at this stage, even though I am prepared to consider the arguments put forward by Senators. Under this Bill a review of the legislation will take place every five years, and this issue will come up as part of the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1186" /> The wording in this section of the Bill is identical to that in the directive &mdash; a course of action which the Senators opposite have constantly urged.  No doubt the issue raised will be dealt with in any revision of the directive.  The first revision in Europe is due in 1991.  Other countries adopted this directive much earlier &mdash; it was brought forward on 25 July 1985 &mdash; and some of them should, therefore, have already had the five year review.  The review may lead to amendment but, in reality, it may not arise.  I have no discretion to change the directive even though the arguments put forward are reasonable.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicates on the one hand that he wishes to stick, precisely and exactly, to the words of the directive.  If he had done that in so far as consequential loss and damage was concerned, we would have been very happy.  Now, he says he has no discretion and that he must stick exactly to the words of the directive in regard to a practical matter, such as the definition of &ldquo;primary agricultural products&rdquo;.  The Minister has made my case because he has indicated quite clearly &mdash; and I agree with him on this &mdash; that this directive was open for implementation by member states as far back as 25 July 1985.  Now, six years later, is the Minister seriously telling me that the European Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament would be seriously disturbed if he were to accept this amendment? As six years have passed, the Minister should be at the forefront in making such a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear to me that he has instructions, perhaps from the more senior Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, that he is not to accept any amendments, however good they may be.  He has not put forward any argument against this amendment this morning, other than that he has no discretion and must stick to the exact wording of the directive.  Yet he departs in <Col N="1187" /> a major way from the wording of the directive when it suits him.  Our amendment is very much in the interests of the <Col N="1188" /> consumer and the producer, and because of this we will have to press it.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 19 to 21.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to delete the following words:</P>
      <P>(2) A word or expression that is used in this Act and is also used in the Council Directive has, unless the contrary intention appears, the meaning in this Act that it has in the Council Directive.</P>
      <P>I move this amendment for two reasons. I consider the wording tautologous in that every word defined in the directive is defined in the Bill so the same ground is covered.  I do not see why that is necessary. Then subsection (2) refers to &ldquo;A word or expression&rdquo; and &ldquo;construing a provision&rdquo; in subsection (3) is done in a different manner &mdash; it is done by the courts.  The courts shall make the decision in terms of construing the provision whereas there shall be simply a reference to the Council Directive in terms of construing a word or expression. I regard that as a rather messy statement and I feel we would be better off without it.</P>
      <P>Perhaps more important is the fact that we have reference to the directive in the Bill.  That was very desirable in terms of our preparation for transforming the directive into legislation, but once a Bill is passed it becomes part of our domestic legislation and should stand on its own. It will cause unnecessary confusion if we have to refer to the interpretation that may be put on the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have just had a long argument and controversy over changes in the directive that have been introduced into legislation whereas the provisions in the legislation are less than the provisions in the directive in terms of the definition of damage. <Col N="1189" /> Since there is no reference to consequential damage, how are you to decide or what is the court going to do? Will it assess what the legislators intended in their definition of consequential damage, or will it try to interpret the minds of those who construed and compiled the directive?</P>
    <P>The legislation must be independent. In construing the provisions of the legislation the court shall make a decision if there is a problem.  There is no problem referring to the Council directive, but incorporating it as part of the legislation is probably undesirable.  I would like clarification from the Minister in relation to it.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to my earlier remarks about Mickey Mouse legislation but what I was referring to there was the quantity, not the quality, of the legislation. I was referring to the corpus of legislation we had got since the beginning of this term, not to the quality of the legislation.</P>

      <P>This is a standard provision in all legislation giving effect to Community instruments and, together with the subsection (3) of this section, is designed to ensure that in matters of in terpretation, precedence is given to the Community instrument over national law.  I would again point out to the Senators that the EC Commission have had sight of this Bill.  They are perfectly satisfied that it adds substantially to the legislation and confirms the precedence of Community law over national law.  In the circumstances I cannot accept this amendment.  I point out that since there is a precedent for this section in other legislation, which I presume was in this House, I would not be in a position to depart from that precedent.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>A further point of clarification. It may be my mistake but I am not aware of this precedent in terms of European legislation, at least not while I have been in the House.  I wonder if it is in fact a precedent.  I am not aware that it has been established practice or that it is a standard provision in relation to each country's domestic legislation for the implementation of European directives.</P>

      <P>I wish to thank Senators for their cooperation and assistance.  I know there have been discussions about introducing legislation here.  I certainly would be delighted to initiate legislation here because I have always had tremendous regard for the views expressed in this House and it would provide an opportunity to tease out a Bill in advance of <Col N="1191" /> the pressures that sometimes occur in the Dáil.  Where I can, I encourage the initiation of legislation in this House.</P>
      <P>I regret that, particularly on this occasion, I do not have as much flexibility as I would like, because, as Senator Kennedy said, I am under immense pressure from the EC in relation to this legislation which is long overdue, and we are also under certain legal pressure in this regard.  We had to get this Bill through as quickly as possible.  Nevertheless, I want to say that the views expressed are very worth while and when this legislation comes up for review those points will be taken into consideration by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for listening to what was a fairly protracted debate on the legislation.  I regret that he was unable to accept any of the amendments, but I am not blaming him for that. I regret also that the legislation was not introduced earlier but, again, that is not the Minister's responsibility.  I thank him particularly for his remarks that he is anxious to see legislation initiated in this House.  We all whole heartedly agree with that.  Let us hope that the next time he is in this House he will be dealing with legislation initiated in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In my contribution of 13 November 1991 I was beginning to outline some specific ways of improving the Seanad.  I was saying that the main <Col N="1192" /> thing we need is a Government commitment to this House.  I am now suggesting that the initiation of Bills in this House is extremely important.  It is a simple matter but it is something that has not been tackled by any Government and not just the current Government.  That specific commitment on the part of the Government to Seanad Éireann is what we need to increase the status and the role of this House in general.</P>
      <P>I also suggested on the previous occasion that the House should always pay particular attention to EC affairs and that perhaps some structure could be devised to enable us to do so.  That is something which we should look at very carefully.  I also suggested that we need to examine the role of the Order of Business in this House.  It has developed into a very long, arduous question and answer session and I do not think that was ever envisaged for the Order of Business.  We need to find some way to have a type of Question Time in Seanad Éireann.  That would help in the matter.</P>
      <P>I was just beginning to outline also how I believe cultural affairs should be given special attention by this House.  The general public should be aware that this House pays particular attention to cultural affairs and EC affairs, as I mentioned earlier.  We should carve out a role for ourselves in that area and the appropriate structures should be devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An undesirable trend time and time again in this House has been the unseemly rush at the end of a session to pass a considerable number of Bills through the House.  Again, central government needs to look at that.  It is not right that we should have very little legislation throughout a session and then towards the end six or seven Bills suddenly emerge in this House and must be passed within a day or two.  Some method must be found to ensure that this does not continue.  It is not giving the legislation the recognition it deserves and it is something which should be looked at very carefully.  It has happened time and time again in this House since its establishment. It is not a reflection on the <Col N="1193" /> current Senators or the current Government but it is a well-known fact that there is this unseemly rush at the end of every session to pass Bills.</P>
    <P>There is one other small issue and that is the question of Senator Ministers. There have been very few Senator Ministers in the history of the State. Obviously, the Constitution does provide for Senator Ministers.  I know it is a question for the Taoiseach entirely, but a Senator or two in the Cabinet would also give prestige and status to this House. There is one vacancy at present in the junior ministerial ranks.  I do not know, Sir, whether you would have any suggestions in that regard.  It is something which I am sure the Taoiseach would take on board.  May I say that I am not interested in the position myself.  I do not think the Taoiseach would get away with it in any event.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the role of a Senator.  What is a Senator supposed to do?  Obviously, the Constitution says a Senator is there to pass legislation, to debate legislation, to delay legislation and to make recommendations in relation to legislation but I suggest Senators are hindered in doing that because of lack of facilities.  One secretary is assigned to work for every three Senators but that is not enough.  In order to deal adequately and effectively with legislation, every Senator should have a full-time researcher who would delve into all aspects of legislation, undertake research in relation to all aspects of Bills and so on.  It is not too much to ask.  I wonder why Senators and, indeed, Deputies do not have researchers and in whose interest is that?  The Department of Finance would have to pay the salaries of extra staff and no doubt they would not be happy with that.  In some ways it obviously helps the Executive that the Members of Parliament are not fully briefed on all aspects of legislation.</P>
    <P>It is important that Senators are given adequate facilities to enable them to carry out their work.  They need a fulltime secretary, they need a researcher, they need basic facilities such as telephones, faxes, computers and so on.  We <Col N="1194" /> are making some progress in that regard but further progress is needed.  It is a crucial question and something which we should look at very seriously.  We have the capacity to improve our situation, the general public do not.  Therefore, we should do something about it and improve our position and our status.</P>
    <P>In relation to the role of Senators as regards constituency work, you could justify the existence of 60 additional Senators, in addition to the Members of Dáil Éireann, by the fact that they become involved in their local communities, they get involved in local and national issues, constituency work, and so on.  Senators bring their expertise and their knowledge to their local areas and that is important.  It extends the network of parliamentarians throughout the country. There are areas that are not necessarily fully catered for by their local TD for geographical reasons and Senators could fill that vacuum.  It is just something of which we should be aware.</P>
    <P>The role of university Senators has been questioned in this House.  As far as I am concerned, university Senators, are a good idea.  It brings minority representation into the House, it brings representation for students into the House. However, I would question the existing structures in relation to the six university seats.  Not all third level students are represented in this House and that needs to be carefully looked at.  For my own part I have a special interest in Dublin City University, the new university on the north side of Dublin.  The graduates of that college must surely be entitled to representation in Seanad Éireann, the same as the NUI and TCD.  That should be looked at very carefully and new measures brought in in that regard.</P>
    <P>We live in challenging times &mdash; the age of modern technology and the improvements that are taking place in the infrastructure of the country, in political institutions and so on.  There are all sorts of imputs now into central Government. Previously the Dáil, the Seanad, the media, pressure groups of various kinds have all had their input into central Government, but that has now been <Col N="1195" /> extended and there are all sorts of interest groups and new ideas emerging. For example, there is the whole question of centralised bargaining and national pay deals.  We have had the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> Senators would need to be aware of the current situation.  One could ask the question if the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is more powerful than Seanad Éireann and in some cases one could answer yes to that.  It is important that we have this debate on the role of Seanad Éireann in the context of changes in modern Ireland and the changes that are taking place in the political world. We need to define our role and we need to fit into modern Ireland.</P>
    <P>One last thought on this debate &mdash; it is a rhetorical question &mdash; are we talking to ourselves in this debate.  I hope somebody is listening out there.  I hope we proceed from here and take on board the good ideas that have been put forward to develop and establish a role for ourselves in the Oireachtas, and indeed in Ireland in general.</P>

      <P>Chuir an Seanadóir Haughey ceist an-díreach, an-tábhachtach, agus é ag críochnú a chuid cainte: an bhfuilimid ag caint linn féin, an bhfuil duine ar bith ag éisteacht linn nó an mbeidh duine ar bith ann le gníomhú maidir leis na rudaí atá á rá againn anseo. Ar ndóigh, nuair a deirim nach bhfuil duine ar bith ag éisteacht linn os rud é nach bhfuil ach duine nó beirt againn sa Seanad ag an nóiméad seo, is i gciall i bhfad níos leithne ná sin atáim ag caint. Go hiondúil, bím ag breathnú ar chathaoir ata folamh ansin, ach is é an duine, dar liomsa, gur chóir a bheith sa chaithaoir sin &mdash; dá bhféadfadh sé teacht ar ais ar an saol &mdash; ná Éamon de Valera.  Mura bhfuil sé ann i bpearsan tá chuile sheans ann go bhfuil sé ann i spiorad.  Tá sé réasúnta, tar éis an achair fhada: ó 1937, breis agus leathchéad bliain ó shin, go ndéanfaimis cur agus cúiteamh faoi Sheanad Éireann, faoi ról an tSeanaid: <Col N="1196" /> cad é atá curtha i gcrích, cad é atá ar siúl againn agus cá bhfuil ár dtriall?</P>
      <P>Caithfimid súil siar a chaitheamh ar an meon a bhí ag Éamon de Valera nuair a bhunaigh sé an Teach uachtarach, Seanad Éireann, agus é ag leagan amach Bunreachta 1937.  O mo thaobhsa féin de, cibé ar bith, agus, dar liomsa, ó thaobh fhormhór mhuintir na hÉireann de, is beag réalaíochas atá ag baint le imeachtaí an tSeanaid i gcomhthéacs fheidhmiú bunreachtúil na tíre seo.  Tá mé den tuairim go raibh beartas éigin ar intinn ag Éamon de Valera nuair a bhunaigh sé Seanad Éireann, go raibh fealsúnacht dhomhain taobh thiar den chaint agus na smaointe a bhí aige.  Ba é an prionsabal a bhí i gceist aige ná go mbeadh daoine i Seanad Éireann a mbeadh scileanna áirithe acu, scileanna ar leith a bhí soaitheanta agus go bhféadfadh siad na scileanna sin a chur ag obair sa Teach seo ar bhonn leanúnach.  Aisteach go leor, is í an chéad aidhm a bhí sa Bhunreacht, ó thaobh scileanna agus dreamanna éagsúla, de réir mheon an Taoisigh ag an am sin, go mbeadh painéal sa Teach seo a mbeadh de chúram orthu breathnú go báúil agus labhairt go fuinniúil ar rudaí a bhaineann le cultúr na tíre seo, cultúr sa chiall is leithne &mdash; labhairt na Gaeilge, saoithiúlacht na Gaeilge, drámaíocht, na healaíona agus chuile shórt mar sin.</P>
      <P>Chuir sé painéil eile ar bun maidir le lucht saothair, maidir le tráchtáil, cúrsaí eacnamúla, rialtas áitiúil agus riarachán poiblí, talmhaíocht agus feirmeoireacht. Sin iad na coincheapa a bhí ag an dTaoiseach ag an am sin nuair a thoiligh sé bunreacht a scríobh le haghaidh Sheanad Éireann.  Tá sé suimiúil gurbh é an chéad cheann a bhí aige, an ceann a ba ghiorra dá chroí, ná an teanga agus an cultúr agus gach dar bhain leo.  Nach aisteach an rud é, bíodh go raibh sé sin mar choincheap nó mar aidhm, nár cuireadh i bhfeidhm go forleathan é.  Breathnaigh ar an Seanad ó bunaíodh é agus ar an bpearsanra a bhí sa rannóg sin amháin, feicfidh tú sa mhóriomlán nach raibh na daoine a bhí ar an bpainéal sin feiliúnach, cé is moite d'eisceachtaí ar nós an tSeabhaic, Éamon de Buitléar agus daoine mar iad, daoine a raibh an-ómós ag dul dóibh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> Nach aisteach an run é in imeacht an ama sin uilig, aon duine ar nós an tSeabhaic agus daoine mar mé féin, nuair a bhíomar ag labhairt as Gaeilge anseo, níor tugadh an t-aitheantas cuí don teanga, bíodh go raibh an Ghaeilge ar chomhchéim leis an Bhéarla ó thaobh úsáide agus cirt de in imeachtaí bunreachtúla Thithe an Oireachtais.  Níor tugadh an t-aitheantas sin go dtí le fíordheireanas dúinn ó thaobh ar chórais aistriúcháin atá in úsáid anois anseo, agus sa Dáil le tamall de bhlianta anuas.  Tá go leor easpaí agus rudaí mícheart maidir leis an gcoincheap a bhí ann ag an tús.  Tá faitíos orm go bhfuil go leor de na haidhmeanna agus den inspiorad a bhí taobh thiar de na haidhmeanna sin imithe ar gcúl agus nach bhfuil glactha fós leo tar éis leathchéad bliain ó bunaíodh an Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Níl aon fáth nach bhféadfaí an scéal sin a leigheas.  Táimid ar ais go dtí an pointe a bhí ag an Seanadóir Haughey ar ball agus a d'ardaigh an Seanadóir Hederman ar maidin agus atá á ardú agam féin anois i gcomhthéacs cé leis a bhfuilimid ag caint.  Ba thrua liomsa tar éis na cainte seo ar leasú an tSeanaid nach mbeadh ann ag deireadh an lae ach tuarascáil ina mbeadh tuairimí na Seanadóirí ar fáil ann agus nach mbeadh aon toradh eile ar an díospóireacht ná freagracht ar dhuine ar bith.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil amhras ormsa mar go bhfeicim cathaoir ansin os mo chomhair agus é folamh.  Níl a fhios agam cé ba cheart a bheith istigh ann.</P>

      <P>Níl mé ag caint faoin taobh sin den Teach.  Tá mé ag caint faoin gcathaoir thuas ansin, áit a bhfuil an tAire.  Tá mé ag caint faoi aon duine a bhéas freagrach as na moltaí a thiocfaidh ón díospóireacht seo.  Cá bhfuil siad ag dul as seo?  Cén toradh a bheidh orthu? Cén duine nó grúpa a bhéas freagrach as rud éigin a dhéanamh leo?  Sin é mo thuiscint air sin agus bhí mí-thuiscint ar an gCathaoir nuair a dúirt mé go raibh mé ag tagairt do dhaoine nach raibh sa Teach.  Ní raibh mé ag tagairt dó sin beag nó mór.  Nuair a bhíonn rud á phlé anseo <Col N="1198" /> bíonn an tAire a bhaineann le gnéithe áirithe i láthair.  Níl duine ar bith fágtha le bheith i láthair anois nuair atáimid ag caint faoin Seanad mar níl aon cheann orainn.  Níl aon bhun nó barr orainn.  Dá mbeadh daoine i ndáiríre faoin Seanad, agus dá mbeadh Airí agus Airí Stáit i ndáiríre faoi, bheadh siad anseo.  Tagann siad isteach agus éisteann siad linn nuair a bhíonn Billí a bhaineann lena Roinn fein á phlé.  Tá mé féin dhá bhliain go leith anseo anois agus is iomaí uair a phlé muid gnótha a bhain leis an Seanad agus a bhain leis an nGaeltacht, mar shampla, agus fós féin ní fhacamar Aire na Gaeltachta istigh anseo agus muid ag cur gnótha na Gaeltachta trí chéile.  Tá laige éigin sa chóras go mbíonn caint faoi Aireacht éigin sa Teach seo agus nach bhféadfadh an tAire atá freagrach as an Aireacht sin é féin a thaispeáint uair amháin ar a laghad i rith a théarma oifige.</P>
      <P>Bhí chuile Aire eile istigh anseo ach amháin an Taoiseach atá mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Níor sheas sé riamh sa Teach seo.  Feictear domsa mar fhear ón Gaeltacht agus mar duine a bhíonn ag caint ar rudaí a bhaineann leis an nGaeltacht agus le hiarthar na hÉireann go bhfuil laige mór ann nach féidir linn a bheith ag súil go mbeadh an tAire i láthair.  Is dísbeagadh agus brú síos ar imeachtaí, cumhacht agus stádas na teanga nuair atá rudaí mar sin ag tarlú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bím ag éisteacht leis na Seanadóirí ag caint anseo faoi nithe éagsúla, agus ag cur síos ar go leor Billí anseo.  Bíonn ardchaighdeán díospóireachta anseo.  Bíonn tuairimí an-láidir agus an-mhaith á gcur i láthair ag go leor de na Seanadóirí, is cuma cén ábhar a bhíonn á phlé sa Teach seo.  Is é an trua, dar liomsa, nach mbíonn deis againn níos mó díospóireachta a dhéanamh ar rudaí a bhaineann go dlúth linn-ne mar Sheanadóirí agus leis an tír i gcoitinne.  Ní gá ach a bheith anseo maidin ar bith nuair a bhíonn Riar na hOibre á phlée lena fheiceáil cad é an deacracht a bhíonn againn labhairt faoi ábhair fíor-thábhachtacha a bhaineann linn.  Tóg Maastricht mar shampla.  Ardaítear an cheist sin seachtain i ndiaidh seachtaine ar Riar na hOibre ach ní thugtar aon aird orainn.  Táimid anseo chuile <Col N="1199" /> sheachtain ag iarraidh díospóireacht a bheith againn ar Thuaisceart na hÉireann agus ní thugtar air orainn go dtí go mbíonn an rud sean-chaite agus imithe ó mhaith.</P>
    <P>Bheadh sé uafásach tábhachtach go mbeadh deis againn labhairt ar Maastricht, Common Agricultural Policy, GATT, an Tuaisceart agus chuile shórt a bhaineann le riaradh na tíre.  Ábhair iad seo a bhfuil suim bhunúsach ag muintir na hÉireann iontu ach bíonn cosc orainn sa Teach seo labhairt orthu.  Ní thagann siad chugainn i gceart nó in am cé go bhfuil cainteoirí ar an dá thaobh den Teach seo atá oilte agus eolasach faoi na rudaí a bhíonn á bplé acu.</P>
    <P>Bímid ag caint faoi cé chomh feiliúnach is atá an Seanad nó an bhfuilimid ag déanamh aon mhaith nó an mbraithnítear orainn mar Theach a bhfuil éifeacht ag baint linn.  Bhí sampla an-mhaith againn an bhliain seo caite nuair a bhí an tAcht Craolacháin ag dul tríd an Seanad.  Cuireadh an guillotine i bhfeidhm ansin agus ní raibh deis cheart againn é a phlé.  Fiú amháin dá mbeadh aon leasú againn ní raibh aon bhealach le go bhféadfaí é a chur ar ais go dtí an Teach eile mar bhí an Teach eile ar scor.  Déarfadh daoine mar fhreagra, dá mbeadh sé sách dona d'fhéadfaí an Teach eile a ghlaoch ar ais leis an cheist a phlé.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios ag an saol mór Fodhla nach shin é an freagra.  Léiríonn an t-eachtra sin go bhfuil easpa orainn-ne agus go bhfuil cumas éigin nach dtugtar aird air sa chomhthéacs sin.  Tá moltaí agus comhpháirtíocht ann agus ní thuigim nach bhféadfaimisne coistí comhpháirtíochta a chur ar bun.  Má bhí sé ceart nuair a bunaíodh an Seanad agus má bhí sé roinnte amach i gcúig rannióg, ní thuigim cén fáth nach bhféadfaimís coistí bunaithe ar na rannóga sin a cheapadh. D'fhéadfaí go leor de na ceisteanna seo a phlé ar bhonn coisteora agus go dtiocfadh siad ar aghaidh ansin go dtí an Teach. D'fhéadfaí é sin a dhéanamh faoi leasú ar Bhuan-Orduithe an tSeanaid.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ballraáocht, tá sé molta gur <Col N="1200" /> chóir go mbeadh Comhaltaí Pharlaimint na hEorpa ag freastal ar an Seanad.  Níl lochtóinn iad a bheith i láthair agus ag caint &mdash; ag cur a gcuid tuairimí in iúl dúinn agus ag insint dúinn cén chaoi a bhfuil cúrsaí i bParlaimint na hEorpa agus san Eoraip.  Ba chéim chun tosaigh é sin. Go deimhin féin tá an páirtí againne ag moladh fiú amháin go mbeadh deis acu a bheith sa Seanad sa chaoi go mbeadh sé iomlán mar Sheanad agus go mbeadh sé ag freastal ar chuile ghné den phobal taobh amuigh de na cúig ghné éagsúla atá sa Bhunreacht.  Chuirfinn fáilte roimh leasú den chineál sin.</P>
    <P>Locht eile atá orainn, mar shampla, ná nuair a dhéantar Bille a thionscnamh sa Teach seo.  Is ceist í seo, dar liomsa, a léiríonn laige uafásach.  Is é sin nach dtugtar cead dúinn ar an mór-iomlán Bille a thionscnamh sa Teach seo.  Déanann an Rialtas cúpla ceann a thionscnamh anseo, b'fhéidir, i rith na bliana.  Ach má chuireann an Freasúra Bille os comhair an Tí seo, táimid ionann is a bheith cinnte dearfa glan nach nglacfar leis ar aon bhealach.</P>
    <P>Leis an bpointe seo a léiriú &mdash; bhí Bille os comhair an Tí seo aréir faoí féinmharú. Bhí sé dá thionscnamh ón taobh seo den Teach ag an Seanadóir Neville. Dúirt an tAire go raibh sé lán taobh thiar den Bhille.  Dúirt sé go raibh an Bille tráthúil agus gur aontaigh sé leis an bprionsabal atá ann.  Dá mbeadh an tAire agus an Rialtas i ndáiríre faoin mBille sin faoi mar a leagadh os comhair an Tí seo é, bhí deis acu a thaispeáint don saol go raibh éifeacht agus brí agus meanma ag baint le Seanad Éireann.  Cén fáth mar sin nár lig sé ar aghaidh é?  Ceithre bliana is fiche ó shin &mdash; i 1967 &mdash; a bhí siad ag caint faoi seo agus ag déanamh iarrachta rud éigin a dhéanamh faoin gceist seo, ach níor deineadh tada faoi.  Chuir Seanadóir Bille os comhair an Tí aréir ach séard a dúirt an tAire ná gur aontaigh sé i bprionsabal leis an mBille agus go raibh an Rialtas anois sásta Bille a thabhairt isteach.</P>
    <P>Thóg sé ceithre bliana is fiche ar an Rialtas ó deineadh iarracht cheana go dtí <Col N="1201" /> gur dúisíodh sa Teach seo arís é.  Cuireadh Bille réasúnach, simplí os comhair an Tí seo inné, agus léirigh an tAire domsa ar chaoi ar bith inné nach raibh aon éifeacht, nó seasamh ag an Teach seo i gcomhthéacs Tithe an Oireachtais. Dá mbeadh, thabharfadh sé éisteacht agus cead don Bhille.  Dá mbeadh gá leasuithe a thabhairt isteach, d'fhéadfadh an Roinn nó an Rialtas na leasuithe sin a thabhairt ar bhord de réir mar a bheadh an Bille ag dul ar aghaidh.  Ach níor tharla sé sin, agus ar an mór-iomlán tá faitíos orm nach dtarlóidh mórán sa Teach seo mura bhfuil an toil léirithe go han-soiléir gur gá agus go bhfuil seans ann é a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Tá cumhachtaí againn Billí a thionscnamh. Rinneamar aréir é.  Ach níl aon mhaith ann.  Ní ghlacaim leis an gcoincheap go bhféadfadh Bille teacht ón bhFreasúra, go bhféadfadh an tAire glacadh leis i bprionsabal agus ag an am céanna nach bhféadfaí é a fheidhmiú.  Tá cumhachtaí an tSeanaid an-lag go deo nuair atá a leithéid sin de phrionsabal i réim sa Teach.</P>
    <P>Is féidir leis an Seanad Billí a thionscnamh agus a leasú agus ionstraimintí reachtúla a thionscnamh freisin.  Ach níl an chumhacht againn iad a chur tríd agus is fíor-bheagán a théann tríd an Teach seo riamh a léiríonn cumhacht an Tí seo. Dúirt an Seanadóir Haughey gur chóir go mbeadh chuile dheis ag Seanadóirí, go mbeadh rúnaí príobháideach ag gach Comhalta agus go mbeadh deiseanna acu staidéar agus taighde a dhéanamh ionas go bhféadfaí teacht isteach anseo agus gach rud a chur faoi micreascóp.  Ach cén mhaith don Seanad nó dón tír é sin nuair nach nglactar le Bille beag simplí a cuireadh ar aghaidh anseo aréir agus nach raibh an tAire sásta é a cheadú nó ligean dó dul ar aghaidh níos faide, bíodh is gur aontaigh sé leis go hiomlán.  Tá sin ráite aige sa chaint a rinne sé: &ldquo;We fully agree with the principle of Senator Neville's Private Members' Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Go polaitiúil ní ligfeadh an Rialtas don bhFreasúra a mBille féin a chur chun cinn.  Tá an cead againn, ach níl an chumhacht againn.  Is laige bunúsach é sin. <Col N="1202" /> Tá sé allright ag na Progressive Democrats a bheith ag caint faoi dheireadh a chur leis an Seanad.  Ach an é sin tús agus deireadh nó leigheas ar an scéal?  An bhfuil duine ar bith amuigh ansin le smacht a choinneáil ar imeachtaí na Dála ar aon bhealach?  De réir mar a thuigim, le go bhféadfaí deireadh a chur leis an Seanad ní mór ceithre scór leasú a dhéanamh sa mBunreacht.  Dá n-imeofá síos an bóthar seo thógfadh sé roinnt mhaith de bhlianta sula mbeadh deireadh le Seanad Éireann.  Níl mé ar son díspeagadh a dhéanamh ar an Seanad nó go laghdófaí éifeacht an tSeanaid.  Cé nach bhfuil an chumhacht againn, dá dtiocfadh rud éigin praiticiúil as an chaint seo uilig sa deireadh, sa chaoi go bhféadfaimis a rá linn féin go rabhamar ag dul ar aghaidh i gceart agus ag déanamh obair fhiúntach dúinn féin agus don tír, bheinn sásta leis sin.  Táimid in ann rudaí áirithe a dhéanamh. Bhí cruthúnas de sin againn leis an Bille IPA a scrúdaíodh sa Teach seo.</P>

      <P>Tá sé fíor-thábhachtach go mbeadh brí agus éifeacht le hobair ar bith a dhéanfadh Seanadóirí sa Teach seo. Baineann sé ó n-ár n-éifeacht nuair nach bhfuil cead againn Billí a thionscnamh sa Seanad.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt faoi chomhdhéanamh na dtoghthóirí i gcás an tSeanaid. Bítear ag casaoid uaireanta nach mbíonn deis ag dóthain daoine vóta a chaitheamh nuair a bhíonn toghchán ann don Seanad. Measaim gur chóir an córas atá ann faoi láthair a choimeád ach fós féin ní miste athruithe a chur ar an structúr chun an córas a leathnú amach agus líon na dtoghthóirí a mhéadú.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Faoi láthair, tá cead votála ag breis is 1,000 comhairleoirí contae, ag Seanadóirí agus ag Teachtaí Dála.  Usáidtear na painéil agus usáideann lucht ollscoile painéil dá gcuid féin le iarrthóirí a thoghadh. Ní hionann an dá chineál toghcháin cé go dtagann Seanadoirí ón dá dhream go dtí an ionad céanna ag deireadh an lae.  Thairis sin, tá cead ag an Rialtas Seanadóirí áirithe a ainmniú.  Glacaim <Col N="1203" /> leis an bprionsabal seo mar go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go mbeadh móramh sa Seanad ag an bpáirtí atá i gcumhacht.</P>
    <P>Aontaím mar sin go mbeadh trí ghrúpa sa Seanad: na Seanadóirí a ainmníonn an Taoiseach; na Seanadóirí a thoghann na hollscoileanna; agus na Seanadóirí a thoghann ionadaithe an phobail, cé go ndeirtear uaireanta nach dtoghtar Seanadóirí go daonlathach.  Ní ghlacaim leis an gcasaoid seo mar is iad baill na n-údarás áitiúla, Seanadóirí agus Teachtaí Dála, atá i dteideal vótála agus gach duine acu i dteideal vóta amháin.  Reachtáiltear an toghchán i measc ionadaithe poiblí a toghadh i gcóras daonlathach sa chéad áit.  Guth pobal na hÉireann is ea na hionadaithe áitiúla agus tá an módh toghcháin sin don Seanad inghlactha agamsa.</P>
    <P>Chaithfinn a rá nach nglacaim leis nach bhfuil an deis chéanna vótála ag comhairleoirí baile agus coimisinéirí baile.  Tá an dá aicme ionadaithe sin fágtha lasmuigh den chóras vótála cé gur toghadh na hionadaithe sin go daonlathach freisin i dtoghcháin phoiblí.  Molaim mar leasú ar an gcóras go leathnófaí cead vótála don Seanad chuig baill na gcomhairlí agus na gcoimisinéirí baile.</P>
    <P>Dúradh go dtiocfadh athrú ar an dlí i mbliana ionas go roinnfí an tír ina réigiúin agus go mbeadh comhairleoirí réigiúnacha ann in ionad comhairleoirí agus coimisinéirí baile.  Tá sé sin sásúil, ach tá súil agam nuair a dhéantar an t-athrú seo go dtabharfar cead vótála i dtoghcháin don Seanad do na comhairleoirí réigiúnacha nua seo a thoghfar i 1992.  Sa chaoi seo bheadh páirt ag gach ionadaí poiblí i dtoghcháin an tSeanaid.</P>
    <P>Tá dhá aicme ionadaithe eile fágtha ar lár fós, comhaltaí chuig Parlaimint na hEorpa agus baill Údarás na Gaeltachta. Má táimid chun leasú ciallmhar cothromúil a dhéanamh ar an Seanad, ní mór an dá aicme tofa seo a chuimsiú sa chóras vótála don Teach seo.</P>
    <P>Údarás ar leithligh is ea Údarás na Gaeltachta agus tá sé daonlathach sa mhéid is gur ritheadh Acht i 1979 a cheadaigh toghcháin don Údarás sin ar an mbonn poiblí céanna le toghcháin <Col N="1204" /> Dála nó toghcháin áitiúla.  Molaim go mbeadh ceart vótála don Seanad ag gach ionadaí poiblí, idir chomhairleoirí contae, chomhaltaí don Eoraip, bhaill Údarás na Gaeltachta, chomhairleoirí agus choimisinéirí bailte.  Thar aon dream eile ba chóir an ceart sin a thabhairt do bhaill tofa Údarás na Gaeltachta chun go mbeadh an córas daonlathach ó thús deiridh.</P>
    <P>Ní aontaím leis an modh ainmniúcháin a mhaireann faoi láthair.  Tá an ceart sin ag daoine agus ag gluaiseachtaí faoi leith toisc an réimse áirithe gnó lena mbaineann siad.  Maidir le toghcháin don Phainéal Cultúrtha agus Oideachais, tugadh cead do eagraíocht ar a dtugtar Muintir na Gaeltachta duine a ainmniú don choiste seo.  Bhí sé sin oiriúnach ag an am ach cé go bhfuil an eagraíocht sin imithe in éag le blianta, tá an chumhacht ainmniúcháin fós ag dul dóibh agus is ag fear amháin a bhí an chumhacht sin ar feadh scaithimh.  Ní mór go gcinnteofaí go mbeadh stádas bona fide ag eagraíocht atá i dteideal baill a ainmniú don Seanad. Ní cóir go mbeadh cumhacht ainmniúcháin ag eagraíocht ar bith nach bhfuil gníomhach.</P>
    <P>Cén toradh a bhéas ar an gcaint seo inniu?  Níl éinne sa chathaoir os mo chomhair amach ag éisteacht linn.  An mbeidh tuairisc ár gcainte ar na seilfeanna istigh san oifig ag bailiú deannaigh? Is trua sin mar go bhfuil uimhir mhór daoine ar dhá thaobh an Tí agus iad an-chumasach agus an-chuid le tairiscint acu don Oireachtas ach níl an toil polaitiúil ann leis an deis sin a thapú.</P>
    <P>Táim den bharúil gur ceist arís é, mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar.  Tá an deamhéin ann i measc Baill an Tí seo ach níl an dea-thoil polaitiúil ann atá ag teastáil chun athruithe a thabhairt chun críche.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nuair a bhéas an díospóireacht seo thart agus na fíricí ar fáil go mbeidh deis againn suí síos ar choiste éigin agus go dtiocfaidh moladh dearfa ar ais le go bhféadfaimís breathnú a dhéanamh orainn féin agus leasuithe a thionscnú a fhágfaidh an Teach seo níos láidre, níos sláintiúla agus níos éifeachtaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to compliment the <Col N="1205" /> Leader of the House for providing time for this debate on the role of Seanad Éireann.  I have been very impressed with the contributions to date from all sides of the House on the proposed reform.  Many speakers say they have waited a long time for this debate as Seanad reform has been talked about for some considerable time. Only good can come out of this debate which should give Members from all sides an opportunity to put forward their ideas for reform.</P>
      <P>The powers and functions of the Seanad are enshrined in the Constitution enacted by the people in July 1937 and in operation since December 1937.  The duties and responsibilties attaching to Members of the Oireachtas are well defined.  The Oireachtas is accepted as a fundamental part of our democratic system.  As one who had the privilege of serving in the other House for a number of years, I have been very impressed with this House.  Many Members here have specialised knowledge and expertise.  The system of election to the Seanad provides for 43 Members, elected from five panels. At least 16 Members must be elected from candidates nominated by particular nominating bodies.  The legislation stipulates that each must have knowledge and practical experience of his or her particular panel.</P>
      <P>Six Members of the Seanad are elected by the universities and 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach.  I support the right of the Taoiseach of the day to nominate 11 Members, and not only to give the Government the majority they should have in the House.  Over the years many talented and gifted people sat in this Chamber as a result of a Taoiseach's nomination.  Senators have already referred to them and each in their own right made a very valuable contribution. It is a plus for the Seanad that there should be an entrance facility for gifted people who may not be elected through the present system or may not attempt to avail of that method of entering the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Conroy referred to Professor Dooge who was an outstanding Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The same can be <Col N="1206" /> said for the late Seán Moylan, another outstanding Minister.  It would not have been possible to have had Ministers nominated from the Seanad but for the benefit of a Taoiseach's nomination.  The Taoiseach of the day should nominate a senior Minister and at least two junior Ministers to his Government from the Seanad.  This would greatly enhance the role of the Seanad.  Over the years other outstanding people were nominated such as Steve McGonagle, Séamus Mallon, John Robb, Bríd Rodgers, Ken Whitaker and many more.</P>
    <P>Senators represent trade union movements, industry, agriculture, education and a wide spectrum of other interests. This diversity has led to interesting and useful debates.  One has only to go back to the Environmental Protection Agency Bill which was initiated in the Seanad. This Bill was fully debated and many Senators went into great detail on the matter.  The Minister duly acknowledged the excellent contributions and as a result accepted many amendments.</P>
    <P>Much legislation could be initiated in the Seanad and debated excellently across the board.  One disappointing aspect of the role of the Seanad at the moment is the Order of Business.  At times it gets out of hand and consequently serves no useful purpose.  Many Senators have indicated they would like to see it changed and I endorse this.  If we need an Order of Business it should be limited to 15 minutes.  A Question Time similar to that in the Dáil should be contemplated and limited to one question per Member per week.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Adjournment motion, at least three questions could be taken daily.  It is necessary to redress the situation where issues of topical interest may not be discussed in this House. People outside the Seanad cannot believe that this is so and on the Order of Business we have witnessed Members from all sides trying to raise various issues and being forbidden to do so.</P>
    <P>Third level institutions should be included in the University panels and I support the proposal that women's <Col N="1207" /> groups should form part of the nominating bodies.  I would like to see many more Bills coming into the Seanad as the Seanad has tremendous opportunities to improve legislation.  Bills may be examined here in depth and subjected to a thorough analysis.</P>
    <P>One has to be greatly impressed by the quality of debate and contribution to date.  The question is how best we can reform the Seanad and ensure that it carries out its proper functions.  Some Senators have already expressed the view that this House must give the public value for money and we must try to change the poor public perception of this House.  It must be seen that the Seanad has a realistic role to play, ensuring better legislation, that we safeguard the public interest and that matters of major importance can be debated here.</P>
    <P>Many excellent contributions have already been made with regard to reform. Excellent ideas and analyses have been put forward.  I support the suggestion that the Seanad should set up a small representative committee to process ideas and look at specific proposals.  In this way, real progress would be made in improving the role of the Seanad.  There is widespread agreement from all sides of the House that reform is imperative.  I am also pleased that in the agreed Programme for Government it states:</P>
    <P>The Government consider that reform of the Oireachtas is an essential prerequisite to carrying through a legislative programme of reform, and to make its work relevant and effective for the people of Ireland.  The parties in Government will present proposals to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in 1991 for implementation during 1992.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas, as we know, includes the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that I spotted this historic occurrence and took the opportunity to congratulate you.</P>
      <P>I cannot really congratulate the House on having this debate.  It is empty, meaningless and facile.  The principle reason we are discussing the reform of the Seanad, at the moment, is simply to conceal the fact that there is no business before the House.  There is no Government legislation and this is simply filler. Everybody knows what is wrong with the Seanad and how this could be rectified, yet nobody is prepared to do anything about it other than make very modest proposals to tinker at the edges, with some of the housekeeping.  I will not speak at any great length here this afternoon because I spoke in the two previous debates, which produced no results.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Hederman, has put down some proposals on the Order Paper arising from previous debates on this subject; in fact, one of them, the proposal for the dates for nomination to both Seanad and Dáil Éireann to coincide has been a part of my political manifesto at every election since 1977.  However, there is not the faintest hope of this occurring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to address the whole question of the Seanad, the areas where there ought to be reform, why there should be reform and how it could be achieved. This is a purely academic exercise.  In Dublin, when you use the phrase &ldquo;academic,&rdquo; you mean largely irrelevant. It will not be acted upon.  It is not in the interests of the parties who control the Seanad, which is not the manner intended by the framers of the Constitution. We are lucky to have a bicameral system.  Mr. de Valera was so irritated at the beginning of the 1930s by the independent role taken for itself by the Seanad that he abolished it.  He then discovered it was a useful part of the political machinery and in the 1937 Constitution it was reintroduced with, as Senator Foley indicated, a certain apportionment of seats to different <Col N="1209" /> interests.  Mr. de Valera also built in a mathematical mechanism which, understandably enough, appeared to guarantee the Government immunity from defeat in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to say that I have one little notch in my bow which marks what I think was the first time the Government were defeated in the Seanad.  That was in the last couple of years and it resulted in the dismissal of the front bench.  While I regret the personal humiliation that may have resulted from that, I am very pleased I was able to demonstrate that the antiquated old machine, the Seanad, could actually work.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Foley that it is appropriate for the Taoiseach to have the power to nominate 11 people for this very purpose &mdash; to ensure that the Government normally hold sway in the Seanad. This should not be as confrontational an arena as Dáil Éireann and, in particular, it should not, except under the most serious circumstances, come into conflict with the lower House.  If there were hostile opposition between the two Chambers, then the limited democracy in this country would be placed in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have looked at the distribution of the seats; 43 seats are filled by the panel system and 11 Senators are nominated by the Taoiseach.  In previous Seanaid, the Taoiseach demonstrated an unusual and interesting flexibility in his choice, bringing in for example, Senator Bríd Rodgers from the SDLP, reflecting the 32 County pretensions of the State, distinguished playwright Brian Friel and naturalist Éamon de Buitléar.  I am quite happy with those 11 seats.  I am reasonably happy with the university seats, although I will direct some small attention to them.  However, where I am not so happy is with the 43 seats elected by outgoing Members of the Oireachtas and members of the county councils at the time of dissolution.  Perhaps I could explain why.  I am not happy with it because, in a democracy, the right to reject a candidate is as important as the right to elect one.  When somebody who <Col N="1210" /> puts himself or herself forward for election is rejected, defeated at an election, the graceful thing to do is to accept the result.  If one looks at the officers of the Seanad immediately following the last election, something rather interesting emerges.  The Cathaoirleach ran for a seat in Roscommon and was rejected, ran for the European election and was rejected, and then came in here and became Cathoirleach.  I do not attack him on a personal basis.</P>

      <P>I am always loth to interrupt the Senator in full flow but I remind him that it is the convention that the Cathoirleach should not be referred to in debate.  I understand the Senator's intention but I must point out, as a matter of procedure, that the Cathaoirleach should not be referred to in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Chair's guidance.  &ldquo;The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on&rdquo;, so it cannot be recalled, even though I might deplore the fact it is actually on the record now. The leader of the Government failed to be elected to the Seanad and was nominated by the Taoiseach to one of his 11 seats.  It was perfectly legitimate, but it makes you wonder how democratic is the process.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Fine Gael group failed in the Dáil general election.  Each of the named principal office holders of this august institution was rejected by the people of Ireland.  There are some people who preach to the university Senators and say we are not democratically elected.  I want to scotch that.  These people have produced and engineered this system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the panels.  They are related to wonderful things like arts, business, public life and so on but there is a fatal flaw in the system because, while there are appropriate nominating bodies, they have the power of nomination alone and are not permitted any participation in the democratic system of election.  If you have the power to nominate you should include people with a special area <Col N="1211" /> of expertise in, for example, the motor industry and in medicine.  On Sunday next we have International World AIDS Day.  This has not been mentioned in either House of the Oireachtas.  The last time it was discussed was when a group of us got together and held a briefing session in Buswell's Hotel, because we were denied access to a room in which to hold the meeting.  In any case we had the briefing session and a debate on AIDS. That was, in its own way, a small vindication of the role of the Seanad.  The people in the Lower House were a little bit nervous of dealing with so controversial an issue.  Perhaps I malign them, perhaps I impute motives to them which do not exist, but at least I can say they did not ever discuss it.  This House took on that issue and dealt with it.  The contributions from all sides of the House were dignified, balanced, well informed and a credit to the Seanad.  I had to bring in people, authorities on this subject, doctors, social workers and so on.  It would be a very healthy thing, if for example, the General Medical Council, the Irish Medical Organisation or the nursing organisations who are, I believe, nominating bodies, not only had the power to nominate, but also to vote. Then you would get people with real expertise.</P>
    <P>I intend no disrespect to the people who have been elected through the county council system.  I attack the system, not the people who have been elected because, by some miracle, many people of excellent worth have been elected by this extraordinary corkscrew system.  I have given the example which occurred soon after I was elected to the Seanad.  I was listening to the debates in order to inform myself of procedures and so on, I heard an excellent speech on fishing from Senator Fitzgerald of Fianna Fáil.  Here was somebody who had practical experience in this area.  There would be more such expertise in the Seanad if the nominating bodies were enfranchised.</P>
    <P>University seats are much more democratic. We are nominated by ten good <Col N="1212" /> folk and true who have to be graduates of the University of Dublin, Trinity College, and citizens of Ireland.  The person nominated, however, does not have to be a graduate of any college.  Any citizen of Ireland can stand for the university seats.  I then have to go out and convince an electorate of, nearly 22,000 graduates, each of whom makes his or her mind up, that I am a worthy representative of them.  In the National University of Ireland the electorate is about 75,000. Let no one think that these constituencies are not democratic or that they do not represent a substantial proportion of the vote.</P>
    <P>This is in contrast with the county councils, where there are less than 1,000 votes.  I wonder if the public realise that when a Senator receives 27,000 or 64,000 votes, the reason he appears to have achieved this magnificent total is, in order to give this farce the appearance of credibility, each vote has to be multiplied by 1,000.  When he, or she gets 64 votes they are multiplied by 1,000 in order to make it realistic.  The system is corrupt.  The people elected are often very good but the system itself is corrupt and defective. When you add to that the fact that the Seanad has become, and is openly acknowledged to be, a kind of political convalescent home or recovery ward for people who are kicked out at the general election and who simply wait here in a kind of suspended political animation to retake what they see as their rightful role in the Dáil, you have a situation where the Seanad is enervated, weakened and corrupted in the interests of party politics.</P>
    <P>It is natural for the parties to be interested in this.  Wherever there is power they will seek it out, it is part of the nature of politics.  In the Seanad, that should be resisted.  I listened with respect, but without agreeing, to the argument that excellent people come into the Seanad who have ministerial experience. It certainly adds to the expertise at certain levels of debate.  I would be prepared to examine continuance of party interest but the principle of yielding, at least partially, on this panel system <Col N="1213" /> and enfranchising the nominating bodies is, I think, one that carried its own irrefutable logic.  I imagine my friends and colleagues who are elected by this system would probably be quite happy if there was a reduction in the geographic size of their constituency because it cannot be very entertaining to be travelling around the country, up and down boreens, and being smarmy to ancient county councillors in pursuit of a vote.  There is something a little undignified about this. Everybody knows stories of people coming&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was not imputing the particular practice to you, although I am aware that in certain cases such occurrences are not infrequent.  May I share with you something that also rather amuses me, that is, the friendship that develops around election time between members of opposing parties and the extraordinary and malevolent hostility that frequently develops within parties, because candidates in this kind of election are watching their backs, from their own party colleague; they know they are in no real danger from the person on the other side of the party political divide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I believe you should not just be theoretical; you should look for empirical evidence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  I would like to know of any independent Member who ran as an Independent without party endorsement or party membership and who made it to Seanad Éireann through the panel system.  I am unaware of any, although there may be one or two.  It is certainly very infrequent.  This throws into contradiction the use of the panel system in order to obtain representation of various interest groups, which is precisely what the Seanad is for.  The Seanad was intended to examine, to scrutinise, to refine and to amend Government legislation and in certain areas it was intended also for the initiation of legislation.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak about the role of the Seanad in terms of refining and amending legislation.  From my own involvement in this area, I would have to say that, far from the despairing tone that emanated from one or two of my colleagues on the Independent benches, I believe with a little ingenuity, you can actually get the Seanad &mdash; which is an antiquated machine &mdash; to do far more than could be imagined.  I will give some examples.  The Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill, 1988, was a classic piece of minimalist Government legislation, which the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Collins, indicated, with disarming candour, did the bare minimum to allow Ireland to sign a series of international protocols and conventions.  From this side of the House we attacked this parsimonious attitude and attempted to make it do something interesting.  For example, we put in additional clauses extending the provisions of the Prohibition of Incitement to Racial, Religious or National Hatred Bill to the principal minorities who might be subject to incitement to hatred &mdash; the travellers and the gay community. In other words, we started bringing in sexual orientation clauses and clauses outlawing specific types of ethnic discrimination.  This was resisted very strongly by the Minister, even though we presented evidence to the Seanad from <Col N="1215" /> other European jurisdictions and also from Canada and North America.  The Bill had not completed its passage through both Houses when a general election was called and when it came up again the new Minister, Deputy Burke, introduced our amendments in the Dáil and they then came back to the Seanad. The Seanad played an important role and when the Minister goes to human rights conferences in Europe he receives the plaudits of his fellow parliamentarians in Europe for having produced one of the most advanced forms of prohibition of incitement to hatred legislation in Europe.  That was thanks to Seanad Éireann.  That is the role it should play.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when Mr. MacSharry was Minister for Finance I discussed the problems of the north inner city with him, in particular, attempts to get funding into the area through income tax reliefs which would encourage people to live in the inner city.  Mr. MacSharry was not entirely convinced but I asked for an opportunity to meet some representatives of his Department.  I met senior civil servants.  I came in with my facts and figures and they made mincemeat of me, in the most polite and professional way because I am not particularly mathematically gifted.  My instinct was that my case was correct, even though I could not argue it properly. I said I knew they were right but I was also right.  I obtained the services of a very helpful economist; we went back and demonstrated our case and Deputy Reynolds subsequently introduced three and a half pages of our proposals into the budget.</P>
    <P>The final example is something we joined in from this side of the House, being briefed by a number of caring agencies. A number of women who were associated with the care of children came in and discussed the matter with us and I put down amendments to the Child Care Bill.</P>
    <P>I mention this because often when a Bill has already gone through the Dáil and comes to the Seanad, apparently for revision, so that we can operate as we <Col N="1216" /> were instructed to do under the Constitution by refining and amending the legislation, we find that is not practical for one very good reason, namely, it has already gone through the Dáil and they do not want to be bothered with it again. They do not want to be pestered.  They feel they have got it out of their system and you almost need Cabinet permission on some occasions, I gather, to get a Bill back to the Dáil.  I do not think there should be that impediment but we are all aware that this impediment exists.</P>
    <P>I will not mention any names but I recall an occasion on which a group of us stayed up very late at night arguing an amendment and resisting any attempt to introduce a guillotine because we felt it was of such substantial importance. Eventually, the Minister, almost in a state of collapse, went outside and made some telephone calls and he explained to us with disarming candour that he had to get agreement from the senior Minister and make sure the Government were prepared to accept it being returned to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On the Child Care Bill, 1988.  We argued very strongly on the question of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> so that somebody could be introduced into the system of support to represent the rights of a child &mdash; not the State, not the parents, not the social services.  This was introduced in England in the aftermath of the Maria Calwell case.  It has saved the lives of children there and will also save the lives of children in this country when it is properly introduced and given the appropriate finance.  When I put down that series of amendments they were ruled out of order because they would create a charge on the Exchequer.  This area-could be reformed, or at least looked at.  I know we cannot create a budget in this House. That would be nonsensical, but there are marginal errors where some small cost is incurred and it is appropriate that we should have the right to introduce such amendments.</P>
    <P>On the occasion the amendment was ruled out of order but were allowed to address the general theory.  We put down amendments and continued to argue and <Col N="1217" /> meet with representatives of the Department until at the last moment the Minister came into the House and said he had listened with increasing interest to what was being said in the Seanad.  He was now fully convinced by our arguments and he was introducing our amendments as Government amendments.</P>
    <P>That was a fine day for Seanad Éireann because, by virtue of hard work and consistently argued debate, we had convinced the Government to take the troublesome task of returning a Bill to Dáil Éireann.  That Bill, in the view of the professional people operating in the area of child care, will save the lives of young people.  That is the kind of thing the Seanad should do and upon which it can congratulate itself when it does it.</P>
    <P>I have attacked certain aspects of the machinery of the Seanad.  I make no apology for doing that, but I have always tried to underline that I am attacking a system and not the representatives.  I think the people representing the various parties in this House are of a high calibre generally and I wish they would be so perceived outside.  There is considerable confusion among the public about the precise role of the Seanad and if this debate can clarify our role then it will be doing a good day's work.  In the light of the circumstances that surround elections and manipulation by the political parties, it is not entirely surprising the public is confused.  Nor is it surprising, although it is regrettable that, for example, when RTE publish their account of the general election, with the breakdown of all the constitutencies, they call it &ldquo;General Election Report&rdquo;.  It is not a report of the general election: it is a report of only one element, because they only deal with the Dáil.  This is because of the time lapse between the Dáil election and the Seanad election.  It is interesting that RTE indicate by this kind of carelessness the lack of profile they feel appropriate to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I will make a few observations about what I might describe as some housekeeping matters because they are all that is going to be changed. Political parties are not at all serious <Col N="1218" /> about reform of the Seanad.  Why should they be?  It is not in their interest.  In a celebrated phrase that predates its belated discovery by a former Fine Gael Member of the Lower House, it would be &ldquo;like turkeys voting for Christmas&rdquo;. Why should they bother?  They would really be voting themselves out of power. We cannot really expect any realistic reform of the major elements.</P>
    <P>Two things need to be done.  The first is coinciding the dates of nomination for both Houses to ensure that people who want to be in the Seanad are in the Seanad and people who want to be in the Dáil are in the Dáil.  The second is enfranchising the nominating bodies.  We are not going to get those reforms but we might get some other things, for example, the development of a proper Question Time.</P>
    <P>People often complain that Senators like myself, apparently unscrupulously, use the Order of Business to paddle our own canoes, to ask questions that are sometimes deemed irrelevant by the Chair and to raise contentious matters. Why do we persist?  We do so because it is one of the very few ways in which the Seanad can be made relevant to the immediate concerns of the nation.  It is one way in which you can draw to the attention of the Seanad and, through the Press Gallery if you are lucky enough to catch the attention of one of the writers, the attention of the public to something you consider important.  The fact that we have these lengthy sessions on the Order of Business is not a reflection of irresponsibility or frivolity on the part of Senators; rather it indicates the absence of a proper machinery to deal with matters of immediate moment.</P>
    <P>I raise another matter that perhaps could be looked at by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges, that is, Standing Order 29. I would like to know if there is any rule book, for example, in existence, is there a Cathaoirleach's rule book which actually tells you the criteria by which decisions are made regarding raising a matter under Standing Order 29 <Col N="1219" /> and placing it before the House for consideration because it is a matter requiring urgent national consideration?  I forget the exact phraseology.</P>
    <P>I recall a situation, I think it was an ESB strike.  I remember getting a ruling on this matter and the Cathaoirleach said he ruled it out of order because it was not a matter of urgent national priority. Yet, while he was saying that, the Taoiseach was actually on the radio proclaiming to the nation that it was a national emergency.  That is quite absurd. Perhaps we should look at that matter and perhaps it would be helpful if we were able to have access to whatever guidelines exist, if they exist, and if they are not just simply improvised by whoever happens to be in the Chair at the time.  It is dangerous because it then might lead to the imputation that there were political or even party political considerations in some of the judgments of the Cathaoirleach.  I am speaking theoretically and I am not maligning anybody; that would be far from my nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly do so, but I have to say that in a democratic forum if we cannot analyse the machinery by which decisions are made then that itself is quite absurd.  Of course, I bow, to your ruling but you are yourself, Sir, reflecting the absolutely nonsensical situation.  I assume I am entitled to ask if there is in existence some kind of guidelines for these decisions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing <Col N="1220" /> Orders are always open for discussion, but as the Standing Orders are there I would like you to adhere to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am doing my best with your very kind guidance, Sir.  I would like to return to this question as to whether there is in existence clear and concrete guidelines with regard to these rulings.  If there is, it will be useful for us all to have access to them.  I am not laying any blame, because I remember, for example, that when the Altamont Bill was introduced &mdash; I am sure you will remember it, Sir &mdash; we had to go looking for all kinds of special regulations governing the introduction of this kind of legislation and people had to go and find these antique items in order to consult them.  Perhaps all of this stuff &mdash; the Standing Orders, the decisions, the methods whereby decisions are reached and the criteria &mdash; could also be looked at.  I regard that as a kind of a housekeeping matter.</P>
      <P>Another thing I suggested quite a long time ago &mdash; I am not sure that it was not even in the previous Seanad &mdash; is this sometimes vexed question of the length of time allotted to Ministers in debates.  I quite accept that constitutionality Ministers are perfectly entitled to speak for as long as they like.  Some people are windbags and uncharitable people might even describe me as one.  I feel strongly that when we have three hours allocated, for example, for Seanad debate it is inappropriate for any Minister to speak for an hour out of that time.  I propose that perhaps the committee, if it ever really does meet and considers these situations, could consider exempting the Minister's time from the time allocated to Members of the Seanad &mdash; in other words, if it is a three hour debate all of that three hours should be allocated to Senators.  If the Minister then wants to speak for 19 hours he can do so provided it does not trespass in any way on the time allocated to Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad and is also a reflection upon the way in which Government regards the Seanad that there has only been one Private Members' Bill successfully <Col N="1221" /> initiated and brought to its conclusion in this House in the past 35 years and that dealt with humane conditions for pigs and abattoirs.  It was introduced by my late colleague and friend, Professor W. B. Stanford.  Again, it is not a nonsense &mdash; one Bill initiated as a Private Members' Bill and brought to a conclusion?</P>
    <P>We have a situation where we are openly, clearly and flagrantly using this debate in order to exhaust time, using it as a kind of filler.  I believe that is what is happening.  There is no legislation coming from the Government of any real significance but we have a number of matters on the Order Paper placed by Independents.  There is the Suicide Bill &mdash; that is being dealt with but it will not get anywhere, of course, naturally enough.  There was an Education Bill put down by Senator O'Toole, myself and Senator Ross when he was an Independent and before he got involved in the sewage problems of Greystones.  I congratulate the seductions, the siren blandishments of the party system, which were able to lure Senator Ross into the problems of sewage of Wicklow County Council.  I may say I resisted these blandishments myself with some success.</P>
    <P>There is the Intermediate Education Bill.  There is a &ldquo;Bill entitled on Act to amend and extend the Irish Nationality and the Citizenship 1956 &ldquo;in the names of myself, Senator Ross and Senator Joe O'Toole.  That Bill was prepared by myself with the assistance of the parliamentary draftsman in response to pressure from a constitutent who in his own family had experienced this difficulty of adopting children abroad and establishing their Irish citizenship for passport reasons and so on.  There is a small technical matter that needs to be cleared up. I went to the trouble of getting the Bill drafted, which is not easy for somebody who is an ignoramus in these matters like myself, but I did it.  There is no real conflict between the Government and the Opposition and the Independents on this, but it has never been brought in.  They will not give time.  Why?  Because they are so obsessed with power &mdash; and I think <Col N="1222" /> this is true of every Government; I am not attacking Fianna Fáil on a party basis &mdash; that they have become a dog in the manager.  They do not want participatory democracy.  They feel it would be an erosion of their power and some kind of negative comment upon their capacity if they were to accept that a good legislative proposal that was not theirs had the impertinence, the impudence, to originate from a side of the House that was not controlled by the Government.</P>
    <P>There is also, for example, item No. 7 on today's Order Paper, the Interpretation Bill.  Again, it is small, simple piece of legislation that removes sexism from the language of parliamentary draft-personship &mdash; and I have to be careful with that one &mdash; and something that the Taoiseach indicated in the Dáil he regarded as necessary.  Here we have a situation where nothing is happening very much in the Seanad.  There seems to be very little legislation coming; we are dealing with filler material all the time and we have a queue of Bills that would not cause the sky to fall in if they are brought through to completion.  Yet, the Government resolutely refuse to allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>May I make another suggestion?  Again I doubt if it will happen, but let us see.  I understand that it is possible that the machinery already exists &mdash; perhaps I am incorrect &mdash; to allow distinguished persons to address the Seanad &mdash; particularly, for example, Members of the European Parliament.  Next week we are going to have a debate on Maastricht.  It is overdue; it should have happened some time ago, but at last we have got it.  Would that not be the ideal opportunity to have some of our MEPs share with us their experience of the European Parliament in order to illuminate and fill out our debate?  I believe this is vital.  It should happen.  I will wait with interest to see if the Government have the initiative and this afternoon I challenge the Government. If they are serious in all this bleating about reform of the Seanad, let them do something.  Let them demonstrate it by this one practical measure.  Let us have some of our MEPs in here next week <Col N="1223" /> to participate in the discussions and to report directly to us.  We are always talking nowadays with these buzz words and buzz phrases; one of them is the democratic deficit in Europe.  Here we have a simple means of making up the democratic deficit.</P>
    <P>I would like to end with a couple of matters.  One of them is returning &mdash; and I do not want to be too antagonistic on the subject &mdash; to the question of county councils and so on.  Again, this is a mixed issue.  I have to be honest and say that at the time of the last local election I was approached by a group who suggested that I might run in Dublin for the local authority.  I seriously considered it, but a number of things militated against it.  One was that, after looking at the constituencies, they suggested I should not run in the area in which I live; I believe in local politics you should have direct hands-on experience of the area you propose to represent.  They suggested that I should move back to my origins in the hated and feared Dublin 4, and I was reluctant to do that.  The other thing was that they then said &ldquo;After that we will look around for a Dáil seat&rdquo;.  I do not imagine I would have taken a seat, but I certainly had no ambitions to do that.</P>
    <P>The third reason I was reluctant to get involved was I recalled placing on the Order Paper of this House with persons who shall be unnamed &mdash; anybody who likes can look up the record; I will not embarrass them by rubbing their noses in it &mdash; a motion condemning the practice of double jobbing politically by being both councillors and Members of the Seanad.  I remember the arguments that were produced at that time by my colleagues. They asked if this was the reason we never met on Mondays.  I wonder if one of those persons is eating his or her own words on that particular issue.  I think the demands on somebody in a local authority, particularly if they are based outside the main urban environments are pretty heavy.</P>
    <P>I would like to end by saying a little about the work we do here.  I think we all work hard but I do not think the <Col N="1224" /> environment is always as good as it should be because I do not think the services are provided to the extent that they should be.  Perhaps this could be looked into.  This is a housekeeping matter.  Perhaps I could give a couple of instances.  I come to my office five days a week because I enjoy it, because there is work to do.  Nobody need think that Senators do not work hard.  I know they do because I am in my office and I meet people going around their offices.  The fact that the Chamber is empty, which is often used in a facile way by the media to attack the Seanad, does not mean people are not working.  We all have our offices with monitors and so on.  The equipment is improving.  We now have shared computers and so on.</P>
    <P>There are six Independent Senators. There are three small offices for six Senators, two secretaries and three political assistants, that is, ten or 12 people in three tiny rooms, four people to a room, filing cabinets, monitors, telephones &mdash; all this jumble around the place.  The conditions are cramped; they probably do not comply with the factories Act.  The division of responsibility between the secretaries &mdash; and I would like to say that the secretaries are extremely capable, efficient, hard working and decent people &mdash; means one secretary is working for three Senators.  If we really take this place seriously, we should have a room and a secretary each. That, of course, might embarrass a few people around here, people who never do any work, and there are some people who do very little.  Of course, it would be a dreadful embarrassment to have a whole office to yourself with a little secretary rattling around in it with nothing to do, but maybe that would force them into doing something.  I think the facilities need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that on occasions what I would consider properly constituted meetings, which were part of my responsibility as a Senator and the responsibility of other Senators, were not permitted to be held within the confines of Leinster House or of our offices because of the judgment of personnel <Col N="1225" /> in this House outside the democratically elected sphere.  I wonder about that.  I am very lucky that in teaching in Trinity and working in Leinster House I had a little bolt hole, a little throughway.  I could skip from the Arts block past the Kilkenny Design Centre and in through the back entrance to Kildare House.  That has now been closed up.  Why?  It seems absolutely idiotic to me that that is closed, because it means I now have to go right around the building, down the stairs into my office, along a passageway and all the way back again.  It is really infuriating to have to do that.  It is a kind of imbecile conception of whoever thought it up because there is a security person now employed full time on that entrance.  In a kind of little, parsimonious, meanspirited way that facility has been denied to those who work in that office building.</P>
    <P>I hope some of these matters will be noted because the principle really must be established that we, the elected Members of Seanad Éireann, are here doing our work to the best of our ability and we should be facilitated rather than hindered in the exercise of our function.</P>
    <P>I am afraid I told a lie &mdash; if that is not unparliamentary language and I may perhaps be permitted to use it about myself &mdash; but I told a lie, not a deliberate lie, because I said I was not going to talk for very long; but I also acknowledged that I was a bit of a windbag and I hope I have not taxed the patience of the House too much by what I said today. Like every person who has taken the trouble to contribute to this debate, I feel passionately that it is an honour to have been elected by whatever method to this House.  It is a privilege to represent your country in a national parliament.  It is something which I value very highly; I believe we all do.  It is perhaps for this reason that a number of us have taken the opportunity to speak at length even if, as I do myself, they acknowledge that it may be just so much sweetness wafting on the desert air and that very little of a practical nature will come from it.</P>
    <P>I hope that my few suggestions &mdash; and I acknowledge and accept that the major ones about disinfecting the system by <Col N="1226" /> removing the grosser aspects of party political control have no chance whatever of success &mdash; in relation to what I have described as small housekeeping exercises may be considered by the appropriate body, which, I understand, is the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which we know from the sometimes tragic history of this House has not always given satisfaction to lowly forms of life such as myself.  I might even say that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges might be given a wry glance from time to time.  Be that as it may, I hope that some of the suggestions I have made here in good faith may be considered worthy of consideration.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the role of the Seanad.  I hope during the course of my contribution to show why I disagree with some of the points made by Senator Norris, although I would like to agree with the points he made in relation to the lack of facilities for Senators in the House.</P>
      <P>So far this has been a very positive and constructive debate.  I have not been in the Chamber for all of it, but I have read all the contributions which have been published to date in the Official Report and I have listened to many of the contributions on the monitor.  Many interesting views and ideas have been put forward and some very practical suggestions for change and innovation have been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Leader of the House set the tone of the debate when he suggested to Members that the role of the Seanad should be considered within the parameters set down by the Constitution. The first fact we have to recognise is that the Constitution gives to Seanad Éireann a role which is in many ways distinct and separate from that which it gives to Dáil Éireann.  The Dáil, as the directly elected House of the Oireachtas, has, as Senator Fallon pointed out, superior constitutional powers in regard to non money Bills and superior parliamentary authority in regard to the finances of the State. This reality, however, must not be seen <Col N="1227" /> as implying that the Seanad has not a major and extremely valuable role to play as part of the Legislature of this State. What Éamon de Valera was intent on avoiding and what he succeeded in avoiding in the 1937 Constitution was a situation where Seanad Éireann would be a carbon copy or a mirror image of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>It was also his objective to ensure that as far as possible those elected to Seanad Éireann would all have specialist knowledge and experience in at least one of a range of vocational areas.  In order to achieve this objective an extremely complex electoral system, involving panels, sub-panels and nominating bodies, had to be devised.  To complicate matters further, the franchise for Seanad elections in the case of the five vocational panels is restricted to an electoral college comprised of persons who are themselves elected public representatives.  In the case of the university panels the franchise is restricted to graduates of the National University of Ireland and graduates of Trinity College.</P>
    <P>It is little wonder, therefore, that as far as the general public is concerned there is some degree of mystique attaching to Seanad elections and to the system by which Members are elected.  There is also the factor that Seanad debates and Seanad business do not receive anything like the degree of media attention received by the other House.  However, almost invariably, when the role of the Seanad is being assessed or evaluated there is a tendency to compare it directly with that of the Dáil as if the role and functions of both Houses were identical in every respect.  That is not a valid basis on which to carry out such an assessment or evaluation and that is why this debate is important.  That is why it is important for the Seanad to look at itself from time to time with a view to bringing forward proposals for reform or suggestions for change which are seen to be desirable and which Members consider will enhance the image of the House, improve its efficiency or make it more relevant and <Col N="1228" /> more responsive to a rapidly changing world outside.</P>
    <P>I have already touched on the previous speakers, including Senator Norris, have also referred to the Seanad electoral system.  The fact that 43 of the 60 Members are elected on five vocational panels by an electoral college of approximately 1,000 electors who are themselves elected public representatives does not tell the full story.  In fact, it does not even tell half the story.  First, as a general rule there are at least three candidates for each of the 43 seats.  Secondly, before each candidate is nominated he or she must go through a selection or election process to secure nomination.  In the case of some candidates there may be a two-tier selection or election process involved.  Having been nominated, if he or she is to have any chance of being elected a candidate must make personal contact with as many members or the electorate as possible.  This involves travelling anything from 10,000 to 12,000 miles throughout the length and breadth of the country trying to convince a very sophisticated and experienced electorate that one is worthy of being elected to what Senator Norris described as this august institution.  I cannot imagine any process that could be more democratic. It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to devise an alternative system of electing the 43 Members on the vocational panels which would be an improvement on the system I have described and which is now in operation.</P>
    <P>Other Members have dealt with the historical background and reasons for the fact that six of the 60 Senators are elected on the university panels by the graduates of the NUI and Trinity College.  The contribution made to the Seanad by university Senators over the years and which they continue to make has been acknowledged by all sides, but I would have to support the case that was made for the extension of the franchise on the university panels to those categories of third level graduates who currently do not have the right to vote on these panels.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made during this debate of the very many distinguished <Col N="1229" /> individuals nominated to this House by successive Taoisigh.  It was an honour and privilege for me to have served in this Chamber with people such as former Senators Éamon de Buitléar, George Eogan, Séamus Mallon, John Robb, Bríd Rodgers, Stephen McGonagle, Christy Kirwan, Brian Friel and Dr. Ken Whitaker.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that elections to the Dáil and Seanad would be held on the same day.  The argument that has been advanced in support of this suggestion is that it would force people to opt for either one House or the other and that it would preclude unsuccessful Dáil candidates from proceeding to seek election to the Seanad.  If this proposal were to be implemented it would probably favour sitting Senators like myself or, indeed, the Acting Chairman by reducing competition on the various panels. Defeated TDs and people who have unsuccessfully contested a general election are usually fairly strong candidates in the ensuing Seanad election as they invariably have a certain amount of sympathy from the Seanad electorate. However, I could not go along with the idea of both elections being held on the same day as I do not believe that people should have to opt exclusively for one House or the other.  I believe this House has benefited from the presence here of people who have served in the other House either as Deputies or, in some cases, as Ministers.  Likewise, I submit that some of the most distinguished Members of the other House are people who served their apprenticeship in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>Neither do I think that the preponderance of party politicians in this Chamber should be put forward as an indictment of this House or of the way in which its Members are elected.  The existence of political parties is essential to the system of parliamentary democracy which we have in this State.  I will never accept that the TD or Senator who belongs to political party is in some way inferior to the species who purports to be an Independent.  It has always been generally accepted that the debate in the <Col N="1230" /> Seanad is of a very high standard and this is as true of the present Seanad as it was of any of its predecessors.</P>
    <P>Legislation coming to this House is scrutinised in great detail.  A variety of extremely relevant public issues are debated during each session in Private Members' time.  Some of the most important legislation to be enacted in recent times was initiated in the Seanad and was greatly improved during its passage through the House.  I am thinking, in particular, of such legislative measures as the Companies Act, the Insurance Act, the Criminal Law (Rape) Act, the Control of Clinical Trials Act, the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act and the Video Recordings Act.  At the moment the very important Environmental Protection Agency Bill which was initiated in this House is being debated in the Dáil. I know that the Leader of the House is making every effort to ensure that it will continue to be Government practice to initiate legislation on a regular basis in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>A study of the Seanad Official Report will show that developments in the European Community and Oireachtas joint committees reports receive more detailed debate in the Seanad than they do in the Dáil.  Furthermore, Members have the opportunity on each sitting day to seek permission to raise important matters on dealt with each day.  It has been suggested during this debate that two matters should be allowed on the Adjournment, a practical and worthwhile suggestion.  I also believe that Standing Order 29 &mdash; Senator Norris referred to this order &mdash; should be amended to provide for the Adjournment of the House for a specified period only to deal with the type of matter contemplated by that Standing Order and that at the end of this specified period, the House would resume its normal business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new departures for which the present Leader of the House has been responsible, in particular the regular allocation of time for statements on issues of major importance.  For example, the opportunity which the <Col N="1231" /> Seanad will have next week over two days to debate the Maastricht Summit is welcome.</P>
    <P>I support the suggestion made by Senator Manning that the Leader of the House should have the status and recognition of an office holder and that the office should carry an appropriate allowance. This is a matter which the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should pursue as a separate issue in view of the fact that county council chair-people throughout the country are paid allowances, in some cases as high as £20,000, and the Leader of the Seanad does not receive a single penny in respect of the office he holds.  This situation should be redressed as a matter of urgency.  Thank you, a Leas-Chathaoirligh.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  I welcome this debate.  The Seanad has always been an easy target for criticism, some of it valid, more of it simply an indication of political immaturity.  The Seanad is part of the constitutional process; it provides a reflective second opinion on legislation and on matters of national importance. If there is a cost associated with it, in many ways that cost is well worth paying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad also provides a platform for people who would not be elected through the political mainstream.  Many of these people have made very significant contributions to Irish political life.  The Seanad &mdash; as a number of other Senators have said &mdash; also provided an <Col N="1232" /> introduction to national politics for many major political figures in this country. Former Taoisigh served their apprenticeship in the Seanad; Ministers on all sides and of all political persuasions commenced their national political life here and the Seanad gave them an important and useful grounding in the political process. That should not be overlooked.</P>
    <P>There is now a clear need for Seanad reform.  Many present functions of the Seanad should be abolished and some new functions introduced.  Much of the present business &mdash; it seems to me &mdash; is conducted on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and is heavily dependent on the availability of Ministers.  A clear programme of work should be drawn up and adhered to for each session of the Seanad.  Ministers should be paired to allow them to deal easily with the business of the Seanad; it is quite unacceptable that Ministers should dash off to the other House and that this House should be adjourned to allow them to fulfil their functions there. It should be possible to arrange pairs for Ministers in those positions and in all situations; except in cases of dire political conflict, this procedure should be adhered to.  Ministers should give commitments to participate in legislative programmes and the Seanad should, for many of them, be of considerably greater priority than it appears to be at present.</P>
    <P>I have long held the view that speeches made in this House are too long.  I am in favour of a time limit on speeches in normal circumstances.  Many speeches would benefit greatly from being edited.  I cannot see why, for the most part, people cannot express their thoughts and ideas in a 20 minute spell or in a shorter period. If effort was put in to considering what was about to be said, it should be possible to attain that objective.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I am not in favour of a complete abolition of the right towards the filibuster, or of the option for Senators in certain circumstances to engage in a filibuster.  It can fill a useful and important political role, but it should only be done for good reason and I cannot understand what anxiety drives Senators to continue speaking for one or <Col N="1233" /> two hours.  It is beyond me to understand why they behave like that.  I sometimes wonder if they ever read those speeches. Perhaps it would be a good antedote for that type of behaviour if they were obliged to read those speeches or to have them read back to them.</P>
    <P>The Order of Business is a sort of Byzantine ritual where Senators try to make political points by asking the Leader a question.  That, to me, is daft behaviour and I cannot see any justification for it in the latter days of the 20th century.  It would be much better if the Order of Business was a routine occasion for Senators to agree on the Order of Business for that day.  The present ritual should be abandoned and that time made available to Senators to make brief statements on topical matters. That would be preferable to the present situation where Senators depend on the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach to raise topical matters and it is quite inappropriate that topical matters cannot be discussed in this House except with the indulgence of the Cathaoirleach.  That practice is wrong and unacceptable and should be reformed.</P>
    <P>I agree with much of the criticism which has been made about the Adjournment debates.  There is considerable opportunity to expand on the Adjournment debate.  Two, three or four, ideally four, times should be taken on the Adjournment and the time available to Senators for the Adjournment should be confined to five minutes.  It might be a good idea if items on the Adjournment were listed into broad categories so that the Minister, let us say, for Finance or for Health could take four relevant items on a rotational basis rather than the present system where, on a typical day, five or six Senators try to raise matters on the Adjournment and only one can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been made of the method of election of Senators.  I agree with most of the points made by Senator Muloolly in relation to this matter.  The first thing we have to remember is that the Seanad is a different sort of Chamber to the Dáil; it fills a different function <Col N="1234" /> and I see no purpose in the Seanad becoming, as it were, a sort of a second division replica of the Dáil with an election system similar to that in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The people who elect most of the Senators on the panels are themselves elected people.  They are widely representative of the Irish public, they come from all parts of the country and they represent all walks of life and shades of opinion.  These people are well informed and have more political sense and judgment than most people give them credit for.  I am not sure that the criticisms made of the system are all valid.  Seanad elections are an item of influence and of importance for councillors, most of whom have very restrictive powers at present.  I would not be in favour of diminishing the role of county councils in the process by which Senators are elected.</P>
    <P>In relation to the University Senators, I share the view that they have made a significant and worth-while contribution to the Seanad over the years.  At the same time, it is difficult to justify university graduates having a vote which those who are not graduates of either Trinity College or the National University of Ireland do not.  I find it very difficult to accept that people such as myself who happen to have an NUI degree should have an extra vote in Seanad elections.</P>
    <P>While the system of electing University Senators gives rise to grave reservations, it produces excellent Senators.  I have, however, long held the view that the process by which University Senators are elected provides certain Members of the public with a sort of conscience washing facility.  Certain members of the public would like to think that they agree with ideas held by Senator Norris or Senator Ryan or by the various other University Senators.  Yet I think many of these people would be deeply worried if Senator Norris, Senator Ryan or one of their colleagues became Minister for Finance.  The university electorate can justify themselves and solve their consciences by voting for people who hold views they would like to hold as long as these views did not cost them anything. It provides a certain type of university <Col N="1235" /> graduate with an opportunity to indulge in a spot of double thinking.  Many of these people are the kind of folk who approach one in saloon bars late at night and say solemnly that they too are people of the left but one knows too well that, over the years, they have voted consistently and irreconcilably for parties of the right.  The opportunity to indulge themselves at election time by casting their NUI or TCD Seanad vote allows them, as it were, to wash their consciences and to reconcile all the delightful inconsistencies that characterise them.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some type of Question Time introduced into the Seanad. Perhaps it should be restricted to certain policy matters and for the most part restricted to written replies with a limited capacity to ask oral questions and to have the Minister answer them.  Much greater use should be made of the Seanad's power to introduce legislation and of present facilities to introduce private Members' Bills.</P>
    <P>Research facilities for Senators are very limited and uneven battles tend to develop between Ministers who come into the House with the support of civil servant experts on the Bill being dealt with and Senators who have to depend on whatever limited help they can obtain. I would like to see greater use made of the committee system and the Seanad having the capacity to call expert witnesses so that it can be fully informed on various matters of political importance.</P>
    <P>There may also be a role for the Seanad confirming certain appointments made by Government.  Many major appointments are made by the Government and nobody seems fully aware of how these appointments are made.  In the case of a number of key appointments, people do not apply for them but are offered them and there is very little review or criticism in the political process of how those appointments are made.  The Seanad could fill that function perhaps.  I would not like the whole shenanigans which went on in the USA in the case of the Judge Thomas appointment to be repeated here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I would like finally to refer to one or two items mentioned by other Senators during their contributions to this debate. Senator Honan spoke about &ldquo;King-makers&rdquo; outside the Oireachtas and the roles they can play in politics seem to be much more significant and important than those of the elected representatives. That role is a reflection of the amount of money these people have and of the way they use that money in elections, and there is no doubt that money talks at election time.  Money is the basis of much of the influence of these people and until the funding of political parties is tackled such people will continue to exert undue influence in many cases.</P>
    <P>In relation to the proposal that elections for the Dáil and Seanad should take place on the same day, I do not think that proposal will get anywhere.  There is an implication in this type of suggestion that party politicians are in some way inferior to independent representatives.  I reject that idea and I do not think that cold analysis of the facts would allow one to reach that conclusion.</P>
    <P>The political process depends on political parties.  There is no valid ground for claiming that people in political parties possess a disproportionate amount of the failings of the human condition.  The inconsistencies which characterise much of the behaviour of members of political parties, including my own, are also to be seen clearly in the behaviour of people who are not part of the political process.</P>
    <P>Where does this debate take us and where do we go from here?  I would be interested to hear from the Leader of the House what proposals he has to implement the ideas introduced in this debate and where the whole process of Seanad reform will be taken after this debate has concluded.  Thank you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Senators I welcome the opportunity of looking at the role of Seanad Éireann and debating constructively how we might improve the structures of the House, how basic reforms could make its operation more efficient and how a positive and constructively informative image could be <Col N="1237" /> presented to a negative and in many cases unenlightened public who view the second Chamber with cynicism.  Since being elected to Seanad Éireann I have made it my business to speak on the role of Seanad Éireann and on reforms that I feel could be implemented not just at political party meetings but also to women's groups, farming organisations, teachers, students and trade union groups and the response has not been negative.  People have openly admitted that they do not know what happens in Seanad Éireann.  Television coverage has helped in the last few months, slim though it is.</P>
      <P>I have also spoken here on many occasions of the need to include political studies in the school curriculum which could have been integrated with social and environmental studies as proposed by the former Minister for Education, Gemma Hussey.  If the subject of political studies was included in the curriculum students could have impressed upon them the importance of democracy and democratic structures.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House, Senator Fallon, explained in detail the enshrining in the Constitution of the powers and functions of the Seanad founded 54 years ago.  As a House of the Oireachtas, we are accountable to the people and all Senators are aware of their role.  We realise that the Dáil is the major organ of the legislative process but the Seanad has responsibility, too, to provide legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Senators must be surprised at the languid, rather lethargic pace of Seanad life.  The protracted and extended Order of Business which occurs regularly causes frustration as the repetition of motions continues, with regular questions to the Leader of the House.  Perhaps the fact that little happens in response exacerbates that frustration.  The Order of Business is a waste of valuable time.  Matters of urgency must be raised, as they are by the leaders of the parliamentary groups, but there is no other body in Irish life whether in public or commercial life which could afford the luxury of such <Col N="1238" /> time wasting before getting the business underway.</P>
    <P>The original aim in bringing together 60 people who would have knowledge and specialist expertise to oversee legislation can be seen through the varied professional expertise of present Members.  A roll-call of former Senators would be impressive.  Our President, Mary Robinson played a very important role in raising issues of vital importance to women during the seventies when she was a lone voice here.  Senator Catherine McGuinness who is now chairperson of the Employment Equality Agency was an impressive Senator.  That begs the question of equality.  We have six women among 60 Members in Seanad Éireann, a poor reflection of equality.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's 11 nominees are now political, but at a time when they were not we had Bríd Rodgers, Brian Friel, renowned and feted today for &ldquo;Dancing at Lughnasa&rdquo; acclaimed throughout Britain and the United States, John Robb, Séamus Mallon, Dr. Whitaker and other impressive and prominent people who had an opportunity then of making excellent and valuable contributions.</P>
    <P>President Robinson sees our emigrants as our extended family and we could extend membership of the Seanad to Irish people abroad.  I have had many requests from emigrants to have that matter raised and it would be an ideal opportunity for the Taoiseach of the day to include representatives of emigrant organisations among his nominees.</P>
    <P>Looking at the panel system, I support Senator Manning who suggested that nominating bodies would have a certain number of votes in addition to those who already vote on panels.  Women's groups in particular should have an opportunity to nominate candidates within the existing panels.</P>
    <P>The historical reason for allocating university seats has been dealt with by many Senators.  One of the reasons was, I suppose, our close links with the British system.  I have spoken almost weekly in this House, on the discrimination against graduates of the two new universities &mdash; the University of Limerick, which now <Col N="1239" /> has two other colleges integrated with it, Thomond College and Mary Immaculate College of Education and Dublin City University.  There is discrimination also in the case of regional technical colleges and other third level institutions.  We will be debating the Colleges Bill soon in this House.  That Bill gives enhanced status to the colleges and it is only reasonable that we would extend the Seanad franchise to all these third level bodies.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming Maastricht Summit would have been an ideal opportunity to welcome our MEPs to this House and give them the opportunity of explaining to us the importance of this historic occasion.  As we know, European issues encroach daily on our lives and as we do not have a committee on European legislation or a foreign affairs committee it is essential that we should have a forum for debating wider European issues.</P>
    <P>The topic of regionalisation, for instance, has been dealt with at conferences throughout the country and motions passed by local authorities month by month have fallen on deaf ears on the part of the Government.  The Seanad would be an opportunity for us to thrash out the importance of regional structures.  We and the United Kingdom are the only countries in the EC who refuse to accept that people in regions should have a say in deciding the fate of European Structural Funds and of integrating with other regional bodies such as farming organisations and trade union groups.  Agencies such as the Shannon Free Airport Development Company could be used as a model to create other similar regional structures.  Regionalisation can be discussed on the airwaves but in the forum where it should be discussed an opportunity to do so does not exist.</P>
    <P>I also look forward to major reports from chairpersons or directors of agencies such as the NESC and ESRI, particularly, who can map a course for us through the 1990s and into the next century. They should have the opportunity of coming in at timely intervals to discuss with us whatever they have worked <Col N="1240" /> through.  State agencies and the Conference of Major Religious Superiors who analyse rural and urban problems and the Combat Poverty Agency should have an opportunity to come to Seanad Éireann and make proposals particularly at pre-budget time.  While I realise the Seanad does not have a financial role we could use this forum for debate.</P>
    <P>We have had few opportunities here to debate educational issues in the absence of an Education Act.  Education is a long term undertaking; it cannot be treated as flavour of the month now and not later. We have had education debates for the past number of months on the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; and on television programmes yet we had little or no opportunity here at any time to discuss the future of Irish education.  It is all right to promise a Green Paper, a White Paper and an Education Act but we need to debate education in anticipation of these papers.  Given the change in personnel since the then Minister for Education, Mrs. O'Rourke promised us a Green Paper before Christmas, I hope we will not have to wait until after Christmas for it.</P>
    <P>Going back to the functions and the organisation of the House, limited opportunities to raise issues which cannot be raised on the Order of Business and which may be of local, regional or even national urgency are not adequate.  It is important to have longer time for Adjournment debates.  A Question Time perhaps could be incorporated into the proceedings of Seanad Éireann and Private Members' time is too limited.  It is not a good idea to divide three hours of Private Members' time between two weeks because the impetus cannot be sustained and it would be possible to create a greater impact if we had an uninterrupted debate.</P>
    <P>I will make a brief point which I can develop later because I believe we are getting an opportunity on another day to continue this debate.  With the queue of legislation in the other House and the pressure on us prior to recess times to debate into all hours of the night which <Col N="1241" /> does not do much for our clarity of thought, I would like to see Private Members' Bill such as the Suicide Bill introduced last night, being accepted by the House instead of being told, to our dismay, that the Government will be initiating their own Bill before Christmas.  I do not really believe this will happen before Christmas but I hope I am wrong. It would have made political common sense to accept the Suicide Bill in this House.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Greystones (County Wicklow) Sewerage Treatment Facilities.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Until about a decade ago, Greystones was one of the most attractive villages in County Wicklow and perhaps in the whole of Ireland.  Since then it has grown very fast and has been transformed from a very attractive, spacious village, into a small County Wicklow town.  That expansion has quite obviously had a very dramatic effect on the development of the town and the development of County Wicklow.  There is nothing wrong with such expansion, it is something we must welcome.  We should applaud the fact that the people of Dublin and the outer Dublin area can live in an attractive seaside resort such as Greystones, but the problem is that, whereas Greystones has expanded very fast in terms of population, unfortunately the infrastructure of the town has been completely and utterly inadequate to deal with this development.  The roads and footpaths are in an appalling condition, as bad a condition as any roads and footpaths in County Wicklow.  The railway service in Greystones is totally inadequate.  There is only one commuter service per day, although the town has a large population. The public services, for example road <Col N="1242" /> sweeping, are bad and in spite of the increased crime rate in Greystones, as in many of our suburban towns, there is not even a full time Garda station.  Unfortunately the worst problem, by far, in the Greystones area is the sewerage problem.</P>
      <P>While the town has expanded very fast, the necessary facilities and infrastructure have not been provided.  No plan has been made to deal with the sewage and the consequent pollution of Greystones Harbour and of the north and south beaches of Greystones has become quite intolerable for the residents of the town. There are too many people for the existing facilities and infrastructure.  That is bad planning.  Too many houses were built without forward planning for the needs of the population.  As a result, we have an intolerable sewage problem. There is raw sewage in Greystones Harbour, and on the north and south beaches.  No Government or local authority had adequately tackled the structural problems.</P>
      <P>I am told by technical people that the outfalls are too short.  I am also told that primary treatment only is provided in Greystones while secondary treatment is essential in a town that size.  We must change to secondary treatment in Greystones because we are now in contravention of the EC directive on waste water, which is due to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is offensive to residents who have lived there for a long time, partly because for up to 40 years they were accustomed to bathing in that area. It was a good bathing beach for many years but because of the sewage, there are &ldquo;no bathing&rdquo; sings on the north beach which is the worst polluted.  It is unwise at certain times of the year to bathe at the south beach because the pollution is so appalling.  There are figures on this which undoubtedly the Minister will have.  Figures given to me relating to the south beach in Greystones, which is the least badly affected, show that on 17 July this year &mdash; in the middle of summer, the prime bathing, holiday and tourist period &mdash; the total coliform rating, which is a bacterial combination, was 3,500 and that <Col N="1243" /> the fecal coliform rating, which is a fecal species of either animal or human, was at 2,500 on that date.  These levels are well above the EC limits and are more than double the Irish limits.  These figures were monitored for Wicklow County Council by the Eastern Health Board.  I have been unable to obtain an explanation as to how this happened.</P>
    <P>On the north beach, which is by far the worst affected area, the result of tests show that the coliform levels, both total and fecal, are consistently well above the EC limits.  This is obviously unhealthy, unsightly and intolerable.  It is possible that illegal developers in various estates are tapping into the perfectly legitimate sewerage works.  That may explain the results on the south beach, but no explanation has been given.  On the north beach, the consistency of the breaching of the EC limits is completely intolerable and is something which the Government and the local authorities have been incapable of countering.  I am sure the Minister will admit that these treatment plants are overloaded, that they are not capable of dealing with the sewage problem, and unless urgent action is taken, the coastline, harbour and beaches of Greystones will be polluted.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me what measures the Government have in mind to deal with this matter.  I know there is a process in hand for tackling the problem but it is very slow.  It is going ahead at a snail's pace.  The damage has already been done and it may be irreparable, not only in material terms but in terms of reputation.  The plan for Greystones is that the projected population is to expand even more quickly in the next ten years.  I worry that while the studies are going on the problem is getting worse.</P>
    <P>I understand an environmental impact study is being prepared, that it has been ordered by the county council and will go to the Department in a short period of time.  A preliminary report, which has been given to the Department, has found unambiguously that the situation is intolerable, that the system is overloaded and is in breach of EC limits.  When the <Col N="1244" /> Department assess this report it appears that the assessment will take between six and eight months, or even longer.  It will then be necessary for detailed plans to be made out and for the Minister of the day to give those plans the go-ahead. Subsequently the contracts have to go out for tender, which could take at least one year.  This situation is critical already but, as a result of the various procedures which have to be gone through as projected at the moment, it will take up to another three or four years to deal with it.  That is unacceptable to the people who have to suffer under the system.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to give me a reply which simply says, &ldquo;this is the situation&rdquo; but to convey to his Department a sense of urgency about this problem. There is no doubt that the Department of the Environment can, without any great difficulty, hasten this process.  They can cut down the time for going out to tender, and making assessments.  If this was regarded as an emergency it would be done immediately but because it has to do with sewerage, it is not regarded as urgent.</P>
    <P>I know it is an expensive matter but if we are irresponsible in the way we deal with the sewerage plant a catastrophe faces Greystones.  It is deteriorating before our eyes at this moment because of the neglect of this problem.  One of the most beautiful parts of County Wicklow, which has been an environmentally proud town, is in danger of getting a bad name.  When the Government neglect matters such as pollution in the harbour and on the beaches of Greystones, pride in the town begins to slip.  It is no coincidence that Greystones did not do well in the Tidy Towns Competition, although that may be partly because the spread of resources in County Wicklow is very thin. It may be there is not enough money to employ people to sweep the roads and clean up at the weekends.  It is a serious problem but if the Government, who have to take responsibility for pollution, neglects this lovely town in County Wicklow, the people will cease to take pride in it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for the sake of this <Col N="1245" /> tourist asset, for the sake of the seashore and the coast, the harbour and the people who live there, to do everything in his power to hasten the process to make it safe to bathe in Greystones again and to make the harbour and coastal areas free of pollution as they used to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Kirk)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Dr. O'Hanlon, to address this House on the issue of the provision of sewerage treatment facilities at Greystones.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment is determined to do all he can to ensure that both domestic and industrial effluent is disposed of in a manner which is consistent with the improvement and protection of our natural environment.  It is essential that effluent disposal arrangements are both safe, from a public health point of view, and environmentally acceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister's objective, and that of the Government, is to ensure that as much work as possible is done in upgrading and improving existing disposal arrangements, as well as providing new systems.  While substantial progress has been made in this area, priority must continue to be given to such projects in order to achieve this objective.</P>
      <P>Since 1987 over £335 million has been invested in providing modern water and sewerage services throughout the country. The economy and local communities have benefited greatly from this significant investment.  Much remains to be done nonetheless, and very substantial capital funding is being committed to this area in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The Environment Action Programme which was published in January 1990 outlines the Government's objectives and strategy in relation to the provision of water supplies and the disposal of sewage and other water borne wastes to coastal and inland waterways.  This ten year programme will ensure that the necessary infrastructure is in place to meet the demands of the 21st century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> The elimination of untreated discharges from major coastal towns is identified as one of the main priorities under the programme.  Investment of £400 million for this purpose is envisaged over the period of the programme.</P>
    <P>The recently adopted EC Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment is an important step forward in environmental terms.  It will have extensive and costly implications for Ireland but these have already been anticipated in the Environment Action Programme.  Municipal waste water treatment plants and waste water disposal arrangements must be capable of operating without causing pollution of fresh, estuarine or coastal waters and without detriment to other beneficial users of waters.</P>
    <P>On foot of the Government's decision to eliminate untreated discharges of sewage from major coastal towns by the year 2000, an appraisal of such discharges was carried out by coastal local authorities. Proposals are now being developed for the provision of treatment of effluent at many of these locations.</P>
    <P>In County Wicklow work has already commenced on the examination of options for the provision of full treatment of effluent from the towns of Wicklow and Arklow.  In addition, the Department of the Environment advised the county council in May 1990 to prepare proposals for a new secondary treatment works for Greystones.  In taking this action the Department were fully aware that the rationalisation and upgrading of the treatment arrangements would be welcomed by the county council and the inhabitants of the town.</P>
    <P>While the positive decision to provide secondary treatment at Greystones has been made, the detailed planning of the scheme has yet to be completed.  This will involve the preparation of an environment impact study.  The importance of this study cannot be over-emphasised. It will deal not only with the type of treatment proposed, but will also address the important environmental issues raised by Senator Ross.  It would not be appropriate to comment in any great detail on this matter, at this stage, as <Col N="1247" /> the study has yet to be submitted to the Minister for assessment.  However, he will take full account of all that is said today and any submissions that are made to him in this matter before making any decision.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Minister is fully committed to the provision of a modern secondary treatment facility at Greystones within the shortest possible timeframe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister assure me <Col N="1248" /> that he will convey to the Department of the Environment the urgent necessity of dealing with this project?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Hanlon, apologies for being unable to be here because of a Government meeting. I will certainly convey the sentiments which the Senator has expressed here today to the Minister and his Department.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 4.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 4 December 1991.</P>
