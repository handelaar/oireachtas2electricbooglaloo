      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to intervene as a matter of urgency to ensure that EC requirements are complied with by having an environmental impact assessment prepared before the commencement of site development work at the proposed interpretative centre at Mullaghmore, Burren, County Clare.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice to take appropriate measures to provide suitable facilities to ensure that the people of the north inner city are safeguarded from joyriding, drug dealing and other anti-social activities in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to open a motor taxation office in Bray, County Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Norris, Costello and Ross as suitable for <Col N="254" /> discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Norris' matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Costello and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to propose a vote of sympathy to the family of the late Councillor Eddie Fullerton, a democratically elected public representative for County Donegal who was brutally murdered over the weekend. In his death, and the manner of his death, there is a threat to democracy in all parts of this island.  As elected representatives we must stand firm for the rule of law and democracy.  We waste no time and do not hesitate in condemning out of hand the type of brutal act that resulted in Councillor Fullerton's death.  On behalf of my party I would like to extend to the family of Councillor Fullerton, to Donegal County Council, to the people of Donegal and, indeed, to all who support democracy here our deepest sympathy.</P>

      <P>With your permission, Senator, I will ask the Leader of the House if he would like to be involved in that vote of sympathy.  Normally, the practice in that the Leader of the House proposes a vote of sympathy and then it is the turn of the various groups.  We have established that practice and I would not like if there were any misunderstandings as to what we do in the future.</P>

      <P>Obviously, I too, would like on behalf of my party to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the family of the late Councillor Eddie Fullerton who many of us knew.  The fact that he was an elected representative makes the crime all the more serious.  All of us should be aware of this foul deed and I extend the sympathy of the House to his family.</P>

      <P>Last week we passed a vote of sympathy and marked the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi.  Again today we note assassination and murder by those people of violence who seem to stalk the world in great numbers.  It is always a tragedy when democracy is assaulted, when the elected representatives of the people suffer, because it is, in a sense, an assassination of the will of the people as well.  It was appropriate that yesterday the elected representatives of all parties in Donegal made their views known on how they felt about the assassination of one of their number.  His views are irrelevant.  He was an elected representative of the people and we have to distance ourselves from and, indeed, condemn the assassination of the councillor in the strongest possible way.  It was an assault on democracy.</P>

      <P>Very briefly, I wish to be associated with the remarks made by the previous speakers.  I met Eddie Fullerton on a couple of occasions at conferences and I found him to be very serious about the democratic political system in the country.  It is rather a pity that more people did not follow his example and enter into politics in the right way.  I would like to convey, on behalf of the Labour Party, our sympathy to his wife and family.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to join with the other groups in this vote of sympathy. We condemn violent death from whatever source and we condemn particularly the violent death of somebody who was a democratically elected representative. We join in sending our sympathy to Councillor Fullerton's family, to the members of Donegal County Council and to the people of Donegal.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 2 &mdash; the Finance Bill, 1991 &mdash; and item No. 3.  In regard to item No. 2 it is proposed by agreement, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the Minister for Finance be called on not later than 1.15 p.m. to conclude the Second Stage debate; and that the proceedings on the Committee Stage and the remaining Stages of the Bill and on the motion of concurrence with the earlier signature of the Bill by the President, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 6 p.m. by one question which will then be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to recommendations, include only recommendations set down by the Government.</P>
      <P>It is further proposed that we will have a sos from approximately 1.40 p.m. or 1.45 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I note the Leader's statement on the Order of Business today and I have no difficulty with the logistics. However, there is one point I would like to put to the Leader and that is my general concern about the relevance of this House particularly in relation to the Finance Bill; it is pertinent today as we finish Second Stage and go on to Committee Stage.  We are all probably aware that the annual publications from the various institutes in relation to advice on money matters and taxation are already on our bookshelves.  The Taxation Advice Bureau have published their booklet on the Finance Bill, 1991, and the layman's guide to same.  We know the difficulties we have; but great play is made of the fact that outside this House people feel that what we are doing here today is virtually irrelevant because the information is on the shelves, the <i>de facto</i> guide to the Finance Bill &mdash; presumed to be the Finance Act without the Seanad having even seen it &mdash; is available to the public.  I would like to know the Leader's view on this and ask him if he feels this is the correct treatment for the work we are about to do in the Seanad today in <Col N="257" /> relation to this most important legislation, or are we totally irrelevant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the Order of Business as proposed in terms of dealing with the issues that need to be dealt with, but I want to ask the Leader of the House about the legislation which will be taken between now and the end of the session.  We need a clear indication also of the sitting days over the next month or so.  It is quite difficult to adjust to sudden changes in the programme as they arise.  For instance, I know that in order to be here today people had to make changes.  I have no problem with sitting on a Tuesday, Friday or Monday, but it is a matter of having advance notice.  I know the Leader of the House wants to make arrangements around the week of the local elections, for instance, and that other arrangements need to be made at other times.  It would be useful if we could have some diary of what is likely to be taken over the next six weeks or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask a couple of questions of the Leader of the House. First, taking into account the serious riot that took place in Parnell Street over the weekend, together with a similar incident which took place outside the Harp Bar in O'Connell Street, and the concern expressed by district justices at the inadequacy of the law in allowing the imposition only of a £2 fine, have the Government any plans to introduce reforming legislation in this area to allow an appropriate fine to be exacted against people who terrorise the residents of the inner city?  Have the Government any plans to support the Garda for whom it must be a most demoralising experience to arrest young thugs and then find they are let off with a £2 fine?</P>
      <P>In view of the very seasonable and pleasant weather we have been having, does the House feel it is appropriate that while the gardaí are, quite correctly, allowed to wear summer uniform and rolled up sleeves, the ushers of this House are not so permitted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to bear this in mind.</P>
      <P>Following from the principal item of business for this morning, the Finance Bill, and the remarks made by Senator Doyle, may I say how much I welcome the fact that the Leader has very clearly placed on the record the Order of Business. Would the Leader comment on a report in <i>The Sunday Press</i> which says that &ldquo;Fianna Fáil outflanks lecturers&rdquo; and suggests that the business of this House is being ordered by the Government in order to make it impossible for University Senators to take part in debates, and that it is a quite inaccurate report that some of us will actually be speaking today&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed I know that Senator Fallon will be able to point out to <i>The Sunday Press</i> that this is grossly inaccurate and is contemptuous of the Government side suggesting that they would, or indeed, Sir, that you would permit such a capricious ordering of Government business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would also like to ask, if I may, when it is proposed to have a debate on Northern Ireland.  The situation there is clearly tragic.  I would have wished to join in the expression of sympathy for Councillor Fullerton, particularly since I am frequently accused of siding with only one side in this issue. I would welcome the opportunity of a debate in which the anomalies of the Sinn Féin position with the ballot box in one hand and the Armalite in the other could be made very clear to the people of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle expressed concern about the Finance Bill.  What we are doing today, and were doing last week <Col N="259" /> is precisely what we done in regard to the Finance Bill over the years.  I do not think that because we are doing that the House is irrelevant or anything like that.  We have a function in legislation.  The Finance Bill is important legislation and we are carrying out our duties.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked for a programme. Obviously, we are aware of what we have for this week.  In the weeks ahead we will be taking Report Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, the Competition Bill, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill &mdash; we will be taking those Bills in June.  Senator O'Toole also asked about sittings for the future, particularly for the month of June.  This is a matter for the Whips to agree on and I am sure the Whips will come to an agreement on that.  I will be watching it, but I can assure the Senator that we will be sitting on most Wednesdays and Thursdays of June.  He also asked about the week of the local elections.  Again, that is something for the Whips to decide. I think it would be the wish of the vast majority of Senators on all sides of the House that we will not sit for the week of the important local elections.  However, that is purely for the Whips to agree on.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Norris's concern regarding the problem he raised.  Certainly, I would have to refute what he said.  In my opinion the Government always support the Garda in their duties.</P>
      <P>In regard to the other comment about <i>The Sunday Press,</i> the record of the House is there.  We have called for business on Fridays over the last few weeks because there was a lot of business to be conducted.  As far as we were concerned as a party, we certainly had our numbers present, as indeed had the other parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>Is dócha gurb é seo an Bille is tábhachtaí dá dtagann os ár gcomhair chuile bhliain mar is í an aidhm a bhíonn ann ná straitéis airgeadais an Rialtais a chur i gcrích.  Ar ndóigh, cheana féin i mbliana bhí an Bille Leasa Shóisialaigh ann, agus curtha leis sin anois tá an Bille Airgeadais.  Tá sé anéasca ag daoine dearmad a dhéanamh ar an áit a rabhamar ceithre bliana ó shin, ag an am nuair a bhí ráta ard cánach de 58 faoin gcéad, agus ráta íseal cánach de 35 faoin gcéad ann.  In imeacht ceithre bliana tá ísliú déanta air sin, go dtí 52 faoin gcéad agus 29 faoin gcéad.  Is minic a dúradh gurb é ceann de na fadhbanna agus na lochtanna a bhí ar an tír seo ná an ráta ard cánach pearsanta.  Níl aon amhras ann ach go bhfuil cion fir déanta ag an Rialtas chun an fhadhb seo a réiteach.</P>
      <P>Tá i gceist ag an Rialtas leanúint den obair seo ach tá an chinnteacht níos mó nuair a chuirtear i gcuimhne go raibh ag an am a thángthas ar an obair seo a dhéanamh fiacha troma ar an tír agus go raibh an fiach náisiúnta ag méadú as cuimse in aghaidh na bliana.  Ag an am céanna gur íslíodh na rátaí cánach cuireadh cúrsaí airgid na tíre, trí chéile, faoi smacht.  Mar shampla, laghdaíodh an ráta ar a bhfuilimid ag tógáil iasachtaí síos go mór i gcaitheamh na mblianta sin agus, mar sin, tá ag éirí, ó thaobh airgeadais de, le straitéis iomlán an Rialtais.  Beidh mé ag caint ar ball ar chúrsaí fostaíochta agus an tionchar a mbeadh súil againn ar an obair seo ar chúrsaí fostaíochta, ach creidim go bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go ginearálta go mbeidh rátaí ísle cánach ann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Creidim gur ceann de na fáthanna gur éirigh leis an Rialtas an obair seo a dhéanamh ná gur fheabhsaigh said go mór na modhanna bailithe cánach a bhí i bhfeidhm sna blianta sin.  Níl aon amhras ann ná gurb é ceann de na rudaí ba réabhlóidí dá ndearnadh i gcaitheamh na mblianta <Col N="261" /> sin ná an amnesty a thug an tAire Ray MacSharry isteach sa bhliain 1987, sílim. Ní amháin gur thug sé sin isteach mórchuid airgid, ach thug sé seans do dhaoine a raibh faillí déanta acu sna rudaí seo iad a chur i gceart, agus níl aon amhras ann ná gur thug sé go leor leor daoine nua isteach sa chóras cánach agus go bhfuil daoine ag íoc cánach ó shin i ngeall air sin.</P>
    <P>Cuireann sé sin go mór leis an gcreideamh atá agamsa gurb é an bealach ar cheart dúinn a dhul ná simpliú, trí chéile, a dhéanamh ar an gcóras cánach, rátaí ísle cánach bheith i bhfeidhm agus deiseanna éifeachtacha a bheith ann chun iad a bhailiú.  Ní mar sin a bhí ach is sa treo sin atáimid ag dul le cúpla bliain agus tá an-mholadh ag dul don dá Aire Airgeadais a bhí ann a thug aghaidh ar an fhadhb seo agus atá tar éis muid a dhíriú sa treo sin.  Thar an t-ísliú iomlán sa ráta cánach, tá rud eile fíorthábhachtach déanta, is é sin, tax exemptions a ardú go substaintiúil.</P>
    <P>I always believed that the idea of a single person paying tax on a salary of £2,500 upwards was ridiculous and that the idea of a married couple beginning to pay tax on a salary of £5,200, irrespective of family size, made no sense because you wound up with the ridiculous situation of people paying tax and needing State hand-outs to live on.  One of the most revolutionary concepts introduced in recent times was the radical increase in tax exemptions.  When people talk about the disincentive to work of high tax rates, and particularly of the top band of tax, I often wonder do they think of the reality of somebody earning £60 or £70 per week and paying income tax and the disincentive involved.  Therefore, the increase in tax exemptions has been of fundamental importance over the years.</P>
    <P>It was a pity that in the seventies the relief for children in the income tax code was done away with.  I have never understood how this happened.  It is quite obvious to anybody that the increases in child benefit did not in any way compensate for the loss of these benefits.  In a country that places great emphasis on the family it seems of fundamental importance that <Col N="262" /> the cost and the importance of children and of families be recognised in the tax code.  The Minister in recent budgets certainly gave recognition to children, particularly in low income families.  It is of great significance for low paid workers that for a family with five children the tax exemption has gone from £5,500 to £8,900.  That is of major significance and only people who are dealing with low paid workers understand the relief felt by people on low incomes at being clear of the tax net when they quite patently cannot afford to pay tax.  I hope to see this extended dramatically; and if there is money for tax relief it is in the level of tax exemption that much of this money should go.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that in today's terms the idea of a single person paying tax under £5,000 income is unrealistic and I would ideally like to see the threshold for a married couple starting at £10,000 and increasing based on the number of children after that.  I will make reference to this again when I am talking about the provision of employment.  If the tax code was amended in this way, and continued to progress in the direction it is progressing, it would act as a stimulus to people to go out in the work place, much unnecessary administration would be done away with and, generally, tax income would not fall that dramatically.</P>
    <P>There is of course attached to exemptions one problem that hits the low paid worker and that is the question of the marginal rate.  A family with five children and an income of £9,500 to £10,000, pay a rate of 52 per cent tax on the amount of income marginally over the exemption level.  This can cause problems, particularly if overtime is involved.  For a person on a flat rate wage of £8,700 who earns overtime it effectively means that this overtime is taxed at the high rate of 52 per cent.  I admit that the 52 per cent rate as it is now is a great improvement on the marginal rate of 60 per cent that applied two years ago; but it still causes serious problems because people are reluctant to get involved in overtime if between PRSI and tax they are penalised at a rate of 60 per cent.  I would favour a <Col N="263" /> lower rate of marginal tax in those cases and I suggest that the 48 per cent level might be the level to aim at.</P>
    <P>In regard to indirect taxation, we have had two major significant reductions in the general level of VAT.  In two years it has gone from 25 per cent to 21 per cent. This will certainly have a significant effect for business and the consumer.  It has been a major contributor to holding down the consumer price index.  Being involved in business, I felt that high rates of tax provided the temptation for people not to declare all their tax liabilities.  Therefore, as with income tax, what we need is, very rigid implementation and lower rates of tax.  I look forward to the rate of VAT dropping significantly over the next few years.</P>
    <P>When we compared our tax rates here to the tax rates in other countries, and particularly our nearest neighbour, it was overlooked that we were using our VAT code to make up for the loss of rates income, which was abolished in 1977.  It is of significance, now that the British Government are moving in the same direction, that the difference between the Irish rate and the British rate is beginning to close dramatically.  At the moment the differential is 3.5 per cent.  This brings home to us the fact that in the whole basket of taxes you cannot isolate one, you have to take them all together.  I have no doubt we can continue to reduce these rates and to come fully into line with the rates in other countries.</P>
    <P>To prove my point on the question of tax yield, there is no better example then the increase in the yield from corporation tax.  Even though the general rate of corporation tax has been reduced, by elimination of certain exemptions and the tightening up of the system, the total yield from corporation tax is going to increase from £257 million in 1987 to £527 million in 1991.  This is of great significance.  It proves that a simpler tax system, with fewer exemptions and lower rates, is not only much simpler to administer but is also a much more effective way of collecting tax.  I would favour further steps in this direction with the elimination <Col N="264" /> of loopholes or incentives, or whatever one wishes to call them, the lowering of the general rates and a tightening up of the method of collection.</P>
    <P>Even though I made use of the business expansion scheme, I think, in general the Minister has to be complimented on the steps he took to reduce and to change certain conditions of that scheme.  I appreciate that there has been much olagón from certain sectors regarding this.  In general, it must be recognised that this scheme was being used to finance projects not, as was originally intended, namely, for risk capital, but for projects that basically were bank guaranteed.  If there is a justification for this type of scheme, and I sometimes have my doubts, I think it has to be within the term of taking risk.  Where this is seen not to be so, the Minister is perfectly correct in taking swift and prompt action.</P>
    <P>Such schemes do not always recognise the possibilities of development among the smaller, less wealthy sections of the community who would not have access to such funds.  I know that when the scheme was set up originally it was thought it would bring money into small venture capital schemes.  Time has proved that this was not so.  It was not the small hotels, the guesthouses, or farm houses that obtained BES funds but the big conglomerate organisations which would in any event have obtained funding for the projects they had in hand.  Our biggest problem in this field is to get money to the small operator on the ground, who will grow organically.  It is he who, over time, can provide rapid development in rural areas particularly.</P>
    <P>The question of decentralisation is of significant national importance.  We hear every day about the problems of emigration, about the problems of traffic in this city, of crime and of social disorder. It was even mentioned today on the Order of Business.  One of the biggest problems we face, and which we will have to tackle dramatically in the years to come, is the problem of the centralisation of all services in the greater Dublin area. <Col N="265" /> The relocation of Government Departments outside Dublin has been of fantastic significance to rural cities and towns.  Certainly, the provision of places for 900 public servants in Cavan, Galway, Sligo and Ballina has been of major importance to these towns.</P>
    <P>Deirtear, má chruthaíonn tú post, go gcuireann tú dhá phost eile ar fáil i seirbhísí atá timpeallaithe ar an bpost sin.  Mar sin, tá sé ionann is cinnte, maidir leis an 900 duine a aistríodh siar faoin tuath nó siar go dtí na bailte móra ar fud na tíre, gurb ionann é sin agus 2,700 post a chruthú san iomlán.  Má thógaimid meán teaghlaigh de, abraimis, cheathrar nó sheisear, tá tú ag caint ar riar maith daoine, os cionn 10,000.  Is ionann é sin agus baile réasúnta mór thíos faoin tír.  Ach creidim go gcaithfimid tuilleadh a dhéanamh.

    <P>The effect of the budget on unemployment has been discussed.  The whole question of unemployment has come very much to the fore in recent times.  I have been involved in the provision of employment for 18 years and I realise that it no easy task.  First, one needs capital, which is, obviously a prerequisite to any type of modern development.  There are those who thought that in rural areas, for some mysterious reason, one could create employment with no capital.  Secondly, you need enterprises to put that capital into and which give a return on profits. Thirdly, you need people and perhaps the third requirement is the most important one.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have become very sceptical about employment-giving schemes, about incentives and about specialised tax breaks for the provision of employment.  I have come to believe that the only way of creating employment in the future is the creation of a viable competitive economy.  People will say that is a right-wing view.  I think it is a rational view.  I have been working in the area of creating social employment through co-operatives and I have found that you cannot survive in the marketplace if your goods are not competitive. Competitive cost structures are absolutely vital.</P>
    <P>I have said consistently over the years that the biggest problems faced by employers are the high payroll taxes, between PRSI and PAYE; the high cost of transport, particularly for those involved in indigenous industry using heavy raw materials, high volume by value; high overhead costs in telecommunications, electricity and in the provision of insurances.  That is the reality employers face.  There is no employer who, if offered incentives, will not accept them.  I have not yet met the employer who, in private, has not admitted that the greatest barriers to development have been the overhead costs in this country.</P>
    <P>We are a nation on the periphery of Europe and some of us work on the periphery of the periphery of Europe and <Col N="267" /> the high cost of labour and transport puts us at a total economic disadvantage.  I recognise, and anybody in business who is open-minded and fair recognises, that on the budgetary controlled elements of this, the Government have made major strides in recent years.  The decrease in the tax rates has been most significant.  It has meant that the overhead cost of tax to employees has greatly reduced.  I have always maintained that the tax for the many is more important than the tax for the few.  There has been great emphasis in certain quarters on reducing the highest rate of tax so as to bring in the entrepreneur and encourage entrepreneurs to work.  However, no entrepreneur can produce if the people on the factory floor do not believe there is an incentive for them to produce, on behalf of the company for whom they work.  The reduction of tax for the low paid worker is more significant in the long term than selective top rate tax reductions.  We have seen major steps in that direction over the past few years.</P>
    <P>A budgetary measure that was of minor significance last year has now come to be of major significance, with the changing of the part-time workers Act and the bringing of part-time workers to full PRSI.  Last year there were very few full-time workers whose wages dropped under £60 per week.  You can take on part-time workers now, and they do not get penalised, although the employer does, in paying 7.5 per cent PRSI on a small income.  The second thing the Government have done, on this general overhead front, is the reduction in VAT and the third thing that has happened is the reduction in Government controlled overhead costs.  Basically, the general rates of excise duty on things like diesel have not increased, which has effectively meant a decrease.</P>
    <P>A very significant step has been taken, in relation to the western areas, by the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in the decision to give some equality in the cost of telecommunications. This is a strategy, a broad package.  Even though that item is <Col N="268" /> not part of the budget as such, it is part of the totality of steps being taken by the Government to decrease overhead charges.  In my time as a manager, the difference between the new telecommunication charges now and what they were, would be a saving, in the time of about £60,000 on my operation alone. We would have considered it fantastic to have been given a cash grant of £60,000, even over that period of time.  It is in this context that one begins to realise the terrible burden placed by high overhead taxes.</P>
    <P>If we want to stimulate further development, we have to continue to control the cost side of the equation.  We have to continue to decrease, in absolute terms, those taxes that particularly affect the cost of industry, agriculture and tourism. Rather than an increase in grant-aid, in new schemes, in the budget of the IDA, I would prefer to see a reduction of overhead costs by the State.</P>
    <P>From the industrialist's point of view, there is another advantage in this.  There is no administration involved in getting a smaller telephone bill.  There are no application forms to be filled up.  You just get a smaller telephone bill.  If you apply for grants, much of the time you twist and turn, trying to comply with the terms of schemes that were not tailor-made for your requirements.  I do not think this point can be stressed strongly enough. There is always a temptation to hold out the lollipop, to hold out the incentive, in the belief that it will make people happy. In the sixties and seventies, people had enough of that approach.  They are looking for something more radical now, something more basic and something very simple.  Our cost structures must be put right and we must develop in that way.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I would like to refer to in this question of development, namely, the question of capital.  It has long been believed in this country that the only source of capital is foreign investment and big investors.  We have to reexamine this in the light of the realities before us, which we sometimes ignore. For example, life insurance companies <Col N="269" /> rely mainly on small investors, a large number of people making a small investment, building up to massive sums of money.</P>
    <P>There is money available in this country. One of the challenges that faces us is to make that money go around.  We have not made that money go around fast enough.  Anybody in the west of Ireland would tell you that much of the money paid out by the State is left dead.  Some of it is left under mattresses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;some of it.  Much of it is put into the associated banks and left in accounts.  The associated banks recycle this money in big ventures in the cities and it is not recycled into the community from which it comes.  I know from my own experience that there is money out there, that there is a wealth of development that could be tapped if we had the right structures.  We should look at very innovative ways of guaranteeing such structures so that communities would have access to the money already in their own community.  I know, for example, in my own community, that the raising of £0.5 million to £1 million, which seems a lot of money, would not be impossible, given the right structures and incentives.  This could be done through changes in both the social welfare and tax codes, particularly in relation to that type of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few years ago, I was faced with the problem of raising capital for enterprise in my own area and with the fact that the structures of the co-operative for which I work were not conducive to investment. For example, the basic share capital of the co-op, when I started, would have been in the region of £3,500.  Faced with the fact that a monolith, if it got involved in borrowing, could not hope to raise big money and would be at risk if one project failed, I tackled this problem in a totally innovative way.  We set up a number of individuals in their own businesses, around a central core advisory service, which was there to help and advise when needed and to keep out of the way when <Col N="270" /> not needed.  This advisory service consisted of people who had experience and would be available to help, even to advise, on how to get money from the State sector.  Within one year of starting this type of development and with very small State support &mdash; perhaps £60,000 or £70,000 &mdash; the capital investment between borrowing and grants of the people we set up in their own small businesses was in the region of £300,000.  This was a very significant investment in a small area in rural Ireland.  If one person failed in their business, they had no major loss and just pulled out.  All the other people who set up on their own, in this way, managed to develop and survive.</P>
    <P>They would say that the biggest problem all along is not in relation to ideas or management.  We were able to give them the management advice, while they were able to do the job technically much better than we could.  The biggest problem is the availability of ready cash.  Capital grants do not answer this, because they are always attached to goods or capital goods.  What is required is the availability of lump sums of ready cash with which they could develop their businesses.  We have to look at this question if we are serious about unemployment.  We must stop thinking that setting up committees, new incentive schemes, new grants will solve the problem.  What is needed is the provision of basic capital to people, low overheads and most important, the attraction of ordinary people with special skills and ability.  They must be identified and matched to projects.  This is absolutely vital in the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>The budget strategy has been going in this direction.  The innovation shown by the Minister over the past few years has been: to simplify the code, collect the money efficiently and reduce the basic tax rate for the ordinary taxpayer.  I hope the Government will not get deflected from this basic direction.  I hope they will continue the policy of tightening up and the simplifying and lowering of rates and that we will see more development in this direction over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to a small <Col N="271" /> point in the Bill.  Under section 75 as it relates to road tax, I note that the Minister has made a special exemption for veteran and vintage vehicles.  He mentions £10 for a motor bicycle and £20 for other vehicles more than 30 years old.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh ar mo shúile dom é le tamall an fhadhb atá ag daoine a bhfuil cónaí orthu ar na hoileáin bheaga amuigh san fharraige, maidir le cúrsaí cháin bhóthair.

    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise a few points and I hope to allow some time for my colleague, Senator Norris, to get in.</P>
      <P>First, I would like to condemn the budget on the fact that it has failed to tackle the unemployment problem, regardless of what my colleague, Senator Ó Cúiv, has said.  The period of the budget will see unemployment in excess of 250,000 people.  This is a great social problem which needs to be tackled.  I would like to quote from the Fianna Fáil policy document during the last local elections, when they castigated the then Coalition for their failure to provide employment for 230,000 people, many of them school leavers, and their failure to curb emigration.  They said that 33,000 young people were forced to go abroad in the previous two years.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is a major problem for many people.  Politicians meet families, we meet fathers and mothers who see their children facing a future abroad. They see no future for them in Ireland. They are educating them for another country.  We see a land losing its best citizens who do not have the opportunity to contribute to our economy, and to the improvement of our people.  They are forced to leave our shores and go abroad. Unfortunately, an acceptance of unemployment has grown over a number of years.  It is time we shouted stop, questioned what is happening and ensured that we do something to remedy the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget fails in that it does not shift the burden of taxation from the PAYE <Col N="273" /> sector.  It is almost discriminatory that the PAYE sector is forced to carry the main burden of taxation.  We can see people whose tax bills can be cut from £8 million to £4 million and it is totally unacceptable that somebody on a modest income must pay tax at the level obtaining for the PAYE worker.  He is not given the opportunity to negotiate his tax position down to 50 per cent of what is demanded from him by the Revenue Commissioners.  This is having another effect on our economy; it is encouraging the voluntary emigration of many of our better educated people.  It is encouraging and forcing a brain drain that will be a severe loss to our nation and to our future.  These people are important for the future of the country.  They are the people who must build the country for the future; they are the people of ideas; they are the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Yet, they are leaving our shores because of the unacceptable PAYE taxation régime.  The budget failed to tackle that aspect.</P>
    <P>Another area where the budget fails is in the allocation to the Department of the Environment.  We had debates some time ago on a motion of no confidence in the Minister for the Environment and on the Environmental Protection Agency and reference was made on those occasions to the condition of our roads. The Government should seriously look at the Fine Gael proposal for a special local roads fund.  The county roads are not maintained at the moment.  The moneys paid through motor taxation should be put into a local fund and spent on our county roads.  I would like to quote from the Fianna Fáil policy document on county roads and their statement in 1985 at the local elections.  They stated:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will provide investment for road construction to bring all our national road network up to international standards.  Fianna Fáil views with concern the rapid deterioration of the county roads system which represents 80 per cent of the public road network.  A special five year programme to assist local authorities deal <Col N="274" /> with the problem will be drawn up for the maintenance of county roads.  A special proportion of the annual Exchequer grant for roads will be allocated to funds for this programme.  We believe that the preservation of the investment of over 60 years in county roads is essential for the repair of non-county roads.</P>
    <P>It refers to moneys for non-county roads under the local improvements scheme.  I ask the Government to take on board the policies they adopted during the 1985 election and ensure that the deterioration that has taken place over the past three or four years is remedied and that a proper approach to maintaining, improving, and saving our county roads, is taken on board.  As an example of what I am saying, Limerick County Council collected £5.3 million in 1990 on direct local motor taxation and in the same year they spent £2.55 million on county roads. What is the Minister's approach to local charges?  He has maintained local charges in the budget.</P>
    <P>In the Fianna Fáil document of 1985 on local authority finances, the following comment was made:</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the new system of local charges and on return to office will abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they are imposed, namely the Local Government Financial (No. 2) Act, 1983.  In its place they will introduce new legislation which will end the present unsatisfactory position and put local finances on a sound basis. The legislation will provide that local authorities will receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year from the central Exchequer.  The Exchequer contribution will be sufficient to provide a satisfactory level of necessary services.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to comment on when it is likely their commitment of 1985&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like, first, to express my appreciation to Senator Neville for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I am particularly pleased the Minister is here.  I would like to indicate a few headings and then just deal with one subject in a little more detail.  It is a subject with which I know the Minister finds himself in sympathy, that is, the question of the restoration of the inner city of Dublin.</P>

      <P>I would just like to make a point to the Minister for Finance.  Two senior academics, the retiring Provost, Dr. Watts, in an interview broadcast on Sunday, and the incoming Provost, Professor Mitchell, in a statement yesterday, indicated that they felt Trinity College was at some disadvantage comparative to the other third level institutions in terms of capital investment programmes.  This is something that bears some looking at particularly since we are moving into the year that commemorates the 400th anniversary of this venerable institution.  I do not want to get into too much comparative evaluation.  We have a wonderful education system at third level and we can be proud of all the colleges, not just Trinity College but certainly the colleges of the National University.  It is something that in this year might be looked at sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted there are a number of headings <Col N="276" /> in the summary of public expenditure programmes which deal with lottery funding.  This is not directly the responsibility of the Minister for Finance but it is something that perhaps he might bear in mind at Cabinet discussions.  I mean no slur whatever on the Minister for the Environment or anybody else but it is regrettable that the Government have not lived up to a commitment given some years ago that lottery funding would be independently allocated by an all-party group.  Perhaps the Minister for Finance could use his good offices to try to ensure that this happens.  It removes suspicion from the political arena.</P>
    <P>I noted in the arts, culture and heritage projects a number of useful things such as the National Gallery and the National Heritage projects.  I spoke on Adjournment debates, one on the curvilinear greenhouse system at the National Botanic Gardens &mdash; we got some money for that &mdash; and also on the National Gallery.  I know that the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are well aware of the significance of cultural tourism and that is one of the reasons they have decided to put in this degree of investment.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention one other item of a technical nature, that is, in relation to stamp duty.  I have been approached by lobbyists &mdash; I am sure the Minister is well aware of the situation &mdash; on the idea as to whether it is appropriate that stamp duty should be charged in Ireland where merely the legal end of the transaction takes place through a solicitor's office in Dublin but where the property involved is abroad.  I have been approached by a group of professional people on this matter.  Perhaps the Minister is aware of the situation and he might like to comment.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to my principal interest, the renewal of the inner city. The Minister will remember that some years ago we had a lengthy debate concerning incentives for the restoration of the 18th century core of the city.  After some degree of debate with civil servants from the Department of Finance, who were extremely helpful, certain measures <Col N="277" /> were introduced in the budget about two years ago.  The Minister may be able to enlighten me on this or put it on the record because I am afraid I will not be able to remain for very long because of university commitments.  How much money has now been taken up under this scheme?  I am not aware of any person in the immediate vicinity of the area in which I am principally concerned who has availed of the tax incentive so provided. This needs to be reviewed.  I would be very happy to take part in further discussions with the Department of Finance to see how this can be looked at.  I know the initial hesitation was that there might be a haemorrhaging of funds.  I am sure the Minister will be able to secure the information which will demonstrate that if money has actually made its way back into the public arena as a result of these measures it is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>It would be useful for the Minister to look at the possibility of giving capital grants for the restoration of heritage houses.  In most of the European and American cities there is some provision for the direct transfer of funds, not just tax incentives.  In general terms the operation of section 23 and section 27 has been to bring in large institutional investors and developers and it almost invariably neglects the small person, the individual householder.  I could place on the record of the House the fact that one of my colleagues in North Great George's Street received a capital grant from the corporation for some section of the restoration work being carried out and immediately applied that directly to the replacement of the front rake of a slated roof on a listed building.  That is a more efficient method of financing the refurbishment of the inner city than tax incentives and reliefs.  This situation is taken very seriously.</P>
    <P>I have before me a documentation from the city manager which makes it clear that in 1984 the city council adopted a report on 2 January of that year by the city manager making the case for tax incentives and other financial inducements to encourage the provision of new <Col N="278" /> residential accommodation and the renovation of existing premises in run down city areas.  Since then we have had the introduction of section 23 tax incentives and so on and there has been some construction. Along the quays where some effort has been made the proportion of residential development there is actually quite small.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister is doing in relation to the Temple Bar area.  I would like to know a little more about the Temple Bar company which has the responsibility of vetting this.  I hold myself in readiness for any consultations the Minister or the Government may wish to have.  I know the Temple Bar area and I invested in it in 1978 when I very much doubt if any member of the Government had the slightest idea where it was.  Very few people in the country did.  The Minister is shaking his head but I would be very surprised if he could prove with documentary evidence that he knew where it was.  We established a community centre for the gay community with a discotheque, cinema and so on. We had discotheques for green issues, environmental issues, women's issues, I can point to a great number of small enterprises that sprung up in that area as a direct result of the operation of the Hirschfeld Centre and yet we are specifically excluded from newspaper reports, Government funding and so on.</P>
    <P>I do not expect the Minister to endorse the specific activities of that group but it is observable as a phenomenon that it was the energy from that enterprise that started lifting the entire area in 1978. There was nothing else there at all, nobody had heard of it.  When you speak of a Left Bank atmosphere you are speaking of an atmosphere generated exclusively by the Hirschfeld Centre.  I would be very happy to have some discussion with the people, if the Minister would consider it appropriate, with the intention of assisting in the redevelopment of a very important area of the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who participated in the debate and to Senator <Col N="279" /> Norris I wish to say we are always open to suggestions and representations as to how we can improve the job we are doing, whether it is in relation to Temple Bar or the other areas of inner city development in which quite clearly he has a definite interest, as I have also.  I do not have the exact detail but I will find out and will send it to Senator Norris in relation to the uptake, if any, under the scheme.  I know it was very disappointing the last time I looked at it in relation to residential refurbishment.</P>
      <P>Quite clearly, we are all trying to make the inner city a living city again and bring back people into it.  That is why the incentives are the way they are but if they have to be changed or redirected, so be it.  We are here to try and do a job.  If the manner in which we set out to do it is not successful I have no hang-up about changing it and redirecting it to get a better result. In relation to the Temple Bar area there is quite a lot on the record.  I will be glad to deal with any questions in relation to it on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Regarding the disadvantage suffered by Trinity College, I will certainly examine this matter in relation to capital expenditure.  I know it is not my own specific area but there is also the question of allocation of science and technology grants and a whole wide area of capital expenditure.  We should all be proud of our third level institutions.  Education got priority attention in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  We need to make more places available in third level for graduates because education is the best investment we can make in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will deal with the question of stamp duty on Committee Stage.  I know the problems that can arise in that area.  They can change every day and every week.  I will look at the specific aspect raised by Senator Norris.  I am aware of some of the problems and that is why I have taken the facility under the legislation to use a ministerial order to exclude areas that need to be excluded.  At this stage all that has been brought under the stamp duty regime are those areas that were there <Col N="280" /> traditionally in the financial services such as cheques, mortgages and so on.  The rest will be dealt with by ministerial order.</P>
    <P>Senator Upton seemed to take from what I said that a mid-term or mini-budget was likely this year.  The Senator should have examined the text of my speech more closely before jumping to that conclusion.</P>
    <P>In my address to this House on 24 May, I recalled that the main consideration underlying the 1991 budget was the need to maintain the consistent thrust of financial discipline in the face of slower economic growth and an uncertain international economic climate.  This is still my priority.  My intention was to inform this House of how the trends in the figures to date compare with the budget picture. I made it clear that the outcome to date, while not according with the forecasts in every detail, do not call into question the broad policy thrust set out at the beginning of the year in both the budget and the programme.</P>
    <P>I went on to say that while events are progressing broadly in line with expectations as far as growth and employment and the generality of tax revenues are concerned, cyclical influences had adversely influenced some areas of the budget.  In particular, stamp duties and taxes on vehicle purchases have been sluggish to date, and social welfare expenditure is coming under some pressure from the unexpected rise of the altered migration trend.  The improvement in the Irish economy, which will follow the international recovery and the implementation of the provisions of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will contribute to a better trend as the year advances.  However, it is too early to say whether this will be enough to enable overall tax revenue to retrieve in full the ground lost during these early months.</P>
    <P>I went on to stress that, should they occur, unavoidable deviations of this kind should not be equated with a loss of financial discipline.  There is a fundamental distinction to be drawn between possible variations from the <Col N="281" /> budget arising from extraneous factors, such as those I have just described, and slippages arising from what could be described as policy failure.  The possible variations cited do not alter the essential soundness of the economy, and we remain well placed to progress towards our medium-term budgetary objectives. That would not be the case should more fundamental problems emerge.  It was in this context that I concluded that the emerging evidence will be carefully evaluated and that &ldquo;if action is considered necessary to safeguard our hard-won budgetary stability and our medium-term goals, we will do what we believe to be appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made reference to pressing the Central Bank to further reduce interest rates.  As the House will be aware, improvements in the environment for Irish interest rates, including money market liquidity conditions and reductions in interbank interest rates, led to the recent reduction of 0.5 per cent in retail interest rates, which was a welcome development for mortgage holders and businesses.  It is the policy of the Central Bank, which has the primary responsibility for Irish interest rates, to foster a level of interest rates as low as possible consistent with exchange rate stability and the maintenance of low inflation. While the bank can influence the market, it cannot dictate the underlying market conditions, or hold rates at any particular level against an established market trend. Any attempt to push rates below the level indicated by the market would result in a loss of official external reserves.  Therefore, any such reduction could not be sustained and could lead to higher rates in the longer term.</P>
    <P>International market conditions are a major factor in determining the level of Irish interest rates and further progress in reducing Irish rates will be heavily dependent on the international environment. Given our low inflation rate and strong balance of payments position, we should be in a position to profit from favourable international developments, particularly in regard to the narrow band EMS countries, as they occur.  Such <Col N="282" /> favourable developments would be more than welcome.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton claimed that the Irish tax system is biased against the use of labour.  While that may have been true in the past, the situation has changed substantially since 1988.  During the last three years the accelerated capital allowances on plant, machinery and industrial buildings have been phased down in most cases from 100 per cent prior to 1 April 1988 to 25 per cent from 1 April 1991 and they will finally terminate from 1 April 1992.  This has removed the major bias in the tax system for firms to use capital assets in substitution for labour.</P>
    <P>Recent years have also seen substantial pro-employment changes in the income tax system.  There have been large increases in the exemption limits, and the introduction of the child addition to them, as I outlined in my opening speech. The standard band has been extended by over 40 per cent.  The top rate of tax has been reduced from 58 per cent to 52 per cent, while the standard rate has been reduced from 35 per cent to 29 per cent. These changes have significantly reduced the tax wedge, about which Senator Staunton was expressing concern.</P>
    <P>In the 1987-88 tax year, it cost at most £3.28 for an employer to pay an extra £1 to a single employee on the top rate of tax: now it costs at most £2.79.  Also, of course, it must be remembered that the vast bulk of taxpayers are not on the top rate.  By and large the group we are talking here in percentage terms is about 12 per cent of the total taxpayers.  That is what we are talking about.  When we talk about this throwaway cliché of it costing an employer £3 to give a £1 increase, we are talking about 12 per cent of the taxpayers.  At the standard rate, which applies to the bulk of our taxpayers, it used to cost an employer at most £1.96 to pay an employee an extra £1; now it costs £1.77.</P>
    <P>Senators Staunton and Upton speculated on whether I was moving away from the income tax rates objectives set out in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>.  I can allay their fears: I am not. Let me repeat what the programme says:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="283" /> The Government have, accordingly, undertaken to make further improvements in income tax, according as economic and budgetary circumstances permit, over the next three years.  The key objective is that the standard tax rate, now 30 per cent, will be further reduced, to 25 per cent by 1993; there will also be further movement towards a single higher rate.</P>
    <P>As I said in my budget speech, the Government's aim will be to reduce both the standard and top rates of tax by 2 per cent in each of the next two years.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton also mentioned the business expansion scheme, claiming that I changed course on the scheme in March under pressure from those affected by my budget changes.  I am glad of the opportunity to refute that suggestion. The fundamental restructuring of the scheme, which I announced in January, is a fact, and the Bill provides accordingly for its implementation.  The key elements of what I introduced in the budget remain.  Shipping, hotels, guesthouses and self-catering accommodation are excluded from the scheme, the company limit on fund-raising under the scheme has been reduced and a lifetime cap has been imposed on the amount on which an individual can obtain relief.  The transitional measures, which were announced in March, are no more than that; they do not in any way overturn the basic reorientation put in place on budget night.  They apply exclusively to companies which had entered into contractual commitments on or before budget day in anticipation of BES funding, and which meet certain other conditions.  I make no apologies for this.</P>
    <P>Whatever one might think about the wisdom of companies entering into such commitments before obtaining the necessary funds for them, the Government, as I have said already, were not in the business of putting businesses out of operation, especially small businesses. These arrangements are transitional, not permanent: they expire on 31 August, they apply only to a limited number of <Col N="284" /> companies, and they apply only to companies which meet the relevant conditions. To qualify for BES funding, any subsequent projects will have to meet the conditions I outlined in the budget.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton also argued that the existence of asset-backed sectors in the BES meant that genuine risk projects were finding it difficult to raise funds.  I can readily agree with this view.  The justification for the BES is as a means of assisting the raising of genuine risk capital.  One of the key reasons I took the measures in the budget was to refocus the scheme on smaller, riskier ventures. Such ventures should have a much better chance of raising BES funds now that the more asset-backed sectors have been excluded.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one of the measures I announced on 12 March was very directly concerned with preserving the focus on risk: that is the prohibition on onlending of BES funds to subsidiaries.  This is now provided for in section 17 of the Bill. Onlending of funds was being used as a mechanism to shift risk away from the investor; this section aims to ensure that investors who obtain BES relief carry the risks of genuine equity participants in the investee company.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton asked whether the £500,000 BES limit should not be higher, and suggested a figure of £1 million.  I could not agree to this.  A higher figure would clearly add substantially to the cost to the Exchequer and the general taxpayer. Moreover, the figure provided for will ensure that the available investment funds are spread across as many projects as possible, rather than being concentrated on a few larger ones, as was the case.  I am satisfied that the £500,000 is perfectly adequate for the smaller, riskier ventures on which the scheme is being refocused; the vast bulk of BES companies in the past have raised less than this.  The BES was not intended to be a limitless source of funds, and there is nothing to stop a company raising other funds apart from the BES.  I would also point out to Senator Staunton that the higher the limit the more likely it is that asset-backing will again begin to divert <Col N="285" /> BES funds away from the riskier companies, about which he expressed particular concern.</P>
    <P>Senator Staunton criticised the increase in VAT from 10 to 12.5 per cent as being inflationary.  I repudiate this suggestion totally.  The VAT changes constituted a package aimed at bringing our system clear into line with EC requirements and this only partly funded the further reduction in the mainstream rate.  The benefits to consumers of the two percentage points reduction in the standard VAT rate far outweighs the low rate increase.  If the Senator looks at the whole picture he will see that the VAT package returns £37 million from the Exchequer to consumers.</P>
    <P>As for the effects of the VAT changes on tourism, again the Senator's views are misplaced.  First, I must point out that tourists will benefit from the standard rate reduction on many everyday commodities, including drink, petrol and gift purchases.  I have also held the 10 per cent rate for tourist accommodation and short term hire of cars, boats and caravans, pending further harmonisation discussions at EC levels.  However, in negotiations to date, there has been little or no support among other member states for my view that meals should also be low-rated after 1992, nor have there been any formal Commission proposal that this should be the case.  Accordingly, I began the process of adjusting the VAT rate on meals in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>Many references were made both here and in the Dáil to statements supposed to have been made by Commissioner Schrivener in relation to the particular aspect of meals but I can assure this House, as I did the other House, that no such proposal has emanated from the Commission and there is no sign of such a proposal.  This was a point that was made in representations to Senators and TDs from the hotel industry.</P>
    <P>The increase in the 10 per cent rate on fuels was consequent on emerging EC decisions.  This, too, should be seen in the context of a general reduction in VAT.  I would point out, moreover, that the less well-off sections of the community, those <Col N="286" /> dependent on long term social welfare, are in receipt of weekly free fuel allowances which, in designated smokeless areas, can be topped up by the weekly £3 smokeless fuel allowance.  In addition, I increased rates of welfare payments this year by more than the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to some of the points raised by Senator Staunton in relation to the Structural Funds.  As he has said, the whole country is classified as an Objective 1, or less-developed, region for Structural Funds purposes.  This is also the case for Greece and Portugal. This enables us to secure Community co-financing on a national basis for our structural development measures and to plan and implement our development proposals in a coherent and strategic manner to achieve the optimum results for the country as a whole and its sub-regions.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of parts of the country that they are at a disadvantage in securing investment as against what might be seen as more attractive locations within the country.  The development agencies attempt, with some degree of success, to ensure a balanced spread of new industrial investment to redress existing imbalances.  Ultimately, however, we cannot turn away a worthwhile investment if the investor insists on a location different from our first preference.</P>
    <P>The issue of access to markets is, of course, crucial to the economic development of the more peripheral and disadvantaged areas of the country.  It is for this reason that the operational programme for peripherality has the twin aim of improving access between Ireland and the rest of the Community and of improving access within the country to the main ports and airports.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave raised the question of price differences on both sides of the Border.  I would point out that the significant indirect tax reductions here in 1990 and 1991 along with the recent United Kingdom increases have narrowed price differences significantly and, consequently, the incentive to shop in Northern Ireland has been reduced very considerably.  The difference in the <Col N="287" /> respective standard rates of VAT has been narrowed to 3.5 percentage points from 10 percentage points at the start of 1990.  This change has had an impact across a wide range of consumer purchases such as electrical goods and toys.</P>
    <P>Price differences on excisable goods, which have given rise to cross-Border shopping in the past, have also been considerably reduced.  A gallon of premium petrol is now only for example, about 30p cheaper in Northern Ireland compared with a difference of about 60p in 1989. Furthermore, there is now little or no difference in the price of a standard bottle of whiskey and a packet of 20 cigarettes between the two parts of the island compared with differences of about £1 for spirits and about 25p for 20 cigarettes in favour of Northern Ireland in 1989.  Of course, Senators will appreciate that price differences could still persist for other reasons, for example, differences in distribution costs and in traders margins.</P>
    <P>I believe I have covered most of the points raised by Senators during the Second Stage debate.  Senator Norris asked specifically about the section 21 <Col N="288" /> relief that was introduced in 1985 providing for the cost of refurbishing a building containing two or more residential units.  Up to the last budget the qualifying expenditure could only be allowed for set-off against the rental income from the individual refurbished property and not against all rental income.  Since budget day it can now be applied against all rental income but only where the refurbished property is located in the designated areas.</P>
    <P>This is an added incentive to try and get people to live in the inner city.  We have no figures yet for the cost of the refurbishing allowance because it would be hidden in the cost figure for the entire section 23 purchase.  It was unlikely to be significant because most of the cost was incurred for the construction of the section 23 properties which bears out the Senator's view that it is likely it is an incentive that has not been used very widely as yet.  I will be glad to respond to specific questions during the course of Committee and Report Stages.</P>

    <P>NEW SECTIONS.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;If the Consumer Price Index for the month of December preceding the year of assessment for income tax is higher than it was for the previous December then, unless the Dáil otherwise determines, all income tax allowances, income tax bands and income tax exemption limits pertaining on the enactment of this Act, will be increased by the same percentage increase as the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index, and, if the result is not a multiple of £200, rounding it up to the nearest amount which is such a multiple.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to provide for statutory increases in income tax allowances, tax bands and exemption limits by reference to annual increases in the CPI unless the Dáil should determine otherwise.  The recommendation would, therefore, establish a principle of automatic entitlements to indexed increases unless the Dáil made other arrangements.  An amendment on these lines was also moved in the other House and it was put to me that this would be a means of being honest with taxpayers, that the value of their allowances would be maintained from year to year and that if any additional relief was being given in a year this would be transparent.</P>
      <P>However, as I indicated in reply to that amendment, I am not convinced of the arguments put forward in favour of indexation. I wonder if it is such a good thing why was it not implemented by previous Governments at a time when rates of inflation were in double figures it would have made a lot more sense?  Notwithstanding the fact that the indexation provision could in any particular year be overruled by the Dáil, indexation would greatly reduce budgetary flexibility and deprive the Minister for Finance of the day of an important discretion regarding budget decisions in any particular year and possibly conflict with intended future measures of the Government on other fronts.</P>
      <P>Annual indexation of allowances and exemption limits would imply a general view that they are all now at the correct level and that they all have equal claim to the resources that may become available in the future for income tax relief. However, in recent years there have been increases in exemption limits, for instance, far above the level of inflation and a child addition was introduced in 1989 which has also been substantially increased.  These measures which were specifically designed to help the low paid might not be feasible if all the reliefs had to be indexed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the Government have made a firm commitment to reduce the standard rate to 25 per cent and move to a single higher rate of tax over the next two years.  If budgetary circumstances permit, indexation might also give rise to unrealistic expectations to taxpayers at times of difficult budgetary circumstances and could itself be inflationary.  The level of income tax which is used to fund the annual budget is, of necessity, determined each year by reference to the budgetary circumstances prevailing at the time and in this context there could be problems <Col N="291" /> inherent in making decisions on the level of allowances for a particular year in advance of the annual budget.</P>
    <P>The implication in this recommendation may be that it would leave taxpayers better off than they fare under the non-indexation procedures that operate at present.  This, however, would not be the case.  For example, in the case of this year's budget if instead of what was done, the basic income tax structure consisting of the main personal allowances, the PAYE and PRSI allowances, exemption limits and the rate bands had been indexed for 1991-92 in line with an increase of 2.7 per cent in the CPI &mdash; that is the increase in the 12 months to November, 1990 &mdash; the cost to the Exchequer would have been £35 million in 1991 and £58 million in a full year. These costs are lower by £44.5 million in 1991 and £74.4 million in a full year than the cost of the budget concessions of £79.5 million in 1991 and £132.4 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, worth stressing for the benefit of the House that this year's performance was not just a flash in the pan. If we go back over the past few years a similar picture emerges.  For example, the cost of the budget concessions on tax rates, exemption limits, personal and PAYE allowances over the past four budgets was in the region of £500 million greater than would have been the case if the relief given in these budgets had been confined to indexation of tax rates, exemption limits, personal, PAYE and PRSI allowances on the lines suggested by this recommendation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, it is worth noting that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> proposed tax reliefs costing up to £400 million over the next three years, including the cost of concessions made under the budget of 1991.  The corresponding cost of indexation over the same period at an assumed average annual inflation rate of 3 per cent, for instance, is estimated at £190 million. These figures speak for themselves and in view of these and what I said earlier I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="292" /> Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 11, before section 1, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;1.&mdash;Payments in respect of fees paid to recognised third level colleges, together with payments made in respect of the maintenance of students attending recognised third level colleges will be allowed against income tax:</P>
      <P>Provided that no amount greater than the full amount allowed for maintenance under the Higher Education Grant Scheme to eligible applicants, will be allowable against income tax to any taxpayer.  No claim will be allowed in respect of any fee or portion of fee, or any maintenance grant or portion of maintenance grant, already paid by a Local Authority under the Higher Education Scheme.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The recommendation proposes that we insert a new section in relation to the allowance of payment in respect of fees against tax generally.  Last Friday evening, if my memory serves me right, during an Adjournment motion, which I shared with my colleague from Limerick, I made this point.  We will probably be told by the Minister that not everybody would be in a position to put college fees, maintenance and the general cost of keeping an adult dependant at college against their tax and those who do not have a taxable income would not benefit from the allowance we are asking for now and perhaps there is a question of equity here in terms of our treatment of all young people.  Given that all young people over 18 who are fully dependent on their parents as college students could be considered as adult dependants as per the income tax, social welfare and various other codes, there is reason to look at and accept what is proposed in recommendation No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> We have all talked, patronisingly perhaps but honestly, about a section in our community referred to as the new poor. These are the people who are marginally above eligibility levels for all kinds of State support and grants and yet are not middle income or higher income group people.  In many cases such families have a large number of children and yet find themselves just outside the eligibility level for full grants in respect of third level maintenance and fees.  Given the high level of income tax paid by this income group payments in relation to keeping an adult dependant at third level college, particularly when away from home and involving a high level of maintenance should be tax allowable which is what we are proposing.  I urge the Minister to allow these payments against income tax and we should look again at how we can ensure that access to third level is made equitable so that any young person &mdash; we cannot call them children when they are 17 or 18 doing their leaving certificate &mdash; who attains the academic qualifications necessary to attend any third level college is not precluded from doing so because of parent's income.</P>
    <P>Ideally, there should be free third level education for all those who qualify through the leaving certificate but that cannot be done overnight because of the cost implications.  However, let us at least start with a group and move towards equal access so that all children can have equal opportunity at all levels of the education system and particularly at third level.  The level of uptake of places at third level in counties such as Wexford is appalling because of the cost of maintenance as we have no third level institution in our county.  Travelling weekly to another county and staying there from Monday to Friday is prohibitively expensive even for many who qualify for third level grants because such grants cover only the bones of the cost, as any parent who puts a child through third level colleges, knows.  Without a reasonable income and not too many other children one cannot afford to clothe them, to buy books and give them a few pounds pocket money.  Notwithstanding the reasonable <Col N="294" /> point I suspect the Minister is going to make about being equitable in relation to all groups who wish to avail of third level education, and the Minister's belief that he is not in a position to extend it to everyone, that does not mean he should exclude a group he might be able to consider while we work on the remainder.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this recommendation. Our children are not born equal but a Government may provide equal opportunity so that each child can realise their individual potential and talents. With unemployment currently at around 20 per cent we must do everything possible to encourage full use of the education system by every young person able to avail of it academically and not exclude any because of the financial position of their parents.  I urge the Minister to accept this recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the recommendation as put forward but I would like to urge the Minister and the grant authorities to take net income into account when adjudicating on applications for third level grants because the present situation where gross income is the criterion is wrong and inequitable and should be revised in the interests of justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle's argues against such a proposal when she talks about equity.  The question of cost is relevant here.  Everybody says that the tax base is too narrow and should be broadened but here we have a recommendation that would, if accepted, narrow the tax base instead of broadening it.  No one would deny that the third level grant system is inequitable; its make-up and the conditions attaching to it need to be reviewed and the Minister for Education is currently engaged in such a review which is the way to proceed.  On the question of equity, it will be said that tax relief is being provided for people who can afford third level costs but what about the people who cannot?  While there are many arguments for and against the recommendation, those are the basic ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="295" /> The thrust of Government income tax policy is towards reducing the income tax rates; this recommendation would cost £20 million in a full year in addition to the reliefs that exist at the moment which are estimated at £183.9 million in a full year.  We all subscribe to the view that the third level system is excellent and that everybody, if possible, should have access to it but the taxpayer is already paying considerable contribution towards third level education.  Public funding represents about 75 per cent of the cost of certain degrees.  We are talking about trying to get to 66,000 students and the way to do this equitably is to review and revise the existing scheme.  It can indeed be grossly unfair to PAYE taxpayers who would find themselves £20 or £50 over the limits while a self-employed person or someone in a business could find ways of getting around those limits.</P>
    <P>The covenanting system exists at present for 5 per cent of income and the more income you have the more you can covenant.  It is a fairly costly tax relief, costing an annual £22,4 million.  Existing tax reliefs are considerable and this recommendation runs contrary to Government income tax policy objectives. Consequently, I reject it.  The review being carried out by the Minister for Education is the way to attack this inequitable system; narrowing the tax base is not the way to go about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister to consider the figure of £20 million he gave there in response to our points on this recommendation.  Surely it is hard to quantify this situation?  It is easy enough to calculate the tax take lost if this recommendation is accepted but how much might be saved if we had a system where more of our young people could fully realise their potential and end up in gainful employment in this country or, if not here, then properly qualified to take up gainful employment elsewhere.  It is difficult to take the cost of the recommendation and put it against what might be saved in terms of delinquency, broken marriages, alcoholism and other social <Col N="296" /> problems that arise from long term unemployment or even from under-employment. People who do not realise their potential are likely to become disgruntled with their lives and with their achievements, and their marriage or family life may suffer.  They may turn to drink or to some other crutch to prop up the consequences of the failure of the education system to realise the individual's potential. I accept there is a cost involved in accepting the recommendation but I put it to the Minister that in the long term we would save a fortune if we could generally allow people to realise their potential.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is the cost of third level education to the taxpayer but the system has been added to in an <i>ad hoc</i> way over the years and needs an overall review.  For young people leaving school this year their chances will not come back again and while we are trying to resolve the overall problem by reviewing the whole system a generation of children will have passed through the years during which they might have availed of third level.  Perhaps they will have missed that opportunity because their parents cannot afford to keep them away from home for two, three or four years, especially if they have three, four or five other children. Given our social situation, many parents have three or four children leaving school one year after the other; the cost of keeping three or four of them simultaneously at third level is prohibitive, so they are obliged to determine which of their children will be given the chance of a degree. If the parent cannot afford to give equal opportunity to each of their children the State must ensure that each child is given that equal opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding the Minister's response which I had anticipated in my original remarks on this recommendation as it has been made elsewhere, today's children cannot wait for the review.  The children of parents on social welfare who attain the necessary qualifications should have sufficient grants to allow them to go through third level colleges of their choice.  The next group of parents &mdash; low income PAYE earners &mdash; are the ones I refer to mostly in this regard.  We want <Col N="297" /> people to educate their children to minimise the chances of our dole queues growing in the future.  I urge the Minister to rethink this.</P>
    <P>There is perhaps potential for equity in what I am saying if we could provide those who are not earning with sufficient grants to see their children through school.  The low income and middle income PAYE sectors deserve to be allowed go give their children every educational opportunity so that they will not later become a burden on the State but will get sustainable jobs and not add to the dole queues, will be able to build their own houses rather than seek public housing, afford private medicine and so relieve the public medical service, and generally help themselves rather than be dependent on the State because the educational system may have failed them along the line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reiterate the point I made to the Minister in relation to the inequity of a break off point based on gross income.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, referred to some inequities regarding PAYE people versus self-employed people.  The introduction of a phased basis instead of an income figure beyond which no grants were made available would alleviate the situation somewhat.</P>
      <P>The PAYE sector who constitute the majority of Irish people are placed under serious pressure when families whose members qualify with the necessary points for a third level institution have no hope of taking up the place without taking out a second mortgage or taking on a second job.  Finance is the stumbling block and Senator Doyle referred to the &ldquo;new poor&rdquo;, those with reasonable incomes who may have been regarded in the past as being fairly well off but who have no hope of coping with this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parents aspire to give their children the best preparation for life they can afford.  It is heartbreaking for parents to see their children denied third level education for financial reasons.  I appeal <Col N="298" /> to the Minister to ensure a complete overhaul of this area involving his Department and other relevant Departments, including the Department of Education. This is an urgent matter; children doing their leaving certificate this year will be out of the system next year and the year after.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to refer to the point I made in my first contribution that these young people, generally over 18, are strictly speaking adult dependants and under the various codes of legislation we allow for expenses incurred in respect of adult dependants to be tax allowable and, on that basis, a case could be taken to prove the fact.</P>

      <P>The approach of the Government on this matter is the appropriate one; Senator Doyle is proposing a piecemeal attempt at reform.  Now that there is a realisation that the higher education grant system is not equitable, the Government have decided to review the matter and the Minister for Education is currently holding that review.  This is the way to approach the matter.  This amendment will not help the overall situation but may impede the process of review.  I compliment the Minister and the Minister for Education on the review.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle involved here is that I want to use the tax situation to address a problem the Government believe should be addressed first, from an equity point of view and secondly, from an expenditure point of view.  None of us need stand over a system where applicants for third level grants are examined inequitably and looking across the different sectors of society there is a certain amount of discrimination against the PAYE sector.  No matter what level it is pitched at somebody in the PAYE system will always say they are just that bit over or short of it.  The question is, do you use the tax system to address this type of problem or not, and we do not consider it appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing covenant procedures discriminate against the lower taxpayer <Col N="299" /> because if it is based on 5 per cent of income, then it helps the higher earner more than the low earner.  I will examine this issue between now and the next Finance Bill.  In relation to taking on board the total write off expenditure as suggested by Senator Doyle, I oppose it for the reasons I gave.  Senator Doyle posed another question in relation to income tax relief for dependants other than spouses and children under the exemption limits and dependent relatives who would be too old to avail of third level opportunities. The covenant gives tax relief in respect of children over 18 only but there is no income tax relief for dependants other than spouses.  Income tax relief for children has been eliminated from the income tax code since the mid-eighties.</P>

      <P>We have before us a Finance Bill with 132 sections and five Schedules and sections 1 to 53 and beyond deal with tax issues.  There still seems to be some confusion about what the Minister has and has not done in relation to tax reliefs.  I should like to ask him when tax <Col N="301" /> relief was introduced.  The Minister is being asked to abolish mortgage interest relief, tax relief on VHI and PRSI allowances. It suits some people to tell him what he has not done as Minister for Finance and what still needs to be done. Although we are dealing with section 1, as there are so many sections dealing with taxation, perhaps it might help us to get through the rest of the Bill if he would now comment on tax reliefs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The six percentage points off the standard rate from 35 to 29 started in 1989.  That was the first time in 20 years the standard rate was touched. The standard rate band has been expanded by 40 per cent and the top rate has been reduced from 58 to 52 per cent. In the area of the low paid taking a broad brush across the whole area, from single people to widowed people, there has been a 24 per cent increase in lowering the exemption limits for the low paid. For the first time in the 1989 budget I introduced the child allowance at £200 in 1989-90 and in 1990-91 it was increased to £300 and up to £500 for the third and fifth child.  There have been increases in the low paid area ranging from 24 to 71 per cent for the single and widowed to a married man with six children.  A married man with six children, for instance, can earn £9,400 and not pay tax at all and a married man with five children can earn <Col N="303" /> £8,900.  That is just a brief overview, without going into the exact detail, of what is taking place.  There have been substantial movements in that regard. We all recognise that much more needs to be done and much more will be done, as economic and budgetary circumstances permit.</P>
      <P>Another specific question is, what would happen if all the reliefs were abolished? I happen to hold the same view as Senator Doyle in some of the areas she talks about because some people and commentators suggest that all the relief should be abolished.  It is as well to know exactly what is involved when talking about abolishing the major reliefs in the system &mdash; mortgage interest relief, health insurance, VHI, life assurance, and the PRSI allowance.  Approximately £300 million will be available aprt from the £58 million saving on PRSI.</P>
      <P>Each 1 per cent in the current standard rate costs about £62 million and about £12½ million for the top rate.  The standard and top rates could, therefore, be cut to 25 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively, for about £300 million in a full year. Everybody has their own views on it, but the view being expressed strongly to me is that people want mortgage interest and VHI relief retained, and they do not want lower tax rates at the expense of those reliefs.</P>
      <P>Restrictions were imposed over the last couple of years in that area.  If we abolish all those reliefs, as some people seem to be advocating, we will get rates down to 25 per cent and 48 per cent, but we will not do anything in relation to bands.  That will merely reduce those rates and leave the bands as they are; the bands impinge very severely on certain points as too many people hit the top rate too soon. That is a reflection of the narrowness of the bands.  My approach and that of the Government has been to move along in reducing the rates.  As I said, we we have already expanded the standard rate band, the one which applies to most taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 17, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Section 39 of the Finance Act, 1986, is hereby amended by the substitution of the following subsection for subsections (2) and (3):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(2) Where, in the year 1991-92 or any subsequent year of assessment (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;the relevant year&rdquo;) the total income of an individual includes any relevant interest and, apart from section 35 (1) (b), the individual would be entitled to repayment of the whole or any part of the appropriate tax deducted from the relevant interest, then not withstanding section 35 (1) (b), the repayment to which the individual would be so entitled may be made to him on the making by him to the inspector, not <Col N="305" /> earlier than the end of the relevant year, of a claim in that behalf.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation proposes repayment of deposit interest retention tax to all persons who are otherwise exempt from tax. However, the intention, as expressed when a similar amendment was moved in the other House appears to provide for exemptions at source for those currently entitled to repayment.  When introduced in 1986 the DIRT was intended by the then Government to be non-refundable tax deduction.  However, to avoid undue hardship to the most deserving cases, the legislation, when enacted, made provision for the refund of tax deducted to certain categories of taxpayers.  Included are incapacitated persons and individuals who, or whose spouses, are aged 65 or over during the relevant tax year and who would otherwise not be liable to the full amount of DIRT deducted from their interest.  This covers at least some of the persons who would benefit under this recommendation.</P>
      <P>A point often overlooked when this general question is being discussed is that there are a number of saving options to which DIRT does not apply.  These include interest on Government securities, interest from credit unions and interest on bonus from the three small saver schemes operated by An Post, saving bonds, savings certificates and national instalment savings.  By switching to one or a combination of these it would be possible to eliminate the impact of retention tax on interest income.  This is something that should be seriously considered by persons who would not otherwise be liable for tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners introduced a series of measures to ensure that refunds of retention tax are made with the minimum of delay.  First, a simple special return was introduced in respect of refunds in 1986; secondly the commissioners conducted a successful advertising campaign in the press and on radio last year to draw attention to the circumstances in which an individual is entitled to a refund; and finally since 1990 <Col N="306" /> the Revenue Commissioners have been maintaining a computerised record of all taxpayers who qualify for a refund of DIRT so that those taxpayers will be issued automatically with a claim form in order to facilitate the following year's claim.  I understand that as a result of these measures, the procedures for refunds are working satisfactorily and that there are no undue delays in processing claims for such refunds, which is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I have considered exempting non-liable persons generally from deduction of DIRT at source but I have not done so for the simple reason that it would cost money, which I cannot afford, despite all the demands being made on the Exchequer.  Apart from the cost which is very difficult to estimate but which could be considerable, an exemption or refund for all non-liable taxpayers would absorb revenue resources on a large scale in administration, checking of claims and so on, thus diverting them from the primary function of tax collection.  Such a system would also leave scope for abuse by means of accounts splitting and the use by tax liable persons of bank accounts in the names of non-liable persons.  It was to prevent such abuses which were taking place on a wide scale that DIRT was introduced in 1986.  The position is kept under review, and this will continue to be the case.  I see no prospect of movement in this regard at least in the short term.  I, therefore, oppose the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I am sure everybody in the House will agree that the youth service is important and that those engaged in it are doing valuable work. Nevertheless, I am opposing the Senator's recommendation as the introduction of tax relief on gifts to the youth service could involve a significant cost.  It would also narrow the tax base again which we should be trying to maintain and widen; in addition it would be bound to generate claims for similar treatment from other organisations whose case might well be regarded as equally meritorious. The resultant cost would mean that considerable revenue would have to be found elsewhere.  Finally, I would point out that there is already substantial assistance to youth services in the form of direct expenditure and funding for a large number of organisations at national and local level is being provided in the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Education which, in 1991, will amount to £9.8 million.  In addition, £5.6 million is provided in 1991 for sports organisations where young people will be the principal beneficiaries.  In view of this, and for the other reasons I have outlined, I cannot accept the recommendation. <Col N="310" /> Recommendation, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

      <P>This recommendation seeks to rectify a situation whereby an investor in a new property might be denied capital allowances on that property by reason only that the property had been tenanted before this purchase by him.  As I pointed out in the other House, the position has already been rectified by section 23 of the Bill which ensures that the investor will be entitled to the allowances provided he purchases the building one year after its <Col N="311" /> first use by the tenant.  Senator Doyle's recommendation seeks to remove any time limit from the provision.  As I have already stated in the other House, I do not believe it is necessary.  The allowances are designed to encourage construction and should be made on or shortly after construction.  To allow them to be deferred without limit may leave room for manipulation.  The time limit will ensure that investors will be found within the period of one year, thus freeing the developer to undertake new projects. In the circumstances I do not agree with the Senator's recommendation.</P>

      <P>At the moment heating oils used by horticulturalists in the horticulture industry benefit from an excise duty reclaim scheme which ensures an effective rate of excise duty of only 2p per gallon.  The present section merely extends the concession to LPG thus ensuring equal treatment of both fuels in this area.  The concession to the horticulture industry sector estimated at £20,000 in a full year will rectify a longstanding anomaly by putting LPG on the same footing as oil used by the sector. No such anomaly exists in the poultry industry.  All heating oil and LPG bear excise duty at 17p per gallon.  It is estimated that oil and LPG account for about 20 per cent of production costs in the horticultural sector whereas LPG accounts for little more than 1 per cent of such costs in the poultry production industry.  Little oil is used by the sector. It could be difficult to confine an excise duty relief to LPG for the poultry industry. It would inevitably give rise to pressure for similar relief to be granted to other intensive animal production or processing operations and, in turn, open the door for those engaged in agriculture and industry generally to seek similar concessions for all generally as well as for LPG.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 86, subsection (1), between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new sub-paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(i) meals;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister referred to this issue in his constructive reply on Second Stage but he will be aware that it is a point of contention in this year's Finance Bill among an industry to which we are all looking to provide many of the answers to our unemployment crisis and to generally upgrade, if you like, the quality of the product.  I would like initially to hear the Minister's rationale as to why at this stage he feels he must include meals in the tourism industry, and in the hotel industry in particular, in relation to the increase of 2.5 per cent VAT that effectively will be imposed on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred &mdash; I am not actually quoting from his Second Stage speech, so I am subject to correction &mdash; to some misconception about the EC's views on this particular area; but much of the documentation we have all received from the industry, particularly the Irish <Col N="314" /> Hotels Federation, would appear to be quite specific on this.  Obviously, there are wires crossed somewhere and this needs clarification.  If the Minister is not in a position to accept my amendment, which I would hope he is, at least we would clear the position for all concerned.</P>
    <P>As far as the IHF are concerned, they feel that the Government's decision in the budget to increase VAT on meals does not square with proposals from the European Community which will apply at what they say will be reduced rate of VAT, the 4 to 9 per cent post-1992.  I do not know the source of that statement, but I am quoting from documentation I received from the Irish Hotels Federation. Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether it is a fact that post-1992 we are supposedly working towards a 4 to 9 per cent VAT rate on the tourism industry, including meals, which would be my interpretation of the present position of the Irish Hotels Federation.  Could the Minister clarify what appears to be a bit of confusion in this area?  He will recall that in the early eighties there was a lot of difficulty in relation to the cost of meals, the cost of eating out.  Quality is one thing, but cost is another issue on which we were all criticised.  My Government at the time responded by reducing VAT on meals and subsequently accommodation. There was a tremendous response.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's advisers shrink when they hear the expression &ldquo;self-financing tax cuts&rdquo;.  He is immediately landed on by everyone from every section of his Department saying there is no such thing: do not listen to it.  You could almost say that this was a self-financing tax cut in that the revenue from eating out and meals generally increased enormously when the overall cost decreased as a result of the reduction in VAT.  If Europe is moving towards a 4 to 9 per cent VAT band in this area I cannot understand the rationale for Ireland moving to 12.5 per cent for meals now if we are going to go back to the 4 to 9 per cent band in a couple of years.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals from the Commission before the Council of Ministers to leave food at 10 per cent, despite all the material that has been circulated by the hotels federation. There is no trace of the alleged statement by Commissioner Schrivener, which was supposed to have been made at a sub-committee of the European Parliament, and, as far as I know, they do not keep records of sub-committee meetings. There is no such statement.  Second, there are no proposals from the Commission in relation to keeping meals at a 10 per cent rate.  Third, while I sought on behalf of Ireland, as did my officials at the various meetings, for the application of the reduced rate on meals, we found ourselves very much in a minority.  The reduced rate should apply to accommodation only in the revised VAT structure of the Internal Market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase from 10 to 12.5 per cent introduced with effect from 1 March is consistent with the harmonisation of the VAT rates and structures required in the context of the completion of the EC Internal Market.  Indeed, we have been advised by business in general that we <Col N="316" /> should make the transitional moves within the VAT structures and not leave them all to the last moment so that there are very large increases imposed at the last moment for the realisation of the Single Market on 1 January 1993; and consequently we made this move.  The hotels federation say that the cost is only £4 million when in fact the total cost of the concession, if it were to be granted &mdash; that is, to go back from 12.5 per cent to 10 per cent &mdash; would be £15 million in a full year.  I think they are only costing the cost to the hotel industry itself and leaving out the wide range of restaurants and other areas where food is consumed.</P>
    <P>That is the position.  I want to clear it up, as I had to do in the other House. The decision we have taken in the budget squares up with the way the whole harmonisation of taxes movement is going ahead at EC level.  Such a statement, if it were made, has not been followed through by the Commission in proposing any reduced rate for meals.  Consequently, when I propose a reduced rate for meals I find myself in a minority. There are only a few member states who support the lower rate.  The vast majority of the countries support a much higher rate than 10 per cent; indeed, we will be very competitive.  For instance, in the UK the rate is 17.5 per cent and in France it is about 18.5 per cent.  We are talking about different rates across different boundaries.  I want to be assured that everybody is fully familiar with exactly what happened over there.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Minister that this lady Commissioner did make these comments.  She is quoted as having made them.  It is not wrapped up in the Community legislation but apparently it was a speech she made in which she put on the record her changed view &mdash; she took the view that services in hotels, including meals, should be at the lower rate.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to make is that at this point we are not bound by what has been enacted in Europe.  If the Minister had the political will to do so, he has the power and the authority to leave the rate at 10 per cent.  I do not know that the Minister can necessarily fall back on Europe and use Europe as the excuse.  He has the authority and the power to designate a 10 per cent rate should he choose to do so.  I am in Senator Doyle's camp on this because I live in the middle of a tourist region and I know what tourism means to this country and how we can destroy our tourist industry by overpricing services.  I know what has happened in some of the northern countries. In Sweden I know of restaurants closing because the Government put a penal taxation on food services.  There are extremely compelling reasons which have been stated by Senator Doyle.  It is counterproductive to put tax on certain types of services.  I would argue with her very strongly that this is a sector where it is counterproductive and I appeal to the Minister's generosity of spirit and his will to listen to a good argument and ask him to leave it at 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Senator does not have to convince me.  I know what I would like to do for our tourism industry.  He was not listening to what I was saying when I stated categorically that, if the Commissioner made the statement, would somebody please refer me to the record of where her statement is?  More important, there is a duty on the Commission and on the Commissioner to follow through with proposals in this <Col N="318" /> regard if those are her views.  I am not disagreeing with her views, but there is no proposal before the Council of Minister or before the officials.  There are no proposals for a reduced rate for meals.</P>
      <P>I might as well bring the Senators up to date about the position in relation to rates at Europan ministerial level.  First, we had the proposal for zero rates to be retained in whatever areas they are at the moment.  There is no facility available to increase the zero rate beyond the items that are covered by it at the moment.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the minimum rate of 5 per cent is now proposed and will be proposed probably next Monday at the EC Ministers meeting to substitute for the band of 4 to 9 per cent and that the next minimum rate could be in the region of 14 to 16 per cent &mdash; not 10 per cent or 12.5 per cent &mdash; as a new standard rate minimum.  Those are the directions in which the discussions are going.  There is no point in putting your head in the sand. I have pushed for the lower rate at EC level.  We have gone a long way from the bands we were talking about in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>You are not listening to what I am saying.  First, I said it is now proposed to replace the existing bands by a minimum rate of 5 per cent for a small category of items.  Beyond that, the next rate will be a standard rate with a minimum of probably 14, 15 or 16 per cent. There is no room for your 10 or 12.5 per cent at that level.  It will be argued at European level.  All statistics will show that the meals aspect of tourism represents only about 15 per cent.  To give an idea of where the rates stand, in case somebody thinks we are putting Ireland into a non-competitive situation, which we are not: the UK standard rate has now gone up to 17.5 per cent; in Denmark it is 22 per cent; in France it is 18.6 per cent; in Germany it is 14 per cent; in Luxembourg and Spain it is 12 per cent and is likely to increase to 14, 15 or 16 <Col N="319" /> per cent.  Those are the sort of rates emanating from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I quote specifically, having listened to the Minister's response to my colleague's reference to Madame Schrivener's views.  The document before me was circulated by the Irish Hotels Federation and perhaps the Minister and his advisers can source it more specifically than any of us.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Originally the Commissioner proposed that all hotel services would be included in the new standard rate of VAT, 14 to 20 per cent, in the Single European Market.  Mrs. Schrivener, the EC Commissioner on Taxation, announced on 26 February 1991 that she now favours &mdash; that word word &ldquo;now&rdquo; implies that she has changed her mind &mdash; the application of the reduced rate of VAT of 4 to 9 per cent for tourism including all hotel services.</P>
      <P>Taking together what the Minister says is the latest view on what those VAT bands will actually be, I think I understand him correctly that there will be no 4 to 9 per cent band as of now.  Those of us left in the House now come from counties that are vitally dependent on tourism.  If we did not have hotels such as Kelly's, the Talbot, White's and Horetown House in Wexford, along with our beleaguered agricultural industry, we would have nothing to look foward to.  I have always found the Irish Hotels Federation to source and research their information extremely well, so I would listen to them. Some of the representations we get on Bills should be taken with a grain of salt but over the years I have found the IHF to be very reputable and quite reasonable even in the fact of adversity and quite understanding of the whole legislative process or the overall Exchequer difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given all of that and all the confusion that exists, I would like the Minister to consider the view of the Institute of Taxation &mdash; it is not my view even though I happen to support it.  Their view is that the development of tourism is the stated <Col N="320" /> aim of the Government's economic policy.  We all support that.  They say that the imposition of VAT on certain income of hotels, guesthouses or holiday homes where no input credit whatsoever has been obtained for fixed assets is totally inequitable.  They say that any further imposition of VAT is most inequitable.  I would like the Minister's view on that. The document goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The prices chargeable by these establishments, hotels, restaurants, holiday homes, etc. have been set for the tourism year 1991 in agreement with Bord Fáilte and published in the various brochures.  These prices cannot be altered to take account of the additional VAT now proposed to be charged from the start of the tax year.</P>
    <P>The tourist year is different to the tax year.  Whatever about proposing that as and from 1992 onwards this is what we want, to bring it in in the middle of a tourist year, when the brochures have been issued, when the holidays have already been sold on the basis of price and VAT criteria at the time, is a little disingenuous.  I do not mean that to be derogatory.  It is just a major problem for our tourism industry and I would like the Minister's response.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Taxation are strongly recommending two things.  First, the postponement of the change in VAT until 1992 &mdash; I presume that means post-1992 or the 1992-93 tax year &mdash; and, secondly, that there be an allowance for an input credit for all VAT incurred on the construction and equipment of hotels, guesthouses or holiday homes against the liability arising on the income in due course.  I think that is a very fair point. I will await with interest the Minister's response to that in the overall context of the increase in VAT on meals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I would like to tell the Senators that two ECOFIN meetings have taken place since that statement was made, and many other meetings behind the scenes, and there is no sign of any new proposals emanating from the Commission or Madame <Col N="321" /> Schrivener's office in relation to changing her mind or a new proposal in relation to the question of meals.  I would not want people to think that we are willy-nilly going along increasing VAT rates in relation to tourism.  It appears that agreement will be reached for a 10 per cent rate to continue or a lower rate to continue to apply to accommodation and to the hire of boats and cars which are a major component of the tourism industry.  The biggest input credit of all into the supply of meals is the food itself.  That is zero rated and will continue to be zero rated.</P>
      <P>I met the Irish Hotels Federation &mdash; I know it was for a very short period of time on the Friday before the Finance Bill started &mdash; to point out to them exactly what I am pointing out here in relation to the position and the development and where we saw it going at European level. That was the first time they had heard that anybody was questioning the supposedly new proposal from Madame Schrivener's office, because I said I had not seen it.  We are having another meeting next Monday and I am not ruling out that we will see it; but, so far, with two meetings gone by I have not seen any new proposal from the Commission in relation to it.</P>
      <P>In general terms we in Government recognise the important role the whole tourism sector is playing and will continue to play; the development that is vitally important as a major contributor to overall economic activity and, of course, the provision of jobs, which is so badly needed.  The tourism industry can be assured that we will look after their interests in so far as is humanly possible at EC level.  These are not my proposals. I fought for a lower rate for meals and got very little support.  I will continue to look after the tourism industry's interests as best as they can be looked after within the whole harmonisation process.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the Minister and it would appear that he justifies the 2.5 per cent increase on meals on the basis of what is expected from Europe or what is coming from Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Given the obvious degree of confusion, I urge him to accept my recommendation and to postpone any increase on meals until the matter is clarified because of the Government policy in relation to tourism &mdash; a policy we all support &mdash; and because of the importance of the tourism sector to every county &mdash; not only my county of Wexford, but every county.  All I am asking for is a breathing space, because once it is brought in, if it is clarified next month, the Minister is not going to come back here with an amendment to the Finance Bill to lop off the 2.5 per cent. There is confusion there.  All I am asking the Minister for is breathing space because once it is brought in, and if it is clarified next month, the Minister will not come back here with an amendment to the Finance Bill to take 2.5 per cent off meals.  We are well into the year and the holiday brochures and price lists have been published.  They cannot be changed. We are not sure what Europe wants.  Will the Minister please accept my recommendation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I stop at this point because I would like the benefit of the Minister's wisdom and expertise on the perceived problems in this Part IV, and the sections particularly.  There are problems very well outlined by the Institute of Taxation who feel that this section and, indeed, the other sections, will frustrate the manner generally in which business will be done by the imposition of a stamp duty as a compulsory tax which they feel is inappropriate.  They also feel that no appeal to an appeal commissioner or Circuit Court judge is inequitable comparing it to other determinations in these lines such as the Revenue Commissioners, etc., and that it is unacceptable that documents executed prior to the passing of the Bill could be in any circumstances be compulsorily dutiable.</P>
      <P>They also feel that the scope of stamp duty is unclear and needs elaboration and clarification in regard to the Stamp Act and interpretations of it and that a professional adviser acting in good faith could be deemed to be negligent and exposed to penalties under these sections given the changes the Minister is making in relation to stamp duties.  Generally, I feel for the record and the completion of the record in the Seanad, we need the Minister's view on these various sections and on Part IV with, if I interpret the institute's views correctly, the exception of a single section.  They feel one section is acceptable but all the other ten or 12 sections we are speaking to are deemed unacceptable.  I would appreciate the Minister's clarification on the problems, be they perceived or real of the Institute of Taxation in relation to Part IV.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds) Albert Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. A. Reynolds)</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what the <Col N="327" /> Institute of Taxation prior to the amendments being published.  To put on the record for the benefit of the Seanad, this section re-enacts section 15 of the Stamp Act, 1891 in the form which makes it more relevant to today's current taxation practice.  Little has happened with stamp duty since 1891.  There have been some changes but not many.</P>
      <P>The section is the primary provision concerning penalties for the late payment of stamp duties and the late delivery of instruments for stamping.  The existing section 15 of the 1891 Act has two kinds of penalties.  First, it provides an interest penalty of 5 per cent per annum for the late payment of duty.  This interest is intended to compensate the Exchequer for the cost associated with the late receipt of the tax.  It has not been increased since 1891 and is clearly insufficient given the present level of interest rates.  It is now proposed to increase the interest rate from 5 per cent per annum to 1.25 per cent per month or part of a month.  This is the rate applying to late payments for most other taxes.</P>
      <P>The second penalty provided by the 1891 Act is to double the duty payable where an instrument is not stamped within 30 days of execution.  This penalty applies to instruments which account for most of the stamp duty yield.  In the early years of this century this provision fell into disuse probably because of its severity. The intention behind this section in the Bill is to bring back into practical application the use of a penalty for late presentation of documents.  This is a very useful role to play in creating a proper compliance climate.  Similar penalties and surcharges are imposed under other taxes for late delivery or non-delivery of returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In stamp duty the instrument to be stamped is effectively the return for tax purposes.  Accordingly, it is proposed to preserve this separate penalty while scaling down its severity.  Where an instrument is stamped later than 30 days, but no later than six months after it is first executed, a penalty of 10 per cent of the duty payable would be imposed in <Col N="328" /> addition to any interest charges.  Where an instrument is stamped between six and 12 months late the penalty would be 20 per cent of duty payable.  An instrument stamped 12 months or more after execution would attract a penalty of 30 per cent of the duty payable.  It will be the practice of the Revenue Commissioners, if this provision becomes law, to impose it where instruments are presented late for stamping.  Inevitably, there will be taxpayers or their agents who will, though acting in good faith, find that the penalty applies to them.  The Revenue Commissioners have a discretion in such cases, depending on the particular circumstances, to mitigate the penalty.  Section 100 shall come into operation with effect as and from 1 November 1991 and will apply to any instrument, whenever executed, which is unstamped or insufficiently stamped.  I want to make it clear to the Seanad, as I did in the other House, that there is no question whatever of any retrospection applying in this situation.</P>
    <P>On the question raised by the Senator in relation to the appeals system, appeals in relation to stamp duty arise in two circumstances, first, where valuations of property or non-quoted shares are disputed and, secondly, where the point at issue is one arising from conflicting interpretations of stamp duty law.  In the vast majority of cases, where valuation of properties submitted to the Revenue Commissioners for stamp duty purposes is not acceptable to them, the matter is resolved through the intervention of the Valuation Office.  If, however, a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the value placed on the property by the Valuation Office, then he or she is entitled to bring his or her case before the Land Values Reference Committee, which will appoint an arbitrator to decide the issue.</P>
    <P>Further stages of appeal to the Circuit Court and the High Court are also provided for.  In instances where the valuation of non-quoted shares is disputed, the taxpayer may present his case to the appeals commissioners.  Again, in this case further appeals may be directed to the Circuit Court and the High Court. <Col N="329" /> Disputes relating to matters of law like those relating to questions of valuation are normally resolved without recourse to appeal.  In the event, however, of failure to resolve the matter to the taxpayer's satisfaction a right of appeal directly to the High Court is provided for.</P>
    <P>The stamp duty appeals procedures have worked well in the past and have provided a satisfactory and practical way of resolving disputes between taxpayers and the Revenue Commissioners.  I would also stress that an overwhelming majority of the stamp duty assessments which are made do not result in the appeals procedures being used.  There is nothing in the proposed new stamp duty legislation which would make the existing appeals procedures any less effective or which would necessitate the introduction at this time of additional safeguards to the many which already exist in this area. However, if it should emerge in the future that the absence of an appeal to the appeals commissioners on a point of law is creating a serious problem for taxpayers I will certainly review the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 101, before section 114, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;114.&mdash;Where a discretionary trust on which tax has been paid at the appropriate annual rate is broken up, an allowance shall be made in respect of such payments of tax as aforesaid in the assessment of capital acquisitions tax due on such breaking-up.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This refers to amendment of section 19 of the Principal Act, the value of agricultural property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Three per cent and <Col N="330" /> 1 per cent discretionary trust taxes were introduced in 1984 and 1986 respectively. The taxes are directed at those trusts which are set up essentially to avoid or indefinitely to delay payment of capital acquisitions tax.  The main purpose of the tax is to compensate the Exchequer for such delay.  If the annual 1 per cent charge is allowed as a credit against the capital acquisitions tax charged on the breaking up of these trusts then such compensation will be entirely negatived.  Furthermore, the tax would no longer be a disincentive to taxpayers to set up such trusts, which are mainly avoidance vehicles.  On the question of the actual yield to the Exchequer, as some discretionary trust may be in existence for many years, the total of annual payments could, if credited against the capital acquisitions tax on a break up, entirely wipe out that capital acquisitions tax.  Accordingly, I must oppose the recommendation.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 102, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The provisions of this section apply to gifts as they apply to inheritances.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I want to extend the provisions of the section to apply to gifts as they are deemed to apply to inheritances here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>This recommendation would have consequences far beyond those intended by section 116. The section is basically a recognition of the tragedy which occurs and the hardship which may be caused by the unexpected death of a child which results in property passing on to a parent absolutely. Senator Doyle mentioned that <Col N="331" /> point when she introduced a recommendation during the debate on the Finance Bill in 1990 and I undertook then to consider the position sympathetically in the context of the Bill.</P>
      <P>This was a case that arose in Carlow-Kilkenny and is one of the examples where the father had transferred all his property to his only son and all their appropriate taxes were paid when the son was killed in an accident.  Consequently their property had to revert again and full taxation would apply.  It is to look after that type of situation, and indeed others, that I have backdated the provision to 1982.  There were a small number of cases around and we took the opportunity to negative the taxing positions.</P>
      <P>This section does not apply to gifts for reasons mentioned above and also because this would facilitate tax avoidance. It would be easy for a person wishing to benefit his brother, for example, to make a gift to his father availing of the Class A threshold, who would then make another gift to the intended brother, Class A threshold again, whereas a Class B threshold between brothers is, of course, much lower.  Class thresholds are increased each year since 1990 in accordance with the CPI.  Class A and Class B thresholds for 1991 are £161,400 and £21,520 respectively.  Senators will recall that last year I introduced CPI indexation on to the thresholds to keep them moving up in accordance with the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As an aside, I must gently chide the Minister on his assumption that it is always between brothers that property may be passed and the daughters shall neither inherit nor have the benefit of passing it to one another.  However, that is an aside.  I understood quite clearly the thrust of what he is saying.  I have in mind the case of a son who inherited the entire farm from his parents.  He has been seriously injured in a car accident, and totally incapacitated.  Effectively, he will need institutional, round-the-clock care for the rest of his life.  I wonder if we could extend the welcome provisions under the inheritance situation to this case.  I thank <Col N="332" /> the Minister for following through on his promise last year to consider this matter for the possible handful of such cases in a year the provisions of this clause could make or break families.  In a case where the son or daughter are no longer physically or mentally capable of running the farm, business or whatever, through illness or accident could we consider how in such cases the farm or whatever might revert to the parents?</P>
      <P>If the principle is accepted that the property can be handed back to parents on the death of a daughter or son, it could be extended to cases of severe incapacitation where the independent existence of the son or daughter is no longer viable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. A. Reynolds Mr. A. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Reynolds</NameTxt>

That word, as far as the Seanad is concerned, gives me the shivers.  I thank Senator Doyle for her co-operation and warmly thank Minister Reynolds. Senator Doyle referred to the fact that the Minister took the whole Bill; he takes all his Bills through the Seanad himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The subject for the Adjournment today is a proposed interpretative centre in the Burren.  I would like to state that this is spelled &ldquo;interpretative&rdquo; and perhaps this could be made clear to the people who manufacture signs using the obnoxious Americanism &ldquo;interpretive&rdquo; which is not English but Anglo-American.  It would be good if we indicated our separation from the American continent in this particular matter of an abuse of language. However, that is a minor point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned here about the Burren. I know the Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Vincent Brady, are sensitive to this area.  I have read Deputy Brady's speech in which he talks about the beauties of the Burren, an internationally celebrated area.  It is one of the unique resources this country <Col N="335" /> provides but a very delicate one and is a highly unusual landscape.  It contains very unusual and specialised fauna, particularly a range of alpine plants; I gather there are also pine martens and other rare animals in the area.  The ecological balance is extremely delicate and it is now proposed to build an interpretative centre in Mullaghmore, one of the most remote inaccessible wilderness areas of this already strange and remote landscape.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the impact of this proposal upon the Burren generally. I would like to address one of the analogies drawn by the Minister in his speech, between the Burren and Glenveagh.  I know Glenveagh, and have been in Glenveagh Castle giving a performance of the works of James Joyce.  It is a very beautiful place and a credit to the country but it is a castle so there is already a massive intrusion into the natural landscape. Glenveagh has a well-constructed interpretative centre designed for concealment and to fit in with the landscape but as I pointed out to the Minister members of the public are prohibited from entering the wilderness area.  For those reasons it is not appropriate to compare what is proposed for Mullaghmore with the result of a century's development at Glenveagh.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if any environmental impact assessment has been contemplated for this proposal; in my original formulation I suggested such a study was required under European Community regulations.  Since then I have thought more about it and I realise that just as local councils can derogate from their own development plans and from planning considerations without much difficulty, so Governments can derogate from the requirement to carry out an environmental impact assessment study if they so wish.  I ask the Minister if we are so derogating and are not proposing to do an environmental impact study. Considering the fact that we have had in this House a very lengthy debate on the establishment of the Environmental Protection Agency during which we spent some considerable time dealing with the <Col N="336" /> question of environmental impact assessment studies and so on, it would be inappropriate and a bad lead if we decide in this highly sensitive and unique area not to conduct an environmental impact assessment.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister consulted with any of the appropriate State agencies, for example, the natural history section of the National Museum, the botanical departments of the various universities or indeed our own National Botanic Gardens? I am not aware that any of these agencies have been consulted by the Minister and they would contain an appropriate level of expertise.  I would like some reassurance that any of these groups or indeed Eolas, the State scientific body, have been consulted about the potential impact of establishing such a facility in Mullaghmore.</P>
    <P>On a slightly more popular note, I would like to indicate to the Minister that there is considerable unease among local people about the establishment of this facility.  There may well be division where people in the immediate area who see some personal or business advantage may be gulled or misled into believing there will be a short term economic advantage to them from the throughout of a considerable number of tourists but the general feeling in the area is against it.  I would like to quote from an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 April 1991 where the local parish priest, the Rev. John O'Donoghue, curate at Carron, said:</P>
    <P>It is like a spiritual landscape and nobody should allow its wilderness character to be damaged.  It is in the middle of nowhere and that is one of its attractions.  It really would be best of leave it alone.  People forget that the Burren comprises a whole series of different areas each with its own unique identity.  If there is going to be development it should be done in an integrated manner enhancing the particular qualities of each area and bringing them together in a holistic way.</P>
    <P>There is a general concern that this centre is being established because European Community money is available and <Col N="337" /> because of a rush on the part of Departments to use up what is seen as available money in Europe.  I would like to quote from Ms Martina O'Dea of the Burren Action Group, also quoted in this article, who maintains that she is not against the development of interpretative centres nor does she wish areas of natural beauty to be excluded from enjoyment by a majority of people if they so wish but that the wrong site has been chosen.  It is a spectacularly ill-chosen location.  This is what she said:</P>
    <P>It might not be too bad if it was on the periphery but it is unthinkable that this should be done to a place like Mullaghmore.  The Burren is a very small area and very sensitive.  It would not take long to destroy it.  The road into Mullaghmore is narrow and they are planning to widen it.  Then coaches will bring thousands and thousands of people who would never dream of going to Mullaghmore unless they were brought in on a tour bus.  When that happens the people who really want to go to a place like this will stay away.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister along those lines. Here is an ordinary person, resident in the area, the head of an action group, committed to protecting this resort, saying, &ldquo;If this centre is developed we are going to have a mass of people coming in.&rdquo;  The Minister, Deputy Brady, indicated in his speech that he anticipates 50,000 to 60,000 visitors to this centre, annually.  Can you imagine the impact of the sudden influx of 50,000 to 60,000 people into a wilderness area?  That would remove its wilderness character fairly comprehensively.  The site is unsuitable because the area is one of our most spectacular and important resources and the Burren is also a very sensitive area.</P>
    <P>Anybody who knows anything about the sensitive balance of plant life in this area will realise that once disturbed it is extremely difficult to reverse any negative changes that occur in the ecology of an area like that.  There is no doubt in my mind that a sudden influx of 50,000 to 60,000 tourists each summer would destroy the peace and tranquility there <Col N="338" /> and the natural habitat of many plants there.  I accept that no plant or animal species is immediately and directly threatened, although it also has to be said that one cannot say definitively that none of them would ever be placed under a real threat because a number of the rarer plant species do occur around the Lough Gaelain-Mullaghmore area.</P>
    <P>In order to develop tourist facilities an interpretative centre is not sufficient; an infrastructure of reasonable roads must also be provided.  The development of this road system will also seriously disturb the immediate area and particularly the plant life.  The existing roads are not suitable for coaches and consist in many places of a one-vehicle track.  The visitors' centre will consume further land resources by the requirement for visitors' car parking.  Paths will be created throughout the area in order to display it to the public and will bring about substantial degrading of the wilderness aspect of the Burren.</P>
    <P>Another practical situation could be the most immediately damaging.  I almost blush to raise it in this august Chamber. Human beings as well as pine martens are animals and 50,000 to 60,000 visitors will require lavatory facilities so there is going to be a problem with sewage, a most effective and potent pollutant.  I do not see any provisions made to deal with the pollution effect of sewage in this area, and that is only for polite people.  When coachloads of people come into an area, particularly if they are on a jaunt and have had a few scoops of beer, they are not going to go into the interpretative centre to conform to the necessities of nature.  I am afraid some of the unfortunate little plants might receive unexpected doses of human waste.  My information is that any inflow of sewerage into the Mullaghmore area, given its sensitive ecological balance, could have a potentially disastrous effect upon the ecology of the area.</P>
    <P>It has also been put to me that there are already many interpretative centres in this area which one would imagine would be sufficient for even the most <Col N="339" /> ardent botanical tourist.  I am not convinced that there are 50,000 to 60,000 people in this country with a specialised interest in botanical inquiry.  Therefore, I think we are talking about general tourists and we have to be careful about introducing a huge number of general tourists who may not have the required sensitivity for this area.  We have all been made uncomfortable by educated people picking wild flowers while out for a ramble in the countryside and so on.  There have been diminishing quantities or primroses and cowslips, although I am glad to say that this year has been a good year for cowslips, as the Minister no doubt has noticed.  If in an area of very rare plants a considerable number of non-specialist tourists were introduced they would undoubtedly harvest some of these items.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline some of the existing facilities: Kilfenora, the Burren Centre, Ailwee Cave, the Cliffs of Mother and further proposed centres at Polanionáin Cave at Fanore, Bell Harbour, Corcomroe and now at Mullaghmore. One has to ask if there is not an element of over-kill here?  Are there not already sufficient interpretative centres, particularly when we are dealing with a very sensitive area?  I would like to urge the Office of Public Works to look at the accommodation at one of the other centres, such as the Ailwee Caves-the prime sites are at Kilfenora &mdash; to upgrade the facilities there as a joint venture rather than building another facility even with what I have acknowledged is the very considerable skill and capacity of the Office of Public Works.  I do not want anything I say in this debate to be interpreted as an attack on the Office of Public Works.  I am indicating strong hesitation in this matter.  I do not think there has been proper consultation. There has not been an environmental&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a series of mixed <Col N="340" /> motives here.  I applaud what the Office of Public Works do in many respects and it would be wrong to be hypercritical of them.  What they have done in Glenveagh is very good and sensitive but Glenveagh is a different environment and I do not believe that the Office of Public Works are experts in the area of botanic ecology. I doubt if even you with all your plámás would be able to convince me that they are.  For that reason it is regrettable that they appear not to have taken into consideration the best professional advice.</P>
      <P>Since I am being challenged on this I have placed on the record my appreciation of what the Office of Public Works have done but there are areas in which they could be a little more sensitive.  For example, in one of their recently acquired annexes &mdash; the wildlife services, from forestry, &mdash; they have not displayed the greatest sensitivity, even in the Burren area.  The new gateway and the very public notice to Slieve Carren is a fairly good example of this, it really sticks out like a sore thumb.  Although the notice itself may be beautiful, exquisitely fashioned, no doubt, a high example of art, at the same time it is inappropriate in the context because we are not talking here about the question of context.</P>
      <P>We are not objecting to a national park in the Burren.  However, it is dangerous to introduce such a disproportionate number of people into the area; it is quite possible that damage will result because of this massive introduction.  The physical site works involved in creating such an interpretative centre will unquestionably disturb the balance and I do not believe that the experts in the area have been consulted as fully as one would wish.</P>
      <P>I know that there is at least a public posture of concern in this area and I would like to quote from Minister Brady's speech at the launch of the Burren National Park in Lisdoonvarna on 22 April 1991 where he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works will be obliged to meet the international criteria governing National parks where a sizeable area of scientific and scenic <Col N="341" /> significance is set aside to minimise impact from man and to which the general public can be invited to appreciate its beauty in a way that will not harm the park.</P>
    <P>I believe that in saying that, the Minister of State was quite correct.  He had the right idea but I am not convinced that he has met those conditions.  I would like the Minister to assure me that those criteria will be met.  The Minister, Deputy Brady, quoted Dr. Hillery as saying that the opening of national parks were very special events and that he would be in similar awe of the striking beauty of the unique Burren landscape which makes it a worthy candidate for the internationally accepted title &ldquo;national park&rdquo; and that we are, indeed, fortunate in having inherited in our environment so much of such great worth.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of the sensitivity of the natural phenomena in such an area it could be disastrous to publicise and to over-popularise an area like the Burren.  The Minister will know from reading travel sections in the Sunday newspapers how very often somebody discovers a little area of Ireland, say in west Clare, west Cork, Kerry or Donegal, and is almost hesitant to mention it in a newspaper in case the very qualities for which it is cherished are destroyed by the publicity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary) Sean Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. Calleary)</NameTxt>
      <P>Without in any way trying to hurt Senator Norris what I have heard today is something I have heard from many people; it seems to articulate a point of view at odds with those of us who live in the west, a point of view that would appear, and I emphasise appear, to say that it is all right to maintain a wilderness.  However, they sometimes forget about the people who have to live and try to make a living there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of these centres is being set up in an area where the population has dropped drastically in the last 25 to 30 years. We believe &mdash; and the people of the area believe &mdash; that it is the kiss of life, not the kiss of death, as Senator Norris seems <Col N="342" /> to imply, for that area.  It is just as sensitive and as beautiful and has many more natural amenities than the Burren and we would not like to see them destroyed. That is a personal opinion.</P>
    <P>There are two primary objectives of a national park.  The first is the conservation of the designated land and the second involves public access and appreciation, a point which Senator Norris made, of the park.  In providing interpretative centres for national parks, the Office of Public Works have been careful to site such facilities where the dual mandate of park conservation and of public access can be achieved.  In the most recent example of Glenveagh, County Donegal, which was referred to by Senator Norris, the interpretative centre not only stimulated the entire tourist economy of the region but also provided a carefully sited focal point for visitors on the periphery of the park which did not undermine the park's wilderness qualities.  It has admirably met the dual mandate of park conservation and public access and the local community are fully supportive of the concept.</P>
    <P>The striking beauty of the unique Burren landscape which was referred to by Senator Norris, with its wealth of botanical treasures, makes it a very worthy candidate for the internationally accepted title of national park.  Changes in farm practices in the early seventies, which saw accelerating land reclamation in the Burren, pointed to a need to establish a national park to protect a representative sample of the Burren in perpetuity.  The area chosen for the park was centred on Mullaghmore at the transition of the Burren hills and the limestone lowlands.  At present over 1,300 hectares have been acquired which are more than sufficient to meet the minimum international criteria for an international park.</P>
    <P>In considering the location of the Burren national park interpretative centre, the Office of Public Works assessed the criteria for site selection for the centre.  They believed that it was pointless trying to provide appreciation of the <Col N="343" /> park away from and out of slight of the very landscape that had been set aside for the people and so they rejected the option of a centre in a built-up area.  On the other hand, they saw the need to avoid locating the centre in the heart of the park and therefore, sought to place it on the periphery.  The result of their examination of the options led them to a site approximately five miles from Kilnaboy where disused quarries and a reclaimed field could hide vehicles and accommodate the building, where there are sufficient circular walks in the vicinity of the centre to accommodate the vast majority of the visitors.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, I wonder whether there will be 50,000 tourists but, as someone from the west, I would love to see it, as spectacular views of Mullaghmore could be enjoyed.  Access could be gained from the stretch of road which would require minor improvements &mdash; I stress minor improvements &mdash; without interfering with its essential character and which would not result in the upgrading of its present status.  The brief for the building itself requires that its visual impact be kept to a minimum and that services &mdash; this was specifically mentioned by Senator Norris &mdash; such as sewage treatment, be designed to the highest standards in order not to damage the fragile ecology of the area.  The building will contain the basic visitors' facilities, such as tea rooms and toilets, but the bulk of the space will be given over to exhibits, an audio-visual theatre and a natural study area so that visitors' appreciation of this unique area can be deep.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Senator Norris said there is widespread community support for the project.  Indeed, community groups such as the Kilfenora Display Centre see the benefits of co-operating with the park centre and discussions have taken place between them and the Office of Public Works to formalise such co-operation and to liaise on interpretative teams.  At a recent public meeting in Corofin, attended by 600 people, only nine of those present opposed the location of the proposed centre.  The IFA <Col N="344" /> in Clare have also written to Brussels in support of the project.</P>
    <P>The project was formally announced in 1989 and it is only this year, at the work drawing stage, that some conservationists opposed the project and called for an environmental impact statement.  Given that the scheme does not require an environmental impact statement under the relevant EC regulations, that the project has the approval of the planning authority and enjoys the support of the local community and their elected representatives and that it has been designed to the highest standards, the economic benefit to the community will not be delayed because of the opposition of a small number of well-meaning but, I believe, misguided preservationists.  I will, therefore, not authorise an EIS in this instance.</P>
    <P>I honestly cannot understand those critics who decry the Government's initiative in availing of the EC structural funding for conservation projects which in 1993 will provide sustainable economic benefits to rural communities at a time when emigration and unemployment are at such high levels and which will actually prove to be a benefit to the whole area.</P>

      <P>It is traditional to thank the Minister and I certainly do so because he gave a wonderful performance in acting out Minister Brady's speech, which he followed very closely.  I very much regret the environmental impact assessment is being avoided.  That is disgraceful. The Minister also substantially failed to satisfy me that any of the experts were contacted.  He did not mention any one of them; he just spoke about the economic advantage.  All I would say is that it is short term advantage and I regret&mdash;&mdash;</P>
