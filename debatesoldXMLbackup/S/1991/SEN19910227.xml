      <P>I have notice from Senator Mary Jackman that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Social Welfare to allocate part of the £500,000 provided in the 1991 budget for Women's Aid to the women's refuges, particularly Adapt House, in Limerick city.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Seantor Michael Howard of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health to take immediate action to alleviate the severe overcrowding of patients in Ennis General Hospital because of acute shortage of beds.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The urgent need for a paediatric unit at Wexford General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Neville of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education to ensure the continuation after 1995 of the post-primary school at <Col N="1614" /> Mount Trenchard, Foynes, County Limerick.</P>
    <P>Tá fógra agam ón Seanadóir Pól Ó Foighil:</P>
    <P>Chun a fhiafraí den Aire Comhshaoil an mbeadh sé sásta leasú caoi a chur i gcrích len a chinntiú nach bhféadfaí cearta vótála a bhaint go héagórach de shaoránach cáilithe i bhfianaise a tharla i gceantar Charna i mbliana nuair a baineadh breis is 200 ainm de liosta na gClár Toghthóirí go mídhleathach.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Shane Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine to hold a public inquiry into any proposed infill and housing development at West Pier, Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator David Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to immediately make available the £50,000 grant already sanctioned by Dublin Corporation for the rebuilding of the Hirschfeld Centre.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Jackman, Howard, Doyle, Neville, Ó Foighil and Ross as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Jackman's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Howard, Doyle, Neville, Ó Foighil and Ross may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Norris as not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of repetition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is Item No. 3&mdash;Appropriation Bill, 1990 &mdash; which I hope will conclude by 4 p.m.  If that is not feasible we will give extra time &mdash; I make that point &mdash; but the Minister will speak at about 3.45 p.m. In regard to that item we have agreed 15 minutes per speaker.  At 4 p.m. we will <Col N="1615" /> start the debate on Item No. 4: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann approves the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>&rdquo; That will continue until 6 p.m. and we will have a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  We will take the Fine Gael motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and we can resume on Item No. 4 from 8 p.m. until 10 p.m. dealing with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  In that regard I am suggesting 20 minutes per speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, we certainly cannot agree to complete Item No. 3 in an hour today. There is no question of that.  Our Finance spokesman, for example, has not yet spoken on that matter.  We are agreeable to take it for an hour but certainly we are not agreed to conclude it.  I have no problem with a limit of 20 minutes on speakers for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> debate.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business I am sure all Members of the House would express their delight that the agony of the Birmingham Six is coming to an end at last. I would like to pay tribute to some of our colleagues here and in the other House who have been consistently with this issue from a very early stage, those who have been there from the beginning and who have fought this long and lonely battle which is, hopefully, coming to an end next week.  I would like to pay tribute to those especially people like Deputy David Andrews and Deputy Peter Barry who from the very start have shown great solidarity &mdash; there are others also but I mention those two people in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to draw the attention of the Leader of the House to a statement made last week by the Director of Public Prosecutions where he said very clearly that the fraud laws in this country and the laws dealing with business fraud are hopelessly inadequate and that there is a need for major legislation in this area.  I believe this is an issue to which this House could very usefully turn its attention. Would the Leader of the House in the next month or so arrange to have a debate <Col N="1616" /> on that whole area: what needs to be done to strengthen the Fraud Office in the Garda Síochána, what legislation is needed?  We would be doing a great public service if we had a public debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcome the new-found interest among the Fianna Fáil Party in the question of divorce.  I note with interest the support of the Minister for Education, the consistency of Senator Hanafin and the support of Senator Cassidy for family television.  Would the Leader of the House, again before the end of this session, arrange to have a discussion on that topic?  There is a huge problem of marriage breakdown.  The problems are enormous and I think the other House is not paying any attention to it.  We in this House could do a useful day's public work by having a debate on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Just to reiterate what Senator Manning has said and what has already been brought to the attention of the Leader of the House, I believe it would be inappropriate to finish the Appropriations debate at 4 p.m.  You recall that we rushed it through fairly quickly in the previous debate before Christmas, but that was on the basis that we would have plenty of time afterwards. I certainly do not want to see it dragging on for a long period of time.  At the same time we have agreed to a restriction on the time element and it should find its own level after that.  The Minister perhaps may want to come in today, but the debate itself should be allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also ask the Leader of the House to indicate the programme as he sees it for Committee Stage of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill?  I note on today's Order Paper that it is ordered for 7 March.  Does he intend to take it on 7 March or what is the plan at this time?  I ask that because, first of all, being a very lengthy Bill, the number of amendments will be quite large.  I also note that in the past few days a number of major interests <Col N="1617" /> among the social partners have made representations to the Minister on this legislation. That has tended in the past to delay the taking of Committee Stage.  I do not object to that.  It is important that people make their views known on issues but we should also have at least a fortnight's notice of when Committee Stage is expected to be taken, because people are going to do a fair amount of preparation on the amendments, etc., and I would like to have some indication of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset may I say how pleased I am in relation to the Birmingham Six, that this whole sorry saga now seems to be reaching its final stages? I welcome the fact that these people are going to be released next Monday.  I hope that, arising from it, there will be an improvement in Anglo-Irish relations.  It is terrible that the whole problem took so long&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be grateful if you would confine yourself strictly to your good wishes for the improvement in that situation rather than going into a speech on it, and you can see the reason for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>All right.  I am happy the matter is reaching a conclusion.  Would the Leader of the House be prepared to make time available for a debate on the laws of libel in the light of the fact that in this morning's newspapers there are reports that a small provincial paper is being put at great risk arising out of proceedings in the court yesterday where costs of the order of £100,000 seem to have been given.  I fully accept that the public have to be protected, but I would hope there would be some other way of doing it which would not involve putting small newspapers into liquidation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>An mbeadh Ceannaire an Tí sásta díospóireacht a chur ar bun faoin Ghaeilge agus faoi pholasaíthe i leith na Gaeilge i gceann trí seachtain, tráth a mbeidh Seachtain na Gaeilge ar siúl ar fud na tíre?  Creidim gur am maith <Col N="1618" /> é le díospóireacht den chineál sin a eagrú agus, b'fhéidir, ócáid bhliantúil a dhéanamh de.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will consider in three weeks time, when Seachtain na Gaeilge will be on, whether he would agree to a debate on the Irish language and the policy of promotion of the Irish language during that week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanNeville" hpid="Mr. Neville Mr. Neville">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Neville</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he has a response to my request over the past two weeks to introduce in this House a Bill on the issue of Government responsibility for the release of prisoners who have committed crimes with diminished responsibility.  I compliment the Leader of the House on his positive response to my requests over the past two weeks and ask him if he now has a reply from the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I always knew the Leader of the House was an optimist but to believe that we can get through the Appropriation Bill in an hour is exceeding the limits of his undoubted optimism. I congratulate him for at least his optimistic outlook.</P>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the words of congratulations to the Birmingham Six and to say that, as many of us in this House know, the next item on that agenda is going to be Danny McNamee and unfortunately, we are going to go through the same whole ritual again in that case.  May I ask those Members of this House who have perhaps more influence on the Government than I to see whether they can do anything to stop the horrendous slaughter now going on in the Gulf?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is definitely an interest in that area but I feel it is not appropriate to the Order of <Col N="1619" /> Business.  If I allow the Senator to make a contribution outside the procedures as laid down, then everybody else would feel entitled to make their own contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be strictly in order, Sir, and ask the Leader of the House if he will consider allowing Motion 73 in my name and that of Senator O'Toole, calling for an immediate ceasefire to be taken?  In that way at least I am staying in touch with the Order of Business.  I believe there are fundamental human values at stake in this issue now.</P>
      <P>I support fully the request from the Leader of Fine Gael for a debate on the issue of divorce.  I am glad that reality has begun to penetrate the thinking of the party of reality.</P>

Bheadh sé oiriúnach, anois nuair atá an córas aistriúcháin againn agus os rud é gur Seachtain na Gaeilge a bheadh ann, a leithéid de dhíospóireacht a chur ar siúl. <Col N="1620" /> Dá bhrí sin d'iarrfainn air glacadh le tairiscint an Seanadóir Ó Cuív.</P>
      <P>May I ask the Leader, as I think I have done fairly politely for a number of weeks, not to forget that there is a promise to have a debate on the prison system and related issues, as a matter of commitment given before Christmas, and I would like him to give us some assurance that it can be taken fairly quickly.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator O'Toole in his request that we be given at least two weeks' notice of Committee Stage of the Environment Protection Agency Bill.  It is a major item of legislation which many Members of this House have taken very seriously and it should be dealt with in an organised and proper fashion.  It is not a contentious political issue; it is a serious issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Leader to explain to the House if indeed his Whip has indicated to him why the Appropriation Bill was put on the Order Paper for one hour this afternoon?  After all, I understand that the Appropriation Bill, a matter of finance, has the same Minister as the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> we were to discuss at 3 o'clock.  I ask him to level with us.  Perhaps the Minister was delayed or is elsewhere and you could not have the relevant Minister here at a certain time. <Col N="1621" /> We could understand that.  Quite honestly, both are very important issues and we would hate to think that the time to discuss the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> was being limited for anything but honourable reasons.  However, we would like to know why the Appropriation Bill, which needs a day in itself to be adequately dealt with, should have been put on to the Order Paper for this afternoon and an attempt made to conclude it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with other Members of the House in expressing pleasure at the positive development with regard to the Birmingham Six case.  I would like to express a little concern about the córas aistriúcháin. Although I find that I can normally follow what Senator Ó Cuív says because of his excellent diction as well as his superb Irish as an experiment, I tried but I could not locate any translation at all of it.  It also strikes me, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; and I am not sure that this was explained to the House &mdash; that there is no translation from English into Irish. This may be a lot to ask, but I think it would be quite helpful if there was a kind of parallel situation for monoglots, as Senator Murphy, my colleague, says.</P>
      <P>I would like to support very strongly Senator Brendan Ryan in urging that time be made available for Motion 73 about the Gulf War.  At the time this was placed on the Order Paper I did not feel it appropriate to call for an immediate ceasefire in the Gulf.  Now, however, I would happily add my name to that motion and, if Senator Ryan permits me, I will do so this afternoon.  I hope the Leader may find this appropriate in order, as Senator Ryan said, to stop the slaughter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House if he will provide time next week for the taking of Motion 74.  I will not be moving a change in the Order of Business today but I will next week.  It is about the judgment in the question of the contraceptive case.  I think it is vital that we remove by legislation means this moral <Col N="1622" /> imbecility, which exposes young people in this country to the risk of infection.</P>
    <P>Finally a Chathaoirligh, may I express my regret that I appeared to have troubled you with a repetitious item for the Adjournment and to say in explanation that I did so merely because I received communication yesterday that a new allocation is about to be made and that seemed to me to be new circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

      <P>The Order of Business is not to raise this matter this time.  I am trying to get the co-operation of all Members on all sides of this House. There was an occasion here only a fortnight ago when Members were very concerned about the fact that the Order of Business apparently went out of control for more than an hour.  If that is what the House wants, then the House can decide to have it.  Otherwise we stick with Standing Orders.  I will give the Senator a brief moment to comment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, but I would like to lead into that question.  It was ruled out on the basis of a lack of ministerial responsibility.  I mentioned that I tied it into a review of an EC Directive which, I understand, is going on in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Therefore, a Chathaoirligh, you can understand my surprise when on the Adjournment yesterday in the Dáil this issue was taken by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and I think, in deference to me, I am owed some explanation as to why this issue could not have been deemed as being a suitable question on the Adjournment last week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add my voice to those who offered their best wishes to the Birmingham Six for what is apparently their imminent release and congratulating those in the House of the Oireachtas and elsewhere, and also across the Channel in certain circles in England, who did all in their power to achieve this imminent and highly satisfactory result.  That these people should be incarcerated in jail for up to 20 years is a complete outrage, but justice, apparently, is on the point of being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, I wish to state very briefly that today is a very auspicious day in <Col N="1624" /> world history because this morning the liberation of Kuwait took place.  Given that our country is a member of the United Nations, supported the sanctions and supported the various United Nations resolutions, the least we should do from this House is to send our best wishes to whatever ambassador from Kuwait is accredited to this country expressing to the Kuwaitis every good wish for the future and commiserating with them on the problems they have had.  I would take no exception whatever to a debate taking place in this House on the Gulf issue.  We need a little bit of balance instead of simply talking about immediate ceasefires which would let the tyrant off the hook.</P>

      <P>As a result of yesterday's court decision against the Irish Family Planning Association with regard to the sale of condoms in this country, I ask the Leader of the House to seek from the Minister for Health with the utmost urgency new legislation or amending legislation to change the law in this area. I believe it leaves the people in this country in an appalling situation and I do not believe the majority of people support what the law now states.  I also feel that if we have any aspirations to a pluralist society in this country and express the values we want, this is certainly not the way to go about it.  It is nonsensical, farcical and inhumane to behave in this manner.  I would expect that a responsible Government, as I know this one is, will deal with this matter with some urgency and that such overtly religious bias in legislation would be removed.</P>

      <P>I share the mystification of those who have objected to the meagre allocation of time to the Appropriation Bill.  Traditionally, we have been given plenty of time to deal with this and I cannot believe the Leader is serious when he is talking about a mere hour on this business.</P>
      <P>I support other voices who have drawn conclusions from yesterday's court decision and I hope the Leader will urge the Taoiseach to consider an urgent amendment of present family planning legislation.  In the meantime we could do worse than ask the Committee on Procedure and Privileges &mdash; and I speak as one who has no longer any practical interest in these matters &mdash; to install vending machines in this House which would show up the nonsense of family planning, the hypocrisy of family planning legislation.  I have no doubt there would be a considerable demand for the products of these machines.</P>

But I think grave exception should be taken to the manner in which Pat Kenny on radio last Monday morning dismissed the politicians' contribution in the campaign for the release of the Birmingham Six.  Politicians are expected to work on cases like this and, when they do not, they are criticised.  I think it was very unbecoming of Pat Kenny to dismiss the appreciation of the politicians' role in this expressed by a man who is in a better position to judge than Mr. Kenny.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning and others referred to the Appropriation Bill. I said &ldquo;to conclude, hopefully&rdquo; or words to that effect, I suppose God loves a trier. I certainly did not make it obligatory that we would conclude the debate.

      <P>I am telling the Senator now that that is the exact position. Senator Manning also raised the question of the Birmingham Six, as did many other Senators.  In regard to this issue and also the issue of the Gulf War, we would all hope that by this time next week the Birmingham Six will be free men and that the war will have ended.  That is certainly a hope I have and I am sure it is shared by everybody in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning also asked for a debate on fraud.  It is something he has asked me about for the first time today. I will certainly investigate the position and see what can be done.  He also asked for a debate on marriage breakdown. Again, it is something I will consider and talk to him about.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the question of the Appropriation Bill and in particular he asked about the Environmental Protection Agency Bill and when the Committee Stage will take place.  My understanding at this time is that Committee Stage will take place on 13 or 14 March and 20 and 21 March.  That is the time-scale that is planned at the moment.</P>

      <Col N="1628" /> Senator Upton referred to the Birmingham Six.  Many politicians, quite rightly, have been congratulated for their efforts, but we cannot ignore the all-party Anglo-Irish situation.  They, too, have played a big role in this issue.  The law of libel was raised by Senator Upton.  Again, it is something new to me and I understand his concern in the knowledge of the case he referred to.  I will think about it.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Cúiv asked a question regarding Seachtain na Gaeilge, Irish Week, from 11 March to 17 March.  It would be appropriate that we would have a díospóireacht on the Irish language on either Wednesday or the Thursday of that week.  That point also applies to Senator Brendan Ryan who raised the question.</P>
    <P>I still have no reply to Senator Neville's question.  I hope to get it as quickly as possible and I will come back to him as soon as possible.  Senator Brendan Ryan raised a number of issues: the Appropriation Bill, the Gulf War, the Birmingham Six and item No. 73.  I have no plans in this regard.  Hopefully we will have no need for it when we come back next week.  He also asked for a díospóireach for Seachtain na Gaeilge and he asked about divorce.  He particularly asked about a debate on the prison system.  I am not forgetting it.  I am trying to get it in place as quickly as possible. Senator McGowan praised the Birmingham Six.  Senator Doyle asked me to &ldquo;level with us&rdquo;, to &ldquo;come clean&rdquo;.  I have explained the situation regarding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Senator Cullen went on to the problem the Irish Family Planning group find themselves faced with and he asked for new legislation. <Col N="1629" /> That is a matter for a minister, I will talk to the Minister and see what happens.</P>

      <P>Os rud é go bhfuil teorainn ama i gceist agus nach mbeidh muid ag caint ach ar feadh cúig nóiméad déag nó mar sin, ba mhaith liomsa mo chuid cainte a dhíriú ar rudaí a bhaineann le hiarthar na hÉireann, leis an Ghaeltacht, leis an chósta thiar ó Dhún na nGall síos go Ciarraí.  I dtosach báire ba mhaith liom labhairt ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus na Meastacháin atá curtha amach maidir leis an Roinn sin.  Tá an-díomá orm nach bhfuil aon aitheantas tugtha sna Meastacháin &mdash; easnaimh é seo atá an-sonrach &mdash;maidir leis an Ghaeilge, an Ghaeltacht agus Roinn na Gaeltachta féin.  Go deimhin féin, tá an-imní orm mar nach bhfuil aon Aire Gaeltachta ag feidhmiú.  Mar is eol don Teach, go teoiriciúil, is é an Taoiseach Aire na Gaeltachta, ach go bhfios domsa, ar chaoi ar bith, agus do go leor daoine eile, níl an Taoiseach ag feidhmiú mar Aire Gaeltachta.  Ní raibh sé le feiceáil riamh istigh sa Roinn sin ná ní raibh sé le feiceáil riamh sa Ghaeltacht. Ní iontas, mar sin, go bhfuil laige sna <Col N="1630" /> Meastacháin mar is cosúil go bhfuil neamhaird á tabhairt ar an nGaeltacht agus ar Roinn na Gaeltachta, agus tá céim síos á tabhairt ag an Rialtas don Roinn sin faoi láthair.</P>
      <P>Tóg, mar shampla, seomra na Gaeilge, sampla beag a léiríonn an spéis atá ann ó thaobh na Meastachán de.  Bhí go leor cainte, rí-rá agus grianghraf ann roimh an Nollaig nuair a osclaíodh an seomra. Tháinig an Taoiseach agus dúradh a lán faoi gach a bhféadfaí a dhéanamh chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Dáil agus sa Seanad, ach céard atá ag tarlú do sheomra na Gaeilge?  Níl duine ar bith ann lena fheidhmiú, níl aon rúnaí ann, ná níl aon duine ann le cuspóirí bhunú an tseomra sin a chur chun cinn.  Is follas sin sna Meastacháin mar níor cuireadh airgead breise ar bith ar fáil sna Meastacháin maidir le foireann don seomra chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.</P>
      <P>Is aisteach liomsa go gcuirfimis seomra Gaeilge ar bun ach nárbh fhiú leis an Aire Airgeadais dóthain airgid nó foireann a chur ar fáil le go bhféadfadh an seomra sin feidhmiú.  Sin an locht is mó dá bhfuil agamsa ar na Meastacháin seo atá á bplé againn.  Is amhlaidh an scéal maidir leis an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge.  Tá comhchoistí éagsúla san Oireachtas agus tábhacht ar leith ag baint leo.  Má táimid dáiríre faoi chur chun cinn na Gaeilge sa Teach seo, ní thaispeántar an dáiríreacht seo ó thaobh sheomra na Gaeilge de agus, níos measa fós, ní léirítear aon dáiríreacht i leith an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge.  Rinne Cathaoirleach an Chomhchoiste, an Teachta David Andrews &mdash; fear díograiseach a bhfuil an-suim aige in imeachtaí an Chomhchoiste agus in imeachtaí na Gaeilge agus a bhfuil an-mholadh ag dul dó &mdash; tromaíocht ar a Rialtas féin mar chonacthas dó go raibh air iad a cháineadh cionn is nach bhfuil siad ag déanamh freastail chóir ar an Chomhchoiste don Ghaeilge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níl aon rúnaí lánaimseartha ag an gComhchoiste don Ghaeilge faoi mar atá ag gach rannóg eile.  Arís, de réir na Meastacháin seo, is léir nach bhfuil aon suim ag an Aire Airgeadais sna cúrsaí seo, agus, de dheasca na neamhshuime <Col N="1631" /> seo agus an easpa airgid i gcás a leithéide, is beag éifeacht atá leis an gcomhchoiste, dar leis an gCathaoirleach.  Murar féidir an scéal seo a leigheas trí breis airgid a chur ar fáil, is cóir éirí as ar fad.  Tá rud eile ann nach bhfuil sna Meastacháin, rud a bhfuil an-chaint faoi agus rud atá antábhachtach, agus baineann sé leis an gcóras aistriúcháin seo.  Tá a fhios ag chuile dhuine an troid agus an cúnamh a fuaireamar ón Teach seo leis an gcóras aistriúcháin a chur ar siúl anseo.  Bhí go leor daoine den tuairim nach bhféadfaí a leithéid a dhéanamh ar chor ar bith mar nach raibh na haistritheoirí ann lena fheidhmiú. Is lú an fhoireann aistritheoirí atá ann faoi láthair ná mar a bhí ann deich mbliana ó shin, nuair a bhí beirt sa bhreis ann.  Tá an rannóg seo tar éis a iarraidh, arís agus arís eile, ar an Aire agus ar an Roinn Airgeadais breis foirne a chur ar fáil chun go bhféadfadh siad a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh i gceart, ach is léir gur tugadh cluas bhodhar do na hiarratais.</P>
    <P>Níl aon tagairt do seo sna Meastacháin. Tá caint ann go gceapfar duine amháin breise amach anseo, ach fós bheadh siad faoi bhun an líon foirne a bhí ann deich mbliana ó shin.  An bhfuil a fhios ag an Teach seo go bhfuil obair Rannóg an Aistriúcháin ceithre bliana ar gcúl ina gcuid oibre?  Go bunreachtúil caithfidh siad na Billí uilig a aistriú go Gaeilge. Léiríonn sé seo ar fad cé chomh lag is atá na Meastacháin, nó an soláthar airgeadais atá ann le haghaidh na Gaeilge agus chuile shórt a bhaineann léi.  Tá seomra na Gaeilge gan foireann, tá an Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge gan rúnaí, agus anois tá Rannóg an Aistriúcháin i ndroch-chaoi de bharr gan dóthain foirne bheith acu. Níl go leor ann leis an ngnáthobair laethúil a dhéanamh gan trácht ar an lear mór oibre atá curtha ar gcúl de bharr easpa foirne.  Cuireann sé an-díoma orm nach bhfuil réiteach na bhfadhbanna seo uilig sna Meastacháin seo.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire a rá linn cén uair a bheidh an t-airgead ar fáil leis na fadhbanna sin a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Tógaimis ceist theilifís na Gaeilge. Cuireadh suim airgid, £500,000, ar fáil breis agus bliain go leith ó shin le rud <Col N="1632" /> éigin a dhéanamh faoi sin.  Níl tada déanta faoi go fóil, cé gur gealladh dúinn arís agus arís eile go mbeadh sé ann a leilhéid seo de mhí, agus mar sin de.  Níl a fhios agam cén uair a bheidh teilifís na Gaeilge nó na Gaeltachta ann.  Tá a fhios againn cén costas a bhainfidh lena bhunú &mdash; luadh an figiúr £9 milliún in aghaidh na bliana agus tá gealltanas tugtha ag an Aire agus ag Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta go mbunófar é, ach ní fheicim cén chaoi ar féidir é a fheidhmiú mura bhfuil sé luaite sna Meastacháin, agus ní fheicim tagairt dá leithéid sna Meastacháin seo.</P>
    <P>Agus mé ag caint ar ábhar seo na teilifíse, níl a fhios agam an cheist airgeadais é.  Cé go bhfuil an Dáil féin á teilifísiú níl iomrá ar bith ann go ndéanfar amhlaidh leis an Seanad.  Níl aon chaint ar mhíreanna as Gaeilge a phléitear sa Dáil ná sa Seanad a theilifísiú.  Nár mhór an gar dá bhféadfaí leathuair a chloig in aghaidh na seachtaine de dhíospóireacht i nGaeilge sa Dáil agus sa Seanad a theilifísiú. Dá ndéanfaí a leithéid bheadh fonn ar níos mó Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí roinnt Gaeilge a labhairt sa dá Theach. Níl le feiceáil ar an scáileán anois ach beagán den Dáil, agus é déanta go dona, dar liomsa, agus é uilig i mBéarla gan oiread agus focal Gaeilge le cloisteáil.</P>
    <P>Mar gheall ar Údarás na Gaeltachta &mdash;tarlaíonn sé gur ball mé féi de bhord an Udaráis &mdash; níl dóthain airgid acu, bíodh go bhfuil cruthúnas ann go bhfuil siad ag cur jabanna ar fáil, agus seo muid anois ag tús na bliana agus is ar éigean atá aon airgead ag Údarás na Gaeltachta le caitheamh d'ainneoin gurb iad an eagraíocht is mó a chruthaigh poist i gcomhmhéid leis an airgead a fuair siad i rith na bliana seo caite uilig.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh Roinn na Gaeltachta de, tá mé an-éadóchasach go bhfuil soláthar airgid cuí, sásúil ann le go bhféadfaí an teanga a chur chun cinn, ní amháin sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil, ach, go bunúsach, ar fud na Gaeltachta.  Maidir le hoideachas, cuireann sé as domsa a laghad airgid atá ann le haghaidh mhúinteoirí feabhais. Tá sé geallta go mbeidh múinteoirí feabhais le fáil agus go dtabharfar aire cheart do na gasúir sin a bhfuil míchumas intinne orthu agus a bhfuil scoileanna speisialta <Col N="1633" /> ann dá leithéid.  Is cosúil go bhfuil polasaí, ag an Rialtas cuid mhaith de na scoileanna sin a dhúnadh.  Tá scéal truamhéileach ag teacht as Gaillimh le cúpla lá anuas go raibh cead faighte ón Roinn Oideachais le scoil a thógáil le haghaidh na ngasúr mallintinneach ach anois tá athrú plean ann agus ní bheidh aon scoil ann do na gasúir sin.</P>
    <P>Tá deireadh á chur le scoil eile a bhfuil gasúir ann nach bhfuil go hiomlán mallintinneach ach a bhfuil easpa bheag éigin orthu.  Tá siadsan á gcur isteach sna gnáthscoileanna, agus seo muid ar thaobh amháin ag iarraidh múinteoirí feabhais a chur isteach sna gnáthscoileánna mar gheall ar ghasúir atá cineál mall ó thaobh foghlama, de, agus, ar an taobh eile, tá an Roinn Oideachais ag cur deiridh leis de bharr gearadh siar scoileanna speisialta a bhí ag déileáil le gasúir mhallintinneacha. Níl sé sin inghlactha agus, thar aon aicme eile sa tír, níor chóir go dtaispeánfaí nó go mbeadh sé le feiceáil go mbeadh aon chiorrú ann.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Roinn na Mara, nuair a smaoinímid ar a laghad airgid atá curtha ar fáil agus ar an obair dheisiúcháin atá le déanamh ar na céanna agus na calafoirt de bharr an dochair uafásach a rinne an stoirm a bhí ann an geimhreadh seo, ní fheicfidh muidne lenár linn féin ná le linn shaol ár bpáistí féin go gcuirfear caoi cheart ar na céanna agus na calafoirt sin.  Tá an dá oileán Gaeltachta, Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr, ag fanacht ó bunaíodh an Stát &mdash; agus níl mé ag cur an mhilleáin ar an Rialtas seo ach ar gach Rialtas a bhí ann go dtí seo &mdash; le cé ceart a fháil.  Tá sé ceadaithe i bprionsabal go gcuirfear caoi ar na nithe seo, ach is é an seanscéal arís é, &ldquo;mair a chapaill agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Níl aon airgead curtha ar fáil chun go gcuirfí deis ar na céanna seo.  Ní féidir liom, mar sin, glacadh leis na Meastacháin seo sa mhéid go bhfuil ciorrú ar chuile Roinn Stáit.  Is trua liom gur mar seo atá, ach beidh mé ag súil go dtabharfaidh an tAire aird ar an pointí seo uilig atá luaite agam.</P>

      <P>Tá go leor pointí spéisiúla ardaithe ag an Seanadóir a labhair <Col N="1634" /> romham faoi na Meastacháin, go mórmhór meastachtáin Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Údarás na Gaeltachta dá bharr.  Ach níl i gceist agamsa miontrácht a dhéanamh ar na hábhair sin tráthnóna, mar, mar a dúirt an Ceannaire, beidh deis againn i gceann trí seachtaine dul isteach sna hábhair sin go mion agus iad a phlé agus féachaint cén chaoi is ceart airgead na Gaeilge a chaitheamh.  Mar is eol do go leor, dúirt mise cúpla rud le coicís anuas maidir le hairgead na Gaeilge agus, dar liomsa, an mhí-éifeacht a bhaineann leis an gcaiteachas sin.  Ach creidim sa díospóireacht áirithe seo gur ócáid í le labhairt go gineáralta faoi chúrsaí airgid na tíre.</P>
      <P>Ach díreach cúpla poínte sonrach a luaigh an Seanadóir a labhair romham, is é sin, ceist na gcéanna sna hoileáin bheaga in Árainn.  Ba mhaith liomsa tréaslú leis an Rialtas.  Le os cionn trí scór bliain bhí ceist bhád farantóireachta go hÁrainn faoi chaibidil, agus anuraidh rinneadh cinneadh faoi sin.  Don chéad uair riamh, tógadh cinneadh na milliúin punt a chaitheamh ar dhá ché a chur ar fáil ar Inis Meáin agus Inis Oírr.  Dé réir mar a thuigimise an scéal, tógfar iadsan anois ach caithfear, ar ndóigh, an réamhobair a dhéanamh agus beidh an t-airgead ar fáil leis an obair a dhéanamh ag an am caoi.  Ar ndóigh, beidh mise i measc daoine eile ag brú na ceiste sin, ach caithfidh mé a rá, mar dhuine nach bhfuil sa saol poiblí ach bliain go leith, go bhfuil mé an-sásta go bhfuil an oiread sin dul chun cinn déanta ar na ceisteanna sin i gcaitheamh an dá bhliain sin.</P>
      <P>This is an occasion for an overview of the total financial situation of the State. A quarter of an hour is a very short time to even begin to explore the problem and the realities of this very important and complex question.  The first thing I would once again like to point out is that I have always maintained, and I continue to maintain, that those who favour extra expenditure have, at the same time to explain where any extra expenditure will come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had enough living on our children's money.  That a previous generation have to be indicted for putting a <Col N="1635" /> burden on this generation and on future generations is something that in my opinion they never had a right to do.  We borrowed, as I have pointed out many times before, £25,000 million pounds but I would have to say that in terms of infrastructure, in terms of a legacy, we have very little to show for that expenditure.</P>
    <P>The second thing is that if you accept that you have to raise extra finance for any extra expenditure you want to make, then you have to look at how that can be done.  Thirdly, and this is very dear to my heart as a practical person working on the ground, we have to look closely at a third option, which is more efficient and more effective use of the expenditure that is being made.</P>
    <P>The first comment I would make about the Estimates which stand at £6.8 billion, is that only 11 per cent of this amount is for capital expenditure.  I have maintained that it is one area where I can see justification for borrowing if it is used productively, effectively and if it generates a return.  We have seen the effectiveness, for example, in the telecommunications area where borrowing was made to modernise the system and where that borrowing has, not only in terms of An Bord Telecom but in national economy terms, paid off handsomely.  I would like to see an accelerated capital programme particularly in the area of roads, ports, sewerage and water to ensure that we have the basic infrastructure to allow us provide a suitable standard of living for our people and also allow industry, agriculture and tourism, etc., to grow and generate income in the future.</P>
    <P>Money from the EC is becoming fundamental to the overall financing of this State.  I have reservations about certain aspects of this.  In relation to road expenditure, it strikes me as odd that Regional Fund money can be spent only on national primary and secondary roads which are, by definition, predominantly in the more developed parts of the country and not on county roads, which most of us use and which are vital to the <Col N="1636" /> aims of rural regeneration.  EC money is often matched by national money.  That poses problems, firstly, because many communities do not have the matching capital and, secondly, the rules, regulations and small print conditions mean that the illusion is much greater than the substance.</P>
    <P>Total expenditure this year is £6.8 billion and of that 61 per cent goes to three Departments &mdash; Social Welfare, Health and Education.  Regarding the Department of Health, it is about time that we reviewed the situation there.  It would appear that throwing money into it does not give the person on the ground a better health service.  There is a structural problem relating to health expenditure.  There are certain fixed principles that everybody seems to accept and that cannot be questioned in health expenditure, which none of us would accept in other facets of our lives.  For example, it is accepted in the public health sector that the State chooses the consultant and so on. However, very few of us would allow the State to choose the garage to send our cars to for repair.  We should approach this matter in a much more imaginative way.  I often ask myself how I can provide private healthcare, for myself and my family for an annual fee of around £500.  I have a choice of consultants and a private hospital bed.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough for people, particularly those in Opposition, to propose throwing more money into health and never propose examining the structures or the way the money is spent.  It is the same in the health services.  The easy option is to go for more money.  There is only a limited amount available and if we do not get value for it there will never be enough money.  In relation to roads, sewerage, water, education, health or housing, the constant cry from people is that more imaginative and innovative ways should be found to spend public money which would ensure a greater return.  Maybe we could raise more in taxes.</P>
    <P>As somebody who has been involved in business, agriculture and most facets of rural and urban life I argued years ago, <Col N="1637" /> long before it was fashionable to do so, that the most sensible policy we could adopt regarding taxation would be to reduce exemption limits and tighten up on the efficiency of collection.  I argued as far back as the seventies that if that were done, the amount of revenue that would come in would increase dramatically, the satisfaction of people with the system would increase and also the nominal rates of taxation could be brought down.  I welcome the moves taken in this direction in the last few years but we can go a lot further.  We should avoid special schemes like the plague. The people want a simple system.  They want a system where they know where they stand, where the poor do not feel at a disadvantage, or the small businessman, or the farmer, because he cannot afford tax consultants to tell him how to dodge around the tax code.  He wants to feel that he is not at a disadvantage compared to his richer neighbour.</P>
    <P>I favour further decentralisation of tax collection.  Nobody knows better about who really is earning what than the person who is working on the ground. The method of collection should be on a bottom up basis rather than the one that applies at present which is from the top down.  I look forward to the day, and it would also create some administrative jobs outside Dublin, when my monthly cheque to the Collector General will be paid to Galway and the relevant portion transmitted to Dublin rather than the system that operates at present where I pay, or any employer pays, the cheque to the collector who gives it to the Department of Finance, who gives it to the Department of the Gaeltacht who in turn gives it back to Údarás na Gaeltachta, who might then given it back to me, but at that stage there is only 20 per cent of my money left.</P>
    <P>Flexibility in the public service is very important.  There has been a growing realisation that methods and work practices that were appropriate to the fifties and sixties are no longer good enough today.  All Departments of Government, whether Health, Education or Social Welfare, which provide a service must be <Col N="1638" /> customer-friendly.  They should cut down on duplication and form filling.  The use of computerisation in a user friendly manner should be encouraged.  For example, when you get your annual PAYE tax from all the details of the latest previous return should be automatically printed out &mdash; life insurance policies, mortgage repayments, etc. &mdash; and the obligation on the taxpayer should be to insert any changes, sign the form and return to the tax office.  From the point of view of the tax office it would cut down enormously on their work and from the taxpayer's point of view it would save a lot of heartache looking for details that have already been supplied to Revenue. This type of approach could be spread right across Government Departments particularly those that have regular dealings with the public and where information was given a long time ago.  Much of the antipathy people feel towards dealing with the State and with intractable forms could be done away with.  On that point, we should have learned from the innovation shown in the famous tax amnesty and build on it.  In that case instead of the Revenue chasing people they were chasing the taxman with their cheques trying to pay them before the deadline.  Some £500 million was raised for the State and this was one of the first major steps in reducing the current budget deficit that has troubled this country for so long.</P>

      <P>Mar aon leis an bheirt Seanadóirí eile a bhí romham, d'fhéadfainn a lán ábhar a phlé i ndíospóireacht mar seo, ach in ionad bheith ag scaipeadh mo chuid tuairimí timpeall na tíre go léir, déanfaidh mé iarracht cúpla rud a phlé.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing that needs to be said is that the process by which parliamentary approval is given to the expenditure of £6.6 billion, either in this House or in the other House, is a scandal.  The degree of parliamentary accountability, the degree to which any Government feel they are obliged to explain or justify expenditure, the degree to which institutions and Departments feel obliged to explain or justify expenditure is close to being unparalleled in any country that claims <Col N="1639" /> to be a parliamentary democracy.  We are among the most secretive of societies in terms of accountability and of public access to information about what is being done on behalf of the public.</P>
    <P>I will come back at some length to one specific issue where things are being done in our name.  We are a society where large areas of the State, far from being transparent, open and accessible are obscure, closed and totally inaccessible. As I have said frequently with the collapse of Stalinism in eastern Europe, we are, in terms of our centralisation, the nearest thing to a neo-Stalinist economy in the whole of Europe in which the most extraordinary determination to hold on to central control is revealed by a succession of Governments, and in particular by a succession of Ministers for Finance who are accountable for the Department of Finance and who cannot and should not be allowed to blame the inflexibilities of centralisation on public servants.</P>
    <P>Nothing can be done to improve the efficiency of public expenditure or the use of public money by building one layer of control on another.  Many of us have ample evidence of the fact that cutbacks over recent years did not produce a determination to use resources more efficiently.  It simply produced smaller, equally inefficient services where large sectors of services were cut but no great attempt was made to improve the efficiency or the accountability of many of the services.</P>
    <P>Irish politics has been excessively dominated by questions of expenditure &mdash; they are important &mdash; and has insufficiently addressed the questions of accountability, openness, democratic control and decentralisation.  As one who stands firmly on the left in Irish politics, the agenda for the left for the next ten years, not just in this country but in western Europe generally, ought to be the very simple one of rendering practical what is theoretical and making all the areas of public power truly accountable. You cannot do that if it is all blocked in <Col N="1640" /> the enormous embrace of a huge Dublin-based bureaucracy which claims to itself the most extraordinary wisdom on the most local matters.  I keep asking, and I will continue to do so until somebody explains, why is it not possible for an urban council to put a yellow line on a road to indicate &ldquo;no parking&rdquo; without the permission of the Minister and the Garda Commissioner?  That is idiotic in the extreme and it either should be justified or abolished.</P>
    <P>The country in the EC nearest to us in size is Denmark.  They have managed in the past seven or eight years to devolve 70 per cent of the powers which were exercised by central Government back to elected local and regional authorities. Somebody somewhere in this country apparently unaffected by reality apparently &mdash; I keep on saying this with more than a hint of seriousness &mdash; infected with the sort of Stalinism that nobody in eastern Europe has believed in for 20 years, actually believes that the centre knows best what is good for people and for every peripheral region.  We had the extraordinary spectacle of the Minister for Finance descendng on my home city to show to senior EC officials various projects which had been funded by the EC and not bothering to consult or involve officials or representatives of the people of Cork because the centre knew best.  The centre does not know best.  The centre does not have a clue in many cases. It is caught up in a fog of alleged expertise which even a cursory glance would show does not exist.</P>
    <P>In my own city &mdash; I am not attempting to plug a line because I have no electoral reason to be more preoccupied about Cork than anywhere else &mdash; we have the ridiculous situation where the Department of the Environment claim a level of expertise on the complex matter of a major river crossing and claim somehow to have expertise available to them which is not available to the local authority.  All they have is yet another engineer with another opinion, not necessarily better qualified, not necessarily worse qualified, but with no guarantee that the decision taken at the centre will be one bit better <Col N="1641" /> than the decision taken at the periphery but with a guarantee of power being retained at the centre.  The whole thing is meaningless.  If people and particularly members of either party in front of me or the Government parties are really concerned about creating a culture of enterprise they should forget about red herrings or the tax system.  The Irish income tax system is no worse than the German income tax system but German enterprise is hardly something to be scoffed at.  They should forget about that red herring and look at the reality &mdash; a centralised, burdensome, unresponsive and unenterprising orientated bureaucracy which has claimed for itself a wisdom which does not exist and a power which it does not deserve.</P>
    <P>On the issue of lack of accountability, I looked at the sums allocated in the Bill to a number of Government Departments. I listened to Senator Ó Cuív asking where will we get money to do (a), (b), and (c), and I look at the Department of Foreign Affairs which last year used the best part of £37 million.  Given the abject surrender of our sovereignty to the United States which we witnessed over the past two months, perhaps we should abolish the Department of Foreign Affairs or at least invite the United States State Department to fund it.  Egypt, Syria, the USSR, China, Turkey and Bangladesh extracted a price for their capitulation to the United States but we apparently lined up and did it for nothing. It was a shameful betrayal of our sovereignty.  The logical extension of that betrayal should be to close down the Department of Foreign Affairs and invite the United States State Department to set up a sub-office in Iveagh House and let them dictate every aspect of our foreign policy and use the £37 million for something more constructive than giving somebody who claims to be our Minister for Foreign Affairs but who quite manifestly is nothing more than another mouthpiece of the United States State Department the right to travel the world <Col N="1642" /> and pretend to be something that he is not.</P>

      <P>The reality of where our money is being spent in the area of foreign affairs is that we are participating in the slaughter of perhaps 100,000 innocent civilians in Iraq who are not responsible for what was done in their name, who have no influence over the person who did things in their name and who will, unlike the leader we all detest, be there after he is gone to suffer the consequences of something over which they had no control.  Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats support this slaughter of civilians which has produced perhaps a greater proportion of deaths than any other war relative to the deaths of combatants.  This slaughter of civilians has been carried out against a man whom his people have never succeeded&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will desist from that line of argument because there are a number of others.  I do not believe the expenditure allocated to the Department of Foreign Affairs, is justified.  Neither do I believe that part of the expenditure for the Department of Communications is justified since it is now used to fund, facilitate and support overflights of this country by those agents of the deaths of thousands of Iraqi civilians.  There is an equally valid case for rejecting expenditure in that area.  I can understand those in this House who actually disagree with me but I cannot understand those who laugh because I talk about the deaths of thousands of civilians.  I find that rather distasteful and not in the least amusing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is ironic that we spend £37 million on the Department of Foreign Affairs which, quite clearly, we no longer need given what I have just said, and substantially less on overseas development aid.  There is an overwhelming case for transferring most of the funding of the Department of Foreign Affairs to something constructive such as ODA. There is the threat of 15 million people starving to death in sub-Saharan Africa at present.  There is an incredible, to use a fashionable phrase &ldquo;world coalition&rdquo; of interested parties determined not to allow public opinion to become diverted from the blood and guts of war to the blood and guts of 15 million starving to death.  We apparently do not have the resources here or in western Europe or in North America to deal with 15 million starving people; yet, apparently we have a bottomless purse to kill 100,000 civilians. In these figures there are charades of sovereignty which no longer exist. <Col N="1644" /> There are pretences, as under the issue of overseas development aid, towards morality and decent values which no longer exist.  There are expenditures which are effectively expenditures for war which should have been expenditures for civil activities, in overflights, communication facilities, landing rights etc.</P>
      <P>The issues I raised are a perfect example of what I was talking at the beginning &mdash; Government without accountability, where they do not feel in the least bit obliged to listen to the views of the people or not believe that the horror of the people at the brutality of war should be reflected in their policies. They believe that the interests of this nation are best served by a sycophantic lying down and saying &ldquo;yes, sir&rdquo; to the State to which they apparently believe we now give our allegiance.</P>

      <P>Bíonn an fhírinne searbh &mdash; the truth is sour.  We know where the borrowing started.  It was not wise.  We all know the old proverb: he who goes a' borrowing goes a' sorrowing.  It was a pity that we were in that situation but Ministers in this and the previous Government are coming to grips with it. We came to power when the national debt was £24 billion, a massive sum of money.  We have succeeded in reducing that.  We did many good things which I will speak of later.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker paid an indirect tribute to the Minister for Finance in that he was so lost for something to say that he had to speak about international matters. We all abhor those deaths but I enjoy listening to those Senators because they are the very same people who seem to condone the death of thousands of people in this country.  There are two separate views, which is typical of what we have to put up with in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like local authorities to have greater powers.  Unfortunately when local authorities decide to get better value for money and to go into the private sector and into contracting, they are prohibited from doing so because of threatened job losses and other risks.  Very often we are out-voted and that is a great pity.  We had a problem in Sligo with a firm of architects and engineers who built houses with faulty chimneys and who was blamed for the problem?  The Minister for the Environment.  No word about the engineers and architects who planned them.  The Minister gave the OK to build <Col N="1646" /> them but surely it was not up to him to detect the problem?  The architects and engineers, however, were allowed off the hook.  There is not one word about them at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. B. Ahern)</NameTxt>
      <P>For any of us as individuals, if we were setting out on a journey, we would decide in advance where we wanted to go.  And then we would decide on the route we would take.  We could then assess our progress by checking that we have followed that route and finally we would arrive at our destination.</P>
      <P>It is just as important for us as a country, as well as for individual enterprises, to have clear goals and strategies for achieving them.  And in the 1990s every business needs to have the support and commitment of all of their staff if they are to be successful.</P>
      <P>In the recent NESC Report, &ldquo;Ireland, a Strategy for the 1990s&rdquo;, the importance of comprehensive longer-term planning was fully acknowledged.  The Government fully endorsed the request from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that a new programme should be set firmly in the context of a ten-year plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> gives us those overall goals which we need if we are to be able to plan ahead in any real sense.  It goes well beyond the general aspirations which have almost become clichés by now and which are often so vague as to be useless as signposts or as ways of assessing whether individual decisions are the right ones.  Indeed, its scope is unprecedented. It builds on the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and carries the <Col N="1647" /> consensus approach to a logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>Before being too critical of this approach, of the development of the consensus involving the major economic and social interests, we should stand back and see how much even the more limited consensus of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> has achieved.  Five years ago, we had suffered from six years of declining employment, losing a total of 80,000 jobs.  With the help of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> that decline was halted and has, indeed, been turned round to three years of growth, with 40,000 more jobs.  Five years ago, inflation was in double figures.  Now we have the lowest rate of inflation in the EC &mdash; and who would have believed this could ever happen?</P>
    <P>Just a few years ago, wage rises were unpredictable and too high to protect our competitiveness and yet, despite high wage rises, our real disposable incomes were declining.  We pulled off the feat of combining low wage rises with assuring growth in real incomes, thanks largely to the wage restraints and tax reform elements of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
    <P>I hope that these few examples illustrate just how great has been the improvement in our circumstances from the consensus type approach of the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i>  Looking back, we can see that the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was adopted at a time when the international environment was more favourable.  World growth rates meant that the right policies led to real progress.  Now we can all see that, at least at the outset of this programme, the environment is much more hostile.  Our exporters face dwindling demand in the UK and in the USA; our other markets are also slowing; the Gulf War could have unforeseeable but far-reaching consequences; projected changes in supports to the agricultural sector are at best ominous.</P>
    <P>Faced with these difficulties, it is even more important for us to get our own domestic policies right.  We cannot afford <Col N="1648" /> to compound any difficulties on the international front with mistakes of our own. The programme offers unique benefits for all the main parties &mdash; Government, the employers, the unions, the farmers. All benefit from the consensus approach. Individuals benefit from improved social services; workers benefit from better industrial relations and real wage increases; the unemployed benefit from improved social services; businesses benefit from improved competitiveness and better strategic planning.  Everyone benefits from a stable economic and industrial relations environment.</P>
    <P>We cannot be content just to rest on our laurels.  We should all share the aims of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  We all want to meet the challenge of emigration and unemployment, especially, long term unemployment. We all want the best quality of life for ourselves and our families. None of us likes being counted in among the more disadvantaged areas of the European Community.  To improve our standards of living, create the jobs we need and eliminate disadvantages, we have to work together towards the common good.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the programme is unprecedented in its wide coverage.  Its importance does not rest solely, or even mainly, on its pay provisions, vital though those are for the economy.  It tackles fiscal policy, where it aims to reduce the national debt &mdash; GNP ratio towards 100 per cent by 1993, down from 131 per cent in 1987.  The longer-term target is a level on par with the European Community average.  It tackles health policy, most notably is proposing free access to hospital consultant services for the whole population.</P>
    <P>Another major benefit is the extra funding being provided to health boards for community health services to help the handicapped and the elderly to live in their own communities.  It introduces a wide selection of improvements in the education system.  It will reduce pupil-teacher ratios at both primary and secondary levels; it extends a six-year cycle at secondary level to all children; and it <Col N="1649" /> offers additional help to the educationally disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>Perhaps most important to the future of education and, therefore, to our economic and social development, is its commitment to a wide debate on education through a Green Paper to be published this summer, a White Paper next year, and an Education Bill in due course after that.  There have been complaints that all these targets were negotiated in a forum apart from the Oireachtas.  I would stress, however, that the implementation of the programme will require the approval of the Oireachtas in respect of introduction of items.  For instance, the detailed fiscal and taxation provisions fall to be debated in the Finance and other Bills, and the short term decisions on health and education funding will also be discussed in the course of debates on each Vote. And, of course, Green and White Papers are wonderful opportunities to ensure that all possible views are taken into account before again, quite properly, coming back to the Oireachtas for the approval of detailed proposals.</P>
    <P>Turning back to the goals of the programme, I think everyone agrees that one of the key objectives of any strategy for the 1990s must be to bring down unemployment.  The Government's role in this must be the encouragement of a climate of enterprise and growth; we cannot return to the expensive and ineffective policies of creating jobs that the economy does not need or cannot afford. That role underpins the economic strategy of this Government's overall policy and the strategy underlying the programme. It is up to employers to take up the chances of economic expansion and, therefore, of job creation.  In this, the Government will of course be adjusting our policies to favour job creation rather than capital investment and we have targeted the indigenous sector in particular in respect of measures to facilitate job creation.</P>
    <P>My particular concern is the priority needs of the long term unemployed.  They are the ones who find it difficult if not impossible to benefit from general improvement in the economy.  They often <Col N="1650" /> suffer from multiple disadvantages, such as poor qualifications and out-of-date skills, and many live in areas where there is a high concentration of unemployment and poverty.</P>
    <P>For years FÁS has run a number of programmes for the long term unemployed, and of course there has been massive assistance from the European Social Fund for re-training and work experience measures.  Other State Departments have schemes which help the unemployed to top up their education or to gain experience in real jobs.  While these have been very successful, they have only been available in a piecemeal way.  With the exception of Youthreach schemes for young people who could not find a first job, there has been no coherent intervention for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned for some years about this situation and indeed one of my motives in establishing FÁS was to facilitate the integration and rationalisation of programmes for the long term unemployed.  I am, therefore, delighted that the new programme contains a major new integrated programme which will harness the resources of local communities and of the relevant State agencies. The new programme will concentrate on local areas.  Local communities will be the primary movers, with help if necessary. Existing schemes and initiatives will be combined and the principle of &ldquo;progression&rdquo; will be incorporated.  At the end, participants should get relevant qualifications and therefore have a far better chance of getting a real job.</P>
    <P>I have already launched the first three programmes, on a pilot basis, in the high unemployment areas of Tallaght, Cork north city and Dublin's inner city.  Six more will be launched later this year and we hope to use the best models to go nationwide by 1993, as resources permit. One particular difficulty for the long term unemployed can be financial.  It is difficult for someone, especially with family commitments, to take up a job opportunity which, in effect, results in loss of income. In the short term, I feel that the improvements in the family income supplement <Col N="1651" /> scheme and child-related marginal tax exemptions will make real progress in addressing this problem.  These improvements will cost over £16 million.</P>
    <P>As an example of the gain to an individual family from these improvements, a family with four children on £160 a week will now be 36 per cent better off working than if they were receiving unemployment and pay-related benefit.  A substantial contribution to solving the problem of low pay is made by the joint labour committee system.  This sets down legally enforceable minimum rates for specific categories of workers.  As the committee includes both sides of industry, it strikes a balance between market forces and the needs of individually vulnerable employees.  The recent Industrial Relations Act strengthens that system.</P>
    <P>While at the moment only 40,000 workers are covered by joint labour committees, I expect this go grow.  The Labour Court are completing an investigation into setting up a joint labour committee for the retail trade, which could add a further 40,000 or so workers.  I expect their findings next month.</P>
    <P>The Labour Relations Commission will also now be able under the Industrial Relations Act to consider whether new committees are needed or whether their terms of reference should be amended. The problems of low pay are also addressed by the provisions for minimum increases in the pay agreements.  These are essential if we are to avoid widening the gap between the better-off and those on low pay.</P>
    <P>In this context I would like to take the opportunity again to rebut the argument that the levels of pay increases were too high for the public sector.  It is invidious to expect workers to work for less just because they work in the public sector. Their products are essential to the community. We must remember that despite the significant reduction in their numbers they have continued to maintain and, indeed, expand services.</P>
    <P>Another area where the new programme provides for further work is in the area of labour legislation.  I have <Col N="1652" /> always adopted the approach in drafting new or amending legislation that it is best to adopt a balance between the interests of the two side of industry.  A tri-partite approach was adopted in the 1989 legislation on occupational health and safety, and is being continued in the Health and Safety Authority.  Concerning the most recent labour legislation to come before this House, the Industrial Relations Act, extensive consultations were conducted with both sides before I formulated a Bill.  I have taken the same approach in drawing up the proposals to extend statutory protection to regular part-time workers.  The Bill is at present before the Dáil and Senators will shortly have an opportunity to debate the matter in this House as well.</P>
    <P>The new programme also includes commitments on other elements of statutory protection, such as unfair dismissals, the payment of wages and employment equality, which have for some time been recognised as needing up-dating, and also on new items such as agency workers.  By the mid-1990s I hope that we will have a body of legislation which is up-to-date, relevant to current needs and which offers the optium balance between the legitimate needs of both sides of industry.</P>
    <P>We must remember that the future of not only our economy but also of each of our enterprises rests on maximising the co-operation and teamwork of both sides; those who manage at national and local levels and those whose work fuels the system.  In the light of ever-increasing competition for a slice of the cake whose growth rate is now under threat, we must all pull together to succeed.</P>
    <P>The relative industrial relations harmony which we have enjoyed since 1988 has underpinned our growth.  It has enhanced our attraction for new investment and improved our productivity.  I hope that moves to facilitate employee involvement in the private sector under the auspices of the Employer-Labour Conference will further increase the degree of consensus in our enterprises.</P>
    <P>Finally, I welcomed the strength of the endorsement of this consensus approach <Col N="1653" /> by all sides &mdash; employers, unions and farmers.  They showed judgment, maturity and a sense of reality in accepting a package which undeniably will serve to restrain expectations of individual benefit in favour of ensuring real improvements to the community overall and in particular to the weaker elements.  In steering of our country through the challenges of the 1990s, we have to aim for a fairer, better society at the end of ten years.  The programme rests firmly on this goal and adopts the best and, indeed, the only realistic strategy to reach it.</P>
    <P>I want to thank this House for the opportunity to say a few words on the programme.  In conclusion to what I have been saying I want to acknowledge the effort of the social partners and the time and the work that was put in by the farming bodies, the employer bodies and the trade unions, all working with the Government and endeavouring to produce a programme that is of substance. During this debate I asks no more than that people should reflect seriously on what they said in 1987.  I decided today in the other House not to come and adopt the political ploy of quoting what was said in 1987 because perhaps somebody will do that some day to me and it is not nice to be made a fool of.</P>
    <P>It is right that people should be cautious and should ask us not to run away with ourselves.  In framing this programme in the four and a half months of detailed discussion which took place over many nights and weekends, I think everybody was realistic.  The social partners and the Government are not a group of people who come together easily.  Some of the comments that are now being made would lead one to believe that we were all in the one camp and that we were all old travelling friends for generations. Nothing could be further from the truth. The social partners and the Government came together first of all out of a sense of necessity, based on the Congress of Trade Unions, 1986 document on the jobs crisis, on the NESC and ESRI reports and on the surveys of 1987 which attempted to halt the slippery slide that this country had begun towards national <Col N="1654" /> bankruptcy.  Unemployment was rising, inflation was out of control, morale was at a low ebb and both Houses were becoming unrealistic and were failing to provide leadership.  I think the social partners and the Government and general support for the programme have led this country back into a strong position. We have been praised by the greatest of financial magazines.  This has been followed by a resurgence of money into the country and the creation of investment opportunities.  All of this comes from a very small cycle.</P>
    <P>I listened to what speakers were saying in the other House and let Members of the Oireachtas not forget how every aspect of our economy is tied in.  Other countries do not have moderate pay increases and those are essential.  Moderate pay increases allow industries to improve their competitiveness; they allow them to sell quality products at competitive prices which help exports and allow us to compete against international trading partners.  That is the start of the battle.  If we succeed in doing that we create stability in our own economy, enabling us to plan our export strategy and to see where we are going.  It also helps Government planning.</P>
    <P>For years in successive Governments we have seen the Minister for Finance on budget day get up and talk about the figures for the year in billions and thousands. About a month later they would then start negotiating the pay levels, which is one of the biggest parts of the whole programme.</P>
    <P>At the end of the year, the markets and all the other right-wing agencies that affect our day-to-day lives, would ask why we were so much out-of-date.  The reason was that provisional figures were put in to allow Ministers for Finance to carry out certain policies, and those policies could not be carried out because the percentages were always too small.  There were huge over runs which produced leapfrogging; inflation rose because the expectations of workers were going up. The Government then had to borrow money externally because the internal markets were not aware that that would <Col N="1655" /> happen and everyone chased everyone else.  In trade union terms, everyone starts at the floor and runs to the ceiling. What happened here was that everyone started at the ceiling and tried to go through the roof, and the economy of the country suffered massively.</P>
    <P>We stopped that in 1987 and this programme will continue to provide that control.  We have moderate pay increases again, helping lowly paid people especially, by giving £15, £5, £5.75 and £4.25 respectively to different groups.  They are the people who will benefit.  We were very careful during the negotiations to ensure that low paid workers would benefit most by receiving the floor increases in the programme along the with family income supplement and by being taken out of the tax net at the bottom or by PAYE and PRSI reduction.  After that we fixed increases at moderate levels.  I am grateful to workers in the public and private sectors, from the biggest to the smallest company for making that sacrifice. It is sacrifice because they have to pay taxes and will suffer other reductions arising from those pay increases.  They are not net increases but gross increases.</P>
    <P>That policy will reduce inflation.  We will have none of this running from the ceiling to the floor, or through the roof. Let us be honest about this.  Nobody told me in 1987 that we would go from being high in the league of OECD countries in regard to inflation to the present lowest level of inflation in Europe.  That shocked even President Delors who had the graciousness to admit that quite recently. Low inflation allows us to do many other things.  Everybody shouts &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; about health policies, education policies and other policies, but if you do not have money or credit-worthiness you cannot do anything.  It is only by having moderate pay increases, low inflation and a competitive environment that something can be done in these areas because they are service areas that have to be funded almost exclusively by the Exchequer with a little help from structural funds.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer reflects what the economy can afford.  Low inflation keeps <Col N="1656" /> interest rates down.  We are now within two per cent of the German interest rate figure.  Three years ago we were eight per cent above the German figure.  If that is not a substantial improvement I do not know what is.  Low inflation and interest rates, or at least interest rates that are controlled <i>vis-á-vis</i> our partners generate investment here and will continue to do so.  We have a growth rate of four to five per cent and we are increasing our exports.  Moderate pay increases, if we have trading competitiveness, stability in our planning and our monetary figures in our budgets &mdash; not only the budgets of the country but the budgets of every private sector company &mdash; will generate investment, increased growth, and exports. That is when we will get jobs and not until then.  You do not just pull jobs off the top of a tree without first building up its roots and branches.  It is useless for people to think otherwise.  We have seen how countries in Eastern Europe and elsewhere have tried to pull jobs out of the hats, jobs without foundation, and they have come to nothing.  One must go through all other processes.  If we create jobs and help the long term unemployed, we can then generate wealth to provide the types of social services we all want.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that there is a better economic model.  For long enough in this country we did all the wrong things.  We are doing the right things now and I am glad of support from people who are serious about economic policy.  We are the envy of other countries.  People will recall that we were in the depths of recession and depression back in 1986. &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; and other programme teams went to Scandinavia to look at the models of society used there to bring people together.  No model as comprehensive as this was adopted in Scandinavia in the seventies or the eighties.  They had very good pay models but they did not have models that drew from the services sector, and from indigenous industries before matching and managing them as we have done in this programme.</P>
    <P>This programme far surpasses anything negotiated in Europe in modern times and the credit for that goes to the social <Col N="1657" /> partners, to John Dunne and his team, to Alan Gillis and his team, to all the farming bodies, and to Peter Cassells.  I want to single out Peter Cassells particularly because what he has done for us is not a three year programme alone.  The Congress of Trade Unions has set out a path which, if Governments follow it and honour the commitments involved will produce ten years of stability.  Considering what we have achieved after three years, surely it is not beyond the imagination of anyone to foresee progress. We have had some setbacks &mdash; I admit we had a number of breaks in the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>&mdash; I hope people will not be watching for a slip.  If people concede these benefits, then in ten years, we need not be harping away about social services and why we cannot afford this, that and the other; we can feel proud of what we will have achieved.  We have set an economic blueprint for achieving that and I want to thank this House for the opportunity of saying a few words on this programme.  I look forward to the debate and I commend the motion and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to welcome the Minister to the House.  He is always very welcome here and I know he listens carefully to our debates.  I would like to congratulate him on the part he played in bringing about this programme.  I know he worked long and hard and that he has used his own personal skills of persuasion effectively in bringing about agreement. I would also pay tribute to the social partners for their committment and for their involvement in bringing the programme to a conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must say that there are some good things in this programme.  Clearly people who worked long and hard, with the commitment of the people involved, would not produce a document which did not contain some good things and some points of significance and interest.  When the Minister talks about the Irish economy and of what we are doing being a model for the rest of Europe, and when <Col N="1658" /> he talks about the Scandinavians looking at us to emulate what we have done, I would say to him to hold on a while.  We would, first of all, like to see the results of this programme when it is in action and to see the effects of some of its aspects.  I would also say that the central defect in this programme is that it is based on an assumption that nothing can be done to alleviate the level of unemployment or to stem the flow of emigration.  It is a programme essentially for those who have, for those who are in employment now.  It does not in any creative or realistic way address itself to the central problem of this economy which is job creation.  That is its central weakness.  I would ask the Minister to hold on before he begins to hold out what has been achieved as a model for the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>In one sense the debate here today is pointless.  The consultations have taken place, agreements have been reached outside these Houses.  There has been no discussion or involvement by Members of the Oireachtas as such and yet today we are being asked to endorse lock, stock and barrel something over which we have no control, no input and no role to play. Many of us, not just on this side of the House but many of the Members of the parties Opposite in the other House have asked themselves what is the point of this debate here today.  When this point was made in the other House the Taoiseach, in his most lofty and Napoleonic <i>persona</i>, said that it was the role of Parliament to approve what Government had done.  I do not accept that.  If Government want to continue to shove the Houses of Parliament into irrelevance then so be it, but do not ask us for our approval or our connivance.</P>
    <P>This is not just some academic debating point nor is it a case of sour grapes. The Taoiseach claims that this document is the product of national consensus.  Up to a point it is; it is the consensus of the organised, the powerful and the articulate. It is a consensus which excludes the old, the sick and the unemployed. It excludes also the elected Opposition parties of both Houses of the Oireachtas <Col N="1659" /> and, indeed, the backbenchers of Government parties here and in the other House.  When the Government talk about trying to achieve consensus they are right.  Maybe it might raise a smile or two in those who saw the way the Government behaved when in Opposition but when the Government talk about consensus it is a most laudable goal.</P>
    <P>Countries which have pioneered consensus, as against confrontational style politics &mdash; I refer in particular to the Scandinavian countries and Federal Germany &mdash; believe that the starting point for a consensual approach must be within parliament itself, parliament and the diversity of groups represented here in Parliament.  Any process which begins by excluding Parliament can hardly hope to be termed, or deemed to be, a successful consensual approach.  Parties must be represented in the formulation of a consensus not, as in this case, having a consensus imposed upon us.  That is the very negation of a consensus.</P>
    <P>Government, I believe, are making a mistake in giving us here today a <i>fait accompli</i>, in asking us in a sense to have a pleasant debate, perhaps an interesting debate, but essentially a debate which changes or influences nothing.  What we say here on this or on the other side of this House, or in the other House, makes no difference whatsoever, apart from the Government speakers who, no doubt, will queue up to congratulate the Minister and the Government on what has been achieved.  The Minister and the Taoiseach said in the other House that many of the proposals contained in the document will come here ultimately as proposals couched in the form of legislation and we will be asked then to put them through.  If that is going to be the case, and given what is included in the programme, the legislative performance of the Government would need to be a great deal better than their track record to date.  If they are to get many of these commitments into reality this rather barren Order Paper will need to be fairly firmly augmented over the coming <Col N="1660" /> months.  We will have to wait and judge on that.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister said that we will have the right to examine the legislation when it comes here in detail. If that is what is proposed we accept that, and we look forward to seeing the legislation come here firmly an clearly laid out, the aspirations translated into the literal reality of parliamentary proposals. But that is something we have to wait for; we cannot judge now.  We have had aspirations before.  Each year we see a list of the proposals which the Government have.  They list proposals which they tell us will eventually take the form of legislation.  We have seen very few of them to date.</P>
    <P>This programme, to an extent, being in the Seanad, reminds me a little of Mr. de Valera in 1934.  In that year he decided to abolish the Seanad, he succeeded in abolishing it in 1936, but a year later he came back with a model for this Seanad. He was asked at that time why he was bothering and he said, &ldquo;a bad Seanad is probably better than no Seanad at all&rdquo;. In some ways the most that can be said about this present programme is that a bad programme is better than no programme at all.  There is a certain merit in having a programme for the next three years.  It gives some degree of certainty; it provides for some degree of stability and allows people to plan ahead with some idea of knowing what the environment will be, but only some idea because the small print in this programme and the small print as it will find its way into legislation, does warrant a great deal of very careful scrutiny.</P>
    <P>What we have here &mdash; with all respect to the Minister and the model, the <i>stupor mundi</i>, which this document has made of this Government with the rest of the world looking in to see what we have achieved &mdash; is a proposal which falls very far short of a coherent, well thought-out strategic plan which would allow companies and the other elements in the economy to plan ahead for the coming three years.  It is very far short of the hyped-up, super-document which the Government's very effective PR machine <Col N="1661" /> would have the country believe it got in this agreement.  What we have is not even a national wage agreement but a whole series of agreements with cunningly concealed clauses which, before too long, are certain to trigger inflation and to get us back on the spiral which the Fianna Fáil Government of 1977-81 initiated and fed and which we spent the rest of the 1980s trying to sort out.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat plan has many danger signals in it. Promises of corrective action by the Taoiseach, should it become necessary, are meaningless.  It took one of the sharpest political operators &mdash; and I am sure he will not mind me using the word &mdash; Deputy Charlie McCreevy to spot that. He knows very well that when a process of concessions and pay deals begins it is virtually impossible to halt that process. So talk at this stage of corrective action, if things go wrong, is meaningless.  If I may quote Mr. Colm McCarthy, one of the most realistic economists, who endorsed much of what the present Government did in 1987-89, he has been quick to point out his sense of incipient danger in this document, his sense that there are so many hidden mechanisms in here that we may well be starting something which will be very difficult to control a year or two down the line.</P>
    <P>Promises of corrective action are meaningless because we all know, especially as we move closer to elections, that it is almost impossible to put the brake on a process like that.  What we have is what we will get and I believe that the long term judgment on this document will see it as being the turning point in the fortunes of this Government, the end of a period of relatively good Government and the beginning of a return to the bad old ways.  We are perilously close to being, not as the Minister said, on the beginning of a ten year planned out programme but at the beginning of being back to short term territory once more. We are back in a situation of living for today and to hell with the consequences. It had to come sooner or later under this Government; the pity is it has come so soon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1662" /> The principal and the enduring failure of this programme is easy to pinpoint; it is in the area of job creation.  The proposals here are threadbare, they lack credibility and are an admission of failure.  There is no strategy in this document for job creation.  There are a series of proposals, frequently unrelated, with no underlying strategy.  We have aspirations but very few hard plans.  A central admission of failure in this programme is that it unashamedly accepts that unemployment and emigration will be as high in three years' time as they are today.  The National Economic and Social Council estimate that even if economic growth over the three-year period of the programme is almost twice as much as the Government project for this year &mdash; and that figure itself is now seen as being a little doubtful &mdash; emigration will still be running at 19,000 a year and unemployment in 1994 at the same level as today.  These are frightening figures and these are the figures which this document fails to address.  It is the background against which the document was framed and this is the central dilemma we find ourselves in today.  This programme does not live up to it.  It is hard to escape that reality and yet the programme flies in the face of it.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects to the job problem today but one central point is that we now have whole geographic concentrations of joblessness.  The expansion and creation of jobs in recent years has barely touched many of these areas, some of which are mentioned in the Minister's speech.  There is little point in telling the young people in these areas that the financial services sector will look after them.  They have not got the qualifications and, in any event, the performance of the financial services sector in creating new jobs is falling very dis-appointingly short of what was predicted, even some of the more modest predictions at the outset.  Only a fraction of the promised new jobs are likely to materialise and this was one of the great hopes of the Government for job creation.</P>
    <P>Tourism is another area mentioned in <Col N="1663" /> this programme.  Again, we are into aspiration.  Yes, progress has been made, but we saw in the budget the curtailment of certain BES schemes which, rightly or wrongly, were curtailed but certainly they are going to have an adverse effect on the tourism infrastructure this year. Tourism is something over which, unfortunately, we do not have full control.  We still do not know the effects of the Gulf War on the tourism prospects for this coming year.  Tourism is an area in which we must work but is not an area upon which we can bank with any certainty that it will provide secure all-the-year-round, reasonably well paid jobs.</P>
    <P>The area of biggest disappointment has to be the food industry.  Over the last number of years this Government, perhaps rightly, have seen the food industry as the main growth area for the creation of new jobs.  We were promised a Department of the Marine, which we got, which was going to ensure that the fish processing industry would be modernised and that we would be into the export of fish in a major way with the consequent creation of a great number of jobs at all stages.  That has been virtually a total failure.  We were told that our whole horticulture section would be revived, revitalised, that it would be brought into the world of new marketing techniques and so forth.  Unfortunately, we have seen very little results and success in all of that.</P>
    <P>I suppose the central problem here is that the food industry has concentrated entirely on the processing of food, putting milk into cartons, making of cheese, putting beef into the shops and so forth.  We are now faced with a situation, emphasised even today by Commissioner MacSharry, where the volume allowed to us will go down.  Milk will go down 2 per cent as mentioned today.  Intervention will probably disappear in a couple of years time.  We have a situation in the food industry, where we have shown far too little inventiveness in finding new products, where the basic volumes allowed to us are going to go down.  We have shown very little innovation in <Col N="1664" /> facing up to the problems.  As the food processing industries become more efficient, as some of them increase their production levels, become more efficient and more cost conscious, this is done at the expense of jobs.  The key factor today in the agri-business and in the food industry is cutting costs, in trying to get more and more efficiency.  Unfortunately, that has resulted and will continue to result in jobs being lost rather than jobs being created.</P>
    <P>I would love to think that this country, which God created to supply good food to other parts of the world, could become a major profitable source of food production. More important than that, it could give significant substantial employment to our young people.  But, unfortunately, all the trends in agriculture &mdash; and the Government do not have control over them by a long shot &mdash; are now indicating bigger, more efficient units but with fewer people working in them and outside market forces are going to put further constraints on the amounts we can supply.  I am afraid the food sector has been an enormous disappointment as the source of the new jobs we were all promised and hoped for over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>I could go on but there is not time to look at other sectors where jobs are promised.  I want to look for a brief moment at some of the educational provisions in the programme.  Some of these are worthwhile and my colleague Senator Joe O'Toole has certainly done a very good job for his union members in the deals he negotiated.  I never doubted that he would do a very good deal for his people and I am glad to see education given a degree of prominence in the programme. Quite frankly, most of the educational proposals there were in the pipeline for a long time.  They were normal trade union demands or, in some cases, were merely cosmetic changes, a sort of conscience money to those who will not get jobs and who are unlikely to get jobs and there is some sort of a sop being thrown to them in the form of <Col N="1665" /> retraining.  There is a good deal of aspiration in the educational section but nothing really radical or fundamental.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned FÁS.  I know FÁS is the Minister's baby, that he was the progenitor of FÁS, the midwife who brought it into existence but I say to him that I detect a great deal of unease about the role of FÁS at present.  I believe there is a strong view that the money being given to FÁS are not being spent nearly as well as they might be.  It has become over-large, cumbersome, not particularly good at reacting as quickly as it should. I am reflecting views I hear from people who are in business, civil servants, people in education, people who would like to see FÁS working but are concerned that it is not fulfilling its role as was intended. I would like the Minister to say how he sees the continuing role of FÁS in this area.</P>
    <P>There is one section in the Minister's speech that leaves me puzzled, where he deals with the provision of local education.  What strikes me there is that these educational pilot schemes will be in Tallaght, Cork and in a number of other areas.  They are there to train local people but I would like the Minister to elaborate a little, to train them for what sort of jobs?  Are these centres going to generate employment themselves or are they going to train people in the hope that the jobs will follow the training?  It is an interesting idea and I would like the Minister to spell it out a bit more in his reply.</P>
    <P>I said this programme has some good points.  There is some certainty in it, there is some consensus, there is some innovation and it would be churlish to say otherwise.  However, it is also, I believe, a very flawed document.  It is flawed for four reasons: the consensus base is too narrow; some of the pay claims it concedes will spiral and will undo much of the good work which underpins the Minister's inflation figures for the past few years; the reforms which it includes, especially in the area of education, are largely superficial and cosmetic and, most of all, there is no hope in this document for realistic job creation, very little hope for those who must emigrate, virtually <Col N="1666" /> no hope for those who are unemployed. That is the key fundamental defect with this programme and everything else it achieves pales into comparison beside it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this programme it is appropriate that we should look back on the usefulness of the previous <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i> Every Senator knows that this programme was introduced at a time of economic stagnation, a time of financial crisis which threatened the very economic life of our country.  The Minister said we should not look back and try to be political but that was the factual situation as we found it.</P>
      <P>We found at the time of introduction of this programme that the national debt had doubled over the previous three or four years.  Employment was getting out of hand.  Confidence generally in business and in the private world was at a low ebb. Now, three years later, we can stand back and see the great benefits of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and the biggest achievement was in the area of inflation.  We have been the envy &mdash; and the Minister commented on this already this evening &mdash; of many nations of our low inflation competitive economy which, of course, is essential for economic progress. This is surely the best basis for increasing employment, reducing unemployment and stopping the emigration of our young people to so many parts of the world.</P>
      <P>These fine achievements were possible because of the support and willingness of the social partners in our society to come together with the Government to establish an agreement necessary to restore the public finances and secure economic and social progress.  As I said and, indeed, as the Minister said, we have been the envy of other nations.  This cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of the programme just finished has been praised by many international economic commentators and there is no reason to believe that the present programme will not continue the onward progress of our nation.  Obviously a continuance of the approach of the <Col N="1667" /> previous <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was the right way forward.  The success of the previous programme has encouraged the Government and the social partners to engage in further discussions with a view to embarking on a new programme and to continue the success story of this great nation.  The Minister has commented on the type of discussions and negotiations.  They were not simple matters, they involved tough, hard talking.  He had indicated fairly that this programme was arrived at over a period of three or four months in a tough manner with tough people negotiating the best for their interests and the interests of the nation.  I can recall that three years ago we had many a doubting Thomas.  We had them on our own side of the House.  They felt that the programme would not, and could not, be a success. They have now been proved wrong.</P>
    <P>This Government clearly want the best possible opportunity for our people in the area of education, health, social welfare and, indeed, in many other areas of life. It is only right and proper that growth be given an opportunity to continue for the years ahead.  I see nothing wrong in important bodies like the trade union movement, the farmers, or the employers, all coming together with Government to set forward a programme for the years ahead.  Obviously we are encouraged by the success of the previous Government and the previous programme and I am confident that this one will be equally as successful.  We had more than one doubting Thomas on the previous programme.  We have them again on this occasion and we have them on our own side of the political divide too.</P>
    <P>I find the criticism different on this occasion because we are not so much saying we are criticising the programme itself but the fact that it was prepared in a manner &mdash; as indeed was the other one &mdash; outlined with the social partners and it is suggested in some way that the Oireachtas feels that their role has been reduced.  We have had, and the Minister has confirmed very lengthy discussion <Col N="1668" /> and negotiations with the interested groups.  Essentially this programme in its composition does not differ very much from the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> just finished.  Without the consensus the negotiations and the discussions with the social partners the programme could not be successfully concluded.</P>
    <P>In the overall programme of commitments made by the Government in economic and social areas, the social partners have themselves made a number of very important realistic commitments on major key issues.  Of course it can be said that to give effect to many of the commitments in the programme for financial legislative approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas is necessary.  I have no doubt that these matters will be discussed in greater length in both Houses of the Oireachtas when the time comes for such debate and will be scrutinised in great detail.</P>
    <P>It will be said too, that some of the provisions extended beyond the life span of the Government.  My understanding of this is that it is normal for Governments to make financial and legislative proposals which can extend into and beyond the lifetime of a Government, and any subsequent Government would obviously be free to propose changes if they felt those changes were necessary. Therefore, I do not think we are reducing, or causing any diminution in the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas in regard to the negotiations of either programme.</P>
    <P>The programme is now before the Seanad for approval, having been discussed and approved by the other House last week, and I would make the point that the approval we are seeking today gives the ultimate democratic mandate to the programme.  The specific legislative, financial and other provisions of the programme will come in time before both Houses of the Oireachtas for full debate, full discussion and decisions in the normal course of Parliamentary procedures.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the programme, I wish to speak on a number of issues, in particular education, health and social welfare. It is important to make the specific point that within the full programme <Col N="1669" /> there should be, and there is not, a letup on sound, firm, fiscal approach.  This is very clear throughout the programme. It is a correct and proper approach.  If we change or deviate from this outlook we certainly risk the chance of losing many of the vital ingredients necessary to continue in improvement in our standard of living and of damaging the climate for more jobs and the investment necessary to create jobs and to sustain these jobs.</P>
    <P>I would specifically refer to the area of education.  Quite honestly, I found Senator Manning's approach very simplistic indeed.  The area of education is very important to us.  I certainly would have to pay tribute to my Athlone colleague, the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, who is very strong in the belief that there should be a lot of consultation.  That is obvious in this programme. She obviously had a great deal of discussion with the various teacher unions and has worked out a programme which will, I believe, greatly enhance the quality of our educational system.  The list of the principal measures within the programme in education is endless.  Some of them more than others appeal to me &mdash; obviously one of them is the one which says we will improve the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>The move to provide greater resources to remedy disadvantages in education must surely be seen as very important.  We will now have a six-year cycle of post-primary education, which surely the unions will welcome.  This will create additional employment for teachers.  The provision of an extra 8,800 third level places to respond to additional demand for higher education, which has been a bone of contention, is something I welcome and which the people and educators will also welcome.  There is also an expansion of the adult education programme and my hope is that greater continuance will be given to the whole area of literacy, an area which I have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>On page 33 of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> reference is made to the higher education grants. This matter was debated at length at a <Col N="1670" /> Westmeath County Council meeting last Monday.  The question raised of increasing the income eligibility limits for families with more than one child attending third level institutions is something that is beginning to be discussed.  The Minister has rightly indicated that it is an aspiration in the programme and it is something, obviously, that I welcome.  In addition, of course, the Minister promised us in the programme a Green Paper on Education, which will be issued by this summer, a White Paper later on next year and then an Insurance Act.  All of this is proof, if proof were needed, of the concern of the Government to provide the highest standards in teaching facilities for all our children.</P>
    <P>In the area of health &mdash; and this is an area in which I have always had a particular interest &mdash; the Government clearly are committed to a radical overhaul and development of our health services. That is based on a number of key principles which are referred to on page 24 of the document.  The first is:</P>
    <P>The overriding principle is to provide a comprehensive, equitable and efficient health-care service based on prevention, diagnosis, treatment, management and rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>The second is:</P>
    <P>The focus is to be on the patient at all times.</P>
    <P>Again, the principle measures contained in the programme should be touched on.  One which is obvious, and which is very important in the whole programme, is the development of community-based medicine which will develop and expand services for the elderly, the physically and mentally handicapped or disabled, and will establish local health centres and expand the dental services.  This programme will be developed over seven years and will cost £190 million, commencing with the provision of £8 million which was made in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are other features, such as uniformity and consistency in the <Col N="1671" /> assessment of medical cards.  I would certainly like to think that there you have an element of flexibility, because a medical card to many people is something they appreciate and wish to have.  The might seldom use it, but the fact that they have it is very important to them.  There is also the improvement of health services for women and a charter of patient's rights. A point which I think is very important, is the question of better and more comprehensive health promotion, again something I welcome.  I believe that money in the area of health promotion is money well spent and time will prove that to be the case.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the spiralling cost of drugs.  This year the cost is £150 million, or 10 per cent of what is spent on our public health service.  While the fundamental approach is that a patient is entitled to have available to him or her the medicine necessary for their illness, nevertheless I believe there is an obligation on the prescriber to ensure that the correct volume of drugs is prescribed so that extra drugs are not left lying around people's homes.  If there is an equally efficient drug available which cost less, than that drug should be prescribed.</P>
    <P>The programme is very important for the health service because it outlines in a very positive way how our community care services should be developed.  I believe that when we develop our community care services further it will take the pressure of the hospital services. Daily we know of people who are put in hospitals who might be more appropriately left at home in the community. The programme spells out very clearly the direction in which we are going in the development of our community services. We have in the Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, a Minister who totally understands his role, a very caring and understanding Minister, and certainly he deserves our full support.</P>
    <P>Social Welfare is by far the biggest spending Department, with a budget of something like £2.7 billion.  The social welfare commitments in the programme are far-reaching and comprehensive and <Col N="1672" /> they set out the agenda for the next ten years.  They represent a realistic strategy for the reform of our social welfare system so as to make it more responsive to changing needs and better equipped to tackle the problems of poverty in society today.  The elderly, the lone parent family, the unemployed, the sick, the disabled, can rest assured that they will have a share in the prosperity which the programme is designed to create. Already, important steps have been taken to implement a portion of the programme. Indeed, the Minister for Labour in his address touched on one of them &mdash; the family income supplement.  He told us that the programme recognises the important role the family income supplement scheme plays in directing resources to lower paid workers with children while preserving the incentive to work and he gave us an example of the gain to an individual family.  A person with a family of four children on £160 a week will now be 36 per cent better off working than receiving unemployment and pay related benefit.  This is the kind of initiative I certainly welcome.  It is wrong that people should be better off on social welfare than working.</P>
    <P>The Minister also talks about the role of the voluntary organisations and I would like also to pay tribute to them. We in Ireland are unique in the extent of the voluntary social service work carried out by people in our own communities. Certainly, the new charter for voluntary social services proposed in the programme will set out a clear framework for partnership between the State and the many voluntary groups.</P>
    <P>I have touched on only a few areas of the Government programme.  It contains many impressive illustrations.  It is a very impressive document and worthy of our support.  Like the previous speaker, I, too, would like to congratulate both the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and the Minister for Finance Deputy Reynolds, who were involved on the Government side together with the social partners.  In approving the programme here today we are taking a number of important decisions that will enable our <Col N="1673" /> economy to grow, improve our standard of living and allow us a better way of life.  It is an opportunity the Irish people would not want to miss.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of discussion with Members on the other side of the House today I was asked, rather naively I thought, by a Senator on the Government side if I was going to support the Government on this matter.  I would like to put on record that I do not intend to support the Government on this matter today.</P>
      <P>The first item in this programme under the heading &ldquo;The Need for a Long-Term Strategy&rdquo; reads:</P>
      <P>The Government, the ICTU, the FIE, the CII, the CIF, the IFA, the ICMSA, the ICOS and Macra na Feirme have agreed this Programme to succeed the <i>Programme for National Recovery.</i></P>
      <P>I want to put on record that to me this is not the Government's programme.  To me, this is the programme of the social partners.  I am delighted the Government have lent their name and their support to this programme; they are one partner.  A number of commentators, particularly on the political scene, have immediately taken this programme as being the Government's programme and which, therefore, must be opposed.  I do not see it in that way.  I see this as a consensual response to a set of needs that were put forward by all the different interests I have mentioned.  This is the position at the end of the day.  This is something that I have voted in favour of and for that reason I support what is in the programme. I support it in the same way as I expect the Government to support it.  I support it in the same way as the farmers, the ICOS, the Confederation of Irish Industry, Irish employers, etc., support it.  This document is the consensual response of all those groups to the set of needs outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the restricted period of time we have to debate this matter I need to restrict myself to certain areas of it also. <Col N="1674" /> Without a shadow of doubt the distribution and redistribution of wealth can only be considered in the context of wealth creation and I have maintained consistently in the trade union movement that the creation of wealth is probably the sole common objective of employers, management, Government, workers and the trade unions.  There can be no distribution or redistribution without the creation of wealth.  The job of the trade union movement is to ensure that that created wealth is spread around and to ensure that those at the lower end of the scale &mdash; workers, unemployed, those in poverty, those in poor housing &mdash; share in the benefits.</P>
    <P>From my point of view I want to concentrate on the area of education.  Certainly, from the teacher's point of view we did have a shopping list going into the discussion on this programme.  We had a shopping list which was given to us by parents, management and those authorities running primary schools right through Ireland.  We were faced with a position where we had the largest classes in Europe.  We had, therefore, a mandate, a directive and a requirement to improve class sizes, to improve the pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we had the appalling position where we had more than 2,000 young teachers &mdash; fully qualified, fully prepared to work &mdash; unemployed or gone abroad.  We had a mandate and a directive to ensure that any programme would improve the position for those unemployed people in the education system. We saw teacher unemployment as being the source of the problem of large classes. The problem of large classes and the problem of the worst pupil-teacher ratio in Europe's primary schools could be resolved simply by employing the unemployed teachers who were out there.</P>
    <P>The other issue which was raised with us time and time again by school management authorities and by teachers in schools, particularly in small schools throughout rural Ireland, was the difficulty of organising the delivery of education in a school which could not <Col N="1675" /> afford to heat, to clean, employ caretakers, employ clerical assistants in the schools.  That became a requirement for us.</P>
    <P>Certainly, there were those three things: the need to improve class sizes; the need to wipe out or make a serious attack on teacher unemployment; the need to ensure an extension of the caretaker and clerk typist scheme for primary schools; and, coming through all that, the need to address the problems of disadvantage in primary education, whether that be disadvantage arising from educational disadvantage or socio-economic deprivation or underprivilege.  We needed, therefore, to find a response from Government and the social partners in the areas of class size, of teacher unemployment, of ancillary services &mdash; meaning the caretakers and clerk typists in schools &mdash; and also to address in a positive way the needs of the disadvantaged in the educational services.</P>
    <P>Those were, as it were, the riding instructions; those were the parameters of negotiations.  From my point of view my support for this programme has been determined by its response on those four main issues in the education area.  I do not have the time to go beyond the education area as we speak this afternoon.  Certainly, the members of my union, the INTO, have clearly been influenced by a variety of factors, including the provisions on pay, but especially in the light of the specific commitments on the various social and educational issues that are covered in the programme.  The Congress negotiating team tried to ensure that every relevant issue that has come before the ICTU in recent years has been taken into account in the protracted and at times very difficult series of negotiations that have taken place among the social partners over the past three or four months.</P>
    <P>The major attraction of this programme is that it covers many facets of social and economic activities, but many of the commitments in the programme that have been given in respect of the educational service have been the direct <Col N="1676" /> result of three years of discussion and negotiation in the Primary Education Review Body.  At an early stage in these negotiations the Irish Congress of Trade Unions put before the main negotiating team the set of recommendations that had come from the Primary Education Review Body, and that document itself was the consensus achieved through negotiations among parents, teachers, inspectorate, management, departmental authorities and representatives of the Government.  That document, with its 107 recommendations, was the result of an agreement achieved after almost three years of negotiation.  That then became the basis on which Congress negotiated on behalf of the primary education sector in the course of these discussions.</P>
    <P>Those demands were made really in an effort to defuse the anger and resentment of parents and teachers following what could only have been described as the hamfisted proposal by the Government in 1987 to worsen the primary school pupil-teacher ratio.  It will be recalled that that anger and resentment was demonstrated in massive protest marches at that time by teachers and parents in cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  There is no doubt that this has led to the position we are in today and the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> in a sense reflects those needs and demands at that time.</P>
    <P>The programme includes various proposals to improve the educational service and vital commitments have been entered into by the Government to bring about a gradual reduction in the size of classes.  It is only a gradual reduction, and the whole direction of the Minister's presentation today has been that we should look at this in the context of a ten year development.  From my point of view the ten year development, in terms of the pupil-teacher radio, has to be, of bringing the Irish class size down to the European average.  That will take time. It is something that can be achieved through a commitment from Government over the next seven or eight years. I want to put on the record that I see this, <Col N="1677" /> from the Government's point of view, as a commitment by the Government to make an investment in primary education.  It is an investment from which, I have no doubt, the State will reap due benefit and profit.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt, the implementation of the programme will begin the lengthy process of bringing our grossly oversized clases down towards the European average. Unfortunately, far too many pupils are still caught in grossly large classes in primitive school conditions.  Provided the commitments of the programme are honoured, over the next three years we will move towards a situation where our schools will be more adequately staffed and resourced and the educational and employment opportunities of young people will be greatly enhanced.  That is the reality at which we are looking at this time.</P>
    <P>Without a doubt we have to look at the impact of the programme, but we also have to look at its shortcomings and we have to ensure that the commitments given in the programme are honoured. Without doubt, the early parts of it have already been set in motion; the early commitments have already been responded to by Government and by those in a position to do so at this time. For instance, to identify a gap in the programme, I refer to smaller schools, schools with 100 or fewer pupils, which is the majority of schools throughout the country.  At present those schools are judged to be too small to participate in the extended scheme for caretakers and clerk typists.  For that reason we must be more careful than ever to look at the needs of those small schools in the future, and we must also respond to the needs of the smaller schools in staffing terms.  We have to look at the smaller schools as being the focal point of many rural communities.</P>
    <P>We discussed last week, and we are discussing again tonight, the problems of the rural sub-post offices.  In the same context one could discuss the importance of the local primary school, which very often is the local point of a village or a cluster of houses in many parts of Ireland. <Col N="1678" /> It is critical that we see to it that the service being delivered in those schools is top class.  It has the potential to be that, but the reality is that the funding for those schools meant that it has not been possible for them to clean, to heat and to maintain their buildings properly and adequately.  We have now decided that under the terms of this programme there will be a huge increase in the grants being given to schools to cover those areas but the increase applies only to schools with a hundred or more pupils so we have to look at the position of schools with fewer than a hundred pupils.  Many of the representative in this forum will know schools of the kind to which I refer.  In the programme it is said that this can be dealt with through an extension of the FÁS scheme.  I certainly would like the Minister for Labour to take on board that commitment in a special way.  It is unfortunate that he had to leave just before I could make this point.  I ask the Minister of State present to ensure that it is brought to his attention, as I have no doubt he will.  The Minister of State will certainly be aware that even in the school which is only 100 yards down the road from himself the need for caretakers in particular is vital.</P>
    <P>At present many of these schools are being serviced through a FÁS social employment scheme but the problem, and what the Minister has failed to understand, is that since FÁS has been broken up into ten different areas throughout the country, ten independent republics, many of them have forgotten what the social employment scheme is for and particularly what the &ldquo;E&rdquo; in the SES stands for.  Whereas most FÁS projects are training projects to bring people into preparation for employment, the SES is different.  The SES is an employment scheme on its own.  It is a social employment scheme, but unfortunately it is being operated in a different way by many of the FÁS offices.</P>
    <P>One of the problems that schools are facing in this area is that, once they have found somebody to employ as a caretaker or clerk typist under the SES, they are only allowed to retain that person for a <Col N="1679" /> year and they then have to go and look for somebody else, or they might not be allowed to have somebody for a second year.  This means there is no continuity. It shows very scant regard for the difficulty in a small rural community of getting somebody who is prepared to work on a part-time basis for £80 or £90 per week, which is what it is at the moment, particularly when it will have all sorts of impact on any other benefits to which that person is entitled.  That needs to be tidied up, in particular to allow schools who employ people under the SES either as caretakers or clerk typists to continue to employ such people beyond the period of one year.  It is a very small thing. There is no extra cost involved.  I would certainly ask Members on the Government side to take on board that point when they are speaking, because I have no doubt it is something that has been brought to their attention time and time again by authorities in small schools throughout the country.  It is a marginal request, a marginal demand, and it is one the Government should respond to immediately.</P>
    <P>Special provision has been made in the agreement to improve the facilities for disadvantaged pupils and existing provision and programmes will be extended to many more schools than currently benefit from such support services.  This is one area we have to address more than any other.  Senator Manning, when he was speaking earlier, said that this was a programme to benefit the employed.  As I have already outlined, two of the major plants which the INTO asked that the ICTU would put forward were, first, to deal with the problem of teacher unemployment and also to deal with the problem of disadvantage in the educational sector.  Both of those, I would put it to Senator Manning, are issues which do not relate to the employed; they refer to quite the opposite.  I ask Senator Manning to note that, because this is the reason I am speaking in favour of this report.  We need to be realistic.  I do not have all I wanted in this report.  I could have a list of demands as long again as the report but <Col N="1680" /> one needs to be pragmatic in approaching problems, especially in attempting to find a consensus.  In attempting to meet the demands of all the different groups I mentioned at the beginning it is necessary to make certain compromises.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that this programme will, first, improve the pupil-teacher ratio down to 25:1 within the next two years and improve it further beyond that point. Second, it will create at least 1,500 jobs for teachers who are at present unemployed, it extends the caretaker and clerk typist schemes to schools of 100 or more pupils and it allows for the expansion and extension of the FÁS scheme to give support to the smaller schools.  Finally, it also allows intervention to take place on behalf of the underprivileged in society through extension, expansion and the creation of new schemes to deal with disadvantage in primary schools.  For me those four points were where I began and those are the points on which I now support the programme.</P>
    <P>I also believe there will be a monitoring of the programme and I saw this happen through the course of the last programme. The question of non-delivery of commitments will not arise because peopole have signed on the dotted line and commitments have been entered into.  Those commitments will be honoured. The programme also includes a policing element to ensure that any difficulties that might arise in the implementation of any of the proposals are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Employment opportunities should also be created under this programme for a considerable expansion of the employment schemes in many different areas.  I also believe that in the tortuous negotiations on pay the Congress objective was to ensure that the annual increases would keep wages ahead of inflation or at least maintain purchasing power throughout the period of the agreement. It is not necessary to remind ourselves that the level of income tax is a significant issue for our members in unions and in employment through the country.  In these negotiations it has been possible to extract from Government what can only <Col N="1681" /> be described as modest commitments, but commitments nevertheless, that the tax burden will be eased somewhat over the next three years and that the standard rate of tax will be reduced to 25 per cent over that period.  This, of course, will be of special benefit to those on lower incomes, and that includes a very high proportion of workers in the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I see this programme as the basis for growth, as the basis for making progress and as something that should be given a chance.  The final determination of its effectiveness or otherwise will be the employment it creates and the successful efforts to allow people at the bottom of the scale to share in the benefits of increased wealth and economic growth. At the end of the day it will be the business of the trade union movement to ensure that those at the lower end of the spectrum will share the benefits that will certainly accrue over the next number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion. At the outset I congratulate the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, for his contribution, which has been recognised by all who were involved in negotiation of this programme, in bringing about this extremely successful and forward looking programme that will, I believe, make an enormous contribution to economic development over the next few years. Without people who can be forward looking and able to see the arguments from many different sides, this type of programme could not be negotiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate also all the other parties involved but I would like to single out the efforts of Peter Cassells.  For a number of years I have been a great admirer of his contribution and of the way he has led the union movement in this country. What is important is that the old archaic view of a union's role is largely changing into a much more modern and a much more forward-looking approach to the development of the whole economic area.  The unions see themselves as a key player in helping to bring about economic <Col N="1682" /> development, whereas in the past the old role was much more protectionist and defensive where they saw themselves really only coming to the fore if there was a strike or a dispute in a company.  This was really the limitation that in many ways they put on their involvement.  Peter Cassells, and others involved, and Bill Attley in particular, have made an enormous contribution&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran) Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran)">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Finneran)</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Senator not to name individuals in the House?  I appreciate that possibly the Senator was praising them but this would invite others to do the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was simply agreeing with what the Minister said.  I was here for his speech and he did the very same thing in his opening remarks.  I was going down that road in a complimentary way.  I would not do it if it was the other way, where a person was not here to defend himself.  It is important that we recognise the contributions of all these people in bringing about this programme.</P>
      <P>At times we tend to forget what a programme like this embraces.  The first thing to be said is that to have in existence a programme of this nature is a tremendous achievement in itself.  While it does not involve all vested interests in this country, or even among the political parties, while it does not involve everything that we would want, nevertheless the fact that we have now got the ability, after many years of failing, to bring all the social partners together into such a programme is a tremendous step forward.</P>

    <P>If we look back at the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, at the economic situation in the country at that time, our inflation rates &mdash; we were outstripping everybody in the league table, the league table we did not want to head &mdash; we see that in the short space of four to five years we have totally redressed that position. In 1986 and 1987 I remember looking at all the current affairs programmes and the constant message was to look at the Nordic countries, look at Denmark and what they have done, look at the miracles <Col N="1683" /> in those areas.  Being married to a Dane I lived with it on a daily basis for a long time and to the jocose slagging I had to put up with on the many visits I had to make to those countries, that we would never achieve it.  I am happy now to return to those countries and show them what we have done.  Indeed in many ways we have gone far beyond what they have been able to achieve.</P>
    <P>The important thing, of course, is that we see this document, this agreement, as a process of growth not only in the areas it outlines but indeed the areas that it begins to have an impact on beyond what is contained within the programme.  I recognise the value the contribution in the areas of health and labour relations, in the development of FÁS and the changes to be brought about in the educational area.</P>
    <P>I would like to move beyond the programme but what I say is contingent on it being expansionist within what it can potentially achieve, particularly as it is set in a framework of ten years, which is the decade of the nineties which will bring us into the next century.  It is in that context that I would like to make two points which, in a loose way, were referred to by the Minister for Labour earlier.</P>
    <P>The first point is that the integration of the EC internal market provides a new challenge and a new opportunity for Ireland.  The challenge, of course, is to place a far greater emphasis on skills and on the development of natural resources, which will bring sharply into focus the fact that industrial development policy must be based on ascertaining and promoting those enterprise sectors in which Ireland can have a relative, real economic advantage in comparison with our international competitor countries.  If we see the framework of this programme as a springboard into the potential economic areas, that means it is a framework for the next ten years.  This is why I want to expand and make two points which I believe the Government, and indeed all political parties, should be looking at.</P>
    <P>I want to make this argument for the <Col N="1684" /> following reasons.  When the EC internal market is ultimately complete, resources will naturally move freely to geographic regions of best comparative economic advantage.  In my view &mdash; I believe the Minister said this earlier &mdash; it would be a very great mistake for Irish industrialists to dismiss the potential challenge from the countries of central and eastern Europe.  These countries are not necessarily under-developed in an overall economic and social sense, East Germany, for instance, which is now the eastern part of Germany since the unification of Germany on 3 October 1990.</P>
    <P>As a point of interest, the former German Democratic Republic, the GDR, had a GNP <i>per capita</i> based on purchasing power parity in 1988 which, even at that time, was 23 per cent higher than that of Ireland.  The preliminary assessment of the EC Commission is that about 70 per cent of the former GDR is within the less developed region definition whereas the entire island of Ireland is still classified in the less developed area.  The Czechoslovokia GNP <i>per capita</i> in purchasing power parity terms in 1988 was almost identical with that of Ireland.  This brings into focus the evolvement of Europe and where, as a Community, we might be going.  It should force this country to look more sharply at our developing economic role.  Based on these comparisons it is obvious to me that the capacity exists within certain of the countries of central and eastern Europe to progress rapidly towards economic and social cohesion with at least some of the countries of the European Community.  Some of the countries of central and eastern Europe must be an attractive proposition for potential investors and traders because of their consumer market size, relatively low transport and distribution costs and development potential.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems in economic growth that we face in Ireland is this chestnut of peripherality.  Peripherality for Ireland is undoubtedly a fact of geography but it is also influenced by history and by attitudes.  If you like to look at it from the European point of <Col N="1685" /> view, Ireland is a peripheral island off the west coast of continental Europe. However, Ireland is also the nearest part of western Europe to North America.</P>
    <P>Although Finland, for instance, is, in a geographic sense, more peripheral than Ireland, Finland's GDP <i>per capita</i> in purchasing power parity terms is 70 per cent higher than Ireland, and Finland's unemployment is less than one-quarter of the Irish State.  Thus, relative to Finland, Ireland has still a society in transition. This is saying to us that we need to identify and develop our own strengths. However, a European view &mdash; this is a point which should be seriously considered &mdash; of Irish peripherality is a very negative concept and a more balanced picture can be got by looking to the west as well as to the east.</P>
    <P>An indication of how Ireland can be strategically positioned to gain from the interaction with the west as well as with the east can perhaps be obtained by looking at Denmark.  The Danes live at the north-eastern periphery of the European Community and they depend partly for their economic well-being on their interaction with their Nordic neighbours, Finland, Norway and Sweden.  However, Denmark is a member of the European Community but is also joined with her neighbours in a Nordic union.  This, of course, means that Denmark has the best of both worlds and has obvious economic advantage by being able to be a full member of the European Community but yet remain within a very strong Nordic union bloc.</P>
    <P>The question I am posing here &mdash; a question that many people in industrial circles in Ireland and political circles too, are posing &mdash; is there a message in this for Ireland?  Could Ireland join in a North Atlantic union with the USA while still remaining firmly within the European Community?  I believe that a North Atlantic union would be a trading arrangement which would work to the mutual benefit of the participants.</P>
    <P>I believe it is not a question of Ireland going cap in hand to the Americans looking for something saying, &ldquo;We need you&rdquo;.  It is nearer to the reverse.  Ireland <Col N="1686" /> has a lot to bring to such an arrangement. Ireland is a trading nation which already exports 80 per cent of the goods which are manufactured here.  Ireland is the trader who, in my view, being on the periphery of Europe, is proportionately on a par with Luxemburg and Belgium, the traders at the centre of the European Community.  This view of Ireland painted on the broad world canvas places Ireland strategically at the centre rather than on the periphery between the USA and Europe.  It is a much more positive approach than the negative view of peripherality off the western extremity of continental Europe.  A positive view of Ireland on the wider world stage can change our perception of geography and point the way to transform Ireland into a wealthy, developed, international trading centre.</P>
    <P>When we look at the logic of this I cannot see any particular argument that does not bring to this equation an equality between what we can offer on the American side and what they can offer us. After all, we are an integral member of the EC, looking to develop our economy, and we accept that is becoming more difficult because of the development of Eastern Europe and the likelihood of countries there becoming part of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our peripherality from a European view pushes us further from the centre.  The United States has a huge vested interest in the European market but it has also enormous fears with regard to the European market.  We have an advantage in our position.  We have an advantage in the language we speak, the language of commerce and of the United States of America.  We have one of the most highly developed telecommunications systems to be found anywhere in Europe.  That is crucial to the development of the type of areas where Ireland has the expertise.</P>
    <P>The link between Ireland and the USA has already deepened in the international trade and services sectors.  The combination of highly qualified and skilled people, together with an Irish modern telecommunications infrastructure, <Col N="1687" /> means that Ireland is now a desirable location for US financial service companies which want to locate in Europe. Internationally traded services do not necessarily suffer from the infrastructure cost disadvantages associated with a small island location.  We can see that by the type of companies that are locating here.  The global office is viable in any place in which skilled people exist provided there is a high quality communications network to support it.  USA companies which want to engage in international financial services and other data-based services can use Ireland as a strategically located base to beam into all continental Europe with the advantage that Ireland can work for the US during the offpeak hours because of the time differential between Ireland and the USA.  I see that as being consequential on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  These are the kind of things that, in a ten-year framework, we should be thinking about and how we can get the job.</P>
    <P>We can do so much within this country but we will be dependent on the European Community.  Do we necessarily and totally have to look at the European Community for total economic advantage? Are there ways outside the Community that can bring us the economic advantage and, more importantly, the jobs that we require to generate in this country?  It is because of the dangers of the expansion into Eastern Europe and the location of the greater manufacturing plants into markets where the greater number of people are that we in Ireland must look at alternative ways to create more job opportunities.</P>
    <P>Ireland should be looking to the areas where we have these major strengths. They include the high technology industries, knowledge-based industries, internationally traded professional services, internationally traded financial services and education and training services.  It is vital that Ireland should concentrate on those areas in which we can overcome the geographic problem of peripherality by way of those greater infrastructural improvements.  Greater emphasis on <Col N="1688" /> activity is the key to our real comparative advantage.</P>
    <P>Strategic trade alliances, particularly but not exclusively with the US, should be developed and examined.  If other countries in Europe find it necessary and convenient to enter into these types of alliances, it is inevitable that there will be a strategic alliance in the framework of the European Community, for the strength and advantage of those countries. One that worries me is the talk of Danubian alliance with the countries in that area possibly coming into the European community.  This further reduces our position with the Community and it further emphasises our need for the cohesive economic and social progress that we want.  The framework is in place. The Government have done a tremendous job in putting a framework in place that involves all the social partners.  These are issues that could be brought to such a forum, could be discussed, should be put in the marketplace in this country for open discussion.  It is totally legitimate for us as a country to look at those opportunities, seize upon them and go down that road.</P>
    <P>A secondary issue which I am anxious to mention is the financial services centre. It is unquestionably a great success and was a very sound idea.  The other area in Ireland that we are missing is the shop window of how we actually market and sell our goods and some of our services outside the country.  There are tremendous examples throughout the world of how this could be done.  I am convinced that within this country we need something like the World Trade Centre.  That may sound grandiose but it has enormous practical application.  If we even look to the St. Catherine's Dock development in the UK.  We can see that there is no reason why we should not have such a development here.  I would envisage this as a strategically located world trade centre which could become a commercial showcase for the export of goods and services from this country.  I believe that over the next few years this will happen. When the idea of the financial services centre was floated, people thought it was <Col N="1689" /> something beyond our capacity to achieve.  I do not believe any of these ideas are beyond us.  We have identified within the EC strategic ports for the delivery of our services and our goods out of this country.</P>
    <P>From the passenger side, we have the Rosslare route which is obviously the fastest route to Europe.  In my constituency of Waterford, Waterford Port is being designated as the fastest route for delivering goods and services into Europe.  If we decide to use the UK as a landbridge for the delivery of goods and services, we will automatically have built in for all time an economic cost disadvantage that we will never be able to surmount.  Because of the designation and the development that is being decided by Government at national level and agreed at EC level, that this is the way our goods and services should be delivered, the linkage into that is a world trade centre located in the south-east, in Waterford, alongside port development.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention that.  It may seem to be coming in a local context but this is an idea that has been floated by industrialists in Northern Ireland, in Dublin and throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am comfortable talking about this issue and floating it from a national and economic point of view.  I am sure there are many other people in both Houses who have good ideas that should be floated.  We need to get talking about them, get a consensus on them and make decisions on them.  The pace of development of eastern Europe is phenomenal and the integration of those eastern European countries within the EC makes it much more urgent for us to look at ways in which we can protect and develop our own economic advantage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many who are critical of the trade union movement for agreeing to this programme but that arises because they do not understand what the trade union movement is about. There are some critics of the movement in the political circles.  Some of this criticism might be due to envy that the trade <Col N="1690" /> union movement is involved in discussions on many topics and in these situations it might appear they were usurping the functions of some of the politicians. That is not the situation.</P>
      <P>There is only the one fixed principle in the trade union movement, that is the improvement of wages and conditions for workers.  However, they just cannot say that is what they will do and nothing more.  Life moves on.  If they want to play a constructive role in helping to establish a new society, trade unions have to widen their functions.  They will have to alter their structures and update their services. They, and particularly the leadership, will have to be in a position from now on to measure the trends and possibilities of production and distribution so that they can look at how the wealth is shared.</P>
      <P>In any debate about a national programme that may be agreed by the social partners from time to time, everyone must accept that it also involves the community as a whole.  I say that very deliberately because for a long time the community was excluded by both the employers and the trade union movement. Perhaps it is possible now that the community could appropriately be designated as the silent partner in this situation. Most of its contribution usually passes unheard but it is there.  I would like to emphasise the importance of the community and ask Senators to look at it this way.  If the community fails in doing what is expected of it, capital, labour and management will also fail in the performance of their respective roles.  For example, if the community fails to provide the natural resources and powers that underlie all production, industry will become a vast mechanism out of gear, it will move along, finally come to a halt and be silent.  That is the situation with regard to the involvement of the community and is a reason the trade union movement become involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community has to be admitted into a partnership.  It provides the natural resources and the powers.  The community in various ways maintains Government, foreign relations etc.  They are the important people, responsible <Col N="1691" /> for law and order, for transportation, communications, credit, banking etc, a whole list of things.  They can never be left out of any national bargaining.  It has been done down the years.  More enlightened people would probably have recognised that in other national programmes. The opponents of such involvement never seem to take into consideration the value of the community and the obligations we have to enable society to participate in discussions. Instead of talking about the parties to industry being three in number, namely, capital, management and labour, let us bear in mind that it is capital, management, the community and labour. There are always four partners, never just three and let us keep that uppermost in our minds.  Does this mean I am totally and utterly in agreement that everything in the programme was exactly what we needed?  Certainly not.  I have some reservations about the programme but I will always be supportive of the principle of consensus in economic and social planning. I welcome this programme like all national programmes I have welcomed. I was not happy about some aspects of the former programme but this one deserves a good trial before we enter into any knocking progress that would be so detrimental.  We can all put down motions in the Seanad or Dáil about support for families through increased child benefit payments over a ten year period. We can talk about the pay rounds in conjunction with the budget and all these things but the most effective way to deal with these matters in this kind of economic and social development programme. We can lay emphasis on those discussions on how the community based health programmes should be dealt with, how the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio should be achieved.  These are all pertinent matters that can be raised in the context of that programme.  For that reason, it is a valuable platform.  It puts a lot of order into society.  We have much work to do with regard to protecting what has been done in these agreements and developing them.  Certainly they have not <Col N="1692" /> reached the point I would like to see but they have achieved considerable improvements.  Our economy became industrialised quite recently so there are certain barriers to be broken down.</P>
    <P>The real bone of contention with the trade union people is the failure to produce sufficient jobs.  This has been a problem from day one and will continue to be a problem for a long time to come. We always run away from the idea of the State getting involved in manufacturing processes but there is nothing wrong with getting involved in manufacturing processes if they produce the right results. There is evidence of such results, as in the case of the ESB and a few other enterprises.  We have had wonderful results during the years with the electricity industry.</P>
    <P>The worrying aspect of this whole question of job creation is that it appears the Government seem to have accepted that the vast majority of the long term unemployed will never work again, although I do not think they have said it in that way. It seems to me that if they have not got targets and programmes of incentives to employers to fill vacancies from the dole queues, if they have not got a concerted programme for employers in the public and private sectors we will not realise this aspiration.  We will have to press a bit harder on it.</P>
    <P>Is the desire amongst private people to produce the jobs still lacking?  Down through the years my criticism of the private sector was that there really was not that drive or initiative amongst them to get into job creation.  I welcome the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, I hope the programme will ensure further developments in the future.</P>

    <Title>An Post Cutback Proposals: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> The following motion was moved by Senator Cosgrave on Wednesday, 20 February 1991:</P>
    <P>That in view of the requirement placed on An Post in its memorandum of association to meet the social and household needs of the State, as well as its industrial and commercial needs, and in view of the decision of the management of An Post to implement certain changes particularly the closure of 550 post offices, Seanad Éireann instructs the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications to issue a direction to An Post under sections 110 of the Postal and Telecommunication Services Act, 1983, to refrain from changes which would have the effect of damaging the social fabric of rural life and increasing the isolation of individuals and disadvantaged groups in society, until such time as it has prepared and published a revised viability plan which the Minister certifies to Seanad Éireann is fully in compliance with the social obligations of An Post under the said Act.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann supports the Minister for Tourism, Transport and Communications in his recent decision to engage in talks with An Post in relation to the Company's Viability Plan and urges him to take full account of the economic and social role of the sub-Post Office network.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Cassidy.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week when I was speaking on this topic I mentioned some aspects of the proposed plans from An Post and I also referred to the Minister's response.  What I want to deal with this week is those aspects which were lacking in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1694" /> The response from the Government has dealt merely with the non-employment aspect.  They have not addressed the fact that 1,500 jobs are to be scrapped. Why did the Minister not consider it necessary to refer that matter to the NESC for examination?  He has referred to the issue of the closure of post offices, and the other issues to them.</P>
    <P>I said last week that since An Post were set up as a private company almost eight years ago the work force in both An Post and Telecom have proved themselves to be adaptable, pliable and ready to meet the needs of a modern, electronic age. The have proved time and again that they were ready to accept recommendations and proposals from management.  They have been co-operative in the extreme but they have now been dealt a killer blow by management with this set of proposals. It is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I referred last week to the need for a European postal service which would be uniform in its delivery, efficiency and effectiveness.  Ireland is on the periphery of Europe.  Ireland, because of emigration, etc., and its history will always, to use the language of commerce, import more letters than it exports.  In that sense, the Irish postal service will to some extent subsidise European and other postal services. That is the nature of the postal business.  I am not addressng that issue. At Community level recently it was considered very important that the Community would be prepared to resource, support and finance a Community postal service, paying particular attention to those services on the periphery.  I want a response to this point.  I want to hear from the Minister what attempts the Government will make to ensure that Europe, which is demanding a uniform, effective and efficient postal service will support, pay for and resource the Irish postal service to some extent.  They have indicated that they are prepared to examine that.  That offer should be taken up by the Government in the context of the present review of An Post's proposals.</P>
    <P>The union dealing with the postal workers have asked that this matter be referred to the ESRI.  I note that the <Col N="1695" /> Minister intends sending it to the NESC. I did not know that the NESC had the resorces to address this kind of problem. They are simply going to buy in support services and consultants when they could have got them in the ESRI.  That in itself is ineffective and smacks a little of a dog in the manger attitude &mdash; just because the union has proposed something the Minister decides to do something else.</P>
    <P>This should be considered in a number of other contexts, for example, we were discussing an hour ago the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Government's commitment to job creation.  It must also be looked at in the context of rural Ireland.  How much more do we have to see?  We have seen the attacks on hospitals and schools.  We are now looking at an attack on post offices. Shortly there will be no small farmer left in the country.  This is part of a plan to raze rural Ireland and destroy the infrastructure of rural communities.</P>
    <P>The post office is an essential part of rural life and it should be seen as such. Those who look at An Post from their ivory towers in the centre of Dublin and talk about savings here, killing jobs there and closing offices, are unaware of the realities of life as they exist outside the Pale.  The Government should consider that.  This is the reality: nobody cares any more.  We are not taking a close look at the impact this will make on rural Ireland. The Government should refer the whole plan to the NESC and not just two-thirds of it.  They should also assess the impact of the job losses.  The Government should address the social aspect of the postal service and see that it is taken into consideration. We should address the social impact of An Post's proposals, how they will affect the rural infrastructure and the intricate sets of relationships in small rural communities &mdash; the importance of the arrival of the post as a means of making contact in a community which is badly under-resourced in terms of social workers and other social contacts.  The reality is that the postperson in many parts of rural Ireland is doing a job that will have to be done by somebody else if <Col N="1696" /> we take away the postal service.  If post boxes are put at the end of lanes there will be no contact with the people.  That social aspect must be looked at.  It is easy for us in the centre of the metropolis to forget about what life in the country is really like.  We should address that aspect.  We need a social audit to assess the damage that is likely to be done to the social structure of rural Ireland as a result of the implementation of the swingeing cuts proposed by An Post. They are not acceptable.  They are a slap in the face to a group of the most pliable, accommodating, supportive and co-operative workers.  They have responded to change.</P>

Obviously the outcome of the deliberations of the NESC report will be of great interest to rural Ireland.  It is <Col N="1697" /> important that this House should put on record that this viability plan &mdash; I use the word &ldquo;viability&rdquo; advisedly when it comes to a body like An Post &mdash; and the threatened closure of 550 sub-post offices is, as has been said and as should be repeated as often as possible, a threat to the existence and viability of rural Ireland.

      <P>No matter what part of rural Ireland one comes from, whether Kerry, Limerick or Leitrim, people feel increasingly powerless.  They feel threatened, isolated and frustrated by the democratic process.  This is a real danger. It is something that has crept in over the past couple of decades.  Viability plans such as those proposed by An Post are nothing new to rural Ireland.  There have been all sorts of viability plans proposed by semi-State bodies down through the years, all of which were to save rural Ireland or for the general good.  Ultimately they turn out to be a damp squib and more and more people leave.  This proposal is the thin end of the wedge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could not help but chart my own existence as a small boy in Drumshanbo in County Leitrim up to the present day in terms of the threatened and actual <Col N="1698" /> withdrawal of services from my small community.  In the late fifties it was the branch railway lines.  The economic experts of the day told us if the railway lines were closed down viable road transport for freight would be provided and there would be an increase in bus transport so that we really would not miss the trains at all.  The closure of the station in Drumshanbo cut many of us to the quick.  Even though it is 32 years ago I still remember it as if it were yesterday such was the impact it had on my young life.</P>

Schools where, dare I suggest, the education one received was in some cases superior to the education many children are receiving in our central schools today. The people who taught in those schools were usually of the community or were related to members of the community, they were heavily involved and made a contribution to the area and to the overall general education of the young people in their charge.  They were small schools but their size and intimacy created a pride and an identity with the parish in which they were located.  Now the children are taken by bus away from their natural environment.</P>
      <P>We had the closure of indigenous industries.  Recently in my part of the country the Arigna coalmines were closed, despite protestations and an entire community rising up in anger and saying &ldquo;stop&rdquo;.  John Healy often said: &ldquo;nobody shouted stop&rdquo;.  The people of north Roscommon and Leitrim shouted &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and did so for the past number of months.  Yet, nobody seems to be listening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times there was a subtle attempt to reduce manpower at rural Garda stations.  In Drumshanbo, for <Col N="1699" /> example, we had three gardaí and a sergeant. Now only one is living there.  This latest blow at the already stricken heart of rural Ireland is really too much for ordinary people to accept.  Now we face An Post and their viability plan.  I compliment the Minister, Deputy Brennan, and acknowledge the presence of Deputy Lyons, Minister for State.  He comes from a mix of a rural and urban constituency and will fully appreciate much of what I am saying.</P>
    <P>Many of the things we are saying about this plan have been said before but they need to be repeated.  There is need for a root and branch investigation of the activities of An Post.  Allegations of mismanagement have been made, especially in Dublin.  I have before me a letter I received from representatives of the staff in the Carrick-on-Shannon post office from which I quote: &ldquo;The ironic part of the plan for the post office in the provinces is that due to mismanagement of budgets by the company in the Dublin region the company has incurred losses almost equal to the total company loss for 1990.&rdquo;  I would like to ask the Minister, a number of questions he may answer if An Post condescend to give the answer considering the attitude they adopted towards an invitation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  One wonders whether they are the people in the ivory tower.</P>
    <P>Can the Minister give a breakdown of the figures for the Dublin region and the provinces in relation to income, turnover and expenditure?  Allegations have been made that the overtime bill in the Sheriff Street sorting office is somewhere in the region of £20 to £30 million.  I have not been able to get a specific figure.  Is it true that the company allowed wholesale featherbedding especially in the Dublin region in relation to staffing and failed dismally to exercise their obligation to make An Post a viable entity?  Figures seem to suggest that when An Post was first created as a separate entity they had £29 to £30 million of a surplus.  That does not compare well with the massive debt they now have and which they suggest <Col N="1700" /> they will continue to have unless they take this action.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others touched on the discussions at European level calling for an equitable distribution of the postal services throughout the Community. Our location and demography should entitle us to some assistance with that.  We are grateful to the communication workers union for taking the trouble to put together a submission in relation to the viability plan.  In the context of policy proposals in Europe under the heading of &ldquo;possible need for community to invest in cohesion&rdquo;, they state that poor performance of any part of the Community's postal services affects other parts of the infrastructure, causing loss of cohesion in the Community.  I was astounded to read &mdash; I hope it is not true, although it was not rebutted &mdash; in one of the newspapers last week that a faceless civil servant in Brussels, when asked about the possibility of money being given to ensure the viability of the rural postal service in Ireland said in effect: &ldquo;We will not support lame ducks; if the post office cannot pay for itself that is their problem not ours.&rdquo;  That is some friend to have in Europe.  We are told we are a very important part of the European Community, that we have a contribution to make, our peripherality will be taken into consideration and we will be given more structural funds, that because we are such decent people we will not be allowed to go down the tubes.</P>
    <P>We are facing a real crisis when it comes to pass that semi-State bodies charged with certain responsibilities can, seemingly without even having half a sleepless night, come up with proposals that will wipe out the identity of entire regions.  That is the core of my argument. It is not just directed at An Post but at any semi-State body or agency which is within the public domain.  They have a moral obligation to ensure that there is an equitable balance between city and country.  Those of us who live west of the line, or outside the old Pale, have every reason to be angry, frustrated and annoyed when we see the steady erosion of the services we took for granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> Put at its simplest, if you as a family person were considering locating in a part of Ireland that attracted you because of its environment, or because of its ready access to larger centres, would you not have second thoughts if over a period of years you saw the community lose its Garda station, post office, national school and all other State agencies? Unless you wanted to be a hermit you would not live in a community like that. Many of these communities were, and should be, permitted to be, viable and strong with a very real sense of identity and pride.  I am not a great man for remembering quotes from books I read, no more than I am at being able to tell jokes.  I wish I had that ability.  Senator O'Toole has a wonderful ability for doing that.</P>

I had nothing to do with medals, power or glory, but for the good of the parish.  At the end of the day that is what rural Ireland is about.  That is the real Ireland, not the one that has been portrayed here and is often portrayed in the national media.  I fully support the efforts of the Minister to ensure that An Post are put back in their letter box and told that their plan is not on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I came to the unfortunate conclusion as we entered 1991 that rural Ireland is being abandoned, either by design or mismanagement and no longer counts.  Many important infrastructures are under serious threat.  Rural Senators have already outlined some of them &mdash; schools, Garda stations, railway stations, the health service, a county road system that is in the last stages of utter collapse due to lack of finance, housing needs put on the back burner, emigration which is sucking the blood from rural Ireland, unemployment which is like a cancer and a serious agricultural crisis facing us in the near future which will wreak havoc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1702" /> Our social conscience is being privatised by the semi-State bodies.  People no longer count.  It is bookkeeping and financial rectitude that counts, not the people or their right to a living or to a service.  If the An Post plan is put into operation it will be the final act which will cause the disintegration of rural Ireland.  It must be scrapped and not just until after June.  The Minister must give a commitment to put the whole plan before the NESC.  Do the planners understand the full implication of this plan on rural Ireland?  Do they appreciate that rural Ireland exists or do they think Ireland ends at Newlands Cross?</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that rural Ireland is entitled to the same industrial and economic opportunities and service as the city of Dublin.  I do not want to create an urban rural divide but it seems as if the eastern seaboard is all that counts.  We are repeating history in that those inside the Pale will survive but outside the Pale, forget it.</P>
    <P>I attended meetings last Friday and Monday and the more we thought about the plan the more we realised that the group of people who devised it would be entitled to the GUBU award of the year.  For the sake of £1½ million, they were putting in jeopardy the jobs of 1,500 people and wiping out 550 sub-post offices.  Go down the road and see the Palace of Versailles where £17 million was spent to upgrade Government offices.  I appreciate that is worthwhile but go down to Newtown or Garrykennedy in my constituency and tell them that they are going to lose their post office for the sake of £1½ million and that 1,500 jobs will be lost.  If they go to the Spring Show in May and visit Merrion Street, they will see the coloured lights and will not know whether they are in the White House or in Buckingham Palace.  One must relate the cost of providing that office to the cost of other services.  I regret that that must be put on the record.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the motion.  The plan is an act of economic lunacy.  We in rural Ireland endeavour to attract industries to our different towns and villages because <Col N="1703" /> nobody else will do it for us.  The Chair comes from rural Ireland and he knows that if the service is withdrawn from a village or town, industrialists will not locate there.  We are in the process of welcoming the decentralisation of the Revenue Commissioners to Nenagh; 200 staff are going to be transferred there. Perhaps some people might not like to see tax offices in their area but we are delighted to welcome them.  It will be a boost for the economy.  They are expected to create at least 50,000 letters per year.  Where is the sanity in decentralising one service while at the same time downgrading a post office that was built only 15 years, one of the most modern post offices in the country?  It will not be enough for the Minister, Deputy Brennan, to take this back to the drawing board, he will have to get the plan and tear it up.  He will have to pick a mixed team, a rural team, not a team from Dublin only, to draw up a plan.</P>
    <P>We take pride in our capital but there is more to Ireland than the City of Dublin and I hope and pray that the Minister will live up to the firm commitment he has given.  I attended North Tipperary County Council meeting yesterday and we were at one on the matter, politics aside.  We said that if the plan was introduced it would be the final nail in the coffin of rural Ireland.  The post office is a major piece of infrastructure that we have to defend and I for one repeat my call on the Minister who is a rural man himself, coming from County Galway. We are fighting for survival in rural Ireland.  We are looking beyond 1992 and it happens to me that the people in rural areas will not have a say in what happens to their country.</P>
    <P>How could anyone suggest putting a mail box at the end of a five mile road in rural Ireland and expect people living on that road to come down every day, in hail, rain or snow, to check the letter box?  A pensioner or a person looking for an invalidity pension might have to come down to the end of a boreen &mdash; a boreen that is linked together with potholes.  I firmly oppose it and I can assure you, a <Col N="1704" /> Leas-Chathaoirligh, that rural Ireland is up in arms over this proposal.  It is no good saying that it is going to be adjourned.  It will have to be scrapped and redrafted with a firm commitment to the survival of services such as the postal service in rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather loath to come in at this point following on from my colleague from North Tipperary, Senator Ryan, because it may appear to be political interference.  Senator Ryan knows where I stand on this issue.  In a sense, this discussion is superfluous in view of the decision made by the Minister last week when he instructed An Post to defer any decisions until such time as the NESC would review the situation. Minister Brennan coming from a rural area as he does, would understand the position in rural Ireland in relation to post offices.  I agree with all the other speakers who say that to implement the plan as proposed by An Post under present circumstances and in its present from would have a disastrous effect on rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is important for people in the Dublin area to understand exactly what the post office means to the large number of villages and small towns in the country. With modernisation and the closure of a number of small schools, the post office in the small village, together with the local pub and church, has become the focal point for people who live in rural areas.  We may all have had the experience when traversing the country of getting lost in a by-road and of being happy to see the post office because you know that you would get friendly attention and advice and direction there.  It is the place one always heads for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Post offices in rural Ireland also fulfil a very important function for people receiving social welfare benefits.  The local postmistress or postmaster, or people who work in post offices, know the areas in which all the old people live and if, for any reason, the pension was not collected on a particular day the word would go out and neighbours would be asked to check that everything was all <Col N="1705" /> right.  From that point of view alone, apart from the professional services they give, the social functions of the post office is extremely important.  That has to be acknowledged and recognised.  I am delighted with the Minister's decision.</P>
    <P>One could question the motives behind An Post's proposal.  Times have changed and modern communications have put the present difficulties of An Post into perspective.  Many jobs performed in the post office a number of years ago have gone by the board because in business terms the fax machine has virtually done away with the ordinary business letter.</P>
    <P>One would have to ask why An Post did not get involved in other types of financial services.  The building societies were quick to move in and to press for the opportunity to diversify when they felt that the brief they had started with was being eroded by competition from other sources.  Why would An Post, rather than closing down many of those vital links that are so important to rural Ireland, not introduce other financial services and compete with commercial institutions such as building societies, banks and so on?  They have access to small savings and many people would hope and expect that they would cater for people with small sums to invest.</P>
    <P>Reference was made this morning to money lending.  A state agency like An Post could perform an important service for the small saver by diversifying, giving them the opportunity to do all their financial business with the post office. They are many decisions that could be taken to improve the services and viability of An Post rather than a blanket decision to close a certain number of post offices throughout the country.</P>
    <P>To blame a specific Minister or the Government is unfair because the whole idea of semi-State bodies is that they should be autonomous as for as possible. You cannot tell people that they are an autonomous body who may draw up policies and implement them without interference and then say that they may draw up whatever policies they like but that they will not be allowed to implement them.  There is a distinction to be made <Col N="1706" /> between a Department and a semi-State body.  Having said that, one recognises that the Minister had a very difficult decision to take when he saw the blueprint for bringing An Post out of very extreme difficulties.</P>
    <P>One must recognise the fact that An Post are in serious difficulties.  The amount of money An Post lost last year and are expected to lose this year is enormous. Closure of a number of post offices throughout the country would result in very small savings in terms of the overall financial structure of An Post.  However, the social effect of such a decision would be enormous.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister again on his intervention at a very timely stage.  Lest anyone would assume that this is a ploy with a view to the local elections, if they are going to be held in June I hasten to add that if so the Minister would have instructed An Post not to reveal this until after the local elections. I think we will have to nail that one.  The fact that the Minister has intervened at this stage shows he is concerned about the situation irrespective of whether elections are held in June or at some other time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>If the House is agreeable, I would like to share my time with Senator Jackman and Senator Hourigan.</P>
      <P>This proposed rationalisation plan by An Post can only be part of the continuous threat to rural Ireland, which has been devastated by depopulation arising from emigration, and other problems.  It is being devastated by the closure of many small shops and by the continuous threat to them posed by supermarkets.  It is being devastated by the closure and rationalisation of schools and by the ratinalisation of the co-operative movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own constituency the implications of An Post's proposal are quite horrendous.  Apart from the ghastly plan to get rid of sub-post offices and to introduce green letter boxes, it is proposed that Cootehill Post Office be changed from a district office to a sub-office; that Belturbet office be changed from district office to sub-office, although Belturbet <Col N="1707" /> has much unemployment already.  It is proposed that the status of the offices in Carrickmacross, Clones and Castleblayney be changed.  It is also proposed that both Cavan and Monaghan be reduced from head offices to district offices.  That will depress the commercial life of those towns and will add to unemployment and break public morale.  It is a ghastly and unacceptable proposition.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reply to the following point.  The Minister, Deputy Leyden, and his colleagues speaking in Boyle, County Roscommon, the other night stated categorically that the proposals to introduce sub-post offices and green boxes had been vetoed and were now history.  This would be very good news if it were not at variance with what the Minister, Deputy Brennan, said in the House last week.  Was Minister Leyden right when he said in Boyle that the proposals were permanently vetoed or was he misleading the people of Boyle? That would be horrendous if it were the case.</P>
    <P>My essential proposition to the House is that the proposals to close the sub-post offices are a grievous threat to rural Ireland, are most unacceptable and must be blocked.  I am not so sure that Senator McKenna, despite his idealistic naivete, is right to rule out the local elections as a consideration.  I would be of a more cynical frame of mind and would be of the view that the local elections are a factor in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I would want an assurance from the Minister that the position will not alter in a post-local elections situation.  Essentially, I rest my case by saying that this poses a grievous threat to an already threatened rural community. It presents the horrible spectre of increased unemployment and the potential emigration of post office workers.  It is important that at every opportunity we voice our horror at it.  I look forward to a specific commitment from the Minister <Col N="1708" /> at the end of tonight's deliberations that the matter is history at this stage and that it will never come to fruition because nothing less than such a commitment would be adequate for this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Reilly for giving me five minutes of his time.  It is interesting that when we were debating the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> today that the whole emphasis of the Senators who spoke was on the plight of the voiceless and the unemployed.  What I find extraordinary is that employment is being wiped out here; instead of creating jobs we are actually getting rid of them and it is something I feel will be raised again and again when we are talking about rural development and the creation of employment.  In the PESP we found there was little or no vision for the creation of those jobs.  What we have are closures: 48 of those 554 closures are proposed for urban areas and what surprises me, and I think Senator McKenna would agree, is that 12 months ago the Minister requested that this rationalisation take place.  Local elections were to be held last year, now it is supposed they will be this year.  There is no doubt that management are opposing political pressure and we do not accept that this proposal was not a ploy to force the situation.  Fianna Fáil councillors at the Limerick County Council meeting were under no illusion that this had to be done so that it would not become a local election issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What surprises me is that NESC or the ESRI were not used at the beginning when this rationalisation was supposed to take place.  They ought to have been commissioned before the chief executive and the board were directed to rationalise. It was then that we needed to be told the social implications.  In the PESP we have a business plan which does not take any account of social obligations; in paragraph 89, page 60, of the PESP there is the following quote: &ldquo;non-commercial obligation to be clearly defined and taken into account in assessing company performance.&rdquo; The blueprint was there to ensure that the social aspect would have <Col N="1709" /> been considered before the plan was implemented.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Pale and its existence, we may as well redraw the map of Ireland to ensure that everybody knows of the existence of the Pale.  We outside the Pale are being asked to pay for the inefficiencies and soaring costs of the Central Sorting Office in Sheriff Street.  That is how I see it.  I will not go into the closure of schools or the cuts we heard of in the news this evening which are going to devastate the rural parts of this country.</P>
    <P>In those rural areas you have entrepreneurs, despite the assumption that all entrepreneurs are urban based.  Those entrepreneurs were the people who kept the post office, developed it into a thriving business, employed people, functioned as social centres and as true integrated rural development centres. We talk about integrated rural development but it means nothing at the moment.  What exists is integrated rural development through those post offices. They are not just a rationalisation for costs; we are retaining a culture and a communications centre.  As one of the Fianna Fáil Senators said a moment ago, they are true communication centres.  We will be very vigilant to ensure that something is done about the £16 million, which will turn into £24 million if rationalisation does not take place.  I find it hard that the economists cannot find £1.5 million elsewhere.  It could be found without interfering with the sources of employment and with the social fabric of this country.  I hope that in the new plan there will be a balance in relation to anything that is so important to us throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To make the best use of my time I do not intend reading this long motion tonight for the consideration of the Seanad.  From listening to our colleagues it is obvious that there is full agreement that the plans proposed by An Post should be left aside.  It is a very roundabout and costly way of saving a small amount of money.  In order to save £1.5 million one is talking about the destruction of 1,500 jobs and the closure <Col N="1710" /> of 550 post offices in rural areas mainly. That is not the whole story.  Linked in very closely with these developments will be many people who will be indirectly affected.</P>
      <P>I agree totally with what Senator Mooney said earlier.  Any diminuition of the kind of scenario he outlined would be very serious.  One of the last vestiges we have to times past is the rural post office and if we are now to close them, in addition to the various other closures that have been referred to, it would be very serious.  In rural Ireland it would cause devastation of the entire community.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased with what the Minister has directed to be done before any further move, which is that there should be a thorough investigation by the NESC of this whole operation.  In the light of the resolution which we have put before this House this evening, we are asking that this plan be left aside until such time as the NESC have prepared and published a revised viability plan which the Minister certifies to Seanad Éireann.  The Minister has undertaken to come before this House with a commonsense plan and I would accept that rationalisation is necessary.  There is no point in burying our heads in the sand.  Things cannot go on now as they did 50 years ago.  We do not, however, have to devastate and destroy the whole social fabric and base of society in rural Ireland.  I would appeal to the Minister to make certain that the team who prepare the next plan are people with a clearer and more positive understanding of life in rural Ireland and of the importance of various amenities. Too often people in ivory towers believe that they know what is good for the Irish nation, for the Arignas or anywhere else. It is not long since we were discussing Arigna here.  It is regrettable that while we do have a fair measure of success in job creation, we are eroding that success very seriously by these proposed closures which are massive and numerous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues here to vote <i>en bloc</i> for this motion to express solidarity. I appeal to the Minister to come forward with a properly thought out plan that has rationalisation to the fore and <Col N="1711" /> which does not resort to cheese-paring nor destroying rural Ireland.  We know from a tourist point of view that maintaining rural Ireland is essential so that our economy does not merely survive but can progress further down the road.  I wish to say much more but I will conclude by asking that we all express our solidarity by uniting on this motion calling on the Minister to do the correct thing when the time comes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion on An Post is one of the most important motions to come before us for some time.  It is not simply a matter of the post office; it is a matter of our whole attitude towards State services, particularly in rural areas. I have no doubt that the policy regarding the closure of rural post offices is one of long standing.  The sequence of events to achieve such a management aim are to run it down, reduce the service, let it die, make it unviable and then, when it is totally unviable, say that we have no option but to close.</P>
      <P>Everything in this plan lacks imagination. The plan smacks of people who knew what they wanted and were determined to get it.  There are a few fundamental questions we should ask the people who drew up this plan.  It is intended to downgrade Ballinrobe post office to a sub-post office and there is talk about closing 550 sub-post offices throughout the country.  I look around my local town of Ballinrobe and I see three of the associated banks maintaining offices there.  I also notice that despite the saving and staff cuts brought by computerisation over the years, the two major banks have had to extend their offices and increase their staff since 1974. Banks are not charitable organisations so the charge cannot be levied that they did this for national or altruistic reasons. What they did was broaden the range of services on offer; they tackled their problems with imagination and found that the major workload reductions achieved through computerisation were more than offset by increased demand for their services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> Let us look at the situation with An Post.  During the same period they proceeded to run down the Post Office Savings Bank.  They adhered to totally outdated work practices.  They made it totally unattractive for someone to invest in the local savings bank through An Post.  Up until a few weeks ago one could not withdraw in excess of £50 from a sub-post office without the book having to be sent to Dublin, thus necessitating a delay in getting it back.  The sum has now been increased to £100.</P>
    <P>In the case of stamps, there was a more ingenious method of ensuring that sub-post offices did not get credit for the sale of stamps.  What they did in that case was quite simple; any large user of stamps was approached by Ah Post and asked to take a franking machine.  The result was that instead of your stamps being recorded in the local post office the sale of those stamps was recorded in the main post office maybe 20 or 30 miles away. To give a very simple example of how significant this type of operation can be, I noted, according to the report, that the 970 smallest post offices earned between £2,800 and £6,000 per annum.  I live in a village that boasts two shops, two pubs, the church, the school and a very small vocational school.  When I asked my local postmistress what her earnings were, without giving away any State secrets, she told me they were in excess of this £6,000 limit.  The reason was quite simple; we made it our business locally to defy all the cajoling of An Post.  The local business people did all their business in the local post office and we kept the business there.  But we were doing the job that An Post should have been doing. Despite their best efforts we kept the business where it was most convenient.</P>
    <P>I accept that An Post is in dire financial circumstances.  That is quite obvious.  But again, it is quite obvious if you read the report &mdash; and the report is totally disingenuous &mdash; that this happened not because of the cost of rural post offices but because overhead costs soared in the period from 1986-90.  The fact is that none of these extra costs was incurred in rural <Col N="1713" /> Ireland.  The reality is that the local postman is not earning much more in excess of what he was earning at that time. Therefore, that is not where the loss is incurred and that is not where the blow should fall.</P>
    <P>The other thing about this report is that since sub-post officers are paid by the piece and the total payment made to 500 of them is in the region of £1.5 million what saving will be made because, when they transfer the business from one post office to another they will, in turn have to pay extra fees to the post office that gets the extra business.  The only possible saving that could be made is in the long term in terms of capital in the cost of computerising and equipping sub-post offices.  Sub-post offices are great value for money.  £2,500 to £6,000 a year for the 970 smallest of them.  The reason, of course, that the sub-post offices are willing to work for this meagre funding quite obvious; it is for the same reason that people seek an agency for newspapers. It is because the profit is not from the post office or the provision of the facility, the service, the building, the heat, but from the business that that normally generates in a local shop.  So, it would seem from a management point of view that there is no financial justification in the proposal and that it was a &ldquo;copout&rdquo; to achieve aims that would just make life more simple for top management having to manage fewer outlets.</P>
    <P>The second thing I would draw attention to is this proposal regarding roadside mailboxes.  Many people have accepted these voluntarily and, if people accept them, I have no quibble with that.  But there are also many people who do not want them.  Let us take the situation of a pensioner without a car living a mile or a mile and a half up a boreen.  Monday morning comes and that pensioner is wondering if there is a letter in the post. He or she trots the mile or the mile and a half down to the little box, opens it and there is nothing there so he or she trots all the way home.  The same happens on Tuesday and Wednesday and so on through the week.  I have no doubt that if there is a cost overrun in that and if it <Col N="1714" /> could be proved that there would be very significant savings in changing the present system of daily deliveries to every house it could be done.  If they deigned to consult with rural communities rather than having these experts come round our areas in a covert manner and becoming annoyed that anybody should know they were there measuring the roads for the boxes, I have no doubt that a much more equitable and better system could affect the same cost savings and still provide the basic service the people want.</P>
    <P>There is also a proposal to downgrade many of the regional post offices.  From a mail delivery point of view, I cannot quibble with this as it is about time we reformed the whole method of mail distribution. I am not totally convinced in the long term that it is going to be as efficient, as is stated, to abandon totally the railways but, that may be something for another day.  However, I could see, just as I pointed out in the case of the banks, that the staff who will now be reallocated from these post offices could &mdash; and I am sure the post office workers would be willing to give this flexibility &mdash; be put at other work which would provide the public with a much better service. Because, at the end of the day, the consumer has to be the overriding interest of the workers, the management and the Government regarding An Post.</P>
    <P>I said recently that I could see a whole lot of new roles for An Post in the future. I could see that they could accelerate out of their problems rather than back themselves into a corner.  They could make all these cuts and come back here &mdash; as I would foresee they would if they implemented this plan &mdash; in five years' time trying to make more cuts because they were still totally unviable.  They can accelerate out of this with a little imagination. There are very obvious areas in which this can be done.  They could, for example, start providing a whole plethora of social welfare services on an agency basis for the Department of Social Welfare. A very obvious first step would be to remove from the Garda their involvement in regard to signing the dole on a weekly basis in rural Ireland and let them <Col N="1715" /> get on with the work they should be at, police work.  They should not be made a type of super social welfare officers signing dole forms each week.</P>
    <P>The second thing they could do is provide a comprehensive banking service that would be particularly convenient for old age pensioners, where there would be a one-shop situation.  Again, we looked to the banks to see if this was viable.  I brought my point home at a meeting the other night when I said there is enough money there, money that is going to the Associated Banks, which could be going into the post offices and be at the disposal of the State if conditions were made attractive.  I brought it home like this: the banks, not being altruistic, do not run services for social convenience but they find it convenient to run travelling banks at great cost, considering the staff costs they have compared to a sub-post office into the most isolated spots to collect the money because they know that the total accumulation of that money is very large. If there was a competitor and a realistic alternative, if there was a system whereby the social welfare recipient could make his banking and his receipt of money on the same day I have no doubt they would opt for the convenience of post office banking.  It would be there five days a week.  Many a person would tell you in the small hamlets and villages of Ireland about the queue outside the travelling bank every week to do business, to pay the ESB bill and the phone bill.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately I have not got enough time to go into other aspects but in passing I will mention other areas where services could be provided.  For example, there is the whole question of paying local authority fees, on car tax, passport forms, etc.  I would have to say there is only one thing in this plan that makes sense to me. I accept that in this day and age we are looking towards equality of service and equality of cost throughout the State and therefore, I cannot quibble with one proposal in the plan that is, one day delivery to everybody.  That makes sense because in this day of fax and whatever, most <Col N="1716" /> people will accept that that is a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>Molaim an tAire as an gcéim a thóg sé an NESC a chur ag athbhreithniú an phlean seo.  Bhí misneach aige é sin a dhéanamh.  Bhí jab aige len a chinntiú nach sáróidh an bhainistíocht é, ach tá muinín agam go mbeidh sé in ann chuige ar ball.</P>

      <P>I never thought we would be here debating the closure of so many post office.  May I say that the general public view of this proposed action by An Post to reduce their workforce by 1,500 and to close 550 post offices throughout the country is the greatest display of an uncaring attitude we have seen by any public body in a long time.  It would appear that An Post are far more intent on making profits than giving a service.  I do not think that was ever intended when the service was handed over by the Government to them. They may have got warnings to pay their way in so far as it was possible but I do not think the Government ever envisaged a withdrawal of the service we have known for many years.  Worse still is the withdrawal of the postal deliveries to the isolated and remote areas of this country. I know the Minister has intervened and has granted some delay and I know that some people have accused the Government of intervening simply because of the forthcoming local elections.  They have suggested that they are waiting until the elections are over and then the hatchet will come down again.  I appeal to An Post, even at this late stage, to postpone for at least one year any attempt to close even one post office in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1717" /> I understand the European Commission is about to publish a report on postal services in the European Community and part of that report suggests that the Community will investigate whether it would be appropriate to make Community funds or other forms of support available to help certain regions which at present do not have the advantage of a fully adequate postal service.  If regions thus disadvantaged cannot find the resources to invest in an improvement of services the Community will investigate whether the investment of some of its central funds is appropriate in order to promote Community cohesion.  It would be a great pity if we have the closure of post offices here and then find the European Community coming up with a plan which could assist the continuance of those post offices.  Once a post office is closed, assistance from Europe will never see that post office open again.  I earnestly appeal to An Post to postpone any action with regard to the closure of post offices or the withdrawal of delivery services.  It would be remiss of me to take part in this debate without mentioning that one post office has already closed and it is in my area.  I will briefly outline how this has happened and it will indicate the uncaring attitude of An Post.  We designated the village of Tallaght for updating about three years ago and since then Dublin Country Council has spent £720,000 on that, with, may I say thankfully, £188,000 coming from the Government central fund.  The ESB have made a major contribution to that upgrading as a public body.  Telecom Éireann and local businesses have made a contribution with their works in the village.  What has been An Post's Contribution &mdash; the withdrawal of the post office from Tallaght which I believe shows their uncaring attitude.  Every other body, business people and individuals were prepared to make sacrifices and to contribute towards making Tallaght village a pleasant area for the local people and for tourists.  Almost £0.75 million was spent by the local authority with Government assistance and it is well over £1 million when one considers <Col N="1718" /> the money spent by ESB, Telecom Éireann and local businesses.  Yet, An Post were not prepared to keep their post office in that village.  That displays a great lack of caring on their part.</P>
    <P>The local post office can never be replaced once withdrawn.  It has contributed enormously to Irish life.  It has also contributed to tourism because we have made much of how we live in rural Ireland when advertising abroad.  If these post offices are closed then I can never see Irish life returning to what it is today. Considerable inconvenience will be caused to social welfare recipients and many others who will now be required to travel longer distances to the post office. Not enough has been made of that.  This choice has been made at a desk in Dublin by a body which I have fairly indicated is uncaring.  I want to thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing his time.  There is a lot more I could say but I want to show my appreciation to the Senator who gave me this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been said that this is a very important motion and this has been acknowledged even by Members on the far side.  If they are serious about that, they will stop the posturing and codology which has been going on in the last couple of weeks and they will vote for the Fine Gael motion.  It appears that this House has been told one story but there has been another story going out in other directions.  Last week the Minister, Deputy Brennan, rode the NESC horse, which is apparently to carry us over until after the local elections in June. However, last night or the night before in Boyle, we had the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden, saying: &ldquo;It is history, lads, it is all over.  This thing has been vetoed.&rdquo;  One must now ask, who is telling the truth?  Who is to be believed? The whole thing has be be evaluated and looked at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the difficulties in which An Post finds themselves.  I do not think enough questions have been asked about how these problems have arisen. How was it that a debt of £1.6 million one year to £3.6 million in another year <Col N="1719" /> was suddenly allowed develop?  There are the questions about management, which appeares to be top heavy, and an overtime bill of £20 million.  Some of these problems have been addressed at an earlier stage and I think there are lessons in this for all of us.  There are lessons in this for all our semi-State bodies and the Civil Service in relation to how they carry on their business.  Many questions remain unanswered.  This is a further assault on rural Ireland, a further attempt to downgrade it, particularly what has happened to Garda stations and the closure of hospitals. If this move goes ahead the Members opposite will know how their constituents feel come June, because the public will not be bought off with this sop of a NESC report.</P>
    <P>With the utmost respect to the Minister of State present, I do not think it has been a good service to the Members of this House that the senior Minister responsible for this only appeared here last week to read out a three and a half page script and then disappear.  I hope that is not the seriousness with which he regards this very serious problem, involving sub-post offices, the social aspect and the human face of rural Ireland.  Last week the Minister in his speech ignored all this and did not even mention the 1,500 people who would lose their jobs. It appears that postmen will be the main sufferers.  How will they be singled out?</P>
    <P>There are many questions which have not been addressed in this debate.  This will haunt the Members opposite over the coming weeks and months.  Do not think that on the doorsteps the public will believe either a NESC report or the lovely soft option of the Minister of State, Deputy Leyden it is history; it will not happen.</P>
    <P>Questions have to be asked about the security and safety of road side letter boxes.  How will they be looked after? Will they be insured?  How will the old and inform get to them?  Who will be responsible if they are vandalised or broken into?  There has to be a clear statement, a clear commitment, from this Government to a certain investment <Col N="1720" /> policy in An Post.  They cannot be expected to borrow more money.  In the early eighties, the plan was that there would be injection of money.  There has been no injection of money and that has to be remembered.  There is a certain social obligation under section 110 just as there are with CIE in parts of the country where there are not always economical routes.  One has to remember that parts of An Post's service are also uneconomic.</P>
    <P>One must look at how problems have arisen in relation to the competitive nature of An Post with regard to other things that they could be doing.  Postage is to cost more.  Are we going to get a better service?  If couriers can run their business and make profits, surely An Post can learn something from them.  Should An Post be diversifying into other services, such as banking and how television licence fees are collected.  It does not make sense that An Post plan to contract out the collection of television licences. They should be able to fight their corner with RTÉ.  There are still many people, as we see in the courts from week to week, who do not pay their television licence fees.  If they are thinking of contracting out some service it might be better for them to see if they can collect some of these outstanding licences. These questions have to be looked at when we consider the future of An Post.</P>
    <P>There has to be a re-examination of the top heavy management structure which apparently exists in An Post.  I gave an example last week of where in one sorting office there were 19 people sorting and 11 overseeing them.  Does that make sense? There is also the scandal &mdash; and it cannot be described as anything less &mdash; of a £20 million overtime bill.  That has to be sorted out, and if the workers and the unions want action, and want rights in this, they must have responsibilities as well.  There has to be a full, frank discussion on how they will go forward in future and how they plan.  I do not think the Minister referred last week to the possible availability of moneys in Europe to help to provide a postal system in member countries.  I wonder if this has been explored.  Has this been looked at? <Col N="1721" /> It does not make sense that mail is posted in Donegal, comes all the way to Dublin only to go back to Sligo.</P>
    <P>I say to the Members opposite that they can feel free to vote for the Fine Gael motion because if they do not, there will be more of the posturing that has been going on at meetings around the country where Fianna Fáil public representatives say they got the nod from Minister Brennan. It is either kick to touch until after <Col N="1722" /> June or, better still, if Minister Leyden is to be believed, it is kick to touch for all time.  I ask Senators to vote for this Fine Gael motion which calls for a review of the Act and a review of An Post. I hope that with proper planning and discussion we will have a system which will benefit everybody but, in particular, the many people in rural Ireland who will be totally devastated if this programme is allowed to proceed.</P>

    <Title>Programme for Economic and Social Progress: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann approves the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i></P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Senator Fallon.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary to the Seanad.  As Government spokesperson on Labour I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  I was rather puzzled to hear Senator O'Toole say he was not supporting this Government programme.  If I understood him correctly, he said he was supporting the agreement.  One must recognise that the programme is a result of initiation of the plan by the Government. In fairness, the Taoiseach, the Ministers who have spoken and Members on this side of the House have paid due tribute to the social partners who were involved in drawing up this important programme.  Nobody tried to diminish the role played by the various social partners in coming to this very important agreement.</P>
      <P>The agreement we are discussing is an extension of the very successful <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> introduced by the Government in 1987 at a time when this country was on its knees to say the least and when many experts were wondering if anything could be done to get it out of the economic mess it was in at that time.  This programme and indeed the last one was built on a consensus approach by the social partners and is very positive proof of the enlightened approach at present to economic and social development.  It points to an understanding by all sides that if we want to make the best possible use of our resources in these very difficult times, a consensus is the only way forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last programme was very successful. Its greatest achievement was a huge reduction in our inflation rate.  That <Col N="1725" /> is a very important point because a low rate of inflation will keep costs and prices at a minimum and create the environment for economic growth which, in the final analysis, is the only way to tackle the scourge of unemployment that was mentioned by a number of Members in this debate.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said in the other House and the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, said earlier, the work done by the Government under the last <i>Programme for Economic Recovery</i> has been recognised and talked about at international level.  The EC Commission in its annual economic report hailed the achievements of the Government as spectacular. In other international fora there was reference to the continuing Irish economic miracle.  By any standards those words are a fair tribute to the performance, work and achievements made under the last programme and which will continue under the new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  They are all the more laudable in view of the fact that not many years ago the self same international commentators were decrying the fact that Ireland was at the bottom rung of the ladder in terms of economic development, with all of the ills that went with it.  Within as very short space of time this economic miracle has transformed this country.  The credit is due, in the first instance, to the Government for putting this plan in place and to all the social partners for the excellent contributions all those organisations made to ensure that the plan was such a success.</P>
    <P>There is no question that everyone wants the best possible for his or her own area.  We want the best education, the best and greatest possible job opportunities, a better standard of living, a better health system, higher social welfare benefits and better all round care and benefits for the disadvantaged and deprived.  In order to achieve all those aims we must have the wherewithal. There are very definite options as to where we get that type of money if we are to achieve all the aims towards which everyone strives.  On the one hand we could loosen the strings and borrow huge <Col N="1726" /> amounts of money to make the extra finance available needed for the type of projects that people require.  They would have short term, beneficial effects.  But all those large amounts of borrowings would have to be paid back and the huge debt and the interest that would accrue would have to be serviced.  On the other hand, we could increase taxation and finance the aims in that way; but we all know that the raising of personal taxation and other types is a disincentive to employment, to investment, and effectively would slow down all economic development.  It would prevent the very thing that we would set about to achieve.</P>
    <P>As the first two options would be totally unsuitable and would not, I think, in the long term solve any problems we would have, the only alternative is a co-ordinated and commonsense approach as envisaged in the former <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and in this new <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The programme is committed to a reduction in taxation over the period of the programme and this is an essential ingredient in the promotion of economic development.  It prepares the ground for moderate pay awards over the period and all concerned know exactly where they are going.  As the Minister said, we have to set a goal, we have to decide where we are going, and then we have to decide how we get there.  Hopefully, we will look at the proper routes along the way to ensue that we are on the right path and eventually we will reach our destination.</P>
    <P>I listened to Opposition speakers who were knocking this programme for a variety of different reasons.  All of their reasons were that this may not happen, and that may not happen and the other thing may not happen.  They were the same people who, some time ago, were decrying the Government for not having a plan.  You cannot have it both ways. You either agree to a plan or you do not agree to a plan, and in this day and age no Government would survive without having proper planning in place.  Indeed, we are the envy of many countries in Europe that we have this co-ordinated consensus plan over a period of time so <Col N="1727" /> that people readily understand exactly what the position is and so that they can plan for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is very important for investment and for business in general, whether it is industry, agri-business, or whatever, that you are able to plan in a definite way and that you are not afraid if you do something today the whole thing is going to be turned upside down tomorrow because of some decision that was taken on the spur of the moment.  The fact that we are in that position and the fact that there are no major pay awards &mdash; this is a very important ingredient &mdash; with the exception of the emphasis on giving maximum support to the lower paid sector of our society, all this allows industry in general to plan because they know that inflation rates will be kept to the minimum.  It is a marvellous achievement, as the Minister said, that we now have the lowest inflation rate in Europe. That is a tremendous tribute when not very long ago we were down at the very bottom of the scale in Europe in relation to our inflation rate.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the importance of education to the country.  I wish to concur wholeheartedly with him in this.  Our educational system must provide the opportunity for every person to develop his or her potential to the full and that applies both in the area of formal education and also in the area of continuing education.  We must aim for the highest standards in education and educational facilities.  It is only with a highly educated people that we can achieve the lifestyle to which everyone would aspire. I think, with all the faults it has and all the difficulties it has experienced over the past number of years, we can take great credit from the fact that even at this stage we have a very successful educational system.  I think that is recognised both in Europe and further afield, where you have the experts and commentators mentioning the very highly educated people who are sent out from this country to jobs abroad.  You have the situation where highly successful and important corporations and companies come to this <Col N="1728" /> country annually to take up quite a number of young people from third level institutions because they recognise that the Irish student and the Irish graduate is one of the best trained and best educated in the world.  Those people do not make too many mistakes.  It is because they heard that we have such a highly educated workforce and group of young people that those people come to us.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that there is still a lot that can be done.  As the Minister said, you have to give the opportunity to everyone to continue and improve themselves. It is important to add that we have a very good educational system.  We must build on that system.  That is why the programme contains a wide-ranging series of measures to improve our educational system, which includes measures to improve the pupil-teacher ratio and provide extra remedial teachers, extra vice-principals and career guidance posts in post-primary schools, a six year post-primary cycle, in-service training, an extra 8,800 third level places and an upgrading and replacement of substandard buildings by 1997.  People might say that those are very ambitious targets, but I think those targets can be achieved, and it is through the commitment in this programme that they will be achieved.  I think the trade unions involved in negotiating the programme were quite amenable to this and felt that those targets could be met.  That is why they have given us such wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, there is a Green Paper due out this summer, followed by a White Paper in 1992, and finally an Education Bill.  I think, it reflects this type of consensus approach to development, particularly in the area of education, where every person and group and organisation involved in the educational field will have the opportunity to put their views forward.  There will be lengthy discussions involved and everyone will get an opportunity to have a say. In the final outcome, we will have an Education Act that will revolutionise the educational system in this country and that will be all for the better.  It is appropriate that one should compliment the <Col N="1729" /> Minister for Education on taking that initiative because it is a major step in the field of education and nothing but good can come from that.</P>
    <P>I think everyone would acknowledge that we need a proper health service. Here I have to refer again to the type of dual standard that is operating.  You hear people in this House and in the other House and in national fora criticising the Government for spending too much money on the programme and then, on the other hand, at local level I heard them on a number of occasions criticising the Government for not spending enough. They are looking for more money all the time.  You have the same individuals at local level having a go at the Government for not supplying enough money for certain projects and then at national level having a go at the Government for spending too much money.  You cannot have it both ways.  You either accept the fact that there is need for economic restraint or you do not.  You have to be definite in your viewpoint.  You cannot be just on one side today and in a different fora, because it is appropriate or particularly opportune, to be on another side tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The important point is that we have to get value for money and I think that is what the Minister for Health is trying to do at the moment.  He is placing the whole emphasis at the moment on community care.  I see the development of community care as a very important step in the whole area of health services.  I do not think there is any old person or any person who is infirm who would not prefer to be at home.  That is what we have to do.  It is too simple to build institutions and put into them old people, people who feel they are no longer of use to society, and get someone to care for them in institutions.  We owe them more than that.</P>
    <P>People who gave their lives in the service of this country are entitled to a little bit more than that.  We have the duty and responsibility to try to ensure that those people live out their final days in their own locality, among their own friends, among the people they grew up with, <Col N="1730" /> rather than be thrown into institutions. In many cases it has been proved that in certain institutions 25 per cent of people have no visitors.  It has got to the stage where even relations and friends have forgotten about them.  That is a terrible thing to contemplate in this day and age. The whole area of community care needs tremendous development and I am delighted the Minister is committed to improving that area.</P>
    <P>Another area the programme identified as being one of the most important targets in relation to job creation and the whole generation of income is the tourist industry.  It is a major plank of economic development.  The potential we have for tourism development is enormous.  At a local level, the River Shannon, the finest waterway in Europe, has huge potential. The Shannon Development Company have done great work in the development of the Lough Derg area and the number of organisations who have been involved in developing the area is absolutely colossal. With the help of this programme and the goodwill of the Minister &mdash; he was with us a couple of weeks ago lauding the Lough Derg Programme &mdash; the potential for tourist development in the area is enormous.  With the Minister's goodwill and the backing of the Government, it will reach out beyond the banks of the Shannon and all areas from the mid-west outwards will benefit from tourism development in that area.</P>
    <P>I do not think the fact that the <i>Programme for Social and Economic Progress</i> was negotiated initially outside of this House and of the Dáil diminishes the role of the Oireachtas.  People must recognise that it is the perogative of the Government to initiate programmes.  The Government put a programme in place, discuss it and negotiate it with all interested parties.  Some people have made the point that we debate programme in the House, then we bring it into the political arena with all the accompanying problems and the idealism of the plan is lost in the political argument. It is the Government's duty and responsibility to initiate a programme with all the social partners.  Let it not be <Col N="1731" /> forgotten that, when the programme is put in place, the moneys have to be allocated for the different areas.  Therefore, all the programmes must come before each House of the Oireachtas in order to pass Estimates to make moneys available to initiate those programmes.  It is not true to say that the role of the Oireachtas is diminished because, in order to implement the programmes and finance them, the proposals must be brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Oireachtas than decides, in its wisdom or otherwise, whether those programmes are suitable.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment all the organisations involved in formulating this programme. It is necessary at this time.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> proved how successful such a plan can be.  I have no doubt that this programme will continue the excellent progress that was made over the past three to four years and no doubt we will look back with pride at the end of this programme on the huge financial and other developments that have taken place.</P>

      <P>I would like to refer to the journey which the Minister, Deputy Ahern wished to take us on today when he said: &ldquo;We are setting out.  We want to know where we were going in advance. We want to decide on the route we take. We assess our progress by checking that we follow the route and, finally, we arrive at our destination&rdquo;.  Well, I certainly would not be happy accompanying the Minister on that journey because I feel at the end of the day, looking at this and taking all the markers, that what I would find at my destination &mdash; pleasurable as the journey may be &mdash; is emigration and unemployment.  The journey must be a realistic one.  It cannot be a flight of fancy or a Peter Pan style of journey.  I am rooted in realism and what I have to say will be specific.  It can be the microcosm of the programme as I see it in the midwest area and other parts of the country. It is essential that we look and examine this document and how it can be applied to work on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1732" /> In relation to Senator McKenna, I certainly do not agree with him that we should be happy that our role is not diminished. I believe it is diminished.  First, we are talking tonight on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and it seem irrelevant now because the programme has been approved and voted on.  As we are talking in terminology now which relates to allies, I noticed an interesting alliance, or coalition, when this was voted on.  The new alliance in Dáil Éireann is Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party, who voted for the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i>, and the Labour Party particularly were happy enough with the idea of setting up an Oireachtas Economic and Social Affairs Committee to compliment the work of the social partners.  I certainly would not go along that road.  Committees are all very well, but I do not see the committee system as being appropriate when we, particularly the Opposition parties, should have been in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the programme can be negotiated outside the Oireachtas without input from the Opposition parties. It shows a disregard for the elected Members.  It reminds me very much of the role of local government at the moment where there is considerable frustration, which will be reaching its zenith by June.  Local councillors realise they have absolutely no power, that they are just rubber-stamping decisions made in the Department of the Environment. They have no discretion about spending. Almost every pound coming from central funding has already been answered for when it reaches the elected members.  It is enough to see that at local authority level, but I certainly do not want the Oireachtas to take up the idea that the decisions are made beyond their control.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the green document, and I would say it is green in relation to tackling the major problems of unemployment and emigration.  In the Dáil the Taoiseach spoke about the formidable task ahead to create new employment and he mentioned the <Col N="1733" /> necessity to create 20,000 new jobs annually. It rang a bell in my mind, was relating back to the Fianna Fáil magic manifesto of 1977, where 20,000 jobs were also mentioned.  Minister O'Malley and Minister Brennan were around in 1977 and all would agree now that we are suffering still the problems of that manifesto as regards debt and so on.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks all I can see in the mid-west, which had been a burgeoning, blossoming region, is that slowly and surely it is becoming devastated by unemployment.  Factories are closing, closures are threatened and factory workers are on a three day week.  That is the real world.  Minister Ahern on his journey should, on my invitation, come to the mid-west to see what has been happening slowly and surely over the past few months &mdash; over a longer period, but particularly over the last few months. There is 80 per cent unemployment in places like Southhill and Moyross.  They are the Tallaghts of the mid-west.  They are the city areas.  The industrial estate companies are on tenterhooks, wondering whether they will be around in the next few weeks.  Outside the area there are towns and villages &mdash; this has already been mentioned in the An Post debate &mdash; being devastated by unemployment and emigration.</P>
    <P>It is of interest &mdash; and I want to be very specific and constructive here &mdash; that in a recent study in FÁS's newly published <i>Labour Market Review</i>, compiled in the planning and research departments, it is revealed that between 1981 and 1985 the probability of those aged 15 emigrating by the age of 19 increased three and a half times.  They are the specifics we have to address.  We cannot discard those figures; they are real figures.  Six per cent of 67,568 people aged 15 in 1981 had emigrated by the time this group reached the age of 19.  I am talking about tender years between 15 and 19.  Some 18.2 per cent were on the dole in Ireland; 46.6 per cent had found jobs without emigrating &mdash; and I am glad they found those jobs &mdash; and although 31,503 had jobs by the time they were 19 years only another 1,090 members had found jobs in Ireland <Col N="1734" /> by the time the group was aged 23 years. These are frightening, staggering figures. In 1985, there were 71,300 Irish 15-year olds.  By 1990, 21 per cent of this group had emigrated; 11.64 per cent were unemployed in Ireland and only 32 per cent had found jobs in this country.  These facts are frightening, disturbing and very saddening.  I said I would deal with reality; these are the facts published in a new publication researched through FÁS.</P>
    <P>What is happening?  Abroad, the outlets for Irish Labour are drying up.  We know that.  There is recession in the United Kingdom, in the United States and we know of the number of emigrants who returned for Christmas and never went back either to Europe or the United States.  They are now at home for good and add to the numbers.  Changes in eastern Europe over the past two years mean that Irish workers face increased competition for skilled and unskilled jobs in Europe, again resulting in rising unemployment. The level of unemployment since the end of October, when it was 16.8 per cent, rose in January 1991 to 18.5 per cent.  These figures are not in the Green Paper.  They are not to be seen for publication, but they are there and they are the reality.</P>
    <P>Worse is to come.  I am sorry, but it has to be a pessimistic message.  More and more people are coming on the labour force.  We have 670,000 between the ages of ten and 19 who will be looking for jobs over the next ten years, and this figure represents about half of all those currently at work.  Looking back at the ICTU agenda, when they proposed a ten year strategy for development, reform and growth, that strategy was agreed to by the Government; and it is interesting that that ten year span will be coinciding with the ten years when you will have that number I referred to coming on the job market.  The present unemployment of 241,000 is a shocking figure.  Looking at the green booklet, only four pages are devoted to unemployment and training out of a 90 page document.  That is a figure that should not be accepted.</P>
    <P>If we turn to figures of another kind, <Col N="1735" /> the current budget borrowing is approximately £350 million, which accounts for 1.5 per cent of GNP; and there is a commitment in the programme to eliminating £350 million worth of borrowing by 1993. However, the programme does not say how this can be done.  We can read all we like, we can read headings, but the specifics must be met and we have to face them.  Tax and expenditure commitments will add up to £550 million borrowing in 1993.  We have to ask ourselves, where will the cuts come from?  Where are the tax increases to be made to eliminate the £350 million, this year's borrowing, and to pay for the £550 million extra borrowing required by this programme, which amounts to approximately £900 million?  I do not see in the programme whether that £900 million will be found in cuts or tax increases.  It is implied, but I would like to have specifics from the Minister on that.  I see no vision.  In reference again to Minister Ahern's journey, there is no light at the end of the tunnel.</P>
    <P>In the short time remaining to me I will briefly refer to specific areas where the Minister could have shown vision.  We will take the social employment scheme. We had looked for specific analogies to be eliminated as regards Christmas bonuses and a debate took place here in the House to which many Members contributed. There are anomalies in that scheme, which is a good one, which can be eliminated. The people who opt for the social employment scheme, coming from long term unemployment, seek work.  They wish to work.  They find there is about £7 in the difference for a man who wishes to take up social employment and what he would get if he were on the dole.  Quite honestly, the temptation is there, if you cannot get on the social employment scheme, to say &ldquo;Well, look, there is only £7 in the difference because of the anomalies.&rdquo; I ask that a training scheme in FÁS should be set up to advise on and monitor the introduction of a training element in the social employment scheme.  It would help to make those <Col N="1736" /> social employment scheme workers more employable at the end of their 12 months.</P>
    <P>I reiterate they acquire skills during their year but they are very basic skills and the people who opt for them are people who have an appetite for work. From what I know from people who are on the social employment scheme in the Limerick area, they are thrown on the scrap-heap of unemployment at the end of their 12 months.  Because they have had the opportunity to work for that one year it is exceptionally frustrating for them to find that after their year they have no further employment.  As Senator O'Toole did today, I look for a second year for those people and perhaps they would be more employable at the end of that second year.  I would like the Minister to conduct a survey, if he has not already done so, on social employment workers to show how many ex-social employment workers have achieved employment after their spell on SES, a very valuable scheme.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the area of tourism, which I will link in with farming and education.  I will speak specifically on integrated rural development.  There is a tiny paragraph, perhaps half a page, in the programme dealing with the prospects for rural development and the Minister's proposal to have a national programme for integrated rural development drawing on the expertise of the pilot programmes.  In my own area, Slievefelim, the funding is so meagre that the co-ordinator &mdash; he was supposed to go in October but held on for another couple of months because some money was found &mdash; is uncertain as to the length of time he will be employed.  The budget has been cut for the programme in my own area.  The potential in rural areas is enormous.  It is absolutely necessary at present for people in rural areas to be able to take up employment as an alternative to traditional agricultural jobs.  I find nothing in the integrated development programme in relation to a firm strategy, a direction or the vision I spoke of earlier.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the overflying situation as regards Shannon.  You may <Col N="1737" /> ask what this has to do with the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> It has a lot to do with it for the simple reason that tourism and alternative farming enterprises in the mid-west and to the west and south west of the country is intrinsically linked, because if you reduce the number of flights coming into the region you reduce the number of tourists.  What we are failing to do &mdash; and this was noted already with regard to the debate on An Post &mdash; is to take the social and economic aspects together.  It is fine to have economic policies, but you must always link the social with them and what I am doing here is linking tourism and off-farming activities.</P>
    <P>I will take an example, because I want to be constructive.  Take a project like a European theme park in that region on the lines of the Bunratty Folk Park. Ireland is the true agricultural model. It represents all types of agriculture &mdash; mixed farming, cereals etc.  It is a prototype for agriculture throughout Europe. Seeing that Shannon is the gateway to Ireland for Americans, if we had a European theme park with an agricultural theme, with the area of Lough Gur, with this full sense of integration that I talked about, you would have your theme, the history of agriculture through the ages and the projects related to the whole area.  You are talking there in terms of an integrated rural development linking transport, tourism, agriculture and the alternative activities we are looking for in the area to ensure that rural villages are not being devastated.  That is something constructive.  In relation to that, I was very disappointed with the budget proposal in regard to the BES because of the effect on tourism, hotels and self-catering areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry we did not have the facilities to hear what the Minister for Finance had to say in Ennis.  I hope he will be able to help in the area I am talking about.  The rented Irish cottage arrangement is a specific scheme where if, on the sale of those cottages, they become viable in the context of refurbishing and updating standards for 1992, they had hoped for input from the business expansion scheme so that when they were sold they would be sold as a going concern and kept in the context of tourism to satisfy the criteria of 1992.  I said I would deal with specifics and that is a specific.  I would like the Minister for Finance to come to the mid-west and say to us &ldquo;of course the rent-an-Irish cottage scheme will be exempt from the problem of funding for hotels because I see you in a different category.&rdquo;  We would be absolutely delighted and it would ensure that we could bring visitors from the United States visitors and Europe to the mid-west and they would go on to Ennis, not necessarily just Limerick but the whole of the mid-west.</P>
      <P>The targets for tourism I find extraordinarily positive but will they be reached?  The figures given are four million tourists, 25,000 jobs between 1988 and 1993.  I will certainly keep them in my mind.  In the next couple of months I will be counting the tourists coming through Shannon Airport to check out the figures.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also the matter of port roads and accessibility for tourism, business people and everybody else. There is absolutely nothing in the peripheral plan to allow people from Limerick rapid transit by way of access roads to the ports because Cork, not Foynes, is earmarked.  In our area we must have a <Col N="1739" /> proper roads infrastructue for tourism and business purposes.  I do not see why all roads should lead to the east but not to the west.</P>
      <P>As regards education the trade unions and their representatives were the architects of the welcome improvements in the programme and I welcome that.  I welcome the improved PTR but I find it extraordinary in relation to the commitment to a study on the future in-service needs of teachers that a study by the Department will now be initiated.  Since 1968, when we had free education, we have been screaming for in-service, courses.  I have been teaching since 1968 and in-service seems to be the buzz word now.  I might as well tell the House if we are talking of long term planning that in-service was being done voluntary in private secondary schools and other schools as well and also through teacher centres.  It fascinates me how it is suddenly the buzz word when we needed it way back in 1968.  The only reason it was tackled in this programme was because teachers were driven demented trying to work on shoe-string budgets to ensure that they were equipped to teach as they should in 1991.  They need to be social workers, actresses and actors, substitute parents.  They are imparters of knowledge, they are initiatiors, facilitators, etc.</P>
      <P>As regards free education £10 million comes to the Department of Education every year given by parents through examination fees and voluntary contributions. My last word relates to the Education Act.  The Green Paper to be issued in the summer and I look forward to the White Paper and the Education Act.  Very regularly on the Order of Business I have asked the Leader of the House a question regarding the Seanad voting rights.  I would like this to be taken on board because we seem to have no relevance in this House in regard to Seanad voting rights.  I have raised the matter many times but I got nowhere.  I hope this will be something that will be addressed in the Education Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed I have not had an <Col N="1740" /> opportunity to touch on health but again I refer to the journey I invited the Minister to take.  If anybody cares to go on my journey, there will be realism at the end of it and constructive commments, not Peter Pan material, a sort of fly-off-into-the-universe approach such as we have heard on this programme today.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman would be quite safe going on any journey where the Minister for Labour is heading the team.  He has been an excellent negotiator. I cannot understand why it is wrong for the Government, the Progressive Democrats and Labour to vote together on a programme that will send this nation on the right path to progress. It is just that Fine Gael are being wrong-footed on this.  Their Leader, with the greatest respect to Senator Jackman, has to create a high profile for himself in the Dáil and he decided to vote against one of the most positive plans that has been put in place in this nation and for our people in recent times.  So if Senator Jackman is taking a poor view of Labour voting with us that is her tough luck.</P>
      <P>I welcome the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  It has recently been negotiated with the Government and it covers a three-year period in 1991 to 1993.  It deals with health, social welfare, justice, environment and all the other areas.  If we have got our act together and if it is annoying some people, perhaps it is, surprise at the commonsense that is now in place and our determination, together with the trade unions and the farming organisations and all the people, to put petty things aside, and decide to create an atmosphere where together we can create jobs for the people we are elected to look after.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like tonight to pay a special tribute to the Minister for Labour for his commitment and his dedication and indeed for all who took part in the talks with him, the trade unions, Government, employers, farmers.  It is only together that this nation can survive.  We have the most comprehensive agreement that was <Col N="1741" /> ever put in place.  We are facing challenges not just here at home but internationally. We need that programme for progress to move forward.  The greatly improved performance of the Irish economy since 1987 has won international recognition.  In many ways the real significance of our success in achieving a consensus approach to the economic and social policies is much more fully appreciated abroad than here at home.</P>

      <P>I am now in trouble when I hear Senator Ross say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo;. We have to face the challenging times of the nineties, we have to sustain the recovery and give a clear signal to the international community of our determination to continue to make progress in a disciplined manner.  The most significant innovation of this programme compared to the previous one is the comprehensive programme of improvement in the main public services.  It is a measure of the success of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and of the growth which it generated that has made it possible to now put this major plan in place and to create improvements in the social policy area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This programme has ambitious targets, including the target for increasing employment.  Farming must be looked after.  When people in the towns think they are special, we should never forget that we are a farming nation.  I hope Mr. MacSharry realises that as well as anybody else who wants to hear it.  I must pay tribute to the Minister for Social Welfare for his extraordinary role in that Department since his appointment.  Over the period of the programme, the Government are committed to improving the level of payments to the tune of £400 million in 1990 terms.  The priority rates recommended by the Commission for Social Welfare will be achieved this year in the case of all long term unemployed. In his nice quiet way, the Minister comes on television, but down on the ground I would say he is one of our best Ministers. He is getting a fair bit of money but I do <Col N="1742" /> not mind as long as he spends it the right way.  He is certainly doing that.  I hope he is told that I said this, because I am sure he does not think I give him any credit.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Labour, with whom Senator Jackman did not want to walk down any road, has put in place regulations for 21,000 part-time workers.  There are many women in that category.  Surely he has to be applauded for his commitment there.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland are unique in regard to the extend of voluntary work which is carried out.  Last Sunday morning, in Ennis, we had nine Masses for the mentally handicapped of Clare and we had a huge collection.  The Minister for Health and his former Minister of State who has now gone to Justice, and the Department of Health have done enormous work for the mentally handicapped.  I am in a first hand position to know that.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health has increased the allocation for mentally handicapped well ahead of inflation although I know that there are still gaps in the service. The Government provided £2 million last year in the budget and there is a further £1 million this year.  I know we need more but it is like all other Departments, every section needs more money.  I am sure the Minister will try to give it to the mentally handicapped when it is available in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was negotiated in 1987 the country was in a major crisis.  There was virtually no growth in the economy, unemployment was increasing rapidly, the national debt was expected to deteriorate further, living standards were declining with the increase in the tax burden, and major social troubles were getting worse.  Against this background, the programme was put in place and despite all the shortcomings it has worked well.  I understand that there are many problems left and all we can do is try to tackle them.  We have to find ways and <Col N="1743" /> means of ensuring that the current recovery, with low inflation and lower interest rates is maintained, and that the major issues such as unemployment, tax reform and the restructuring of our health services, are tackled.</P>
    <P>Now that the economy is in a healthy condition we need a new approach to take account of those changing circumstances, which draws lessons not only from the success of the past but also from its shortcomings. This approach should recognise that our fundamental structural problems were there before the programme and we should go on as a nation to lay down a long term strategy for development.  I understand that before the talks between the social partners and the Government, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the employers and farming organisations asked that there be a long term strategy for the development of the country over the next decade, a decade for development, reform and growth.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay a tribute to Peter Cassells and to all the people in the trade unions who were at the negotiating table. At one point, towards the end of the negotiations Mr. Cassells said that as well as our immediate priorities in discussions on a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Development</i> we will be insisting that these discussions take place in the context of a long term strategy.  This will be the last opportunity we will have in this century to put together such a strategy.  It is an opportunity that we cannot miss.  It is probably rarely that a tribute is paid to Peter Cassells.  There has been criticism and we should stop the begrudgery.  If something is put in place that might be successful for the nation, we should pay a tribute to the people who have played a very significant role in doing so.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment made a statement last week outlining a new housing policy.  Those in Local Government know what that contains. The objective of industrial policy is to have an increase of 100 per cent over the decade and the number of Irish manufacturing companies having an annual turnover greater than £5 million in real <Col N="1744" /> terms.  We talked here a while ago about jobs.  We should have more confidence in ourselves when we see nations like America and European countries looking at us and when we see tough, hardheaded business people prepared to come in here.  Over 1,000 overseas owned companies have been established in Ireland over the past 20 years.  Some 350 of those companies came from the United States.</P>
    <P>When we see that and when we realise the number of jobs that have been created, and the type of money that has been put on-stream here, perhaps there should be less criticism of the Americans and of the way they have helped.  They are tough business people, but they came in here. We should be less critical of the people and the nations who help us.  Lashing the other side is a road I never went down when I was in Opposition.  I was over on that side for a while before I moved on to become Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <P>The international financial services centre is an area which is much more familiar to my friend, Seantor Ross, than to me.  I do not even pretend to understand finance.  He pretends he does. Twenty-three top banks have gone into the international financial services centre.  There is nothing wrong with that under a Fianna Fáil Government, I rarely take credit or talk about what Fianna Fáil are doing.</P>
    <P>The IDA's list of major new investments in 1990 shows that 30 top companies came into Ireland in that year.  Let us stop the knocking.  Let us give credit where credit is due.  This what has happened to us as a people.  This is why at times we ask why is there such little respect for politicians?  I could not understand why this programme was voted against in the Dáil.  I am sure the Fine Gael Senators will have much more sense and will vote for the programme tonight.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the investment in tourism in the west and how important it is.  Senator Jackman need have no worries about the over-flying of Shannon.  It will not happen, regardless of the Dublin lobby.  Tourism generates twice as much taxation as merchandise exports.  Over £400,000 million, or 49 per cent of every <Col N="1745" /> £1 spent by tourists, ends up with the Exchequer.  It is in the tourism area that I see potential for job creation.  The Minister for Finance in his speech said:</P>
    <P>We will continue the stability of the public finances and the economy in the face of challenging world trends.  It will give us a very competitive base from which to expand our output, increase our employment and create jobs.  It will enable our economy and this nation of ours to grow.</P>
    <P>I welcome the programme and again pay tribute to the commitment and the commonsense of all the social partners with the Government.  I am very critical of powers being taken from local government but I did not see anything wrong with the Government negotiating with our social partners, the farming organisations, or with anybody else, if it is for the benefit of the nation.  As a politician, I have strong views on powers being left to the local authorities, but I do not agree that it was wrong that those negotiations should have taken place.  There was no use putting a plan in place here or in the Dáil without the people who had to implement it.</P>
    <P>I would like to put on record my thanks to all associated with the programme because everybody, except a few, seems to be doing everything to help this country take another solid step forward, without playing politics.</P>

      <P>I would hate to be on that very short list of Ministers which the former Cathaoirleach did not actually mention in her contribution because I would think there was something waiting for me, when I went outside this evening, of a most unpleasant nature.  I do not share Senator Honan's great euphoria about this programme, or about all the individual Ministers which she predictably mentioned with such enthusiasm this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very easy to pick up a programme of this sort and because it is dressed up <Col N="1746" /> in such laudatory language and because it is full of assertions and subjective judgments to say immediately that it is a good thing and it is something we should approve.  Because it is called a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> it is, by definition, automatically placed in the pigeon hole of things of which we should approve.  It is like a national wage agreement or the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  It is something which we should, as a first and primary step, approve of.  It is also misleading to talk of it in this way and to take things on their face value.  Its whole thesis is based on what it calls &ldquo;the social partners.&rdquo;  It is my contention that this is exactly what they are not.</P>
    <P>I should have mentioned that with the agreement of the House I will give Senator Hourigan as much of my time as I can.</P>

      <P>With regard to the social partners, it is a false premise to even accept that particular designation of the negotiators because the farmers, the unions, the employers and the Government are parcelling out the national cake after having an extremely stern fight about it.  They are, in fact, antagonists and they are hostile to each other in their fight for the national cake.  Once they have divided it up they are all happy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take issue as well with what the Taoiseach said in his opening remarks about this programme, when he said that partnership between all the interests in our society is the way forward, implying that this is what this document is representative of.  It is not.  This document is a reflection of a deal done between the vested interests and the power-vested interests in our society.  It is not a reflection of all the interests in our society. There are many people who do not feel <Col N="1747" /> they are represented in this document, nor do they feel that they have been fairly treated in this document.  Indeed, they feel excluded for this programme.  The farmers are happy; the unions are happy; the CII are happy and the Government are happy.  That is something which the people have to believe is a good thing for them as a whole because there is this great agreement.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of people who are not happy.  I certainly do not think that the mentally handicapped people, who occupied the Department of Health this morning, are too happy with this programme. I do not think the disabled are happy.  I do not think the unemployed are happy.  I do not think the voluntary bodies are happy.  There are very many marginalised groups who are not represented in this programme and it does not do them any justice.  It specifically excludes them.</P>
    <P>It is time we took an honest approach to the problem of unemployment.  I am not as long in this game as Senator Honan, but as long as I have been in it I can remember Ministers coming into this House and to the Dáil with flowery language about the problems of the unemployed and about it being their primary objective in Government to solve the problems of the unemployed.</P>
    <P>It is time &mdash; Fianna Fáil are particularly guilty in this regard &mdash; that some Minister came to this House and said that Governments were relatively powerless to do anything about the unemployment problem. If they can do anything about it they have failed singularly to do anything about it in the last ten years and they are powerless to do anything about it in the future.  It is time they admitted that unemployment is here to stay, regrettable as that is.  It is something which politicians, if they are realistic at all, should acknowledge, instead of raising false hopes among the unemployed through making promises which they have patently failed to keep in the past <Col N="1748" /> and which they will fail to keep again as a result of this programme.</P>
    <P>This programme, which mentions the unemployed at great length, is full of unrealistic promises about what they call a community-based, local-based solution to the unemployment problem.  It is ill-thought out, is unrealistic and certainly will not create many jobs but, for the moment, it is enough to get over the problem of producing a <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and break through the unemployment block which they must do in order to maintain credibility.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the trade unions in regard to this issue.  Was it in their brief? Were they representing the unemployed? I do not think so.  There was nobody at these negotiations representing the unemployed.  The trade unions looked after the employed people.  They looked after their own patch and got far too good a deal from the Government but they got absolutely nothing for those who do not have jobs.  That will buy industrial peace for the Government but it will do nothing for those on the dole queues.  The chapter on the unemployed is bogus.  It will not produce any jobs.  It will go into the litter bin with every other programme for the unemployed which has been produced as far as I can remember.  It is utterly dishonest and cruel to promise to reduce unemployment when we know perfectly well that it will not happen.  Unemployment will continue and the trade unions are as guilty as anybody else.</P>
    <P>I welcome some parts of the programme. They are good.  The commitments given on education will be kept because they are of such a specific nature that it would be very difficult for the Government to back down on them. They give time, timetables and dates by which targets must be met.  I welcome that.  I welcome the fact that there is to be a Green Paper on Education and that an Education Act will be introduced by June.  There is a firm commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and also in <Col N="1749" /> relation to teacher training.  These are very important.</P>
    <P>Many things were omitted, for example, the recognition given to teachers in our society.  The problem of lack of mobility for teachers should have been tackled but it was a good attempt at tackling the problems in education. However, it does not state how these commitments will be paid.  It is very important when we produce a programme which is full of targets, which really equals promises, to say how it will be paid for.  Since the education programme is a capital programme, it should be paid for out of privatisation money.</P>
    <P>It is expected that a large amount of capital or what should be treated as capital will come to the Government next year as a result of the privatisation of the Irish Sugar Company and Irish Life. Nobody knows how much that will be as it depends on market conditions and so on but there should be a commitment given to use some of it as a capital investment in education and if not in education then as a capital investment in something else.  That should be slotted in somewhere so that the Government will not spend it on current spending.  If that is not done and if we run into trouble in the economy, which we undoubtedly will, there will be the temptation to use the money from Irish Life to bail us out.  We would paper over the cracks and it would be wasted. It will be a safety valve and it should not be used for current expenditure.  To use it specifically for capital expenditure in education would be of great benefit to the country and would justify the Government's privatisation programme.</P>
    <P>The section which deals with privatisation is unclear in its objectives.  It is unclear why the Government propose to privatise certain companies.  The document states that the Government have no ideological position on this.  That can, of course, be read both ways.  It is a poor reflection on Government thinking that they do not have any position on privatisation. They should have decided <Col N="1750" /> whether this was an efficient means of running industry or whether it should be done in a piecemeal way in order to raise money when the Government are in trouble.  The danger is that if we successfully privatise the Irish Sugar Company and Irish Life the Government will regard privatisation money as a source of revenue.  When they run into the trouble they are about to run into because of the world recession and as a result of the Gulf War etc. the temptation will be to put their hands in the privatisation money and paper over the cracks with that money.</P>
    <P>The Government failed to give a commitment in this programme and there will be a great temptation for them to use the money for all the wrong purposes and literally waste it on current expenditure. May I ask the Chair how much time I have left?</P>

      <P>I agree with some of what Senator Honan said; it is what she did not say that is always the problem.  The economy was well run from 1987 to 1989 and up to 1990.  It would be churlish to dispute that.  Extremely courageous and unpopular decisions were taken which no Government like to take, particularly in the health and education areas.  Senator Honan was right when she referred to an increase in investment confidence overseas between 1987 and 1989.  There was a dramatic change in attitude by overseas investors after the change of Government in 1987.  Investment came flowing into this country, particularly into Government stocks.  It showed confidence in <Col N="1751" /> their policies.  The unpopular measures hurt people in the health and education areas but they had a dramatic effect in that, as a result of overseas investment, take-home pay increased, employment increased a little and investment boomed.  The balance of payments surplus increased and all the recognised economic indicators rose up.  It was a dramatic turnaround and any fairminded person would give the Government full recognition for that.  Although Senator Honan criticised Fine Gael, it is fair to say that they played a very responsible role in supporting the Government at that time.</P>

      <P>What I am worried about is that this programme threatens many of the great benefits enjoyed in that period. It is a departure from the economic fiscal rectitude which was imposed at that time. It is loosening the strings too early.  It is consistent with the budget strategy introduced at the end of January by the Minister for Finance but it is based on an assumption of growth which very few reputable or impartial economists share with the Government.  That is the reality. The Government, unfortunately, have a vested interest in stating a growth figure which may turn out to be way above what is realistic.  That is the real danger we are faced with in this programme.  If growth goes wrong everybody knows that this programme is out the window.  The Government simply will not have any money to pay for it.  Reputable and respected economists believe that growth will not be up to the expectations of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1752" /> What we will see as a result of this programme is that public pay will be up by nearly 15 per cent this year.  Even if you take the Government's figure, public service pay will rise by 13 per cent in 1991.  It rose by 8 per cent in 1990.  Given the worldwide recession, this is a sum which we simply will not be able to pay for except through higher taxes and borrowings.</P>
    <P>It is a cowardly decision by the Government. They have capitulated to the public service unions, in particular the ICTU, and it is probably a promise which they will not be able to sustain except by borrowing in the future.  They will have a very difficult decision to make in years to come because they will have to decide, when they cannot pay for this wage agreement out of earnings, whether to borrow the money.  If they borrow money again we will be back to the slide down the economic poll where we were in 1972-87.</P>
    <P>I would like to see realistic targets in this programme and a firm commitment that growth would pay for expenditure.  I would like to see a firm commitment that if we did not earn the money to pay the public service we would not pay them. The only commitment we have is that if the targets are not met the Government will review the situation.  That is not good enough.  We are in some sort of wonderland. We have yielded to the temptation to promise jam tomorrow in the hope that we will be able to pay for it whereas we would have been better off not having a document like this at all.</P>

      <P>The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was introduced in 1987.  There have been worthwhile and significant results in the intervening years.  Positive and definite measures for the good of the economy emerged during that time and it would be rather ludicrous not to identify those improvements and acknowledge the progress made.</P>
      <P>We are talking about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  This programme has already been agreed to and we are debating its merits and demerits.  There is much to commend in the programme.  My reservations in the main are centred around the attainment of the various objectives set out in the programme.  I am sceptical about some of the objectives and I am particularly dubious about employment targets.  We have an unemployment figure of 241,000 or 250,000 &mdash; it is not terribly important which it is &mdash; but added to that an unknown number of people emigrated over the past number of months.  If you were to add that figure to the number of those registered as unemployed you would get a figure not far from 300,000. I acknowledge that when many emigrants came here recently at Christmas they did not return overseas for very good reasons such as the danger posed by the Gulf War and so on.  That is artificial.  While employment prospects abroad may not be as great now, we will again be confronted with massive emigration.</P>
      <P>I am sceptical of our ability to achieve the employment targets which have been laid down.  Granted we can reach targets but at what cost?  We must also realise what circumstances generated employment. In 1977 we had a very serious unemployment position which was rectified quite easily by massive recruitment in the Civil Service.  That kind of artifical employment is no use.  The programme the Minister has put before us contains many excellent points.  We must employ people gainfully because there is little use in just having job creation for the sake of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1754" /> There are three main areas which generate money: tourism, which has very strong potential, agriculture where the brakes are on at the moment and the potential is not so great, and industrial development.  We must receive revenue from these areas if we are to finance the areas of health, education, law and order, the environment and so on which are non-earning. We rely on the income earning areas.  The prospects in agriculture are not good as we are relying on tourism and industrial development.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the measures introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare.  They are very substantial and deserve to be lauded.  The weakest section of society benefit from social welfare payments. Part-time workers form an important part of society with full-time employment becoming less easy to procure.</P>
    <P>We must create a climate for industrial development.  We are fortunate that American and European companies have located here but we must bear in mind that unless we have low interest and inflation rates and people who are available for work, we will not attract industry to this country.  We must attract industry if we are to make any headway.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Senator Honan said with regard to the mid-western region <i>vis-a-vis</i> Shannon.  The status of Shannon will not be altered and Shannon will continue to do a very good job not alone for the mid-west region but for the country.</P>

      <P>We must be mindful of how we set up development programmes in the future.  Hopefully our massive borrowings have taught us a lesson.  We borrowed heavily in the past and should be mindful of borrowing.  I thank Senators Ross and Farrell for giving me part of their time.</P>

      <P>I welcome this <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> When the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> was brought forward it was scoffed at too; indeed, many development programmes brought forward in the past were scoffed at.  They were all very successful but none more so than the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, and I have no doubt that the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> will be even more so.</P>
      <P>We all remember a time when we worried that industries would not locate here because we had the highest number of strikes in Europe.  The <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> put an end to all that. Industrialists are now happy to come here because we have low interest and inflation rates.  Senator Ross did not explain how our inflation rate was so low and England's so high.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why people say that all interests are not covered in this programme.  The trade unions, teachers and employers are the people who count and they were all involved in it.  Great credit is due to the Minister for Labour, Deputy Ahern, and his negotiating ability. He has brought peace and stability into the workforce and into industry.</P>
      <P>We came to grips with emigration before and I have no doubt we will do so again.  However, I am disappointed that so many people on the far side are pessimistic and have so little confidence in themselves because when they criticise the whole community they are criticising themselves as well.  If they put more effort into being constructive instead of destructive, we would have a much better society.</P>
      <P>I am delighted with this programme and I know it will lead to success and prosperity and that it will have the desired effect of reducing emigration which is what we all want to see.</P>

      <P>I thank the Seanad for the time given to me today.  I was given a long run to put <Col N="1756" /> my views forward on the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i>  In any programme negotiated between the social partners covering a wide range of people, from farmers with different interests to employers and the trade union movement and the Government taking into account all the sectional interests and national interests, you cannot, as Senator Ross and a few others were doing today, divorce the good points from those you do not like.  You cannot say that all the things that are good in the programme lead to stability and should be kept but we should get rid of the bad.  Nobody can negotiate that way except with a rifle.  If you want to negotiate in a democracy you have to give and take, and that is what was done in this programme.</P>
      <P>As I said earlier this afternoon, the important point of the agreement for the economy is that we will have moderate pay increases and Irish goods will be competitive abroad.  We will have quality goods produced by a quality workforce. We must sell competitively and we can only do that if we maintain stability in our planning and in our economy.  If we do that we will have low inflation.  We had a position where GBR was at 13 per cent, we had double figure inflation and the country was practically out of control. Now we have single figure inflation; it is the lowest in Europe.  We have interest rates that are just 2 per cent higher than Germany, which was 8 per cent a few years ago, and we are way below the United Kingdom.  That attracts genuine investment which Senator Ross and others mentioned.  If you have genuine investment you are allowed to increase your growth.  We have 4 per cent growth. Exports are at a very high level.  That attracts jobs and wealth into the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of those matters can be taken in isolation.  Any Member who believes you can take a few good things and forget about the rest is making a fundamental economic mistake.  No other country has <Col N="1757" /> achieved this.  Japan has not achieved it nor has Germany.  I believe that indepednent economists, whose bona fides to me are quite questionable, who normally make their money by questioning things and putting forward analyses of why things are wrong and rarely predict three years ahead, will, at the end of this three-year period, be as wrong as they were in the last period.  This country can do very well during the next three years, and particularly over the next ten years.  If we are wrong we will be answerable for that. <Col N="1758" /> Independent economists will just write another story in three years' time, or quite a lot of them will not be on the scene at all.  It is amazing how many of the companies who put forward economists this time put forward different people on the last occasion.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank you for the opportunity of debating the programme today and, in conclusion, I thank all the Senators who went to the trouble of making excellent contributions.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House for this motion on the Adjournment.  My concern is the sum of £500,000 that has been allocated to locally based womens' groups. Because of a specific allocation of £20,000 in the budget to Women's Aid, Dublin, I was afraid the impression might be given that funding for refugees and rape crisis centres would come from yet another allocation.  What I wanted to bring to the <Col N="1759" /> attention of the various groups throughout the country &mdash; not just Limerick &mdash; is that within the £.5 million there would be funding for their organisations so that they would not feel that because Women's Aid was given £20,000 no funds would be forthcoming for them.  Nobody was disappointed that the Dublin group got the £20,000 allocation.  Women operate these centres and depend on local funding they do not crib if a Dublin based group fets funding while a provincial group does not.  Over the past number of budgets certain rape crisis centres have received greater funding than others. They are all concerned with the same problems so they do not criticise this fact but it is important that moneys should be given also to Limerick and distributed throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My reason for mentioning the Limerick ADAPT House is that it has been six years in operation.  It is established now as a major centre for women and children who have suffered domestic violence and it is the only such centre in the mid-west region.  It serves the area of Limerick city and county, Tipperary and Clare which are all part of the Mid-Western Health Board area.  Notwithstanding the fact that they service the mid-west, the actual admissions, when we break them down, extend from Dublin across to Galway, down to Cork and into Kerry. There are people in the centre even from England.  On an annual basis at least 132 families on average are admitted to the refuge at ADAPT House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like all these groups the allocation from the budget would be essential for their survival.  The figure before me for ADAPT House is £75,000 of which approximately £28,000 can be obtained from the Mid-Western Health Board to go towards salaries.  The remainder of up to £50,000 has to be raised through voluntary fund raising.  This increases every year.  What I am asking for is a specific allocation to the centre.  It is not only battered wives, people whose marriages <Col N="1760" /> have broken down, etc., who come to the centre and have to be worked with, but there is also the increasing problem of the trauma experienced by children who have been sexually abused.  This year, if ADAPT House is to be able to help these children, they need to be in a financial position to employ two qualified child care workers who will have to work on a 1:2 basis with those children.  This is an extra dimension to Adapt House.</P>
    <P>ADAPT House receives funding at present for one salaried social worker who is the only full-time social worker in the country associated with refuges. There is a caretaker, an administrator, a day-time housekeeper, a night-time house mother and caretaker, a receptionist and secretary, but they are all part-time workers.  The centre is open to victims of family violence at all times of the day and night.  Women and children may stay there for periods ranging from days to months and while in the house they not only get refuge but benefit from services such as counselling, legal aid, housing assistance, welfare payments, medical aid.  They are given every help and support to recover from their experiences and, of course, social workers and qualified childcare workers are necessary to help build up the confidence of the women and children in their care so that they can resume normal living as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Approximately 132 families stay in the centre each year; some attend for information, advice and counselling.  Approximately 1,000 bed nights are provided each year and demand is increasing. Women come with problems related to physical violence, to marital incompatability or mental cruelty, to alcoholism, psychiatric problems, homelessness, gambling and, of course, to financial problems.  Of the cases dealt with, 45 per cent go home to an unchanged situation, 30 per cent undergo organised counselling, others go home following a barring order and 9 per cent set up home <Col N="1761" /> away from their husbands.  The diversity of cases is evident.</P>
    <P>I want to make a strong case for this refuge because they are outside the Pale, a factor that has been addressed in other matters today.  There is the feeling that those who cry loudest can sometimes be centred in Dublin.  There is only joy that the women's aid refuge in Dublin received funding but there is a need to state that centres like ADAPT House do tremendous work.  For many, long stays in institutions are not desirable but there are occasions when it is not possible for families to leave ADAPT House within the accepted time limit, which is approximately 12 weeks.  They no longer need the full security of the refuge or the input from staff but no other accommodation is available.  The biggest demand at the moment, outside of the salaries for the two childcare workers that they need to employ, is for half-way housing.  Four flats have been fitted out basically to help those families in a transition period so that they will be fully rehabilated eventually. What is necessary is equipment for those flats where women share a communal kitchen.  Children who have suffered sexual abuse are presenting themselves in growing numbers and they require an almost one-to-one care.  Therefore, I am appealing to the Minister, as one who listened very carefully last year to the Women's Rights Committee, to tell us his plans for the £500,000 allocation to various groups throughout the country.  I know he will listen very carefully and ensure that ADAPT House, and similar refuges throughout the country, will receive funding from the £500,000.  That is not to say that other groups seeking support for women's centres throughout the country such as community-based groups, both rural and urban, should not get their fair share, but it is essential that a caring institution like ADAPT House &mdash; if &ldquo;institution&rdquo; is not the wrong word for an alternative &mdash; be facilitated to ensure that a rehabilitation service catering for almost the whole of the west would <Col N="1762" /> be financially secure.  Voluntary workers should feel that there is support for them in 1991.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased that the Government decided to allocate £500,000 in the budget to continue the grants scheme which I introduced last year for locally based women's groups.</P>
      <P>This was the first programme of its kind.  It was intended to provide support and development outlets for women in the home.  It has proved to be extremely successful.  Some 200 groups, from all around the country, received grants from the allocation of £350,000 made last year. Over 6,000 women benefited directly from the projects run by the groups concerned.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman referred to the rape crisis centres and to a specific, separate allocation made by the Minister for Finance in the budget last year and which we distributed.  What we did was contact all the rape crisis centres around the country and asked them what their needs were.  Some did decide later that their needs were bigger than they thought at first.  Some had plans ready to be implemented and they were able to make their needs clear from the outset, and others had to think about it.  We said, &ldquo;Right, think about it and come back to us.&rdquo;  The money then apportioned was to the different centres.</P>
      <P>In this year's budget the Minister for Finance again specified a number of centres, including one in Ballymun, and the women's aid organisation, which were mentioned specifically.  I want to emphasise that the purpose of this fund, which consisted of £350,000 last year and is £500,000 this year, is to help women in the home in all the activities that they can become involved in.  In conjunction with that, we can of course give assistance to other women's groups, but the primary purpose of this fund is to help women in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of activities were <Col N="1763" /> assisted, including self-development and home management courses for women living in deprived areas, counselling and advice services, community education, women's health programmes, young parents' groups, some women's refuges, travellers' projects and arts and crafts courses building on women's skills.  In allocating grants, we gave priority to particularly disadvantaged areas and to projects aimed at specifically disadvantaged groups.  Almost half of the groups funded were less than a year in existence and many of these sought relatively small amounts of money for their projects.  Other groups at an advanced stage of development sought more substantial funding and six of these large scale projects received grants of £10,000 each, including the ICA who set up a new counselling service for women in the home who are having difficulties with their marriages.</P>
    <P>There are many women's groups throughout the country doing very worthwhile work in the social services area within their own community.  There was a very positive and constructive response to the introduction of the scheme and I know that many women's groups saw it as official recognition of the valuable work which they are doing.</P>
    <P>Examples of the sort of groups assisted include the North Wall Women's Centre in Dublin's inner city, which received a grant of £10,000.  This group provide second chance education and personal development courses for mothers.  Its activities also include programmes in leadership skills, cookery, drama and literacy.</P>
    <P>A grant of £3,000 was provided to the WEDGE group in Cork, which is primarily concerned with women's education and personal development. The Moyross Family Resource Centre in Limerick received £5,000 for the purchase of equipment for the centre and to run personal development, literacy, <Col N="1764" /> sewing and cookery courses for women in the area.</P>
    <P>An amount of £500,000 has been allocated for the scheme this year as compared with £350,000 in 1990.  Last year, three major projects received core funding of £10,000 each.  These were the North Wall Women's Centre in Dublin's inner city, Ronanstown Self-Development Group in Clondalkin and the Little Bray Family Resource and Development Centre.  In view of the major contribution which these projects are making in the development of their local communities, they will each receive a grant of £11,000 in 1991 to enable them to continue to develop their activities.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the activities of my Department have gone beyond the area of income maintenance and we are becoming increasingly involved in providing financial and other supports to voluntary and community groups in the social services area.  This does not mean, however, that we are taking over responsibilities which are more proper to other State agencies.  We are simply providing special recognition where we are in a position to do so to groups who are doing particularly valuable work in this area.</P>
    <P>Last year for example, special once-off grants were provided to the six rape crisis centres to assist them with their work. This year, special grants are being provided from the £500,000 for women's groups to a number of organisations which provide refuge for women and children who are victims of domestic violence. These will include the Aoibhneas Women's Refuge in Ballymun, the Women's Aid Refuge in Rathmines and the Meath Women's Aid Centre.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the allocation for women's groups however is to assist newly established groups and to provide practical support and encouragement to women to come together and establish new groups within their communities.  In almost 70 per cent of cases, the grants made enabled the groups to undertake projects which could not otherwise have <Col N="1765" /> been undertaken.  The scheme has enormous potential and I plan to maintain the emphasis on using the fund to help groups in establishing themselves within their communities.</P>
    <P>Last week I formally launched the 1991 grants scheme which is being advertised extensively on local radio throughout the country and in the newspapers.  Any project being carried out by a locally based women's group may qualify for a grant. Projects should involve the participants in the running of the project and where possible in the design of the project itself. Application forms for grants under the scheme are available from my Department. The deadline for receipt of completed applications is not until 20 April.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the very worthwhile work being carried out by ADAPT House in Rosbrien in Limerick.  In fact, this group have already received financial assistance on two occasions under the grants for voluntary bodies scheme administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>A grant for the ADAPT group cannot even be considered at this stage since they have not applied.  I have already issued an application form to the Senator to pass on to the group and I can assure her that their application will be given careful consideration when it is received. Bearing this in mind I am surprised that the Senator should have persisted with this motion.</P>
    <P>At the same time I understand the Senator said she wishes to highlight the position of ADAPT.  Certainly, as far as I am concerned, if the Senator was to say to me that this group are doing excellent work and wished to submit an application, I would follow that up on her behalf. The Senator must appreciate that, essentially, the refuges are the responsibility of local health boards.  We can give them some assistance and if the Senator submits an application I will certainly have it considered this year.</P>
    <P>As the Senator knows there is some extra money in this year's allocation so I hope there is a possibility of disbursing <Col N="1766" /> some of it.  The Minister for Finance in the course of the budget speech each year mentions a number of projects.  That is the preogative of the Minister for Finance and submissions should be made to him before the budget.</P>
    <P>The final date for application is 20 April and they will be considered at that stage.  Grants were made to the Mid-Western Health Board.  We tried to spread the money around the health boards but the amount distributed relates to the number of applications coming forward.  In the Eastern Health Board region there are huge areas of disadvantage and many organisations seeking grants.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board area grants were allocated as follows: Ladies Club, Southhill, Limerick, £400; Moyross Family Centre, £5,000 and Caring and Sharing Group, Moyross, £300.  The Family Resource Centre, Ballynantybeg, received £3,000; Janesboro Women's Development Group, £3,000; Kilfinane Women's Development Group, £800; Kings Island Youth and Community Centre Committee, £4,000; CARE, Limerick, £500; Parents' Awareness Group, St. Ann's School, Ennis, £350, Soroptimist International, Ennis and District, £1,000; Tipperary Women's Development Group, Tipperary Town, £3,000 and Women's Education Group, Templemore, £300.  They all got more or less what they sought.  There is a small booklet &mdash; I can provide a copy if the Senator does not have one &mdash; outlining all the grants paid last year, the first year of the operation of the scheme.</P>
    <P>As I said, I accept that ADAPT House are doing excellent work and if they submit an application I will certainly ensure that it is fully considered.</P>
