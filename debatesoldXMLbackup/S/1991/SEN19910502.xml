      <P>I have notice from Senator Raftery that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take effective measures to prevent the use of illegal drugs in beef production, in order to protect our beef sales.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Upton of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request the EC to act in consort with the rest of the international community to prevent the impending famine in Africa.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Raftery and Upton as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected Senator Raftery's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Upton may give notice another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

Could the Leader of the House find out for us, if he does not already know, if there are such detailed proposals? If they exist, what shape are they in? When may we expect to see them in this House, if at all?</P>

      <P>I would like to raise again the question of the introduction of the Education Bills, and also the question of a debate on education, which the Leader assured me he would raise with the Minister with a view to determining a date for such a debate. On the question of the reform of the Seanad we, on these depleted Independent benches, are very keen to extend the Seanad franchise to people outside local authorities and university graduates. We would like to raise the issue of a debate on reform of the Seanad. It could be taken with the constitutional Oireachtas reform question raised by Senator Manning. We are open to all sorts of criticism at the moment in that we do not have enough people involved in the election of representatives to the second Chamber.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> In the light of what happened last week, it would be appropriate at some stage to consider the state of industrial relations in Ireland. Between the Dáil and the Seanad we had 226 experts on industrial relations running riot last week. In calmer times, now is the time to address the structures and the problems in general. This is not having a cut at Government or anyone else. It is just simply assessing and addressing the question of industrial relations in Ireland.</P>

      <P>Has the Leader of the House any information for us on the present status of the proposed foreign affairs committee? Can he confirm for us that Members of this House will be members of it? Have there been any developments, in view of the Taoiseach's reply yesterday, in regard to the possibility of this committee being established during this session?</P>

      <P>Senator Upton took the words out of my mouth. I was thinking of what the Leader said yesterday in reply to a similar question from me in which he said he was hopeful that there would be appropriate Seanad representation on such a committee. That does not sound to me to be terribly positive. Since the Leader is the only channel between the House and the Government, has he been making active representations on our behalf that there should be appropriate Seanad representation and that it should be a joint committee?</P>

The report is very important and vindicates Fine Gael policy.</P>

      <P>As has been said, the Progressive Democrats would be very keen to have a debate on Oireachtas reform. We were anxious to see it in the Programme for Government and anxious to see it come to the top of the list. Would the Leader of the House support the move to have a discussion on that whole area. With regard to the foreign affairs committee, we are more than just hopeful. We believe that Senators have a right to be on this committee. I ask the Leader of the House to impress on the Taoiseach that this is the feeling of all the Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear Senator O'Toole speaking on the reform of the Oireachtas and on the number of votes to elect people here. When he takes over the secretaryship of his association he will have in mind a bigger vote. As a former member of the Committee of Procedure and Privileges &mdash; until I was moved off that, as well &mdash; I suggest that the Cathaoirleach, as chairman of that committee, Senator Manning, Senator O'Toole and the Leader of the House, who are all members of the committee should get together and prepare a White Paper in place on how this House should be reformed. Then we could discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to hear Senator Cullen talking about reform. It is a relief to me that he is not getting rid of us that he only wants reform now. I urge the Cathaoirleach and the Leader to think about what I have said. There is mention of White Papers, Green Papers and so on. Let us prepare one paper on reform of the Seanad. I have no trouble with a closed shop. I do not think the Seanad election <Col N="1314" /> was ever a closed shop. It has always been tough to get in here. If we compiled this White Paper ourselves, maybe somebody would take notice elsewhere. I have confidence the Cathaoirleach will do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Honan has said. I chaired an <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on Foreign Affairs in 1981-82 but it was mainly composed of a number of Senators briefing ourselves, speaking with ambassadors or VIPS who happened to come through. They were all outside the House. Nevertheless, there is a useful idea there. Since 1981 we have introduced quite a number of reforms. When are we going to put some of them into practice? Yesterday morning I mentioned that we might consider inviting the Commissioner for Agriculture or one of the experts we have on development aid. I mentioned his Lordship Dr. Casey, from Galway, or Father Finucane, who might address the House. We have that provision on the rules of the House. Why do we not use some of the reforms that we introduced ten years ago?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the Radiological Protection Bill. Indeed, I would like to thank the Opposition for their help on that. It is important as we are the last country to arrange procedures so that the Convention can be completed and from that point of view it is urgent. If the debate is not completed at 6 o'clock there will be an element of flexibility. The Senator also asked me to investigate the present state of play in regard to reform of the Oireachtas. I will do that and keep him briefed as much as I can on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole asked about a debate on education. My hope was that we would have it next week. I have been in touch with the Minister's office but, unfortunately, she will not be available next week. In the week following that, I had indicated to Senator Costello, Senator Harte and Senator Ryan that we would have the debate on prisons. That is still <Col N="1315" /> planned for that week. If we feel we should have a debate on education that week, we will have it and we can put back the prisons debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFallon" hpid="Mr. Fallon Mr. Fallon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fallon</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole asked about a debate on the reform of the Seanad. I have no proposal for that. It is obviously something we can discuss. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have discussed it from time to time and should continue to discuss it on and off. Senator O'Toole also referred to the industrial dispute of last week. We are all very pleased that problem is now resolved and, hopefully, it is the last we will see of that type of dispute. I have no proposal for a debate on that matter at this time.</P>
      <P>Senator Upton referred to the foreign affairs debate, as did Senator Murphy. I said that the information given to me was that this committee would be set up during this session. Senator Murphy asked what representations, if any, I have made in regard to representation from the Seanad and he made the point that I said I was hopeful. That still is the position. I cannot say categorically that there will be representation from the Seanad. I have expressed the wish on a number of occasions that there would be Seanad representation and all I can say is that I am hopeful that is the position.</P>
      <P>Senator Neville asked about a debate on the programme that was recently announced on law reform. I understand the Minister indicated he was bringing forward legislation on that matter. Senator Brendan Ryan referred to the Local Government Reform Bill and he commented on what Senator Finneran said. Senator Finneran replied. I can say the publishing of that Bill is imminent. He also asked about the debate on the prisons system. I have arranged for such a debate either on the 15th or 16th of this month. In fairness to Senator Brendan Ryan, I did not promise a debate before Christmas &mdash; before Easter, yes. I really hoped to have it before Easter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cullen referred again to <Col N="1316" /> Oireachtas reform. Senator Honan's comments have been noted, as have the comments of Senator McDonald.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was opportune that we adjourned at the point we did yesterday. Certainly I was thoroughly confused with this section by the time we had finished with it. I have spent a lot of time between last night and this morning trying to unravel the system of appointment. With due respect to the parliamentary draftsmen, it is gobbledygook. I defy anybody to read this and to explain how an appointment is made when we run into the difficulties envisaged by some of the subsections to section 21. I have an amendment to delete the word &ldquo;particular&rdquo;. I would like to draw attention to the fact that, first, we have to look at subsection (4) which begins, where the Minister makes &ldquo;a&rdquo; request under subsection (7). It is not a special request; it is &ldquo;a&rdquo; request. Subsection 9 (a) reads:</P>
      <P>if the committee is unable to select any suitable candidate pursuant to a particular request, ...</P>
      <P>It has now become &ldquo;a particular&rdquo; request.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) begins with:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Minister makes a request under subsection (7) or (9) or section 24 and at the time of making the request any of the offices specified in subsection (2) is vacant, the Minister may appoint a person to be a member of the committee and such person shall remain a member of the committee until such time as the selection by the <Col N="1317" /> committee pursuant to the request is made.</P>
    <P>That is absolutely right. It becomes &ldquo;the&rdquo; request which is precisely what my amendment provides. In that case &ldquo;a&rdquo; request becomes &ldquo;the&rdquo; request. That has to be precise.</P>
    <P>In subsection (8) there is a reference to &ldquo;a&rdquo; request under subsection (7), and that is also fair enough. Subsection (9) (a) states:</P>
    <P>if the committee is unable to select any suitable candidate pursuant to a particular request...</P>
    <P>which does not make any sense at all. In my opinion subsection (9) (b) should include the words:</P>
    <P>If the Government decide not to appoint to be the Director General any of the candidates or, as the case may be, the candidate, selected by the committee pursuant to the request.</P>
    <P>Apart from being incorrect, what is proposed is contradictory to what comes in the next section. In the next two subparagraphs it is quite clear that the question of &ldquo;the&rdquo; request is totally irrelevant. In subparagraph (i) and (ii) it is quite clear that the Government can act on the basis of any of the requests. Subsection (9) (b) (i) reads:</P>
    <P>(i) the Government shall appoint a person to be the Director General who was among those, or, as the case may be, was the candidate, elected by the committee pursuant to a previous request (if any) in relation to that appointment,...</P>
    <P>We then go on to subsection (9) (b) (ii) which reads:</P>
    <P>(ii) the Minister shall make a further such request...</P>
    <P>It is not &ldquo;a particular request&rdquo;, it is &ldquo;a further such request&rdquo;. It continues:</P>
    <P>...to the committee and the Government shall appoint to be the Director General a person who was among the candidates or, as the case may be, was <Col N="1318" /> the candidate selected by the committee pursuant to that request or pursuant to another such request made in relation to that appointment.</P>
    <P>I do not understand it even though I have gone through it thoroughly. It would be fair to say, without being in any sense disparaging &mdash; and I am not trying to be smart about it &mdash; that if I were to put my name on the list of candidates for this job today, nine or ten requests later if the Government felt that I was the right person to choose they could take my name from the number of candidates who applied. However, that is a separate issue. One cannot talk about &ldquo;a&rdquo; particular request because &ldquo;the&rdquo; particular request cannot be followed right down through the sections. It is &ldquo;a&rdquo; request. I have a difficulty in principle with the way in which it operates, particularly in relation to the two subparagraphs.</P>
    <P>The Government appears to be able to do anything they wish. Even the relationship between the Minister and the Government is not clear at some points. We are not talking about a particular request. To tie it together, subsection (9) (a) refers to a particular request, but it is not about a particular request. It is about any request which comes under subsection (4) which reads:</P>
    <P>Where the Minister makes a request under subsection (7) or (9) ...</P>
    <P>It is any request under those subsections, and it is also any of the requests made under subsection (9) (b) (ii). From what I can figure out they are interchangeable. At the end of the day somebody is going to say &ldquo;words say what I say they mean&rdquo; but nobody can follow through logically how an appointment is to be made. It is trying to cover all aspects &mdash; and I do not disagree with that &mdash; but it is trying to cover some things which cannot be dealt with. The normal practice is that when a committee of selection fails to make an appointment there is only one thing to do and that is to start all over again. Normally, that means advertising from the beginning.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> I have another specific question on subsection (9) (b) (ii) in relation to the last few clauses in it. It states &ldquo;... or pursuant to another such request ...&rdquo;. When the Minister or the Government make a request at that point are they talking about a rerun of the whole section, or are they talking about going back to subsection (9)? That is unclear in subparagraph (ii). It is not clear whether that request is supposed to go back to subsection (9) or whether it goes back to the very beginning of the structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator O'Toole obviously over yesterday evening and last night, has tried to clear this point in his mind. In all the legislation put through this House since 1977 I do not remember a measure as complicated as this and if it is complicated to Senator O'Toole what chance have I? Would the Minister consider redrafting it in a simpler fashion? I am quite sure it would still mean the same thing but perhaps I am asking too much. Now that it has been brought out again in detail to us here this morning, I wonder would the Minister comment on it? Perhaps it is absolutely clear to the Minister and to her senior departmental advisers, but it is not clear to us and if it is not clear to us it will not be clear to Members of the Dáil and to the people outside. This is one record this House has, that if a section needs to be changed and this has happened before &mdash; this is the place to do it. Perhaps it is one section that could be redrafted with less repetition in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read this subsection and I am not deliberately trying to hold up the Minister but may I suggest that part of the confusion about subsection (9) is that two entirely different things are being covered in the same subsection. One is a problem to do with the committee being unable to select somebody &mdash; it is perfectly legitimate that the legislation should make provision for that likelihood given the structure of the committee and I would see a clear division <Col N="1320" /> between the insiders and the outsiders as liable to be 3:3, but that is a separate issue. A separate problem is that the Government may not be happy to make the appointment the committee recommends. It seems that a lot of clarity would result if those two issues were dealt with in separate subsections, one subsection to deal with the possibility of the committee not being able to agree, and the other possibility that the Government do not want to make the appointment the committee recommends. They are two separate issues. If they were dealt with separately a lot of these problems would be avoided.</P>
      <P>Subparagraphs (1) and (2) refer to either of two different possibilities and the permutations become extremely complicated at that stage. The simplest way would be to ask the people in the draftsman's office who give Ministers briefs to give us lectures about the necessity for clarity in legislation to make the separate subsections. At this stage I am sure every page of the Minister's brief has a quote from the draftsman's office. The Minister should ask them to say precisely what she wants them to say. I cannot make any sense of it and I do not think we should spend a lot of time on it here. It should be looked at again and my suggestion would be to separate the two eventualities which are not related. One is the committee cannot do it, the other is the Government will not do it. They are two separate things and should be dealt with separately. A lot of the overlap would be got rid of if they were dealt with separately.</P>

      <P>I fully support Senator Ryan's interpretation of this section. I await the Minister's response. It strikes me that what we were talking about yesterday in terms of adding even one more member to the selection committee would change the vote to 3:4 if we are talking strictly in terms of voting and you are less likely to have the problem that is indicated here but that is gone and I will not develop it. It also strikes me that if the National Heritage Council or another body with an environmental bent had <Col N="1321" /> been added, but particularly the National Heritage Council which could be considered insider, we might have the right balance to avoid the problems this section is trying to take care of.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the day when the law will be self-explanatory to all of us. It causes me as much confusion as it does everybody else. I often pick up American legislation and see how easy it is to understand exactly what is intended. These provisions are taken from the Director of Public Prosecutions Act, 1974 and the 1983 Act establishing An Bord Pleanála. Precisely the same wording is used and neither has caused any problems. I will explain in English &mdash; if that is not out of order &mdash; what exactly happens.</P>
      <P>The Minister acting on behalf of the Government makes a request to the committee for names in relation to the post of director-general and the committee can send up to three names. If, in the event, the Government do not appoint somebody on that request, they make a particular request, which is another request, and if&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just explaining what happens. They make a particular request which is for another set of names or whatever. If they do not select somebody from the second request the Government can go back and take somebody who was on the first list or another request. In order to avoid confusion I will have a look at this again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously it would be my intention to have it made clearer. I did not envisage that this section would cause any problems since we had taken it verbatim from two Acts that have been on the Statute Book for some years and have not caused confusion. It has not arisen that a Government did not appoint somebody who was suggested. This is to deal with all eventualities. I am told it is here for <Col N="1322" /> legislative clarity and so on. We will have a look at it again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. There are a number of things that should be clarified. First, what is meant by the Government making a request? Do the committee begin the process of selection <i>ab initio?</i> It is not made clear here how this appointment is made. It is left up to the committee. I presume they would advertise and so on but that is not in the legislation. In all these requests it is not clear to me whether the Government have to go through the whole process of selection. In other words if the Government decide not to appoint do they have to begin again from the beginning and go through the whole procedure on each occasion? That is an important factor.</P>
      <P>One of the things I found very confusing was that at the beginning of subsection (9) it says: If the committee is unable to select any suitable candidate...&rdquo; that surely should be &ldquo;or candidates&rdquo;. If you are beginning the process all over again, when they come back to make the selection it might be for three or fewer. That has to be made clear. I think we have discussed this in full. I have made the point and I am not pushing it any further. If the Minister would appeal that it be drafted with clarity and with legislative and legal safety that is good enough for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">

      <P>Obviously we will be making regulations in relation to procedure. The positions would probably be advertised. I will be making provision that the committee would use the services of a professional recruitment company to help them in the process. It is a difficult process. The reason &ldquo;candidate&rdquo; and not &ldquo;candidates&rdquo; is used, is that the committee may send only one name forward. They do not have to send three. I do not envisage that the Government would not appoint the name sent forward. This Bill is to deal with somebody having perhaps a subversive background or something of that nature. It is to deal with these kinds of eventualities that this legislation is framed in exactly the same way as the <Col N="1323" /> Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, and the Local Government Act, 1983, establishing An Bord Pleanála. Given my commitment, we will have a look at it again to see if we can simplify the matter.</P>

      <P>Thank you. On that basis I will withdraw my amendment. I have no difficulty whatsoever about the Government having the right not to appoint somebody because I would be the first person to criticise the Government for making the wrong appointment. I would want them to have the discretion, for whatever reason not to appoint somebody. I look forward to a redrafting of this in an appropriate form which would make life easier for all of us.</P>

      <P>In page 19, subsection (15), lines 47 and 48 and in page 20, line 1, to delete &ldquo;or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the director general is properly appointed, he should have the maximum security of tenure, his activities should not be subject to any interference whatsoever and the Government should not be in a position to dismiss him for some vague and arbitrary reason or because he is politically unacceptable. I note that they would have to bring such a case before the Houses of the Oireachtas and give stated reasons, but that is not a guarantee that they would be dismissing him for the right reasons. They could allege another reason, as it were. It seems to me that when you say he can be removed on grounds of ill-health and, therefore, incapable of performing his duties or for stated misbehaviour, that that is as far as you can go. Once you talk about the Government thinking that his <Col N="1324" /> removal is necessary or desirable for the effective performance of the agency you are on to quite dangerous ground.</P>
    <P>Our rule of thumb in all these matters should be to give the Government the minimum power to interfere with the agency and its director once it is set up. I see no good reason why that clause should be included in the subsection and I propose its removal.</P>

      <P>It may come as a surprise to the Minister that I have found on many Committee Stages that some of the sections that cause most of the trouble are the ones that have been in a whole succession of previous legislation. The reason is because they are often so confused or so peculiar that people have let them slip past and quite genuinely it does a lot of good to actually have a look at them. I do not believe that you should have a director general who cannot be dismissed if he or she is clearly incapable of carrying out his or her duties for reasons of ill-health or stated misbehaviour. However, I am unhappy with the idea that you set up an agency, you give it a board of directors, you operate an appointment procedure, the person has a maximum period in office of seven years and, on top of all those constraints, you say that if his removal appears to the Government &ldquo;to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions...&rdquo; and so on. That is the sort of catch-all phrase that may well tempt Governments and may well appeal to Governments, but it is the stuff of bad legislation. I am concerned that if Governments want the power to dismiss people, they should specifically circumscribe that power. Otherwise it is far from their being accountable nor is it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In subsection (15) it is stated that &ldquo;the <Col N="1325" /> Government shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal&rdquo;. That is not just dealing with, what I will call, for argument's sake, the offending part of this. It is for any reason. It appears to me that if the Government use the phrase &ldquo;the removal appears to the Government to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the Agency of its functions&rdquo; then the statement from the Government that would come before the Houses of the Oireachtas would simply say, &ldquo;The Government dismissed the director general because it appeared to the Government that his removal was necessary or desirable for the effective functioning of the Agency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The phrase as it stands gives the Government a considerable, and I do not think a justified, capacity to dismiss the person simply because they do not like the way the agency is doing its business. I am not saying that it would be done lightly but I believe Governments have enormous power. After all, Governments can introduce amending legislation and have it through both Houses of the Oireachtas in most cases in half a day if necessary. To include catch-all phrases like this, just in case we did not think of everything, suggests a tendency to believe that our capacity to draft legislation is limited and that we have to have these catch-all phrases in case we do not think of something. It is a bad way to do it and I fully support Senator Murphy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the need to change this because I believe that apart from grounds of ill-health, or for stated misbehaviour, there can be other very good reasons why the director general would have to be removed from office and there must be some way of achieving that. I do not think it is the intention of the Government to be vindictive to the point of getting rid of the director general for some spurious reason. There must be regulation other than ill-health, or stated misbehaviour. Because the Government must then lay before the Houses of the <Col N="1326" /> Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal, I would favour leaving that section as it stands.</P>
      <P>In relation to what we have spoken about already, and the previous amendments, surely when the Minister says that it was in the Director of Public Prosecutions Act and so on, you could go back to the 1880s. That is what gets us into difficulties. We are dealing with language that is archaic. I take the Minister's point about American legislation. It should be possible for any intelligent citizen to understand the law of the land. I sometimes think that the language used in legislation is a device by the lawyers to keep themselves in business rather than to allow the citizens understand the law. That is perhaps a separate issue. In that respect, at least, I agree with Senator O'Toole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are appointing a director general to look after the Environmental Protection Agency. What is &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;? Let us say the director general of the Environmental Protection Agency decides to take shares in a chemical waste disposal plant in Connemara. Would that be stated misbehaviour? Are we talking about that horrible word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; or of morals? What is the misbehaviour we are talking about here? Is it an unacceptable type of relationship? I have difficulty with this phrase &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. Would bribery be regarded as stated misbehaviour? Would it be all right for the director general to take a bribe to give a licence for a dirty industry to be set up in Dingle?</P>
      <P>Another thing that worries me slightly about the director general is that he or she can be removed for &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; whereas the deputy director general can only be sacked for &ldquo;committing stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. I am intrigued by the difference. One seems to be a passive situation where we can all nod and wink but the other person has actually to do it and be seen to do it. I do not have the same difficulty as my colleague, Senator Ryan, about the words:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1327" /> or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary or desirable for the effective performance by the Agency of its work.</P>
    <P>I would oppose that if it were left like that, but the fact is that they have to lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal. To put it in context, if the Government decided tomorrow to remove the Director General of RTE there would be one almighty national row. I do not think any Government would do so lightly. I am not worried about that part, but I am concerned about &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. On Tuesday night last I had a discussion with one of our best known Irish authors, John McGahern. John McGahern was sacked from his job for &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; in 1963. Who stated it, I do not know. I found it unacceptable at the time. I feel that &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; is something that can move from time and place. I think &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; is unnecessary in this legislation. I do not know what it means. I do not know if it has to do with unacceptable practices to do with the environment or to do with personal relationships or private life, or money, or bribery and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure Senator O'Toole that one's private life, unless it impinges on one's public responsibilities, will not be considered stated misbehaviour unless, of course, some of the new waves of enthusiasm sweeping through certain quarters take control here such as the Christian Democrats principles, or whatever they are called. Obviously, &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; deals with corruption, bribery and matters of that kind. Since the Government will have to specify in a document to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas that should satisfy us.</P>

      <P>In relation to Senator Murphy's amendment, it is desirable that if a director general is incompetent or not performing his duties or if the agency is not being run efficiently there should be some room for manoeuvre for the Government to be able to dismiss that director. The term &ldquo;ill-health&rdquo; is clear and &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; is corruption, bribery, and so on. Incompetence arises if the agency are not functioning or if the director general is in conflict with others in the agency and the work is in cnaos. There is a need for such a subsection. In relation to the dismissal of public servants this is exactly the procedure that is followed and the power that is given to the Government. I do not think anybody would suggest that it has been used either excessively, been abused or whatever. I do not know how one would get rid of the General Secretary of the INTO, what kind of procedures are involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe the Senator should give me look at them. Obviously, the director general would have at his disposal the Unfair Dismissals Act, his natural rights under the Constitution and so on. I do not think we need worry that a Government would willy-nilly seek to get rid of somebody because they did not like him or for some reason like that. I know that is the point the Senators are concerned about.</P>
      <P>We need to leave room for a Government to act where there is gross incompetence and that is the reason why the additional phrase is included after &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a general point with reference to what Senator Dardis said about the necessity for the law being clear. A corollary of that is that we should not be necessarily impressed by provisions because they have been in other legislation. In fact, we should look at each legislation totally afresh. Maybe it is because I am not used to working on Committee Stage of a Bill <Col N="1329" /> that to me all this is new. I am there making a present to Senator Ryan for his electors. I asked, outside of &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; and &ldquo;ill-health&rdquo; what other reasons were there. I perfectly accept the point, and I was already aware of it, that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a director general, having been appointed as being qualified and suitable and showing every promise and so on could inexplicably begin to swing the lead or be diverted by other matters and so on. However, I would prefer, instead of that kind of blanket clause, that the Minister could have another specific thing on the lines of &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo;. Incompetence is, after all, a fairly clear condition as it were. It was my general feeling that the role of the Government, once the Director General has been appointed, should be absolutely minimal to interfere with the functioning of the official or the agency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister jogged my memory when she pointed out that this subsection was the same as that applied to public servants and civil servants generally. Do I not recall correctly that even though reasons must be given for their removal from office they need not be detailed reasons. For example, in this case the Minister could lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a statement that the director general had been removed for reasons of ill-health or that he had been removed because he had committed a stated misbehaviour or that he was removed because it appeared to the Government necessary and desirable for the effective performance of the agency. There is no commitment in this subsection to give detailed reasons so that we would know what specifically caused the removal. It will be one of these generalities that will be put in the statement that will be laid before the Houses. I do not think, from the Minister's assurances, that we will be any wiser when some document is laid before the Oireachtas. I would like the Minister to clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point that struck me is whether the director general being <Col N="1330" /> declared bankrupt, for example, would be considered by the Government as rendering him unsuitable for office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Senator is making and I more or less agree with it except to say that if a Government are taking this drastic action, obviously one wants to minimise the effect of that on the individual and his or her family. Subject to that, I will have a look at it. I accept the point the Senator is making, that it is not good enough to say &ldquo;stated misbehaviour&rdquo; and leave everybody wondering. At the same time the director general, and his or her family, have rights which I would not like to infringe, although I accept that being in a key position they have responsibilities that probably lessen their rights in that regard and that the people have a right to know. I will have a look at it to see if in some way we can satisfy what the Senator is saying which, basically, I agree with.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 21 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a general comment on section 21 for the record. I support what we have decided. To my mind the process as outlined in the section and the people and interests represented on the selection committee, is absolutely correct in as much as it represents Irish life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the section the people who will select the candidate are the Secretary to the Government, the Secretary of the Department, the Chairperson of An Taisce, the Managing Director of the IDA, the General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Chief Executive of the Council for the Status of Women. The appointment of the latter two shows a very progressive development on the part of the Government in many ways. It also shows a response to the demands by the social partners, particularly the trade union movement, <Col N="1331" /> and also reflects the trade union movement's concern for the status of women.</P>
    <P>It is quite in order and quite correct and I would like to be seen to be in support of what is there. Despite comments made yesterday by people the Council for the Status of Women have a perfect right to be represented. It is an issue in which they would have a particular interest and many others have but in terms of size and groups represented they are an important one. I am happy that the committee of selection will represents those areas in Irish life which are most important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Minister a question on section 21 (11). It reads:</P>
      <P>The Director General shall be appointed in a wholetime capacity and shall not at any time during his term of office hold any other office or employment in respect of which emoluments are payable.</P>
      <P>What about the director general being involved in stocks and shares, in the purchase of land, the sale of land and so on? Should he or she not be prohibited from those activities which are neither offices nor employment but which could be potentially sources of a serious conflict of interest? It seems to me that this is a position which must be above reproach. Like the rest of us the director general is perfectly entitled to have his insurance policies and so on in which he has no real say over what happens to his funds, but the direct involvement in ownership of land, sale of land or sale of stocks and shares seems to me to be an area where the director general of an agency like this should not be involved. If he or she has any sense they will not be doing it but we should ensure in legislation, if it is possible, that he or she does not do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention here is that the director general would be a full-time official and would not hold any other employment. Obviously, they could be involved in voluntary groups or something in their spare time. Therefore, it is <Col N="1332" /> a question of their employment interests. Their interests in property or shares or whatever is dealt with by way of declaration of interests and we should deal with that there. Obviously, they have to declare their interests and they cannot partake in anything that has to do with something in which they have an interest. That is the appropriate way to do that. We cannot expect the director general and directors to cease to be property owners or to not be involved in the ownership of shares. That would be unreasonable. That is better dealt with by way of declaration of interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, a very active person who is interested in this could end up being debarred from taking many positions. I have an amendment later about the interests of the director general being on public record. That generally does not mean that the value of any of these shares has to be disclosed but simply their ownership. What I would be inclined to suggest is the sort of requirement that is imposed on Ministers in the Government in that any directorships or any involvement would have to be done, as in the United States, by way of a blind trust. When somebody becomes a member of the government in the United States all their ownership of shares etc. has to be passed on to a trust which deals with them without the person having any personal involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the director general of the Environment Protection Agency should be involved in the Stock Market or should be involved in land deals. They are a serious area of risk and conflict of interest. We accept that in a specific case the interest has to be stated. The specific case is a decision by the Environmental Protection Agency, the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency might be aware that certain companies were interested in certain areas of development and had informal contact. It seems that is going into an area with a receipe for uncertainty. I do not think that the director general should be the sort of person who takes those risks. There is a case to be made for doing more than <Col N="1333" /> simply saying in a specific case when it comes before the Environmental Protection Agency an interest should be stated. Stating an interest at a time when a decision is well under way does not necessarily mean that the person will not have benefited from astute use of information that was perhaps obtained informally.</P>

      <P>I was interested to note that Senator O'Toole has belatedly joined Senator Ryan in nailing his colours to the feminist mast and, incidentally, nailing down the feminist vote as well. Perhaps because I bring to these matters the freshness of someone who has not been very assiduous in legislative work, I was appalled, as a democrat, to note that the masculine pronoun and possessive adjective are used throughout this Bill. There is no introductory section which takes the harm out of this by saying &ldquo;he&rdquo; and &ldquo;his&rdquo; shall embrace &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;. I am amazed that every feminist nerve in the Minister's body did not jangle at this atrocity; mine do.

      <P>Senator O'Toole drew <Col N="1335" /> my attention to this on Second Stage. The sole purpose of this amendment is to maintain consistency between the provisions of this subsection and section 21 (15) in relation to the basis for the removal of the director general from office. Obviously, in one case it was for stated misbehaviour and so on. We have removed the difficulty there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 77:</P>
      <P>In page 22, between lines 14 and 15, to insert a new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(12) The Agency shall compile and publish a register of interests, financial, commercial and property held by the Director General and the other Directors.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is very little one needs to say about this amendment. Either one believes in it or one does not. I recall that when I, in my innocence, a few years ago tried to introduce, not to mention have discussed, a Bill in this House to have the interests of Members of the Oireachtas put on public record, my colleagues on the other side refused even to allow me permission to print it. Hope springs eternal and the Minister's party are particularly sensitive on the issue of accountability and of standards in public life. It is a perfectly reasonable amendment.</P>
      <P>Let me explain that a register of interests in the conventionally understood sense does not mean that people have to state how much the interests are worth. They do not have to state that they own £2,000 worth of Greencore shares, which seems to be the fashionable ones at present.</P>

      <P>I keep hearing stories about people making money out of this magnificent exercise. I am not sure what good it does the productive sector of the economy but it seems to be the fashionable thing to do. The register of interests traditionally, as it is understood in other countries, does not involve people having to state the actual cash worth of the various operations they are involved in. It simply means that the places where they have direct financial interest, either in shares or in property, would be a matter of public record. It is not an unreasonable request that somebody in so sensitive an area should actually have to go through the areas where they have shares or cash or property to make sure that the publication of that list will not suggest to the public a conflict of interest that may not even have dawned on the person who has those interests. Therefore, the most simple way to focus people's attention on it is to ask them to publish the list of what they own, not how much they are worth &mdash; although I would have no problems about that, I think it would probably be a good thing for our society. What a normal register of interests means is that the interests are listed, not their value.</P>

      <P>In putting down this amendment, I feel that draftspersons also have to reflect changing times. Notwithstanding ancient and well-honoured practices, it is time we went somewhere beyond where we are. The term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is unnecessary. I have been at meetings and I have attended conferences where people have insisted on being referred to as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. Men and women have both insisted on being referred to as &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; because that is how they are termed under legislation. In the Labour Court it always annoys me that I have to refer to the person as the chairman. It has been brought to my attention on a number of occasions that it is not &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not particularly like the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, it is not a very elegant title. When I was faced with this within my own union, the INTO, we changed the term many years ago from &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; which is an equally non-sexist word and far more acceptable than <Col N="1338" /> the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. I would have preferred to have put in the word &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo; here but I reckoned it might lead to difficulties in drafting, although the Minister did accept an earlier amendment from me in Latin. I do not see that this will create any difficulty. We are reflecting changing times. The title of &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is discriminatory and unacceptable to a large number of people, even though it may be well intentioned. I would ask the Minister to respond positively to this in the Bill. It does not cost anything, it does not create any difficulty to replace the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; with the term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; throughout the Bill. I know the chief executive of the Council for the Status of Women would be very pleased to see that changed in the legislation. She would be much happier to ensure that she was involved in something which had a &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; rather than a &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; running it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with this in Senator Murphy's absence, which concerns me. Perhaps he has been converted overnight. They say that &ldquo;chairpersons&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairmen&rdquo; are a bit like angels, they are sexless. It does not really matter which term is used. I am obviously very well disposed to what the Senators say and I am going to have a look at this for Report Stage. Some people prefer to be called &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo;, &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, so there is confusion as between the terms. I will ask the parliamentary draftsman to have a look at this so that it is not offensive and that we are keeping pace with the changing times, which is certainly my concern. It is offensive to a lot of women that these titles are always referred to in the masculine. It is my desire to try to end that, so we will have a look at this for Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a little point here that needs to be clarified because &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; can become a synonym for a female chairperson. You will still have &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; and &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, which is still discriminatory because they are two different words. That is why alternatives should not be allowed. The word that <Col N="1339" /> should be used is one that does not have sexist connotations. You cannot have a situation where you have chairmen and chairpersons because that leaves the title which historically has had the weight of authority behind it. It is still appropriated by men and you have another title for women. It is a bit like &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; Most people will tell you that when newspapers use &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; They mean &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;, and that &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; is not really a substitute for &ldquo;Mrs&rdquo; or &ldquo;Miss&rdquo;. It is a term that categorises people as well, except in certain circumstances. If the Minister is going to have a look at this she should not allow people to persuade her to put in alternatives which will leave men being called &ldquo;chairmen&rdquo; and women being called &ldquo;chairpersons&rdquo; or something like that, because that does not solve the fundamental problem that the language we use is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am between two minds about the Minister's response. I put the amendment down for the reasons outlined. I expected an absolutely positive response. The term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is now unacceptable. The Minister has not indicated that clearly in her response. I know when I read &ldquo;spokesperson&rdquo; in the newspaper that it is a woman and, as Senator Ryan says, when I read &ldquo;Ms.&rdquo; I know it is Miss or at least an unmarried female. I would like us to grasp this one and say we will use a non-sexist term. There are many reasons for this. There is the question of adjusting society to change. There is the question of educating society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a situation in schools at the moment where teachers are saying to us that they are coming across sexist language all the time. This is sexist language without a shadow of a doubt. I would only find acceptable something which is not sexist language. I would be appalled at the idea of what Senator Ryan suggested might happen: that somebody would have the choice of saying &ldquo;I am the masculinist here. I want to assert myself and therefore I want to be called chairman, and chairperson is for wimps&rdquo;. I do not want that to happen. But the fear is <Col N="1340" /> that people will exult in this kind of thing, wanting to be called &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; or &ldquo;chairwoman&rdquo; or whatever. I am not sure whether it is a question of people not being self-assured about their sexuality, or whatever it is. From the point of view of the need for changes in society, of educating people to equality, and from the point of view of those in the situation &mdash; and I am particularly talking about teachers, who would be most concerned about bringing people to an awareness of equality &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; is the term to be used. It is particularly important, because a move forward has to be made. The Taoiseach has interviewed on radio last week and showed himself very open to making the type of changes I have suggested here. I think it reflects Government thinking.</P>
    <P>I have come across a very serious problem at different levels in different Departments. The Government have a view on equality and they have set up the second Council for the Status of Women. They have shown themselves to be open to move forward on women's affairs and so on. But this is not trickling down to the Departments at all. This is a classic example of it. If I were writing a document tomorrow morning to the primary teachers I would not consider using the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. If I did, I would get hundreds of letters back, not from women but from people who would be concerned about the impact in terms of equality. We should just grasp this one and change it. It is not &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;; it is &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am in agreement with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole. I accept what the Minister has said, that she will refer this back to the draftspeople. It is unfortunate to see legislation coming before us still using archaic, sexist language. It is needless at this stage. It is disappointing to see legislation in which the term &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is still being used. Language is very important. The term &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; is more and more accepted and should be generally accepted, just as we have in the Irish language &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo;, which is <Col N="1341" /> non-gender. We should have a greater awareness of the use of language. The use of the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; is indicitive of the type of awareness that is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support this amendment strongly. I am glad the Minister has given an indication that she will refer the matter to the draftsman; but, as Senator O'Toole said, perhaps she might be even more definite because the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; reflected an historical period when the senior positions were universally occupied by men. Society has changed and the language must reflect that. I would emphasise a point Senator O'Toole was making that this alteration in language has a educative value. Even people like myself find the word &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; slightly unattractive; it is a little bit ugly, but that may be because we are simply not used to it. The fact that our attention is drawn to it because we may feel a slight distaste for what we see as a stylistically unattractive word makes us think about the fact that society is changing.</P>
      <P>A very good point is being made that it should be &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. There should not be an alternative. It reminds me of the time when people used to ask when a women gave birth: is it a boy or a child? This kind of distinction is unfortunate and we ought to reduce this impact in our language. Curiously, I turned earlier on to Senator Ryan and said that the word &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; is a very good example. He said &ldquo;I was just going to say that&rdquo; and, as he was speaking, Senator O'Toole said it and then it was confirmed by&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I believe language is important and in particular I believe that if somebody gets to one of these positions who happens to be female they should not be offended by the titles. Personally, I do not mind whether I am called &ldquo;Miss&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ms&rdquo; or &ldquo;Chairperson&rdquo; or &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; or whatever. There are many who would say the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; implies male anyway, because traditionally men are associated with these positions. Besides the actual word, it has a lot to do with history and association and social thinking. I do not disagree with what is being said and, if I can, I will accede to that. In future I will instruct the draftsperson to take careful note of what titles are being used.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the debate, because for years women who did make it into chairs insisted on being called &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, or agreed that they should not be called anything else. I remember at one stage when I became chairman of the county council I clobbered the councillors who decided to call me &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; because I was chairman and that was that. I insisted that I be called chairman. I agree with the Minister, but some women have commented to me that they saw &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; as a lesser person than a chairman. The few women who made it to boards insisted that they be called chairman. By changing the title to &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; are we indirectly devaluing the chair? With due respect to Senator O'Toole, when the INTO and other teachers unions give women some <Col N="1343" /> appointments at the top &mdash; they are finding it hard to do this but they might let one or two eventually&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Why should women feel that they are not chairmen? I would hope to be a chairman again.</P>

      <P>On the basis of the Minister giving me the guarantee she did that, subject to there being no legal difficulties, she would bring in on Report Stage a change to &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;, I just want to make the general point that what Senator Honan says is absolutely right. That is why I want it legislated for. She made the point that she did not feel any less of a Cathaoirleach because she was a woman or was called the Cathaoirleach than she would have been if she were called Chairman, if that were the official title. It is significant that nothing reflects our culture more definitely and more certainly than our language. The reality is that <Col N="1344" />&ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and other terms would be seen as a lesser title if it was just something that was put aside for women. But I know that many successful women have been very &ldquo;iffy&rdquo; about this issue, about the removal of sexist language, on the basis that &ldquo;I made it myself and other people can make it. I feel stronger in the position as chairman&rdquo;. I have always felt that they were wrong about that when I heard so many men who were opposed to women supporting them and always using them as the example.</P>
      <P>I take Senator Honan's point. She is absolutely right. There was a perception that this was a lesser role &mdash;&ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;, but times are changing and they are changing very quickly. It is by bringing in these changes that we address that particular point. I am happy, on the basis of what the Minister has said and the commitments she has given, to withdraw the amendments. It also means that we have dealt with ten or 12 amendments in jig time.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister will have this matter looked at and come back on Report Stage. Having said that, I am absolutely amazed and I would ask the Minister to ensure that the parliamentary draftspeople in future when drafting a Bill would use the phrase &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;chairman&rdquo;. We must recognise that things are changing. I was surprised to see this Bill refer on many occasions to the position of chairman because that implies that the post would be held by a male. I was surprised to see a female Minister bring a Bill to this House with the phrase &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; used on so many occasions and she was not the only person to use it. Senator Doyle also used that phrase when referring to the chairman of the National Heritage Council and the chairman of the Confederation of Irish Industry. The time has come for that position to be referred to as chairperson. Our party, some ten years ago, changed the word &ldquo;chairman&rdquo; to &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo;. We were before our time but in future when <Col N="1345" /> the parliamentary draftspeople are drafting a Bill the term chairperson not chairman should be used and I am glad that the Minister has undertaken to examine this for Report Stage. I cannot see how there could be any legal difficulties involved &mdash; the term relates to the person who is chairing whether they be male or female. We should adopt that principle in any future legislation.</P>

      <P>I was taken by what Senator Honan said. I am sure she reflected a real situation where women in the past felt that they were not in command unless they were called chairman; chairperson was a lesser kind of being. That situation, although undoubtedly real, illustrates classically the internalisation of oppression in that the word &ldquo;man&rdquo; somehow conveys strength, command, control and authority. For that reason it is important to change to &lsquo;chairperson&rsquo; so that the language may reflect the situation in which people are genuinely equal. Finally, the business of Ms. Mrs. and Miss and so on is not vital but I find &lsquo;Ms.&rsquo; a most useful title. If you do not know whether the person you are addressing is married or not you put down Ms. and it is fine. I am all in favour of that because it is neutral as I believe the word chairperson is.</P>

In my opinion &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; is the most appropriate but we will refer this back to the draftspeople and ensure that we are subject to no legal difficulties. I certainly take on board the views of the Senators.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Senator Honan's comments. I had a very recent experience with a lady chairperson of a local authority. I referred to her as the lady chairperson of local authority X. I thought I heard an interruption but I went on. I later referred again to the chairperson. She made it clear that she was offended to be regarded as chairperson and told me afterwards that it meant to her that she was not as good as the men. It is not as simple as it often appears. Many women, particularly those who have been in politics for some time, are accustomed to titles like chairman and feel psychologically and socially and in every other way that the word chairperson is a lesser title and is sexist or implies inferiority. Language does help to get over that. Legislation obviously has to play its part by instituting titles that do not cause offence and do not imply that something is always in the masculine when it should be neutral. Subject to coming up with an appropriate amendment I give the House an undertaking that I will come back on this matter on Report Stage.</P>

I am unhappy with the idea of two as a quorum, which seems like a very small proportion of the membership. The Minister may have a good reason for picking two. The reason may be that it is the first number above one because one would be an unacceptable number and that two makes it as functional as possible. However there are good reasons to ensure that this agency works as as unit and the idea of a quorum of two is dangerously close to trivialising and individualising it. I am happy to move Senator O'Toole's amendment that the number of persons for a quorum should be three rather than two.</P>

      <P>I have put down this amendment together with Senators O'Toole and Doyle. The minimum for a quorum should be three; two is moving dangerously close to dictatorship. Out of the number of people involved if three persons cannot be present at a meeting the meeting should be called off and I cannot understand how two could form a quorum if democracy and the agency are to be seen to work. If members are committed to the working of the agency a greater number than two should be able to turn up for a meeting and I appeal to the Minister to accept this reasonable amendment.</P>

    <P>Senator Hederman, who is absent abroad, asked me to deal with this amendment in her name and I agreed to do so, but only technically so that it may be placed on the record, and I will explain why. I have no difficulty in supporting Senator Ryan's amendment. I look back to section 19 (3) which gives the number of people who constitute the agency as I understand it, and I quote: &ldquo;The Agency shall consist of a Director General and four other directors.&rdquo; We are dealing here with some kind of proportionality. <Col N="1348" /> You must know the number of people before you start deciding on what constitutes a quorum. Four out of five is a strict requirement for the constitution of a quorum. On the other hand, two out of five is a minority.

My point is a serious one. In a body charged with the degree of responsibility that this agency will have, with a small number of people directing it, a minority ought not to form a quorum. I will be happy to move Senator Hederman's and Senator Ross's amendment in their absence but I feel myself more in agreement with Senator Ryan's amendment.</P>

      <P>When I was framing the legislation I was anxious to give the agency as much flexibility as possible in the way it organises its own affairs. Under section 25 (5) the agency can set, if it so wishes, a higher quorum but as I was equally keen that the agency would not be given so much flexibility that one person could effectively make decisions, we set the quorum at a minimum of two. They can obviously have a higher number if they wish. The practical difficulty of raising it to three out of five would be that in a holiday month two directors could be away on holidays at the same time. That would not be unreasonable during, say, August. Another director could be tied up at another meeting or be away on agency business which would mean that ordinary decisions about the issuing of licences and so on could not be made until you got three people together. This might pose practical difficulties. The Office of Public Works, for example, have a quorum of two commissioners for <Col N="1349" /> making decisions, as do the Land Commission, I am told. There is precedence for that.</P>
      <P>I take the point that we do not want a minority making decisions over the majority. That is not going to happen. The agency may decide to set a higher quorum. If anything controversial arose or a decision in which most of the directors wanted to be involved they would make sure they were involved. This is simply setting a minimum so that they can without restriction conduct their everyday business of issuing licences and do the various chores they will have to do in the name of the agency. If we raise it to three we might be making it somewhat unrestrictive for the ordinary everyday decisions.</P>
      <P>What Senators would be concerned about is that with a controversial decision where there might be a difference of opinion within the board of the agency, a majority would have to form a quorum to make a decision. I accept that and the agency itself will so regulate its affairs. I do not think any two are going to act in a way that will be at variance with the remaining three who for the time being are absent for whatever reason, even at the beginning of a meeting. The quorum is what begins the meeting and does not normally apply thereafter. I presume Senator Hederman's request for four was put in when it was intended to increase the number to six or seven. Four out of five would be excessive and would place a huge burden on the agency and be very restrictive.</P>

      <P>Senator Naughten said that if they are interested they will turn up. It is not a question of turning up for a meeting. These people will be full-time officials of this agency and their work will involve more than being sent to head office where they will need to make decisions from time to time. Much of their work may necessitate going outside the agency to meet various people and so on. To increase the quorum to three for <Col N="1350" /> ordinary cases might be desirable in some circumstances but might be too restrictive. The provisions in section 25 (5), which allow the agency the maximum flexibility in arranging its own affairs, is a happy compromise in the circumstances. I ask the Senators to accept that.</P>

      <P>I have listened to what has been said and while I appreciate that we would all hope that the two members forming the quorum would do the job in a businesslike fashion and work in the spirit of the Bill, nevertheless what we are asking is that three of the five directors &mdash; the director general and other directors &mdash; be there for important decisions which will affect a large percentage of the population.</P>
      <P>It is not good enough that two people should be in a position to take those decisions. If we have five directors at least three should be there when important decisions are taken. I take the Minister's point that they will have to go out and examine different projects. Surely it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that they arrange a time each week to sit down and take important decisions whether it is on a Monday morning or a Friday afternoon, always allowing that those officials will be entitled to holidays. Four would be stretching it but there is not unreasonable. I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. It is in the best interest of the agency to have a minimum of three for a quorum.</P>

      <P>I was happy that the quorum would be two because as the board is so small it would put extreme pressure on individuals if all had to turn up for meetings, but then I read in the previous section that the chairman would have a casting vote. If there was not a casting vote the two people would have to agree and that in itself would be a safety mechanism. The casting vote of the chairperson means that one person can decide in the event of a vote. I imagine that in practice that would be quite unlikely. There could be some important issue where the chairperson <Col N="1351" /> would be the person to decide in the event of two people being the quorum. I have some reservations about two in that context.</P>

      <P>Senator Dardis makes a very valid point. Two people at a meeting, when one has a casting vote, effectively means one person at a meeting. I am concerned that the agency could effectively be run by one person; the other person would be wasting his or her time. We hope that will not be so. During my period on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Building Land, if anyone remembers that famous committee of many years ago which laboured for long hours to produce a report that nobody has noticed ever since, we had long discussions with An Bord Pleanála as it was then constituted. The committee were not overly impressed with the burden of work being undertaken by each member of An Bord Pleanála. This was a previous board, a good number of years ago. We did not have the impression that this was the most &mdash; in terms of the hours put in by each member &mdash; demanding job in the world. Some of the information supplied to us suggested that. I know it is the Minister's intention that the Environmental Protection Agency will be different. We would want to be very careful about giving a casting vote to the chairperson at a two person meeting.</P>

What is to prevent the chairperson in the month of August, when a dodgy decision is to be put through from arranging a meeting when he or she knows that the other directors will be out of the country? It will be a dictatorship of the chairperson in those circumstances. It is highly dangerous and I would be very concerned about the present proposals.</P>

The important issue is public credibility in relation to the agency and the assumption and absolute belief of the public that the agency is independent, that its integrity is beyond question and that there is absolute faith in the decision making process. By allowing part of that process to be a decision between two people, one of whom could have the casting vote, effectively giving one person the decision on what could be a vital issue in terms of the agency or an industry, takes away totally from the integrity of the decision making process, from public credibility and from the independence of this agency.</P>

If we have a two person meeting of this agency without a <Col N="1353" /> casting vote I am happy to accept two people because a stalemate would have to be resolved by a full meeting of the agency. At a two person meeting, when one person has a casting vote the person in the chair knows that he or she can decide everything that day. They can go through all the rituals of discussion but everything will be decided by one. If the Minister is saying that she is going to make sure that that would not be the case, then I am happy to withdraw the proposal to have a quorum of three, with the possibility of reintroducing the amendment when we see what the Minister comes up with on Report Stage.</P>

It is otherwise a question of amending section 25 (4) where it says, &ldquo;every question at a meeting of the agency shall be determined by a majority of votes of the directors present and in the event that the voting is equally divided, the person who is chairman of the meeting shall have a casting vote&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not think, with the best will in the world &mdash; I accept what the Minister says about looking at it &mdash; that the casting vote can be removed from the chair; it is a well tried and practised democratic procedure. In this instance, however, when you could conceivably have two, one being the chairman, there could be an abuse of the system in terms of fairness of votes because the casting vote would give the effect of one person dictating. If we do not remove the casting vote from the chairman under section 25, the only way of avoiding this situation is to move from two to three. That is the simplest way, otherwise you are interfering with the procedure of the chair of any meeting having a casting vote, which <Col N="1354" /> has been well tried and tested over the years. I would favour the move to three rather than remove the casting vote from the chair.</P>

It is not my desire or intention that one person would make the decisions and I accept the difficulties with the casting vote. Perhaps after casting vote, we could remove the chairman having a casting vote where there are only two present. I will either do that or make a quorum of three. I know it is the intention of the Senators not to have one person making decisions on everyone's behalf. I will come back on Report Stage on this.</P>

      <P>In page 23, subsection (4) (a), line 12, after &ldquo;General&rdquo; to add &ldquo;for a period not in excess of six months&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not a party colleague of Senator Ross. Senator Hederman asked me to move amendments on her behalf. The intention behind these amendments is to avoid a situation where the Minister nominates the director general on a permanent basis. Subsection (4) (a) reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where, owing to the illness of the Director General or of a director, or for any other reason, a sufficient number of directors of the Agency is not available to enable the Agency effectively to perform its functions, the <Col N="1355" /> Minister may, as an interim measure, appoint from among the officers of the Minister who are established civil servants for the purposes of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, one or more persons to be a director and, where necessary, one to be Deputy Director General.</P>
    <P>At that point there is no limitation although one does come in subsection (4) (b), that is 12 months. A 12 month illness is a serious illness and it seems reasonable that power of appointment should be limited to a period not in excess of six months. I will await with interest the Minister's response to this point. These amendments were urged upon many of us by various environmental bodies who sent briefing material around. In fact, I would have added my name but I thought that when one person had got in first it seemed a little silly to put down the same amendment half a dozen times.</P>

      <P>I certainly have great pleasure in supporting the principle behind both of those amendments. I compliment Senator Ross for putting down his amendment because I believe it is very important that we would have a time span, that we would not have a situation where, for example, the Minister could appoint a civil servant and that appointment could run on for two or three years or longer. It is fair and reasonable that amendment No. 86 be adopted by the Minister. That would allow for a time span of six months. I do not think any of us in this House or anyone in the other House either would like to see a situation <Col N="1356" /> where somebody would be appointed and could be there in an acting capacity indefinitely. I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment but I am aware of subsection 4 (b) here which might restrict such an appointment for 12 months if I interpret it correctly. Perhaps we could limit the restriction to six months in subsection (4) (b) rather than subsection (4) (a) if the Minister, sees fit. I fully support the principle enshrined in the amendments.</P>
      <P>I reiterated that above all the Environmental Protection Agency must be seen to be independent. If there is any question &mdash; though this would seem unlikely &mdash; of the Minister having to appoint a director general, a deputy director general or any number of directors, a maximum of six months should be sufficient. A possible reason for the Minister having to take such action would be the illness of the serving personnel but if an illness is such that it necessitates the director general for example, having to be absent for more than six months, the whole question whether he or she was fit to continue in office or even whether there should be a temporary appointment of the deputy director general would have to be examined. In such circumstances the deputy director general should be able to take over rather than have a ministerial appointee run the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not forget that the matter of the independence of this agency, operating at arms length from Government, particularly from the Department of the Environment, is of fundamental importance for other public credibility of the agency. We must not do anything that detracts from that in any way. Six months should be a sufficient length of time to take care of any contingency that might arise. This is all highly improbable but I suppose it could happen if both the director general and his deputy were to be ill at the same time. I cannot think of any other circumstances in which the need for a Ministerial appointment would arise. In any event I would not like to see a civil servant or other public servant or <Col N="1357" /> Government appointee run the agency for longer than six months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, can I make it clear that there is a restriction in subsection (4) (b); Senator Naughten seemed to think that was not the case. The restriction is 12 months. I know it is desirable that a temporary director would only be appointed for a fixed period and the shorter the better. There are circumstances in which people can be very very ill. It might be six months before it is decided whether a director would ever be able to return to work. Then one <Col N="1358" /> would have to go through the procedure of selecting a replacement and that could take up to 12 months.</P>
      <P>The Minister would only use this power if the agency, for example, could not carry out their functions as a result of a director, who had a particular expertise, not being available as a result of illness. Then the Minister might seek to appoint somebody who has a similar expertise so that the agency could continue to function. I would be prepared to opt for the six-month period or perhaps a nine-month limit. However, six months might be too restrictive and it might be unfair to a director who was seriously ill to impose that limit. Effectively it would mean that he or she would have to make up their minds very fast and might put pressure on somebody who, perhaps had had open heart surgery, cancer or whatever. That would be enough to cope with without being faced also with the loss of their career. We all know of people who have been very ill for up to a year but who then recover and return to normal duties. I do not want to be unfair to anyone. That is why I suggest a 12 month limit. Equally I do not want to be unfair to the extent of having a temporary director appointed <i>as infinitum.</i> Similar provisions exists in Bord Pleanála legislation and, thankfully, it has never had to be used. If Senators persist, perhaps on Report Stage we could consider a nine month limit as a happy medium between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will comprise four directors and a director general. In the normal way in the event of the absence of the director general for reasons of illness or whatever, another appointment would not be made. However, if the person who was absent has an expertise without which the board could not function, the Minister could then appoint another person. I note Senator Conroy's intervention in particular because he is a medical person. People can, as we know, be very ill, but make a full recovery, return to work and do an excellent job. One would not like to think that we would put the extra pressure on that person of having to make up his mind within a period of six months. I can talk to the Senators again in relation to this matter. All of the Senators are reasonable about it in this regard. There is a slight misunderstanding about the way the provision is worded but, subject to me having a look at it again, I may or may not come back on it at Report Stage.

      <P>I have no difficulty in appreciating the Minister's point that if somebody with a particular expertise was <Col N="1360" /> sick or absent for a long time he or she would need to be replaced. My concerns relate more to the Government or the Minister appointing a director general for any length of time. The head of the agency is the sort of public face that the agency will be given and the independence of the agency will depend to a large extent on the role played by the director general and the perceived role, integrity, experience and knowledge of that person when in office. An I right in assuming that the deputy director general can act as director general if the director general is ill for any length of time? If a person with a particular experience is necessary then I expect it is the experience that will be replaced. I am just nervous about the perception that the Government will jump in the minute the director general is sick and appoint someone to run the agency for a year.</P>

      <P>I will not be pestiferous about this and waste a lot of time. We could be here for six or 12 months with this. There is a little inconsistency in one aspect of what the Minister said. She said there may be circumstances where a very specialised form of expertise is required. In other words, this is virtually a unique qualification that this person possesses in some scientific area. I am delighted that the Minister is so confident in the richness of the Civil Service. That section goes on to say that she can choose from among the range of established civil servants. There is just a little hint of contradiction there. On the one hand, there is this uniquely talented and qualified person and, on the other hand, the Civil Service are bulging with these people from whom a replacement can easily be picked. I will not go on <i>ad nauseam</i> about this.</P>

      <P>This deals with the role of the director general in terms of the advisory committee. The section as it stands reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Director General of the Agency <Col N="1362" /> shall, <i>ex officio</i>, be a member and shall be the Chairman of the Advisory Committee...</P>
    <P>The amendment is intended to remove this automatic role of chairing the advisory committee. This seems to be quite sensible because if one is being advised by somebody one should adopt a listening posture. One should not be conducting the meeting.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that there is a legal point not too far distant from this that a person should not be judge in his own case, that he should not sit and chair a committee which is examining matters relevant directly to his career and so on. The fact that the director general would chair the advisory committee might have an inhibiting impact upon those discussions. For that reason it seems appropriate to remove this automatic role of chairing from the director general but of course, to have the director general, himself or herself, in attendance. He or she must be a member but I do not think it is appropriate that he or she should be the chair of a committee that is advising them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support this amendment. The advisory committee is an excellent structure but is weakened by the fact that the director general will actually be chairing it. That is a mistake. The chairperson of the advisory committee should be elected from among the members of that committee and, if necessary, the director general or the Minister should approve that appointment if the Minister feels that is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I imagine if people have reached the level of being accepted on the advisory committee there should be no difficulty with any person among their number acting as chairperson of the same committee. If there is a difficulty with that they should not be on the advisory committee in the first place. It weakens the whole procedure in having the director general running the advisory committee, chairing all the meetings and listening to the debate as they tease out issues with a <Col N="1363" /> view to subsequently advising the director general and the directors on a particular point.</P>
    <P>I support all Senator Norris has said. I cannot understand the <i>rationale</i> behind this. Being a great supporter of the concept of the advisory committee I do not want to see it weakened. I would like to see the chairperson come from among their own and report back to the director general and the directors.</P>

      <P>I am easy enough whether or not the director general is chairman of the committee. I have no major hang-up about that. If in the absence of the director general, whether through illness or for whatever reason, the post is vacant then the deputy director general should act as chairperson. I have no great hang-up about whether the director general is chairman of the committee. Senator Doyle has argued he should not be. I believe, in the absence of the director general the deputy director general should automatically take over in a situation like that. I tabled amendment No. 92 because I believe, for the smooth running the agency, it is important that the deputy director general would be able to take over and run it in the event of the director general being sick and carry out the functions of the director general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the amendment proposed by Senator Hederman. I am happy to take Senator Naugten's amendment on board. Traditionally we often appoint advisory committees and they are token committees. They are there to fulfil either political or certain interests for the time being and thereafter are totally ignored. Whilst they might <Col N="1364" /> produce very fine reports nobody heeds them. I was keen that would not happen in relation to this committee that it would be fully integrated into the running of the agency. I felt that by making the director general the chairman of the advisory committee one was making it a much more powerful committee, giving it greater status, and making sure the Director General had to abide by the advisory committee. If he or she is the chairperson of it, it is most unlikely that that person will be able to ignore the advice of the advisory committee.</P>
      <P>The second reason was that when the setting up of the agency was mooted and discussed openly among a number of organisations some people suggested to me that farmers should be on the board of the agency. It was suggested to me that An Taisce, Earthwatch, the Confederation of Irish Industry and a host of organisations wanted their person as a director. That was not what the agency was about. The directors are to be professionals, mainly scientists, with expertise and it was not appropriate to have a board of directors made up of a host of vested interests. I was equally concerned that those vested interests would be very much involved in the agency. It would be good for them, it would be good for the agency and it would be good for the environment because they would be working in tandem.</P>
      <P>It was to give groups like industrial groups, local authority representatives and environmental interests a real and meaningful role in the operation of the agency that I decided to construct the advisory committee in this way. I did that very deliberately. People outside this House feel that it is in some way wrong to have the director general as chairperson. I do not accept that. If the director general is not chairperson much of the advisory committee's work might fall on deaf ears. I do not think it would have the same kind of status and importance and I do not think it would be fully integrated into the operation of the agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not agree with Senator Doyle's suggestion that the Minister should approve the chairperson. That is fraught <Col N="1365" /> with many dangers. Senator Naughten suggested that where the director general is not available to chair the committee that the deputy director general would so do and I would be happy to bring in an amendment along those lines on Report Stage. I would agree with that.</P>
    <P>I strongly urge Senators not to have an independent chairperson from the people who will be appointed. If that occurs that committee will not be taken seriously, its work will fall on deaf ears and it will not be incorporated fully into the running of the agency. I do not think it will have the status, the clout and everything it needs and deserves. The agency will be the worse for that. I strongly believe that having the director general in is incorporating that committee fully into the operation and structure of the Environmental Protection Agency and making it part of the agency rather than separate from it which is extremely important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In moving amendment No. 89 I should have asked that amendments Nos. 94 and 97 be taken with it. That is an important consideration. They all flow from each other; there is a logical sequence there. I listened to what the Minister said and I was not fully persuaded. The situation she envisaged is possible in any case if the three amendments are taken together. One says that the director general shall attend as a member. It does not automatically make him or her chairperson but they could be elected. They have a possibility of being elected, I imagine that if the arguments the Minister presents are as strong as she feels he or she would be elected chairperson. The amendment seeks to remove the automatic status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 97 states that the advisory committee shall, at its first meeting, elect a chairman from among its members; the chairman may hold office for no longer than three years but shall be eligible for re-election if reappointed for a second term as a member. It will strengthen the committee if the committee elects its own chairperson. If, as is quite likely, that chairperson were also director general then that would be a <Col N="1366" /> considerable strengthening. It also leaves open the possibility that the director general might not be regarded as always inevitably appropriate.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Naughten's amendment and, in some ways, I have great sympathy with what Senator Doyle and Senator Norris are saying. At the same time, the purpose, the functioning and effectiveness of this advisory committee are a key part of the effectiveness of the agency. It is important that the director general of the agency be very deeply involved with in direct responsibility in relation to the advisory committee. There is no more effective way of getting somebody directly involved and taking responsibility than having that individual made chairman of the committee rather than being a member who may attend or almost, by implication may not attend or may not take notice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement by the Minister that she will consider for Report Stage my amendments Nos. 92 and 98. The reason I tabled those amendments was for the same reason the Minister gave, to have the director general chairman of the committee. I have been 17 years in public life and I have been on a number of different committees. It is very simple to set up a committee for it to issue a report and so on but if the director general is not chairman of that committee chances are he will not attend those meetings. I have seen it happen at health board level, at county council level and at Oireachtas level that somebody else is asked to take responsibility or deputise. If the director general has to attend those meetings the chances are that he will have more interest in the advisory committee. It is more likely he will take on board their suggestions or will steer them in a certain direction. I tabled those two amendments so that in the absence of the director general the deputy director general would automatically take over as chairman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by Senator <Col N="1367" /> Doyle but there is a danger that if on an advisory committee there is not a direct input by the directors and the director general, it will not function properly. The best way is by having the director general as chairman. Very often that committee can issue lovely glossy reports at great cost to the taxpayer but nobody pays any heed to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Naughten has said because my experience is that where one is serving on advisory bodies they are much stronger, are listened to much more when the executives of the organisation must attend. Where an executive chairs it he or she is much more likely to attend, contribute and are much more likely to listen.</P>
      <P>We have spent much time discussing the procedures by which the director general should be appointed, the nature of that job and how to strengthen that position. If we get the person which it is the intention of the legislation, that person should be involved at every level in the organisation. If we are to have continuity within the organisation and if the advisory committee are to function properly, it is essential that the director general be involved, that the director general be the chairman of that committee, and that in his absence the deputy director general chair the committee. I would go along with having continuity right through the organisation and having the advisory committee not just meeting in isolation and sending recommendations and views to a higher authority, which they will read at their leisure. It is much more important that they be present at and have a direct input into the meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We were discussing five or six amendments together, all relating to the same point on section 27. They referred mainly the chairing or the chairmanship of the advisory committee. I listened with interest to the Minister's <Col N="1368" /> defence of the procedure outlined in the Bill. Her point that to ensure that the recommendations and advice of the advisory committee are acted on it would be necessary to have the deputy director general chairing the meetings, did ring true with me. I fully support her reasoning. Like her, I have seen too many reports from sub-committees of one kind or another gather dust and not be taken seriously, but apart from that rather good line of defence which she has, I am not satisfied.</P>
      <P>When one considers that this advisory committee shall consist of not more than 12 members, that means that it could, in effect, consist of only two members. We do not know how many will be on it. Unfortunately, amendment No. 88 was ruled out of order as constituting a charge on the Exchequer, but the whole point behind amendment No. 88 was to try to define the minimum number of members that would be on the advisory committee. We would like the Minister's view on that.</P>
      <P>The chairpersonship of such a committee is relevant in the context of the total membership of the committee and the numbers on it. If it is a committee of two, the director general may go ahead because if you have a chairperson plus one, we are back to the argument we used previously about the casting vote and effectively the chairperson deciding what happens in relation to the advisory committee. How do we know what sort of quorum these advisory committee meetings will have if we do not know how many members will be on them? The quorum could be two if there are only four or five members on that committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The composition in terms of the numbers on the advisory committee are still very vague as we did not have the opportunity to debate amendment No. 88 and the imposition of the director general as chairman of the committee is a further reason for concern. I want a strong advisory committee. I fully support the concept of it. It is an excellent concept, but I am a bit nervous as we are not sure what the composition of the advisory <Col N="1369" /> committee will be. I would like to tie the director general to the advisory committee. I accept the Minister's point there, but whether that means the director general must be chairperson or not I am not so sure. I am not sure it has to go that far, because in the absence of knowing the structure of the advisory committee, the numbers on it, what a quorum will be and who will have the casting vote, we were back to the debate we had on the last amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make two points. One of the reservations expressed by Senator Dardis at least is countered in the series of amendments, because it reads quite clearly that the director general shall attend the meetings. That is prescribed behaviour. That is the statutory part of his or her duty. It is not correct to say that if the director general were not to be made chairperson of the committee he or she would never attend. It is a statutory function to attend. The force of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is quite clear and specific, so that argument goes right out the window.</P>
      <P>My second point is an organisational one. I chair a number of little committees of different kinds myself. I know from my own experience &mdash; and I do not think that it is confined to myself &mdash; that there are occasions when the function of chairing a committee distracts your attention. Because you are managing the business of the committee you are not listening as carefully as you ought to. Your business is to steer the committee through. If it is an advisory committee it would be much better to allow for a situation in which, for example, the director general might not particularly want to be chairperson but might prefer to take the listening role, and listen to the advice that was being given by that committee. If these amendments were accepted the director general would have to attend. There would be no escaping from that. It would be a requirement, and he or she might very well feel that their attendance would be better by not being in the position of chairperson.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>To recap on the reasons for the director general being in the chair, the more I hear the debate the more I am convinced it is the right approach. If a director general was merely compelled to come to the meetings it would be a ritual and the advisory committee would not be seen as an integral part of the agency. The advice would be very unlikely to be acted upon or might not be acted upon. On the other hand, if the director general is in the chairing position there is a huge onus on him or her to ensure that advice is part of what the agency does, and that the advice and the agency are almost synonymous. That is my idea. I do not want the advisory committee to be separate from the agency. I want this advisory committee to be an independent forum within the agency itself, to allow outside bodies to come in, advise and be part of the agency's work. I want the advisory committee to be very much involved in what is not in the day-to-day running in the sense of individual licenses, and so on. That is made clear in the Bill. It should be very much involved in policy orientation, performance and the way the agency executes its functions.</P>
      <P>I believe it would be far more impressive and would give a much higher status to that committee if it were chaired by the director general. It would be very difficult for a director general to ignore the advice of a committee he chairs. It would also be much easier for the committee itself to be kept informed of what the agency is involved in and of its thinking in relation to matters if its chairperson is also the director general of that agency and if it very much incorporates the kind of people I would like to have incorporated into the functioning of the Environmental Protection Agency but who would not be suitable persons to have on the board itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Senator Doyle's query about a minimum number, subsection (6) (a) makes it clear that the Minister has to appoint one from each of the subgroups, that is, a minimum of five, and then may appoint four other persons. I am not averse to putting in an amendment that <Col N="1371" /> would require a minimum number. There is no intention to have a committee of two, three or whatever. Subsection (5) provides that various organisations will be prescribed and will have the power to nominate. One will be selected from each category. That would give us a minimum of five. I am prepared to have an amendment put in on Report Stage that has a minimum number on the advisory committee.</P>
    <P>Many people said the advisory committee should be larger rather than smaller, and the number 15 or 20. Various numbers were suggested to me. My own view is that I like to keep committees as small as possible but equally, I want them large enough to be able to incorporate the kind of interest I would like to have in that committee &mdash; local authority representation, environmental organisations, representatives of industry and so on. The figure 12 was both large enough to allow us to have the maximum number of organisations and interests incorporated in that committee and small enough to allow it to function. Very large committees tend to be very unwieldy and unmanageable; it is very difficult to get quorums, and so on. I am not averse to the points made by Senator Doyle at all. If the Senators so wish I shall come back on Report Stage with the minimum number, if that would be in order.</P>

It is slightly separate from the main thrust of the amendment in relation to the chairpersonship of the advisory committee, but it is related in that we need to have some idea of the numerical composition of the advisory committee we are talking about. Section 27 (6) (a) is unclear and that is just not my opinion: It is the view of many of the environmental organisations as well, not least An Taisce. As worded, you could have from one to seven members, in fact, from the organisations above, because &ldquo;not less than one shall be so appointed from among persons selected by the organisations which for the time being stand prescribed&rdquo;. It is not one from each of the organisations. It could be one from the collective organisations.</P>

      <P>This involves the insertion of a new paragraph, which reads:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall have regard to the organisation specified in section 7 (2) of the 1983 Planning Act when choosing to prescribe organisations for the purpose of subsection (6).</P>
      <P>I do not imagine that the Minister will find anything offensive about this. The intention is, of course, to be helpful and to draw the attention of the Minister, in making the selection, to the analagous provisions in the 1983 Planning Act where organisations are specified. It would appear to be perfectly rational that organisations regarded as appropriate for the purposes of the 1983 Planning Act would be precisely the kind of organisations that would be appropriate to be considered by the Minister in making this selection. It simply says: &ldquo;shall have regard to&rdquo;. There is nothing mandatory about it. She is not directed to include all or any of those organisations. It would be a useful point of reference for her to have regard to the organisations specified in analagous legislation. That is all I want to say on that. Should I say something about some of the other provisions? Senator Brendan Ryan asked me to deal with some of his amendments as well. We will move on to those later.

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for your guidance. Amendment No. 100 reads:</P>
      <P>In page 23, lines 43 to 49, and in page 24, lines 1 to 35, to delete subsections (6) to (10) inclusive and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) (a) The members of the Advisory Committee shall be appointed by the Minister as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) one member chosen by organisations prescribed under subsection 5 (a),</P>
      <P>(ii) one member chosen by organisations prescribed under subsection 5 (b),</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go through all the subsections. The principle is quite clear, however. That is a very democratic one. I would be most interested to hear the Minister's response. In other words, rather than the Minister appointing the person to represent the organisations, the organisations themselves should have the opportunity afforded to them to select their representative. I believe that that would only serve to strengthen that representation. I am not suggesting for a moment that there would be any kind of hostility or difficulty between a Minister and these organisations. I said this to the Israeli Ambassador just the other evening when we were talking about the PLO; I believe the Israelis were trying to dictate who should represent the Palestinian people. It seems quite idiotic to me. You would not allow that in the football match in which everybody took such a consuming, passionate interest <Col N="1376" /> yesterday. You would not allow the Irish manager to select the Polish team. It is always good when the representatives emerge from the organisation and are chosen by that organisation. They then have the strength of that organisation. In principle, it is much better to have the person chosen by the organisation than by the Minister. I imagine that in many instances there would be no difference of agreement. Very likely, both the Minister and the organisation would be thinking along the same lines and would select the same person. As a matter of principle this should be enshrined. I will listen with interest to the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to speak to amendment No. 105 which is being taken with the other amendments. I would ask the Minister to accept this amendment. The amendments proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;nominate one person for appointment by the Minister.&rdquo; I put down this amendment because if those organisations mentioned in subsection (5), are requested to select four members or more &mdash; it says not being less than four &mdash; it means that what you have, effectively, is the Minister making the selection. That is my interpretation of the section. Perhaps the Minister would clarify if that interpretation is correct. If those organisations select a number of people and submit the names to the Minister for appointment, I feel that this is undemocratic in so far as the Minister will receive a list of names and can pick whoever he or she likes from that list. It would be far more democratic if that organisation selected a member for appointment as happends with Bord Báinne and several other boards which have representations from farming organisations. The organisation itself selects its member and the Minister then appoints, whether it is the Wool Council, An Board Bainne or a whole host of bodies who have members from voluntary organisations. I would like to hear the Minister's reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the thrust of these amendments. I hesitate to suggest <Col N="1377" /> which one I feel specifically that the Minister should take on board. There is a message in them, and that is that the drafting is very unclear in this part of the Bill. Specifically section 27 (7) is unclear, and I quote:</P>
      <P>The organisations prescribed under a particular paragraph of subsection (5) shall, whenever so requested by the Minister, select such number (not being less than four) of candidates as the Minister may specify for appointment...</P>
      <P>There is a view that that means that all the organisations collectively shall come up with not more than four names or that each organisation shall submit four names individually. It is really for clarification. If I interpret amendment No. 100 in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan correctly, I think he is trying to clarify that by singling out each organisation and stating specifically that each shall come up with recommendations. Apart from whether each organisation should recommend one member to the Minister to be included or they should recommend a choice of two or three, we need to clarify what the Minister is asking of the organisations because there is a lack of clarity in subsection (7) of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to subsection (5), before we go into specifics, the Minister describes the type of groups she would like to have represented on this advisory committee. Farmers, farming organisations and agribusiness generally are in one sense the conservators of our environment. They are our main environmental protectors because they are in the frontline with the land and the waterways. I know there have been problems. That is well documented. The assistance to help the farmers overcome their problems has been outlined by successive Governments but there are still difficulties there. Whatever one's view of agricultural activities and farmers generally, they are the main conservators of our environment and they are in the frontline. I would like an assurance that, under some of these trade descriptions from (a) to (e), the Minister <Col N="1378" /> envisages farmers/farming organisations being represented.</P>
    <P>I do not want anyone in there whingeing and whining. I want a genuine agriculture input in terms of environmental protection. There is no one as good as a farmer who is environmentally aware to see that a job is properly done. Perhaps more farmers need to be brought on board, but the better farmers today, and the farmers who will be with us in the long term, know that the care of their environment is in their own best interests, apart from the country's best interests. Could the Minister give an assurance under subsection (5) (a) that their occupations relate to environmental protection? Tilling the earth is part of conservation. I would like an assurance from the Minister on that particular point. Also, subsection (7) is unclear in terms of what is being asked. When we know what is being asked then perhaps we can discuss whether it is democratic, as one of my colleagues mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to amendment No. 104. This is an important amendment because it refers to the General Council of County Councils who, I believe, will play an important part in regard to this Bill. I would ask the Minister to consider having two members from that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>All these amendments in one way or another seek to deal with the make up of the advisory committee. I will begin by giving Senator Doyle an assurance that, obviously, it is intended that farming organisations will be represented. They probably will come under a number of different subgroups. Obviously, they will come under subgroup (c) in that they are involved in the promotion of economic and other development and in subgroup (d). In fairness, they will probably come under other categories because of the kind of work they do. I can assure the Senator that it is the intention to prescribe farming organisations and farming interests for the purposes of subsection (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> In relation to Senator Foley's comments on amendment No. 104, I sympathise with the gist of that amendment that it is the intention that local authority representatives would be represented on the advisory committee. I am not in a position to give any specific undertakings in relation to numbers because I think that would be undesirable and I think two out of six would be excessive, as Senator Doyle said. Equally, I am not disposed to naming one group as opposed to some other group. If we start the General Council there are, of course, other bodies that represent local authority members. It would be preferable if we had one body that represented them all but if you start naming interests then you are forced to name everybody; otherwise it would cause much difficulty.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris suggested that the organisation should nominate their own person. I would not be totally against that except to say that there would be a tendency, I think, for the same kind of people to be nominated. Generally in the case of many organisations, even where they come under the different subheads of subsection (5) similar kinds of people may come through &mdash; planners, engineers &mdash; and I certainly do not want an advisory committee that is made up totally of the same kind of people. That is why we wanted some kind of flexibility to be able to pick and choose so that the overall committee was a balanced and unbiased one, and it is for that and for no other motive. That is the reason as well to have a minimum of four, to give that wide choice rather than to restrict it to one. It is a minimum of four. I think Senator Doyle thought it was a maximum of four. It is a minimum of four in section 7.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Four from each subgroup under 5 or four collectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>From each subgroup, they may nominate up to four. If you like we can come back and discuss that if you want me to reconsider it in the light of the comments and suggestions that were made. The important thing is that we <Col N="1380" /> have an advisory committee that is independent, has outside interests, that it is big enough to be representative but small enough to be effective, that it has a balanced number of people on the committee.</P>
      <P>I am not badly disposed towards Senator Ross's amendment that we would have regard to the organisations prescribed in the Planning Acts but, of course, they are only a small part of the organisations interested in the environment. Their main interest tends to be with the built environment and, of course, this agency's work in the main will be in relation to the natural environment. I am not against the gist of what that amendment proposes.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is any difference between us there. Obviously it is the intention to have a balanced committee made up of a number of different interests because that would be very good for the agency, for the outer interests themselves to be that much involved, for the farmers, for industry representatives and very good for environmental organisations. Since this advisory group is also going to advise the Minister, I think it would be good for Government policy-making generally to have an advisory group that is as representative as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the Minister cannot see her way to change the method of nominations. I have listened carefully to what the Minister has said and while I take the point that there is a danger of a certain type of person coming through from those organisations I think it is unlikely that all of those organisations would put through the same type of person. In future years it could be some other Minister who would be presented with a set of names from one of those organisations and maybe there would be political pressure on him in respect of a candidate or candidates selected from one of those groups. That could happen. They could get on, regardless of their qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all practising politicians, we know the realities of life, and this is why <Col N="1381" /> I am suggesting we should ask those organisations to nominate one for appointment to the board, that one name would go forward to the Minister and that he would use his or her statutory function to appoint that person. The principle here is very important because I can see great difficulty years down the road if you have a situation where an organisation can nominate four, five or six people. The names go to the Minister and perhaps the person who was last in gets appointed because he had the greatest influence. I think it is far more democratic if the organisation nominates a person to sit on this board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the points made by Senator Foley in moving Senator Finneran's amendment, I think there is a lot of merit in that amendment. The General Council of County Councils is the one overall body which represents county councils. To nominate two persons from that is a very reasonable request in so far as these are the people who are dealing with planning matters and with sanitary matters who will be discussing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will. My apologies. The members of the General Council of <Col N="1382" /> County Councils all have experience of local government at first hand. They are all people who have served for a number of years on local authorities. They have first-hand experience and I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of taking this amendment on board in so far as I do believe that the representatives of the General Council of County Councils would have an important role to play on this advisory committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would be profitable for me to simply attack county councils and so on but I think it should be kept in perspective. It is very appropriate that there should be a representative but I think two out of the small number that is there would overload it. Their interest should be represented, they play an important role in terms of local government but I maintain my point that they have not always been on the side of the angels and I have not confined my experience of county councils just to the Dublin area. I went down three or four years ago to Ballybunion where they had this annual meeting of the General Council of County Councils and I spoke on section 4 planning permissions and agricultural pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am staying very closely to the question of the suitability of nominees of the General Council of County Councils to be on this body. I think that is relevant. I am talking about the qualifications. I do not think there should be two instead of one because they are not always on the side of the environmental angels. It was said from the other side of the House that they were protectors of the environment and all that kind of stuff and had direct knowledge and this is why they should be included. I should like to say when I raised environmental questions on matters such as slurry pollution it was denied. I do not think it is a good idea to overload this organisation with representatives. I think there should be one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> With regard to amendment No. 100, I would like to press this because I do think there is a very important principle here. It is a democratic principle and I would very much like the Minister to take this on board. I know the present Minister is well disposed towards the agency and the Government have certain environmental concerns and so on but that may not always be the situation and we could have a Minister who might wish to weaken and render inefficient an agency of this kind. What better instrument could be placed in the hands of such a Minister than the opportunity of selecting one from four? I believe that such a Minister would select the weakest. This would create clumsiness. It would be inefficient and undemocratic. I see no real reason for it. It is sloppy. It is idiotic going to organisations and telling them to select four people and then leave it a while before the actual selection is made. This renders the whole process very inefficient. What about the three who are not nominated? There would be a series of selections. The prescribed organisations would select four, and then there is another run off selection. I would like to press this amendment. It is important that the Minister should take it on board.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to section 27, page 23. It is astonishing to see the Minister referred to throughout as &ldquo;his&rdquo; decisions when we have a woman Minister sitting there and consistently in this section Minister Harney has &ldquo;his&rdquo; decision and &ldquo;his&rdquo; choice.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not keen on the amendment which would allow two people from the General Council of County Councils to be nominees. The reason I am not keen is that I belong to an angling association, I am chairman of my local angling club, and my experience as an angler, not just in my own club but in other waters, is that the local authorities have been the biggest offenders in terms of water pollution, even bigger offenders than farming, which is not to be excused. Farming has a role, but certainly it has caused pollution. I said on Second Stage that Lough Ennel was virtually destroyed by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My angling club sued our local county council for pollution of the River Liffey. I do not think the county councils stand excused in relation to the matter of pollution and in relation to the protection of the environment. Having said that, I have no objection in principle to them being part of the advisory committee but I do <Col N="1385" /> not think they should have two places as of right.</P>
    <P>If one were to look at the organisations which may be prescribed by the Minister under section 27 (5), the county councils can be included under one or other of those categories. We could go on all day talking about organisations which might or might not be suitable. From the angling point of view I would have a vested interest in that I would like to see angling represented. As a member of the Royal Dublin Society I would say that the society have a very wide interest in all these matters. Its membership reflects a very wide spectrum of society. It has an environmental sub-committee that is involved in economic development. It would be another organisation that would spring to mind as being suitable. We could go on all day talking about particular organisations and once they are dealt with in general terms the specifics can be entered into when the agency has been put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It never fails to amaze me as a former Junior Minister for the Environment and as a member of a local authority since 1974 and having been involved in various environmental issues over the years, how Oireachtas Members and others can consistently state that local authorities themselves <i>per se</i> are responsible for the pollution that undoubtedly occurs in different areas through lack of proper treatment of sewage and effluent generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to state firmly that the local authorities at any point in time over the years and during successive Governments are only as good as the political will of the day to fund the local authorities to put in the treatment plants, etc. Criticism is warranted but it is warranted against the politicians because there did not appear to be votes in providing the money for primary, secondary and tertiary treatment around our country. The local authorities are not financially autonomous any more. They were never really in a position to raise sufficient capital to carry out the treatments or to put in the plants that were required in this area. <Col N="1386" /> While there have been problems and while there has been pollution, the blame rests squarely on the national politicians over the years for not putting their money where their mouths are because they did not think there were sufficient votes in this type of spending. It is an easy way out always to blame the local authorities. It would suit me to do so as well, but we cannot, we must be honest.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specifics of the amendment, we are asking the Minister to use up two of his or her nominations because the Minister has only got four under this Bill. We are asking the Minister to appoint two of the four nominations he or she will have from the General Council of County Councils. I firmly believe that local government and county councils must be represented. I do not think it is fair, however, to ask the Minister, if he or she has only got four nominations and, if we refer back to subsection (6) (b) only four have been given to the Minister &mdash; unless we extend that and I am not in favour of that &mdash; to give two to the General Council of County Councils. There are excellent councillors on the General Council of County Councils, there is no doubt about that but the appointment to the general council from the different local authorities is purely political and it depends on who has control of the different local authorities in different areas.</P>
    <P>Since 1985 the main Government party have had control on the majority of councils, so the general council is controlled by Fianna Fáil. Times will change and we could have a Fine Gale-led Government and Fine Gael dominated county councils. We are all practising politicians. I do not want to let any Minister of any colour, hue or creed have any control in relation to political appointments. I am nervous in this regard. If I could have assurances that appointments of this kind would be on merit, and strictly on merit, rather than feel that the Minister was going to have a party hack of any colour, be it Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, stuck on a very small advisory committee, perhaps to spy on what is going on and report back to <Col N="1387" /> the Minister, then I would be happier about what is before us.</P>
    <P>Most of us here have had long experience of how local government operates and how people are appointed on the General Council of County Councils and of how ministerial appointments to various bodies over the years have worked. If it is in the interest of the environment and if it is someone with experience who will expand the authority of the advisory committee I would have no difficulty in a nomination by the General Council of County Councils. I am nervous of any Minister, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrat or otherwise &mdash; the Progressive Democrates do not have many councillors at the moment &mdash; having control of two of the four in this way because they would be political appointments. The nature of the General Council of County Councils is that card carrying members are on it. I am a little nervous of that even though we have excellent councillors. I want to see local government firmly represented on this but we need to think long and hard about the best way to do that.</P>

      <P>I want to speak on amendment No. 104 which I tabled following consultations with the General Council of County Councils. I would go back to the time when the Bill was being prepared. One of the first organisations the Minister was good enough to contact was the General Council of County Councils. She attended a full meeting of that body in the offices of Dublin County Council and issues were discussed openly with all political sides. The General Council of County Councils is representative of all parties, even the smaller parties. The Minister felt that they were a group that could and should have an input into her preliminary discussions before the parliamentary draftsman drafted the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The General Council of County Councils are a national body. They represent all county councils and four of the five borough councils. I hope the fifth borough council will at some stage be a <Col N="1388" /> member of that body. They have a direct input into the activities of county councils at a national level. They have a very clear and defined structure, an executive and a brief. There is an input from each local authority as each local authority sends three delegates to that body. The General Council of County Councils are representative of all political parties.</P>
    <P>People who know the system of appointment of committees at local authority level will fully understand that no one party can hold the three positions on the general council when committees are being formed. The General Council of County Councils have a particular role to play as regards the implementation of this legislation because they are the people who are in day to day contact with planning problems and the prevention of pollution, whether it is air pollution or water pollution. The councils have a direct input but it would be physically impossible for the Minister to accommodate 27 county councils and four or five borough councils. For that reason the umbrella body are the group we should look to. The umbrella body in this case are the General Council of County Councils. They have a very positive and constructive role to play on the advisory committee being proposed.</P>
    <P>I submit that two of the nominees should be from the General Council of County Councils. I fail to understand Senator Doyle's thinking on this. She seems to think that there is something bad about a political appointment. Senator Doyle is a political figure and we are all here on a political basis. No member is here because of his or her religion or education; we are here because we are politicians. Politicians elected us except my good friend Senator Norris and his team. The number on his team is dropping now.</P>

      <P>Yes, indeed. This is an ideal opportunity to give a position of prominance to a very responsible, constructive, well organised and efficient organisation as the General Council of County Councils. This is an opportunity for the county councils to see themselves through their national umbrella body, as having a direct input into the Environmental Protection Agency Bill. I await a response from the Minister. I know she holds that body in very high standing. If there is a different nominee after five years so be it. Nobody need think that once appointed one is a member of the agency forever. I would not envisage that and I would not think that that would be the case. When Governments change, and I do not see a change of Government coming for a long time, there would not be anything wrong with the new Government giving advice to that committee. I put it to the Minister that this is a body of importance, the premier body as far as local authorities are concerned. The Minister should consider allocating two positions to that body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelHoward" hpid="Mr. Howard Mr. Howard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howard</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that has become obvious from the debate on this Bill is the willingness of Senators on all sides to advance a personal view. I welcome that, it is a very good and constructive approach. I have sympathy for the suggestion that two nominees from the General Council of County Councils <Col N="1390" /> be part of this advisory body. The General Council of County Councils are the umbrella organisation representing elected councillors and their members &mdash; I have been a member of it in the past &mdash; are people of sound judgment. When the agency is up and running it will become obvious if it is taking a certain direction, or if there is a certain over-riding influence on it. I would welcome the General Council of County Councils having a direct channel of their views through the advisory body.</P>
      <P>I want to pick up on another issue that was referred to. There is a widespread practice by individuals whose support among the electorate would not see them on the smallest urban council or town commissioners to engage in a regular exercise of undermining the standing, sincerity and objectivity of elected local representatives. I often cringe when I find there are people here who are, quite inadvertently, by what they say giving support to that particular lobby.</P>
      <P>I do not want to deal with some of the contributions I have heard since I arrived here, but in relation to the point that the local authorities themselves are among the greatest polluters, that is an unfair accusation to make. It should be obvious to anyone with any understanding of the situation that, if that happens, the reason is a denial by central Government of the financial resources to these local authorities to enable them to put in place the means to prevent that pollution. There is not a local authority in this country that will willingly engage in any activity that causes pollution. There are, in the Minister's Department and before the Government files upon files of applications by local authorities seeking finance to enable them to overcome the danger of pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have the utmost respect for my colleague here in front, but I criticise him for referring to party hacks. I do not care what political side these appointees come from, I would have more confidence in them representing solid, objective views, because they are answerable to the public every five or six years when practically <Col N="1391" /> everybody else on this committee will never be answerable to the public. We should never ignore the importance of that answerability to the public. Members of local authorities throughout the country are in that position, and for that reason I have the utmost sympathy and support for what is intended in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority for 30 years it is my duty to support Senator Finneran and the other speakers who have defended the rights, responsibilities and activities of elected representatives of local authorities down the years. In my years as a local representative I have discovered that if anything goes wrong there is only one person blamed and that is the local representative. If there is pollution of a river or a water supply, it is the local authority who are blamed. My amendments which were disallowed, emphasised that the local authority have a very important role to play, but that role cannot be carried out without the full support of the central authority. Finance is the basis of all our problems; and until such time as the local authority are sufficiently financed, the criticisms at present being levelled against local authorities about pollution are null and void because it is not their responsibility.</P>
      <P>I fully support Senator Finneran. Irrespective of what political party they represent, the General Council of County Councils are a responsible body and I have admired them and appreciated their work over the years. They have always represented our views, irrespective of what party they belong to, and they have a very vital role to play in the fulfilment of the ideas and objectives of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think it would be profitable for me to go on an exercise in bashing county councillors. I know that elected local authority representatives do valuable work and do not receive remuneration for it. I know they are elected and all the rest of it, but I am not sure that this House is completely <Col N="1392" /> unbiased or objective because, after all, most of the people here are county councillors. So they are heaping all this wonderful praise on themselves. I think it is a little immodest for them to tell the Irish people how wonderful they are. Listening to some of the speeches, I thought it was really a pity we bothered having a Government. It really would be much better &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>You never know. I might, that is quite possible. I will consider it. However, I was very interested in what Senator Finneran said. He was disarmingly honest when he said he was all in favour of political appointments and so on. I do not agree with political people being appointed. Perhaps I am misinterpreting what he had in mind, but I think there is a subtle distinction. What I would be concerned about is not the appointment of somebody who may have a political belief &mdash; I hope most people in this country would have a political belief, people should be in a political party if they wish to be and should express themselves politically &mdash; is a TD, a Senator or a councillor, what I object to is the possibility of the politicisation of the process of appointment. That is highly dangerous. That may only very marginally come in here and I do not think there would be much point in raising scaremongering tactics about it. But from a practical point of view, if you go down this road of putting in named specified organisations you will have a queue a mile long. Of course, not all of them will be so effectively represented in Seanad Éireann as the councillors are, but it is a dangerous road to go down. I think that two members out of 12, about 16 per cent, from the councils is far too heavy a loading to put into this committee. Provision exists in the machinery whereby this kind of representation can be considered. Whatever the reasons, councils have been involved in acts which <Col N="1393" /> have been to the detriment of the environment. Pollution is an example I mentioned and Senator Dardis took it up. There are bad, inadequate or downright wrong planning decisions.</P>
      <P>I would like to end by referring back to the other amendment I moved for Senator Ross, amendment No. 99. The Minister did very graciously say that she would bear this principle in mind, but she did not say she would take it on board. She said that the organisations referred to under the 1983 Planning Act were principally dealing with the built environment, and there is certainly an element of truth in that. However, I would have to say that planning decisions very often have a real impact on the environment particularly in terms of the preservation of green space and so on. I could list dozens of instances where planning actually impacts directly on the environment. For that reason it is quite important that we bear in mind the organisations referred to under the 1983 Planning Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>In case I would be misinterpreted in any way &mdash; and I know it would not be a deliberate attempt by Senator Norris &mdash; I have two points to make. Senator Norris said that every other organisation would be looking for nominations as well. Where would you get a similar organisation to the General Council of County Councils which represent possibly 700 elected representatives? There is no other organisation in the country that is directly involved in the planning area. He also makes the point that perhaps somebody would be appointed on a political basis from that organisation. That would not be my intention at all. I would consider one or two office holders, such as the chairman and vice-chairman, from the General Council of County Councils. It would not be my intention that the Minister would pick two people out of that organisation for political purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one thing that happened in the general council down the years it is that there is an appreciation that they are expressing the views of local authorities and not a political view. If you look at <Col N="1394" /> their record you will see that, irrespective of who held power in it, they have always been very responsive to the needs of the councils rather than seeking to back up the Minister. I have been involved in the general council for some time and I was chairman of it in 1983. I can say that there has been no attempt in that organisation to be a back-up or support group for whatever Minister or Government was in power. I would not intend that the Minister should pick two people from the organisation. I would be more interested that it be two office holders, so that when the office holder changed the nominee to the Environmental Protection Agency would change as well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Chathaoirligh. We need to be big enough as politicians to accept that there are people in the country who are outside the political arena but are competent enough to participate in institutions of the State effectively and to contribute to the welfare of the country. However, that is not to take from Senator Finneran's point. As I said earlier, I have no objection in principle to the county councils having possibly one member, but I would not go as far as two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stand over the statement I made that county councils have been serious polluters, irrespective of the reason, whether it be lack of finance or whatever. The fact is that they have polluted and at times it is quite obvious that, not only have they polluted, but that there has been a lack of will to rectify the faults <Col N="1395" /> there. You only have to think of the way landfill dumps are managed. For instance, we had a case in my own constituency &mdash; we can now get back to constituencies &mdash; where the wind blew litter all over the road. What I am saying is that we as politicians have a responsibility to be able to stand back. Yesterday, when we debated section 21 dealing with the appointment of the director general, we had repeated calls to depoliticise the procedure by which the director general was appointed, and now we are saying we should politicise this aspect. Which is it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I had spoken to on amendment No. 104 before Senator Finneran came in supporting the principle of having two nominees from the General Council of County Councils and I do not intend to cover that ground again. I must reply to Senator Dardis, who was grossly unfair when he criticised the local authorities and said they were responsible for some of the pollution. County councils have not got the money from central Government to clear up this pollution. Senator Finneran, as a member of Roscommon County Council, knows that a report was brought before us the last day which indicated that the source of the major pollution of two rivers was two sewerage works, because the Department of the Environment had not given Roscommon County Council money to modernise them. I will leave the argument there. To accuse local authority members of being responsible for or being lackadaisical about pollution is unreal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we have a body with members elected from every council in Ireland. They are elected to the council and then elected by that council to the General Council. Some of them are further elected to the executive and we are seeking to have two of them on this advisory committee; you can have them under subsection 6 (b) as Ministerial appointees, or under subsection (5). The suggestion that there will be a queue a mile long is absolutely ridiculous, because there is no body other than the <Col N="1396" /> General Council of County Councils which represent the joint voice of all the elected authorities. No other body can put themselves in that class. It is only fair, right and reasonable that they should have two members on this committee.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 105 because that is the only way members can be democratically elected or appointed on to this agency. Under subsection (7) the prescribed organisations put forward not less than four &mdash; there could be seven or eight &mdash; candidates for appointment by the Minister. What will happen is this. Somebody with a close association with the Minister of the day will be put forward by that body because they will know that that will be the member appointed. While there may be other names put forward, regardless of the expertise of these people the individual with a line to the Minister will get the appointment. That is a fact of political life. It does not matter which Minister is in office, that is going to happen, because that Minister will be under pressure from his organisation to appoint that individual.</P>
    <P>So that the agency can have its independence and retain its self-respect, I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 105. I do not see any conflict between amendment Nos. 104 and 105. Amendment No. 104 is to appoint two members from the General Council of County Councils as a body representing all the local authorities. Amendment No. 105 basically is giving to the organisations mentioned in subsection (5) the authority to elect &mdash; and that is what I am talking about &mdash; onto the agency their member rather than putting forward four or five and the Minister deciding on it.</P>

That is more than <Col N="1397" /> can be said in relation to everyone else who will be on this committee. They will be nominated. They will not have to go to the bother and the difficulty of being elected.

      <P>When I spoke on this section earlier I said I was sympathetic towards it and that I was inclined to support it. Now I fully support it. That support has been confirmed by the more recent contributions of Senator Norris and Senator Dardis. I would like to respond very briefly. Senator Dardis accused me and others of defending the family. Yes, I am defending something, something far more essential than the family. I am defending basic democracy here. It is quite unreasonable of Senator Dardis to continue along these lines even though it was clearly explained to him that the problem of local authorities in relation to pollution is the absence of adequate finance. Still he persisted in undermining the standing of the members of local authorities. I wish him well in the local elections in Kildare and I will be interested in seeing how effectively he brings a prosecution for pollution against <Col N="1398" /> himself when he is a member of that body.</P>
      <P>The other comment I wish to make relates to Senator Norris's reference to &mdash; a repeat of what has often been said before &mdash;&ldquo;appalling planning decisions.&rdquo; It is probably &ldquo;appalling&rdquo; because it is in conflict with Senator Norris's view. Are we to take it that in relation to every situation in which Senator Norris holds an opinion, everybody else who disagrees with him is wrong? What I am defending here &mdash; and I am supporting this &mdash; is democracy, the local electorate, the people who elect the politicians.</P>

If Senator Finneran really feels that we could have a county councillor appointed to the advisory committee, not on the basis of his political persuasion but purely because of the environmental experience and the contribution he will bring to the advisory committee, I will accept his word. He is a practising politician, and so am I, but you can understand my reservations looking back over the years as to how these ministerial appointments have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Into the family. I am glad you recognise it at last. Most women have recognised that factor for decades never mind generations. Perhaps we could ask Senator Finneran to be a little bit more explicit on how he feels those two would be selected from the general body of the General Council of County Councils; it is two out of four. I am a little worried about weighting the Minister's maximum four nominations in terms of declaring now that two must be from the General Council of County Councils. He could in fact pick three if the correct persons were there and if they were the people the advisory committee needed. I am not so sure we should be specific in terms of the quantity he must pick when he is allowed to have only four under the section.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to subsection (6) (b) of section 24. Subsection (6) (b), if I am correct, restricts the Minister appointing not more than four members; it is not just two out of 12. It is restricting the Minister appointing two out of the maximum of four. Whether that is wise I am not sure. I have no objections to a county councillor being on the advisory committee provided that county councillor is there purely because of the breadth of experience on environmental matters that he will bring to the county council. We need to clarify that.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Finneran's amendment. If there is any body, organisation or group of organisations which require and deserve to be represented on this advisory body it is the county councils. One of the unusual situations &mdash; perhaps not unsual situation but a true one &mdash; is that the county councils are, as we all know, very closely involved in matters which will be of particular relevance to the environment, and they are involved at a very practical level at the same time. There is also, hopefully, <Col N="1400" /> going to be a good deal of cross reference between this body and the various planning authorities associated with the county councils. To have somewhere in this Bill a specific reference to the nomination of councillors to the advisory body is very appropriate.</P>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this. These are nominees of the General Council of County Councils. They are not necessarily being put forward in any direct political capacity &mdash; although I do not think that is necessarily any harm in itself &mdash; but representing all county councillors and all county councils. It may vary from time to time who the nominees should be. I feel that, even if they were specifically political, of whatever party, that would not necessarily be such a bad thing, because clearly the vast majority of the other appointees are being appointed because of the various other non-political bodies, which are being represented. This couple of councillors are unlikely to be on the General Council of County Councils unless they are very experienced councillors. It could be very beneficial to have on the advisory body a couple of down-to-earth councillors who really know what it is like when you are facing the various planning applications.</P>

That would be my wish too. As I said earlier, I do not think it is desirable to single out particular groups or organisation because that would cause difficulties. There are lots of other groups who asked to be specifically named and I have said the same thing to them all. When I was framing this legislation in all we received 50 submissions from organisations and individuals. I would say from half a dozen to at most ten submissions came from individuals, the remainder came from organisations. You are talking about 40 different organisations all of whom have an interest in this committee, of of whom felt it was important enough to make a submission, and in many cases a very <Col N="1401" /> comprehensive and well thought out submission.</P>
      <P>It is going to be difficult with a small committee of 12 &mdash; 11, effectively, when the Director-General is included &mdash; to try to encompass that wide cross-section of interests on to the advisory committee. It would be undesirable to have more than one from any group, Having said that, I share the sentiments of Senator Finneran. He has spoken with me before on this matter. I know he is very concerned about this. He raised it in his Second Stage speech as well. I accept that it has the support generally of all sides of the House, with the exception of Senator Norris, although I think Senator Norris accepts perhaps that one might be reasonable.</P>
      <P>I will give a commitment that when we are specifying organisations under paragraph (d), local authorities would come under that specification. To include them in the four members the Minister would have to appoint would be making the Minister's nominations extremely restrictive, although they could be included there as well. However, they obviously would be appropriate as an organisation to be prescribed under section 27 (5) (d). I would give that undertaking to the House, if that is an order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to organisations merely nominating one for appointment, that presumes that if an organisation makes one nomination the Minister will nominate that one. As I said, it would be very difficult to narrow down the organisations to the tidy number of seven, which is the maximum which can be appointed under subsection (6) (a) because of the number of people who have an interest in this Bill &mdash; people from the trade union movement, professional organisations like engineers and planners, An Taisce, Earthwatch, Greenpeace, ACRA, community based organisations, the Confederation of Irish Industry, the Federation of Irish Chemical Industries, both the General Council of County Councils and the Local Authorities Members Association &mdash; LAMA &mdash; the municipal authorities representatives. <Col N="1402" /> All these bodies made very good and detailed submission.</P>
    <P>In relation to the local authorities, it would be easier if there was one body and not a number of bodies. This point was made by the expert committee appointed by the Government to look into local government reform. In their report they recommended that it would be preferable if local authorities could have one representative group, not just for this kind of purpose but for a whole host of other reasons. Of course, there are many who would argue that because of the relationship between the agency and the local authorities perhaps the county managers should be represented and so on. Many different interests are going to look for representation here. Certainly, I will give an undertaking that the local authority members will be a group specified under paragraph (d). I hope that will be acceptable. I, too, would be anxious to have people who represent the public, who are elected by the public, and who have a very important role in environmental protection. Even after this Bill is passed and the agency is established, the local authorities will still be in the frontline of environmental legislation. They will be the people in the main operating our environmental laws, enforcing them, and involved in environmental protection. It is extremely important that there is a good relationship between the local authorities and the agency and that there is goodwill among local authority members. When this agency was mooted, many local authority members felt it would mean an erosion of their powers and that is why I went to great lengths to meet the various bodies and their subgroups. There is an acceptance and a consensus among local authority members that this agency is essential and they want to co-operate with its establishment and running in every way possible. In the spirit of co-operation I, too, will ensure that the sentiments if not the substance of Senator Finneran's amendment No. 104, on the idea of representation for local authority representatives will be taken on board.</P>

      <P>The Minister in her reply mentioned local authority members as distinct from members of the General Council of County Councils. I would see a distinct difference there as members of LAMA could be involved. I would not see LAMA as the body representative of county councils. The General Council of County Councils have a certain function and it is that body who are referred to in amendment No. 104 and which we would like to see having membership. We recognise that it would be impossible to have a member from every county council or to try to get nominees from all the regional committees suggested under the new local government reform. The appointment of two members from the General Council of County Councils would meet the wishes of County Councils and indeed, of the Members of this House who have spoken in favour of this amendment.</P>
      <P>Did I hear the Minister say she would have them included under section 27 (5) (d)? Could they become a conglomerate of a number of other organisations under that heading? In fact, they may not get any consideration. I would not be happy with that. The amendment tabled by Senator Finneran clearly specifies that they should be included in subsection (6) (b). I ask the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it was put down.</P>

      <P>I request the Minister to be more specific in what she is suggesting. The amendment proposes two nominees of the General Council of County Councils. Subsection (5) (d) states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1404" /> organisations which in his opinion are concerned with the promotion in relation to the community of social, economic or general interests,</P>
    <P>A variety of organisations come under this. I am sure I would get a reaction from Senator Dardis if I were to say that I object to an organisation of the standing of the General Council of County Councils being brought down to the level of several bodies that could be included there.</P>

      <P>Maybe the Minister will tell us how many organisations she envisages could be included in this pool because that is where the dilution can start? Subsection (6) (a) states that not less than one shall be appointed from this particular group. Therefore, there could be up to a dozen organisations in that pool with only one being appointed from it. That would be defeating the object of the exercise this afternoon. How many organisations are likely to be in this pool? Once we put in the General Council of County Councils in the pool and take them away from what is proposed in the amendment, they may or may not survive in that pool. In fairness to those who have strongly supported this amendment, the Minister should outline the implications of what she is now suggesting.</P>

      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on admitting responsibility and on outlining the activities expected of local authorities to ensure that the Environmental Protection Agency will be a success. She clearly indicated that local authorities have a major role to play and if they have the Minister should accept the amendment rather than go into, as Senator Howard has indicated, a maelstrom of applications. If local authorities are to be seen to represent the people and ensure the objectives of this Bill are carried out the amendment submitted by Senator Finneran should be accepted rather than <Col N="1405" /> asking the General Council of County Councils should get into the swimming pool with perhaps 15 or 16 other associations. The Minister clearly indicated she will be depending on local authorities to ensure that the objectives of this Bill are carried out. For that reason, not to protect the family as some Senators suggested, and to ensure that the objectives of the Bill in its entirety can be fulfilled, the amendment should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I have no objection in principle to the General Council of County Councils being represented but what is undesirable is that they be specifically mentioned in the Bill. It would be better if they were treated as one of the organisations under section 27 (5) (d) and be represented through that vehicle rather than have it statutorily included that they would as of right have representation. Within the public mind, if it was included in the Bill that they should have representation, it would certainly cause some suspicion that this agency were not entirely independent because we had mentioned one body to the exclusion of other bodies who might have some good claims to be represented also and be named in the Bill.</P>
      <P>From section 55 onwards a great deal of the Bill concerns itself with the role of local authorities in the operation of the agency. One could argue on both sides that it may be undesirable for local authorities to be represented because so many parts of the Bill impinge upon what they should do and govern their activities. Senator Doyle asked earlier on what basis people would be nominated to represent the General Council of County Councils. I suppose the Cathaoirleach might suggest that the names be put into a hat and drawn out.</P>

      <P>There is agreement among us but if you push me too far I might go back into my shell. We cannot specify one group as opposed to any other. It would cause too many difficulties because whilst I appreciate and sympathise with the concern of Members here that local authority members are not ignored and should be very involved in this advisory committee equally I have had pressure from other organisations and groups who would like to be given an assurance. I will adopt the same approach to everybody to ensure that there is a balanced and representative group on the advisory committee. I am prepared to ensure that under ministerial appointments or under section 27 (5) (d) there will be a representative of the local authorities and I hope that that will satisfy the Senators. They are going into the pool but local authorities are good swimmers even in a large pool and are able to survive better than most. They may have more influence than other groups within this procedure.</P>
      <P>I think that any Minister or Government of whatever colour appointing the advisory committee would ensure that local authority representatives were incorporated and that an appropriate person to represent local authority interests was on the committee. I give you that assurance here this afternoon and I hope that that will satisfy the Members. Otherwise we will have a whole host of problems because it is going to be difficult to prescribe the organisations and specify who or what organisations are involved here and then to do the picking and choosing. Regardless of who would be deciding the Minister of the day would ensure that the goodwill of the local authority members was with this agency and that they were very much involved in the advisory committee.</P>

      <P>I spoke specifically about the General Council of County Councils. The Minister replied on the basis of local authorities and I can understand that, but on that point she raised I do agree with her that for this agency to work well there must be a tandem approach. The local councils and the county boroughs are the planning authorities which is why they are so different from any other organisation. I respect Senator Dardis; any contribution he makes in this House is excellent but I feel that he is not grasping my point. The General Council of County Councils, representing the 27 local authorities and five county boroughs has a vital role as far as this agency is concerned. If there is any conflict between the two or any sense of oneupmanship, the agency will not work satisfactorily. Representation on the advisory committee from the General Council of County Councils is desirable. When the Minister replied she did not specify the General Council of County Councils as being involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was a representative from a local authority, where would that person take their brief from? They could only take it from the local authority they came from. The brief of a representative of the General Council who had aspired to the position of executive, vice chairman, or Chairman would have to come from 32 different local authorities; they would not <Col N="1408" /> be speaking on their own behalf or with the authority of one county council or one county borough, but on behalf of that organisation which represented 32 local authorities. That is why I am interested that this umbrella organisation for the whole planning process should have an input into the advisory committee. Therefore, I am appealing to the Minister to recognise the General Council of County Councils for what they are. The whole basis and future of planning and development in this country and the co-operation that will I hope ensue between the agency and the local authorities could at any time be enhanced by having somebody there who be able to advise on one side or the other as a representative of both agency and council. It would be a two-way process and I think nothing but good could come from it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to return to what I started on the last day, that is dealing with a specific area of the Bill and amendments which I can assure the Minister will be pressed. There is one in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan and I will be placing one on the Order Paper as well dealing with visits to this country of foreign military aircraft and shipping carrying nuclear weapons. The absence of a provision in this regard is the most glaring omission from the Bill and one that must be rectified if the Bill is not to be a total and absolute nonsense.</P>
      <P>It is worth putting a few definitions on the record of the House. Air space controlled by a State is defined internationally under the Chicago Convention, which was ratified by Ireland in 1946, as that area of the sky over a country which can be attained by the national aircraft of that country. In the case of Ireland that is 60,000 feet. Therefore, that is what we are dealing with in a definition of Irish air space as being controlled by any protocol or legislation we might pass. It is very important that we include an element in this Bill which will protect this country against the danger of nuclear accidents occurring either in our air space or in our territorial waters.</P>
      <P>I would like to anticipate one of the Minister's arguments which I believe he may make with regard to territorial waters because he may produce the notion of the right of innocent passage in international law although, in my opinion, this right could be challenged in international legal fora. However, I do not expect the Minister will bother setting out on that course. In my amendment I have re-defined the area which the Bill ought to regulate as encompassing the harbours, inlets, ports and inland waters of the country. I hope the Minister will not disappoint me by trotting out in response this notion of innocent passage even though, as I maintain, the right of innocent passage could be subject to challenge internationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of over-flights we ought to realise how regular an occurrence these area. There are 20 military over-flights every day, about 7,000 per year. That puts clearly on the record the fact that there is a very considerable persistent entry into Irish air space of aircraft which are clearly military and 70 per cent of these are from the United States of America. Just as with the question of <Col N="1411" /> nuclear submarines and warships carrying either nuclear generators or nuclear warheads, the Irish Government take the guileless view that it is sufficient merely to notify the country of origin of the aircraft of our policy. This policy goes back to the days of Frank Aiken and it is that, without the specific permission in writing of the Government, there should be no entry into Irish air space of aircraft carrying weapons or dangerous materials.</P>
    <P>The Government in recent years and for some considerable time have simply notified and expected as a matter of honour that neither our air space nor our territorial waters are violated by foreign governments. However, the record shows quite clearly that this happens. It happens regularly, persistently and, I am sorry to say, with the connivance of the Government.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sea it is perfectly obvious that this situation is a dangerous one and one which the majority of the Irish people would not welcome. I could read into the record at this stage very considerable massive documentation which demonstrates clearly and incontrovertibly that American warships fully armed with nuclear weapons have visted this country, and that the United States Government acknowledge this fact. I will give an example, not from a technical journal because I will leave that for the time when I will be pressing these amendments. I would like to advise the Minister that I will be putting extensive material from the report by Hans M. Kristinsen into the record in urging the acceptance of my amendment. I would like to read into the record a report from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 28 July, 1988 where the reporter says:</P>
    <P>Since the USS <i>Conyngham</i> is a guided missile destroyer, this correspondent asked the Navy spokesmen whether it was armed with nuclear weapons when in Irish waters. He gave the standard reply &ldquo;We neither confirm nor deny that our ships have nuclear weapons&rdquo;. However, a source close to <Col N="1412" /> the INS said that this matter came up at an INS staff meeting on Tuesday in a report which said that the State Department was keeping the incident under wraps because the destroyer had nuclear capacity, nuclear capability and should not have been in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>Could anything be clearer than that?</P>
    <P>Later on I can, if the Minister so requires, read documented evidence into the record where time after time warships have visited this country fully armed with nuclear weapons. One easy way of verifying this is to look at the fact that when they left their port of origin in the United States they were checked and they were certified as being armed with nuclear weapons. I would like to ask the Minister is he satisfied that this is in the interests of the Irish people. I ask that because of the very large number of incidents there have been of naval accidents involving this kind of shipping. Since 1945 there has been one such incident per week. That is a very considerable number of major accidents involving sinking, fire, grounding, shipwreck or something like that. There is a much more worrying statistic that I would like the Minister to take on board; of these accidents 30 per cent take place in port. It is only a matter of time, maybe a long time, but the statistical evidence would indicate that there is a real possibility of a nuclear accident taking place in Irish waters.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister, as a resident of the inner city of Dublin, precisely what plans has he got or what role does he envizage the Raidiological Protection Institute playing in the event of a nuclear accident in Dublin bay? I would point out that warships penetrate right into the heartland of the city. If something occurred in one of these ships right in the centre of our largest city, with a population of over a million people, what role does the Minister see the Radiological Institute playing? Will it have anything to do with it at all or will it just stand idly by while the city is affected? I do not suggest that I think there will be a meltdown or that there <Col N="1413" /> will be a massive nuclear explosion. I would certainly hope there would not be &mdash; but there could quite easily be a fire in a generator, which would involve the release of a cloud of radioactive dust. I do not believe for one second that we have the capacity to deal with any such incident and it is grossly irresponsible for us to pass up this opportunity to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>May I say that the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Harney, who has just left the Chamber, when she was steering the Environmental Protection Agency Bill through the House, drew our attention very firmly to her support for what was called the precautionary principle. If we are going to take precautions about pig slurry, effluent and sewage, why should we not take precautionary measures against a most dangerous and insidious form of pollution from nuclear radiation? Surely we have the example of Chernobyl? Surely we will take a lesson from that?</P>
    <P>One of the worst aspects of this kind of accident is that its impact is not immediately visible. The source of the problem can be quite locally contained, there may be no visible explosion, and yet, insidiously, the surrounding area can be contaminated to a very considerable extent by radiation. I do not have to tell the Minister that radioactivity of this kind has a very, very long half-life. I want to put it on the record that it is not satisfactory for us to remain in a situation where we merely notify foreign Governments of our policy and innocently expect them to accede to it, whereas their response is the equally sinister response that they will neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons on board. What kind of fools are we?</P>
    <P>New Zealand has declared itself a nuclear free zone and there has been no substantial impact on their relations with the United States. I know that we in this country tend to lick-spittle to the Americans and to feel that we cannot really push an independent line even in terms of the welfare and health of our own citizens. Let us look to the example of New Zealand. Relations were broken <Col N="1414" /> off but they are now warmer than they ever were and their trade has actually increased. Let us not be put off by this mercenary attitude of thinking we are pushing our own economic self interest.</P>
    <P>Let us take a leaf out of the book of Sweden, for example. The Social Democratic Party in Sweden have agreed that they will get rid of this, neither confirm nor deny response. They will not allow it, they will not regard it as acceptable by 1992 at the latest. In the event that foreign Governments do not accede to this, they will require certification. I believe we can expect no less of our Government. May I point out that I mentioned the Greenpeace report the last day. A similar report was done in Sweden. Of the 71 warships, which were covered in that report, 31 were carrying nuclear weapons. Even with the existence of this &ldquo;neither confirm nor deny&rdquo; policy, they confirmed that 31 out of the 71 vessels were carrying nuclear weapons in defiance of the domestic policy of the state of Sweden. That ought to cause us to worry. Let me say, this was not just worked out by implication, by looking at the manuals in the United States of America under the Freedom of Information Act. It was also confirmed by an on-the-spot check of the deck logs of those ships. We must bear in mind that this is the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to draw the Minister's fangs a bit, to anticipate a possible argument that could be made &mdash; I know this because it was made in the other House &mdash; that Greenpeace reports are not 100 per cent accurate. There was a report concerning the US battleship called the <i>Ticonderoga.</i> It was alleged that it was carrying a nuclear arsenal and this was wrong. It was wrong because the nuclear arsenal was removed the month previous to its arrival in Dublin. However, Greenpeace itself drew the attention of the public to this fact. I would like to ask the Minister, since I gather he quoted this in the Dáil, why does he believe Greenpeace when they admit one mistake? Why does he not believe them when they continually tell the truth? They have always told the truth and when one error <Col N="1415" /> was unearthed, they unearthed it themselves and publicly acknowledged it because they have a specific investment in veracity, in their reputation for telling the truth and for being accurate in all their pronouncements.</P>
    <P>I am also very worried by the attitude of the United States Department of Defense because it does not gladden my heart to read what their position is with regard to the possibility which they acknowledge, even if we will not, of a nuclear accident of some kind taking place in the waters or the air space of a friendly country. This is a statement from them in 1981:</P>
    <P>In the event of an accident involving nuclear weapons their presence may or may not be divulged at the time depending on the possibility of public hazard or alarm. Furthermore, due to diplomatic considerations, it is not possible to specify the location of the accidents that occurred overseas.</P>
    <P>That ought to make us worry a bit. Even when an accident does occur in our air space or in our waters the U.S. Defense Department will make the decision as to whether they inform us subsequently of the location, the site of this accident.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tell me if he is happy with that or whether he thinks this is a matter that should be covered by the Radiological Protection Bill. Precisely what the Minister is proposing to protect this country against is radon gas. I a not sure of the figure but up to 60 or 70 people each year are affected seriously by this gas. That is very important but it is nothing when compared with the scale of damage that would be caused by a nuclear accident. That is why it is essential that this is taken on board.</P>
    <P>I could give a list to the Minister of incidents that have taken place already in Irish air space. Mercifully there was not any nuclear discharge. There was a very clear case of a near miss when a bomber almost brought down a Laker Airways passenger aircraft. There were several incidents when planes developed <Col N="1416" /> engine trouble or leaks and had to jettison fuel. We all know what has happened in the seas on numerous occasions. When pressing the amendment I may be tempted to read all this directly into the record of the House but I do not want to be tedious at this point. Neither it would be appropriate to go into the very specific elements at this stage in the progress of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We can all recall incidents in which trawlers, for example, fishing peacefully in the Irish Sea suddenly found themselves being pulled backwards at up to 70 miles per hour. People were killed in some of these incidents which were caused by nuclear submarines going through our waters. If there can be such accidents with trawlers is there not a danger to other vessels, too? The Minister knows that there are seven nuclear submarines on the bottom of the ocean bed. What are they doing there? What will happen when the metal corrodes and the nuclear core is exposed?</P>
    <P>There is a very serious case to be answered here. The Minister owes it to the House to let us know whether he intends to do anything about it and I will not accept being fobbed off with a reply that the matter is not his responsibility. If it is not his responsibility I want to know whose responsibility it is. I do not believe that it can be shifted to the shoulders of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In section 31 of the Bill, for example, the Minister goes into the areas of a number of Ministers, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the Minister for the Marine, the Minister for Finance etc. There is a whole long list of them. Why can he not take on this responsibility, acknowledging a primary role in determining general foreign policy for the Minister for Foreign Affairs but in this instance taking Irish waters into the protection of this legislation?</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the case with sufficient strength. I look forward with great interest to what the Minister says. I hope he will accede to my request in view of the very clear and incontrovertible case I have mounted to demonstrate that our policy is not adequate &mdash; that while we <Col N="1417" /> state we do not permit nuclear weapons to be brought into this country, many of the ships that visit here carry them. We would want to be pretty guillible not to realise that but in any event it can be independently confirmed by way of the many accidents that do occur &mdash; one a week &mdash; that 30 per cent of these occur in port, that these ships visit right into the heart of our capital city and that there is a statistical possibility of a major nuclear accident in our waters. I will be utterly bemused if the Minister feels that a Radiological Protection Bill which is supposed to reassure the public that we are adequately coping with the dangers of nuclear radiation omits this most important aspect.</P>
    <P>That is all I wish to say today but I would like to signal, if I have not signalled it already with sufficient clarity, that there is already one amendment in the name of Senator Brendan Ryan, that I have a further one and that these amendments will most definitely be pressed in the event that the Minister shows himself to be unwilling to do what I would regard as his national duty. May I say that that be nothing but a return to what one might refer to as the pre-split days, when everything was happiness and sunlight and all the people on the other side of the House were contentedly browsing in the pastures of Fianna Fáil, when Frank Aiken instituted a number of the protocols on which we ought to depend but on which we are not depending. In my opinion we are betraying Mr. Aiken's fine reputation. There is nothing new in what I am suggesting. We would be simply implementing what 25 or 30 years ago was stated Fianna Fáil Government policy. In addition, this might perhaps appeal to our vanity as politicians &mdash; we would acquire a distinct position of moral leadership and authority in the world if we took on board this kind of amendment and forbade the introduction of this kind of weapon of mass destruction into our country. We know it is happening. We know that it is dangerous. We know, obviously from the example of other countries that by accepting the amendments I suggest we will not be damaging <Col N="1418" /> our political or economic interests in the long term, rather the reverse. We would actually be acquiring the kind of moral status that we had at the time of the Ministry of Mr. Aiken.</P>

      <P>The whole question of radiation is very important. It is a subject which raises fears in the minds of many people. In the good old days everything was divided into two parts. You had <i>res mensa</i> and <i>res extensa:</i>  you had matter and mind and it was nice and simple to deal with. The whole question of radiation widens the scope of human experience. The fact that radiation can travel through space, that it does not need a medium to travel, has obvious advantages; otherwise we would not have sunlight but there is also the whole factor that in many cases it is unseen.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us seems to concentrate to a larger or lesser extent on ionising radiation. It would appear that in the public consciousness to date, although things are changing, that ionising radiation would seem to be radiation that would need monitoring and that would cause potential hazards to people. If one looks at the historic perspective, it is curious that Madame Curie died from the effects of the experiments she was carrying out and through continued exposure to X-rays. For a long time people have been aware of the danger of ionising radiation and, particularly, of gamma rays. However, it is worthy of note that even experts have changed their attitude dramatically towards radiation over the past 20 years. All of us have been familiar with the situation where the regulation, use and procedures followed, for example, in the use of such everyday things as X-rays have changed dramatically over the years. Therefore, we must look beyond the scientific expertise at any time. We must broaden our horizons. We must always keep in mind the potential hazards from any substance that is used by mankind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> The hazards, as I pointed, from ionising radiation are well documented. There is now a great public awareness of the need to be wary of this type of radiation. Radiation is a good thing. It exists all round us. That is a fact. Radiation has been bombarding this earth, gamma radiation included, from the beginning of time. That it does very little harm to humans is also something I admit. Therefore, one of the problems we face when we talk about radiation is that it is not simply a black and white matter of what is safe and not safe. In simple terms, all radiation is potentially safe, and all radiation is potentially dangerous. In latter times, we have become aware of the potential dangers of non-ionising radiation, depending on the dosage. For example, it is now well recognised that sunlight itself, in overdoses, can cause problems and skin cancer. Sunlight or visible radiation, ultra-violet and infrared radiation are somewhere in the middle of the electro-magnetic spectrum.</P>
    <P>We have to accept here that the potential danger from radiation basically depends on four factors. They are the intensity of the emitting signal, the distance the person receiving from it is &mdash; and that works to the cube of the distance &mdash; the frequency of the signal itself, and the period and the continuity of the exposure itself. One of the problems is that people, by playing down any potential hazard from non-ionising radiation rather than playing down people's fears, increase the fears in the mind of the public. People who deny any potential danger for non-ionising radiation increase their fears. We have around us, in all aspects of everyday life, plenty of examples of non-ionising radiation bombarding us from all sides, some natural as I have pointed out, and some manmade. Most of these provide very good benefits to mankind. Most, I would accept, are in a situation where the benefits far outweight any disadvantages. We have, for example, the use of radar, the use of microwaves, the use of television waves and radio waves. Radiation is emitted from such things as computer VDU <Col N="1420" /> screens and televisions. Yet, nobody in their sane senses is proposing that any of these things be done without. What I think some people are looking for, with justification, is that there would be continued monitoring of the levels of exposure to all types of radiation that exist, that that would be done in an open fashion, that information in simple and understandable form be made available to the public, that that information would show the risk terms in terms of people per million per year as best as this can be done and that every type of major radiation source be analysed and monitored on an ongoing basis. When you are talking about public utilities &mdash; and we all known about the controversy surrounding the microwave links of the MMDS television service &mdash; it is very important that the population would feel there is independent monitoring of it and that this would give a true and accurate figure of the risk involved in any radiation exposure.</P>
    <P>It concerns me somewhat that in the definition in the Bill that non-ionising radiation has not received the prominence it should. I accept it is covered under the general provisions of the Bill and is specifically mentioned, but basically the Bill seems to mainly direct its attention towards ionising radiation or activity radiation which is defined as the number of nuclear disintegrations which occur per unit of time in a radioactive substance.</P>
    <P>This Bill should, quite clearly, cover all types of radiation from the lowest frequency radiation to the highest frequency radiation. A fact that many lay people would not be aware of is that it is all electro-magnetic radiation and that there is no fundamental difference in speed or anything else between gamma rays and sunlight except the frequency that is involved and therefore, the energy it emits.</P>
    <P>On the question of being independent, we have to genuinely recognise that we have a problem here. Obviously, the people who will be doing the research into these things are, in the main, involved in industry, etc. I must say that <Col N="1421" /> at times I am concerned about the drift in university circles towards sponsorship in various fields. I would have to say that it worries me at times to find university faculties sponsored by people who might have vested interests in developing certain types of equipment. It creates a question. If we do not have research people clearly independently financed it raises the question as to whether there will be public confidence which is essential.</P>
    <P>I am not particularly worried about the levels of radiation around us, but that is not good enough. We are here to serve the people. Telling the people that it is not dangerous, if we do not convince them, is not good enough. It is wrong for us not to do everything in our power to reassure our people that they are not in any danger of exposure from any of the unseen hazards that exist in our world today. Those hazards particularly frighten people, because they were played down so much 20 or 30 years ago. They frighten people because they see radiation as something unseen stealing through their atmosphere, as something that can get them in their homes and in their workplaces and that they would not be conscious of in the normal way. I have time and again said &mdash; and I stick by this &mdash; that in real terms the hazard we face from chemicals is much greater than the hazard we face from any radioactive or non-radioactive radiation in our atmosphere. I accept that. I accept that we tend to treat chemicals on a very casual basis and then you get people totally scared by the word &ldquo;radiation.&rdquo; I accept that people use the word &ldquo;radiation&rdquo; as a scare word and carefully distort the fact that, as I have pointed out, sunlight itself is a form of electromagnetic radiation. However, it is important that this institute, when set up, is seen to monitor on a continuous basis all common sources of radiation in our atmosphere and in our environment, irrespective of from what source it comes. That would include all the public utilities and also common levels of radiation emitted by VDUs, television and all sorts of equipment in factories, and so on. The monitoring role of this Bill &mdash; the role of ensuring that <Col N="1422" /> the public have confidence that they are not being polluted, injured or hurt by a hidden source &mdash; will become more and more important in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill all sources of nuclear radiation in our environment have to be accounted for. Therefore, we will have to be ever vigilant that all nuclear devices brought into our environment will be reported to us. I do not know if this Bill is the way to do that. It seems ridiculous to be for ever and ever harping on at least known sources of possible nuclear contamination and risk, and at the same time to shrug our shoulders at unknown sources of possible nuclear risk. It is something I feel very strongly about. It is a matter that should be addressed in the near future. I do not know whether an institution like this could do so. I do not necessarily feel that this Bill is the way to do so, but if we are serious about possible risk from nuclear radiation that is something that will have to be kept in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill. I welcome the title of the Bill, the Radiological Protection Bill, which replaces the nuclear agency. We have now broadened the remit of this Bill and this agency to cover all types of radiation in the atmosphere. The agency will go a long way, when set up and operational, to ensure that people have more confidence in what is in their environment, and will have some means by which to measure the benefits we all derive from all types of radiation, whether in medicine, pleasure, services, safety, or communications and, on the other hand, the possible dangers that might exist. Also, it will continue in my view the never ending thrust to improve and maintain all the advantages of modern technology, which are tremendous, and at the same time by further technological development ensure that we reach higher and higher standards of safety with new technology. That was not always done in the past. It was something that people were not conscious of always in the past, but something that, for the future, we will have to be very conscious of.</P>
    <Col N="1423" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardHourigan" hpid="Mr. Hourigan Mr. Hourigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hourigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome the Bill. I compliment the Minister for introducing it to the House. It is a very wide-ranging Bill. While I certainly welcome the Bill, I have reservations as to whether it goes far enough and takes care of all the areas that need definite attention.</P>
      <P>The Minister clearly outlined the purpose of the Bill. It is no harm to refresh her mind slightly on that. The purpose of it is to provide a framework for a comprehensive system of radiological protection for the general public. That is, in itself, an extremely desirable objective, one that nobody could quibble with. It is something we must support. The Bill, as indicated, sets out to establish the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. At the same time we will have the dissolution of the Nuclear Energy Board and the transfer of all the assets of the board and their liabilities to the new institute. That is a correct introduction to this important activity which our Minister for Energy has taken on board.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are included in the Bill a wide-ranging set of protection measures which will be and can be adopted by different Ministers from time to time, in normal circumstances and, indeed, in emergencies where there is fear of radiation and radioactive effects. That is very important. It cannot be overstated that radiation in its various forms cannot be quantified. It cannot be measured. For that reason, it has to be frequently monitored and controlled so that the slightest element of risk receives attention and, above all, so that the people are made aware of what is happening and what the various testing agencies have come forward with.</P>
      <P>The enactment of this Bill will enable Ireland to ratify three important international conventions in the nuclear field. Some of its provisions derive from the requirements of these various conventions. These are referred to at length in the Bill and I do not intend to go into them at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are concerned here with international situations. Frankly, we are not free agents when it comes to radiological <Col N="1424" /> protection measures and radiation generally because radiation knows no barriers or bounds and, depending on the direction of the wind and so on, we have little or no control over it. We want, therefore, to make sure we are conscious of the fact that we are dealing with an international position and not one we can lightly tinker around with. We are an island but we are not certainly an island in the context of radiation or radioactive material.</P>
    <P>Of course, many people on the international scene are presenting, as a solution to environmental damage and global warming, radiological protection. I do not entirely agree with this. People make an argument quite effectively on one side favouring nuclear energy in a controlled fashion as against the use of non-nuclear energy materials and the effects on them. As a nation, we, however, are totally opposed to any question of establishing nuclear plant within our shores. Some years ago consideration was given to a plant at Carnsore Point County Wexford. I believe that everybody in this country is fully agreed now that there is no place here for the establishment of any type of nuclear energy plant. Therefore, nuclear energy is not an option for us under any circumstances at this time.</P>
    <P>This view, is of course, shared by many other states. We are not the only State that holds that particular point of view; other states hold it as well, although some states hold an opposite view. Regardless of any difficulties that might arise from oil or other sources, there is no doubt that we must continue to avoid resorting to nuclear energy as an acceptable solution to our energy problems. With nuclear energy there are positive, serious health and environmental risks which are intrinsic to the nuclear energy industry. Safety measures and the risk of serious accidents are at the core of the nuclear question.</P>
    <P>Reference was made earlier to the risk of accidents. Frankly, the risk of accidents is high and we must be conscious of this. Regardless of the arrangements <Col N="1425" /> made by Ireland while holding the Presidency of the EC and the international Atomic Energy Agency Conference on Nuclear Energy in September 1991, I believe that nuclear energy has to be left to one side regardless of the outcome of that conference, regardless of what safety measures might be assured and regardless of what we are guaranteed. We must seek, and we will get and enjoy international co-operation. Ratification of the assistance, and notification and protection conventions which have been referred to in the explanatory memorandum are extremely important.</P>
    <P>There have been a few very unpleasant and sad incidents in the area of nuclear energy in recent times. In particular, we have had the Chernobyl disaster where it is likely &mdash; and nobody can be definite on this &mdash; that the events took place several days before we or other countries were made aware of those happenings. This is where I revert again to the importance of information and the transmission of information immediately to all concerned. We also have Sellafield. Our eastern shore is quite near Sellafield and is likely to be affected by fallout from the Sellafield plant.</P>
    <P>Reverting to Chernobyl, I believe that many thousands of people suffered death there, and others suffered grave injury, shortterm and long term, in that disaster. We have never been given an absolute account by the Russians what precisely happened there. This is a great pity. Our Nuclear Energy Board, in my view, are, to a certain degree, to be blamed for not informing the people of this country more rapidly of what happened at Chernobyl. I do not believe the Nuclear Energy Board, even if they had the full facts, could have created a scare by telling people to stay in their homes. Perhaps they could have advised people, indirectly, that it might be prudent for them to stay indoors over a number of days, but this was not done. The Nuclear Energy Board must have been in possession of a great deal of information they did not pass on directly to the people. Any modicum of radiation can be lethal in many respects. It has been stated <Col N="1426" /> already that radiation, or radium, is good and bad. It can kill and it can cure. Even the mildest form of radiation, and even not very intensive sun, can and does cause major skin cancer problems. This is a problem throughout the world. We have had this problem in recent years because fortunately, we had pretty good summers and long periods of sunshine.</P>
    <P>There is, as I perceive it, a certain lack of co-operation between countries on the whole question of nuclear energy. There are countries that are firmly and adamantly in favour of nuclear energy as a means of producing energy.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I welcome this Bill as far as it goes but I believe it should extend a little further. Hopefully, on Committee Stage, we may have an opportunity to make some comments in that direction.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the plans to establish a nuclear station at Carnsore Point which coincided with the setting up of the Nuclear Energy Board and, rightly or wrongly, it was suggested that the Nuclear Energy Board were pro-nuclear energy. I am not saying that that was the case but in some people's minds &mdash; and it was indicated earlier that very often it is what people believe that is important very often and not the facts &mdash; the Nuclear Energy Board were pro-nuclear energy. There are still some European countries and some EC members arguing in favour of nuclear energy. There are other countries, like ourselves, that positively are not going down that road. That, in my view, leads to a lack of co-operation that otherwise might be there. In the OECD countries one out of every four light bulbs is powered by nuclear energy. That gives us a fair indication that nuclear energy is not just a matter of form and something that we can take too lightly. Estimates at present are that up to the year 2000 there will be an annual increase of 23 per cent of requirements for electricity, all of which will not be produced by means other than the nuclear plants. With this substantial increase in energy requirements a lot of that will come from nuclear plants. It gets to the point of our <Col N="1427" /> having more and more control mechanisms, more and more monitoring of the whole operation, more relaying of information from one country to another.</P>
    <P>There is nothing seriously wrong with nuclear energy as a source of energy except the risk that it presents when accidents occur. Many OECD countries are lobbying very strongly for nuclear energy at present. Arguments have been put forward that pollution will be minimised or reduced by the introduction of nuclear energy, that the pollution created by fossils &mdash; turf, coal, timber and so on &mdash; is leading to the greenhouse effect. It is argued that that is far more serious than the possibility of a nuclear accident. I would have difficulty in agreeing with that because a nuclear accident, even of a minor nature, would be extremely serious and is something I hope we will never see in this country or in any country throughout the world. It is inevitable that it is going to happen at some stage through perhaps no fault of operators or anybody else but of the actual system itself.</P>
    <P>We do not realise the enormity of the effects a nuclear accident could have on our country or any other country that is affected. We must get a better hearing for our representations <i>vis-à-vis</i> Sellafield which affects our country very significantly, particularly the eastern side. We are not taken sufficiently seriously by those in Sellafield when we protest in this regard. It is incumbent on the British to have a far better monitoring system at Sellafield. From our point of view it is essential that accidents do not occur at Sellafield. If one does occur it will have very serious consequences here.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for regulations of control to be introduced if the levels rise above a certain point. Why not have these regulations in place beforehand rather than waiting for the possibility of a major or minor accident? That is one point I would emphatically put to the Minister. The regulations mentioned in section 32 should in fact be put in place beforehand <Col N="1428" /> and not when some accident has occurred.</P>
    <P>I have already talked about Chernobyl and matters there are very serious and will be serious for generations to come. The fall-out there was certainly far greater than we were led to believe. We are reminded of the situation, on a larger scale, in Hiroshima and Nagasaki where 50 years after the atomic bombs were dropped during the war the effects of radiation are still felt among the population. Freaks of nature continue to be born in these areas. We should be aware of the terrible animal that radioactive substances can be. There are innumerable hazards from the effects of radiation and we should never underestimate the effects. There must be a fresh start on radiation and the protection of people at this time. I want to emphasise again that we are talking about an unseen substance, something that cannot be felt and something we do not know about.</P>
    <P>Senators have referred to the number of aeroplanes that pass over our country daily or weekly and the amount of highly radioactive substance that crosses this country. We must also be mindful of our shores and our ports where ships that are highly radioactive are from time to time stationed and the slightest mishap in these places could cause something of a horror. I thoroughly agree with the point made by Senator Ó Cuív with regard to chemicals &mdash; the various chemicals we use so freely in agriculture and other areas such as weedicides, pesticides and so on &mdash; all these and many others we do not know about are probably as lethal, if not more so, in their effects as the real radioactive materials that are at least labelled as such. The problem is that we do not known the danger areas. We cannot be sure what points we have to be mindful of. We cannot be sure what exactly is a dangerous substance. This brings me back, at the risk of being repetitive, to the importance of our having a very sophisticated, elaborate and indepth monitoring system so that nothing will go unheeded. I share the view <i>vis-à-vis</i> our airspace, our harbours and our inlets, that we must not allow them to be open <Col N="1429" /> country to highly radioactive aeroplanes, ships or whatever. We must ensure that we guard them. Protecting our air space would ensure that aircraft do not come into that arena.</P>
    <P>I do not have figures to back up the point I am going to make but I believe the incidence of cancer in our community is at higher level than ever before. I would be inclined to link that horrible situation of high cancer incidence, very often in people in their teens, twenties and thirties, with radiation. Radiation, or some other unknown substance, has caused this dreadful situation. Radiation has been of great benefit to our community in so far as radium treatment has helped many people in our society. On the other hand, it is lethal when it is being absorbed by members of our community without their knowledge or sometimes with their knowledge.</P>
    <P>Unless we make certain that all radio-active substances are monitored on a frequent basis the consequences for this country could be serious. I am sure all Members in this House and people outside will agree that we must at all costs avoid unnecessary risks. I must compliment the Minister for introducing this Bill and ask him if he will consider making regulations with regard to monitoring beforehand rather than when excessive levels of radiation appear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin my reply by thanking those Senators who have contributed to the debate in such a constructive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I first turn to an issue raised by a number of Senators, the problem of Sellafield. The ongoing basis for Ireland's call for the closure of Sellafield is that the Government believe that the plant is inherently unsafe. The questionable safety standards at the plant, its history of mismanagement and the frequency of accidents and other incidents there confirm the Government's view that the only way to resolve concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant. Chernobyl demonstrated the transboundary nature of nuclear accidents, and the need for countries with nuclear power programmes to <Col N="1430" /> take account of the legitimate concerns of their neighbours.</P>
    <P>While the Sellafield plant continues to operate, it continues to discharge radio-active waste into the Irish Sea. Although the level of discharges has dropped considerably in recent years, this situation still remains unacceptable to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>A further concern of the Government is that the transport of radioactive materials to and from Sellafield gives rise to continuing risk of accidents involving shipping carrying such materials. The coming on stream of the THORP, the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant, will increase the scale of Sellafield's operations and further increase the risks including those arising from transport.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle sought an up-date on UK plans regarding nuclear power reactors at Sellafield. The position is that a study has been carried out for British Nuclear Fuels on building two 1,500 megawatt nuclear reactors, one at Sellafield and one in south-west Scotland. It is envisaged that the existing Calderhall plant, which supplies steam to Sellafield, and Chapelcross in Scotland, each containing Magnox reactors, would be replaced by the new units. However, I understand that there will be no decision on these reactors before the mid-nineties.</P>
    <P>The British Government have deferred decisions to build any new nuclear stations until it has undertaken a review of civil nuclear power in 1994. The Chief Executive of British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has said that BNFL is in no way committed to the construction of the new reactors and further study would have to be carried out before such a decision could be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave called, in his contribution, for the phased closure of Sellafield. I have been looking at the legal options open to me since taking office. Recently, officials from my Department and the Attorney General's Office met with representatives of Greenpeace at my request and their legal advisers. The various legal options were discussed, in particular the procedural avenues open under the International Court of Justice. <Col N="1431" /> The details supplied by Greenpeace are very interesting but purely in the context of procedures and my officials will examine them carefully. However, nothing new has emerged in respect of the actual legal and case basis on which we can pursue this matter. I will nevertheless continue to keep the issue under close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>On another point which the Senator raised I can state that I am satisfied that my Department are satisfactorily briefed on aspects of the Sellafield operation by the officials of the Nuclear Energy Board who visited the facility and have briefed me on the position on the ground. The House can be assured that the UK authorities are regularly made fully aware of our concerns regarding Sellafield.</P>
    <P>On the question of the selection of board members of the new institute, I have already consulted with the existing board members of the Nuclear Energy Board and the board of management in this regard. I will be having further discussions with the Ministers for Health, Labour and Environment and other bodies with an interest in radiology safety, before making any decision on the final composition of the institute's board.</P>
    <P>The Senator also sought some additional information on radon monitoring. The position is that the UCD survey identified western counties as being a greater risk of having high levels. Consequently the NEB undertook more detailed surveys in Galway, Clare and Mayo. This confirmed the earlier indications of the UCD survey. The board found that about 10 per cent of the houses had levels exceeding 200 becquerels per cubic metre. The householders concerned have been notified and further investigations are in progress. Schools have also been studied but only a few had levels above the reference level. Further studies are also in progress at these schools.</P>
    <P>Regarding the transportations of radio-active materials, the IAEA transport regulations lay down detailed rules governing all aspects of the transport of radioactive materials. Those regulations <Col N="1432" /> provide a high degree of safety and they are continually updated in the light of improved knowledge. In Ireland the NEB monitor implementation of these regulations and indeed where appropriate, impose special further conditions and ensure a rigid response for any possible incident. As a result of the international acceptance of the IAEA regulations, the international transport of radioative materials take place with a high degree of safety. This does not mean that we must not be vigilant. I am satisfied that our emergency plan will be capable of mounting an effective response to a transport incident should one occur.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the local authorities involvement in the emergency plan, this will be achieved via the Department of the Environment who are represented in the interdepartmental committee. Communications between the Department of the Environment and locl authorities are ongoing in this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle, and other Senators raised a question mark as to whether my Department should have responsibility for the new institute. I ask the question, would the new institute be any more independent under another Minister? I have ensured the independence of the institute by modifying the Bill and I would challenge any inference that the Department of Energy could be faced with a division of loyalties because our clear and unambiguous policy is that we oppose nuclear energy as a solution to our energy problems.</P>
    <P>This whole issue was dealt with in the Dáil at some length and the Government have carefully considered the matter. It was deemed inappropriate that the Minister for Health, for example, as a provider of health services, including services involving radioactive substances, should also have responsibility for the supply of these substances to health institutions. Effectively, he would become both licenser and user. Senators, I think will agree that it would be much better if two functions were separated and the health services could be provided with independent advice on these materials. <Col N="1433" /> This opinion would be given in isolation from their use in the medical area.</P>
    <P>There is also the consideration that at European Community level, nuclear matters encompass a wide range of energy policy issues which are normally dealt with by the Minister for Energy. It would be inadvisable to separate the nuclear power issue and associated safety matters from the overall energy area because we need a definitive strategy encompassing both.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned in my Second Stage speech, the various amendments to the Bill have ensured that the institute and their board will be able to act in an independent and professional manner under the Department of Energy. Given the independence of the new institute and the undoubted expertise now in the NEB with regard to radiological protection and nuclear safety generally, I believe that they are best placed to assume this role. The new institute will inherit a well equipped laboratory and an expert staff from NEB and will be in a position to effectively carry out the functions as contained in the Bill from day one.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan rightly pointed to the inherent dangers in the nuclear fuel cycle. In that context, it might be appropriate to dwell briefly on research which is taking place on what could be a safer form of nuclear energy &mdash; nuclear fusion, a subject also raised by Senator Doyle and Raftery.</P>
    <P>The Joint European Torus &mdash; JET &mdash; is the largest project in the EC's research programme on controlled thermonuclear fusion, which is aimed at proving the feasibility of using nuclear fusion as a source of energy. The JET device, located at Abingdon, Oxfordshire, commenced operations in 1983. There are 22 Irish persons on the staff of JET, seconded from the public service or originally employed in the private sector, in administrative, technical and professional grades.</P>
    <P>One of the major advantages claimed for fusion is that it has the potential to be inherently safe in that it will not have the major problems associated with the present day fission reactors &mdash; e.g., risk <Col N="1434" /> of runaway chain reactions, production of long lived spent nuclear fuel, which can involve reprocessing, security problems associated with the possible diversion of uranium and plutonium for military purposes. However, the fusion reactor will involve a certain amount of radioactivity and the structure of the reactor will become radioactive after use.</P>
    <P>The European fusion programme is a long term co-operative project embracing all the work carried out in member states of fusion &mdash; Sweden and Switzerland also participate. It is designed to lead in due course to the joint construction of prototype reactors. It is divided roughly into three stages &mdash; the demonstration of scientific feasibility, then of technological feasibility and, finally, of commercial feasibility. The programme is still at the first stage, with JET and other smaller devices being developed and used to demonstrate scientific feasibility. Preparations for the second stage, &ldquo;the Next Step&rdquo; or NET &mdash;&ldquo;the Next European Torus&rdquo; are also in progress. It is envisaged that construction on the Next Step might commence in the late 1990s.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on fusion research through the EC budget is currently about 200 million ECU per year. When national funding is added the total expenditure on the programme is about 450 million ECU per year.</P>
    <P>Ireland would, of course, prefer that the bulk of expenditure, within the nuclear research budget, be allocated to nuclear safety but we will continue to observe any progress in this whole area.</P>
    <P>Turning briefly to other matters raised by Senator Doyle and Senator Cosgrave on the establishment of an independent nuclear inspectorate, this issue is at the forefront of our strategy in the field of nuclear safety. I believe that the best way to ensure that the highest standards of safety are being achieved and maintained is to have an independent, international inspectorate established to verify the application of such standards. Within the European Communities we have proposed that the Commission establish such an inspectorate for the Community. We <Col N="1435" /> have pointed out that the Commission has sufficient power to do this under the EURATOM Treaty and that it must remember that it has a duty to protect all of the peoples of the Community. I continue to look to the Commission to bring forward a realistic proposal, and to nuclear member states to accept that they must be seen to be safe. As I mentioned in my Second Stage speech last year, in response to repeated requests from Ireland, the Commission announced a modest proposal to reintroduce inspection and verification of member states' monitoring facilities for discharges of radiation. Officials from my Department have met Commission representatives to discuss this initiative and have made it clear that while Ireland welcomes the latest move, it is imperative that a much more radical approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle asked about the relationship between the new institute and the 1977 order. The Nuclear Energy Order, 1977, will be kept in force under the Bill, when enacted. Under this order the custody, use, manufacture, importation, distribution, transportation, exportation or other disposal of radio-active substances is prohibited except under licence from the board. Conditions may be attached to such licenses.</P>
    <P>To clarify the question of the chief executive, I had originally intended to appoint the first chief executive officer, purely on the basis that it would ensure the immediate executive operation of the institute as and from establishment day. However, in order to reinforce the independence of the institute, I have amended the Bill so that the board will appoint the chief executive officer, subject to my consent, even though there will be a time lapse before the first chief executive officer takes up duty. Section 11 (5) was amended accordingly.</P>
    <P>To clarify the position regarding the international conventions, the new institute will play the lead role in the implementation of these conventions. The institute will be the competent authority and the contact point and this is set out in section 27 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1436" /> Regarding the Paris, Oslo and London Dumping Conventions, these are separate conventions dealing with pollution of the seas. Various Government Departments have involvement, including the Department of Energy, who are advised by the Nuclear Energy Board and will continue to be so by the institute regarding pollution by radioactive materials. Ireland strongly opposes dumping at sea of any radioactive substances.</P>
    <P>Regarding some of the points raised by Senator Conroy about the Chernobyl accident, it has been reported, although the actual data has not reached us yet in Ireland, that increases in the occurrence of leukaemia have been recently detected in Soviet Republics. It is expected that this will become more evident in the coming years when it is likely that other cancers will begin to appear. There is a great deal unknown about the effects of the Chernobyl accident and many studies, i.e. epidemiological studies, need to be done. The EC is discussing with Soviet authorities, both all-union and individual republics institutes, what assistance can be given to the Soviets in helping to study the many problems still existing after the Chernobyl accident. The Nuclear Energy Board have been active in these discussions and we in Ireland are encouraging and supporting this collaboration as far as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked why so many Ministers were involved, particularly under section 32. The position is that other Ministers are to be involved in making regulations under this Bill where there could be a contamination risk to the food chain in the event of an accident &mdash; these measures are envisaged in an emergency situation and are required because of &ldquo;legislative weaknesses&rdquo; in this area at present. Many Ministers have responsibility for different aspects of the food chain, e.g. Agriculture &mdash; for food, meat, etc., the Marine &mdash; for fish, etc. The appropriate Minister is best placed to regulate his own area. There would be co-ordination of all measures by a nuclear accident committee in an emergency situation comprising representatives of all relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1437" /> Turning to the issue of overflights and the passage of foreign ships which have the potential to carry nuclear weapons, this is the subject of an amendment for Committee Stage and I will go into the appropriate detail on this matter when we are dealing with those amendments. For the moment if I could just respond to a number of points. Senator Ryan, and maybe Senator Norris, seemed to have suggested that the Government are ignoring this whole issue. Senator Ryan went so far as to say that the Government blissfully ignore the passage of nuclear weapons through our airspace and into our coastal waters. In this House last week and in the Dáil, at all Stages, I have repeatedly asserted and emphasised the Government's position on the issue. It is a clear and unequivocal position: there is a prohibition on the carriage of nuclear weapons through our airspace; there is a prohibition on the entry of nuclear weapons into our ports. That is the categoric position.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also questioned our commitment to complying with our obligations under international law. I must make the point that we just cannot run willy-nilly away from the obligations imposed on us under international treaties. The fact is that under the present requirements of international law our territorial waters &mdash; indeed the territorial waters of all states &mdash; are subject to the internationally recognised principle of innocent passage. This principle, for example, is recognised and adhered to by the Government quoted as a model by Senator Ryan and, I think, Senator Norris &mdash; New Zealand &mdash; because it is an international obligation and the question of prohibiting entry into territorial waters simply does not arise. I have been accused of passing the buck to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Some Members have glibly stated that they do not care who deals with the matter as long as someone does. I would take issue with that simplistic point of view. What we are talking about here is our respect for international obligations; and, whether we like it or not, this involves contact at the highest diplomatic level.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> Finally, Senator Conroy and other Senators expressed concern about nuclear submarines. I can assure the House that the Government share that concern and are very aware of the dangers posed to fishing trawlers by nuclear submarines. The Government are continuing to focus international attention on the problem at every level and at every available opportunity, including the International Maritime Organisation where we launched a successful initiative in 1987. At the United Nations, the Minister for Foreign Affairs again raised the problem in September of last year, and in that forum the Government have called for a new sense of responsibility on the part of those who operate submarines.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris questioned the role of the institute in the event of an emergency. I would refer him to section 7 of the Bill, where subsection (1) (e) says that the institute &ldquo;would be involved in assisting the planning and implementation of measures to deal with radiological emergencies&rdquo;. I want to add to that that it will be a function of the institute to assist in the planning and implementation of measures to deal with radiological emergencies, if they ever arise. God forbid that they would. Because of the nature of radio-active substances and nuclear devices, proper emergency planning to enable swift and adequate measures to be taken to minimise the effect of a release of radioactive material as a result of a nuclear accident or other occurrence is very important.</P>
    <P>Following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986 a national emergency plan for nuclear accidents was drafted by an interdepartmental committee chaired by my Department. The plan involves the deployment of a network of radiation monitoring devices around the country in order to detect any increases in radiation, a system to enable notification of an accident abroad to be received, the rapid calling together of a nuclear accident committee following a notification or detection of raised radiation levels and directing the response and the identification of the roles and functions of the <Col N="1439" /> various Government Departments, agencies and other bodies in the response to the emergency. The Government approved expenditure of approximately £900,000 in 1988 to be phased over four years on resources for the plan, including equipment and also approved staff and other running costs arising from the plan. Much of the necessary equipment for the operation of the plan has been purchased and it is now operational. Some further work on the elaboration by Government Departments and other agencies of their role is in progress. A limited test of the plan has taken place and further tests will be held from time to time.</P>
    <P>The institute, when established, will take over the functions and resources of the board in relation to this plan. Under the national plan for a radiological emergency the Department of Energy have been designated as the co-ordinating body for the work of all relevant State agencies, such as the present Nuclear Energy Board. The Radiological Protection Institute will continue to fulfil the important role of assisting in the planning and implementation of measures to deal with the radiological emergency.</P>
    <P>Senator Eamon Ó Cuív referred to the question of non-ionising radiation. This is covered to a certain extent in the Bill under section 9, which enables the Minister to extend by order the institute's activities to non-ionising radiation such as microwaves, as distinct from microwave ovens, and also to radio waves. There is at present no central authority in Ireland in relation to the assessment of the effects of non-ionising radiation, the laying down of protection measures and the regulation of its occurrence. There is as yet no clear evidence of any adverse effects from this radiation, but the matter is receiving greater attention worldwide.</P>
    <P>There is concern in some circles, for example, about the effects of the radiation from electricity cables and from MMDS television signals. Therefore, I feel that it is necessary for the new institute to be in a position to take on this new function and to acquire the necessary expertise and resources to do so. Before <Col N="1440" /> any decisions to extend the institute's responsibilities to non-ionising radiation can be taken, it will be necessary to examine, in consultation with relevant Government agencies such as the Department of Communications, the Department of Health and other bodies such as the ESB, what needs to be done and to which body's responsibility it should be assigned.</P>
    <P>I intend to have this question examined as soon as possible by my Department in consultation with the other relevant agencies. The difficulty at the moment is to determine what is necessary and what hazards are to be dealt with. The scope of non-ionising radiation is that the hazards, if any, are not at present clearly identified nor are the control measures that could be appropriate or useful. Section 9 (1) (c) of the Bill, therefore, is worded so that it can be specific to any one type of radiation considered hazardous and outlines the powers and functions necessary to cope with a specific problem.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;nuclear explosive device&rsquo; means any nuclear weapon or other explosive device capable of releasing nuclear energy, irrespective of the purpose for which it could be used, whether assembled or unassembled;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a definition of a nuclear explosive device. This is important. It relates also to my own amendments because I am <Col N="1441" /> particularly concerned about the importation into this country, which has been clearly placed on the record of this House, of nuclear weapons. It is important, if one wants to inhibit this development, to give a definition of what a nuclear weapon actually is. The definition states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; means any nuclear weapon or other explosive device capable of releasing nuclear energy, irrespective of the purpose for which it could be used, whether assembled or unassembled.</P>
    <P>Because the whole question of nuclear weapons is quite a technical area. I think it is worth looking at what actually is involved in a nuclear arsenal. A nuclear warhead has four principal components: there is the nuclear core, which is a central ball of lethally radioactive plutonium-239, combined with another substance called tritium, which is added to boost the plutonium's explosive power. This is also known as the capsulei, then there is the nuclear tamper. This is completely surrounding the central ball of plutonium and is a shell of second radioactive material, typically uranium-238 and it is known as the casing; the conventional explosive is the third element. There is an outer shell of non-nuclear explosive packed around the tamper as a triggering device. When exploded, it compresses the nuclear material of the tamper and the core into a critical mass, at which point the warhead detonates in a nuclear explosion; finally, there is the arming mechanism, which is an electronic switch which requires insertion of the correct 12-digit code sequence to activate the fuse of the conventional explosive surrounding the nuclear warhead.</P>
    <P>There is another matter of concern I would like to draw to the attention of the House. Until the middle 1950s American nuclear warheads were designed in such a way that the core and the tamper, the first and second elements I read into the record of the House, were separated. <Col N="1442" /> Since then all warheads produced for the American armed forces have fully integrated design, whether in storage or transit. This means that whether in storage or transit they contain all the components necessary to generate a nuclear detonation. This is very serious and, as I say, it relates very directly to the amendments I have down subsequently and also to the amendments of Senator Brendan Ryan.</P>
    <P>I see that my colleague from the Labour Party, Senator Upton, is here. I hope he does not think me very presumptuous for having jumped into the breach and moved his amendment, but I am sure he would be more competent to speak directly to this amendment himself. I will leave it at that, if I may.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do not feel that Senator Norris was presumptuous. I thank him for jumping into the breach when to some extent I was caught offside. We have put down this amendment because we believe that any Bill which deals with nuclear protection cannot afford to ignore nuclear explosive devices. The effect of nuclear radiation is pretty well the same regardless of how that radiation has been emitted. That is the basic reason for tabling this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy) Robert Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considered this. I do not really understand why it has been put down because &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; is not referred to in any part of the Bill. Therefore it does not arise that there is a need to put in a definition for it. There is a definition of a &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; already in the text and that would cover the concept of a nuclear explosive device. If I may put it on the record, &ldquo;nuclear device&rdquo; is defined to include &ldquo;any machine or apparatus the operation of which involves the use of a radioactive substance, an irradiating apparatus or a nuclear reactor&rdquo;. I cannot accept the proposed amendment. It is not necessary. There is no need for a definition of this <Col N="1443" /> kind because the word &ldquo;explosive&rdquo; does not appear in any part of the text.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend pushing my amendment. Certainly, the Minister is correct that that phrase does not occur. It is a glaring omission. It is a disgrace that it is not there. Of course it should be. I wonder if the Minister is aware of the dangers to which it is exposing the citizens of this country by his neglect? I would not describe him as being blissful about it, but I think it is negligent. That phrase &ldquo;nuclear explosive device&rdquo; is contained in my amendment and in the other amendment, so if the Minister takes the subsequent amendments on board it will be part of the Bill. It is not satisfactory to say blandly &mdash; I will not say blissfully, although I note there is a hint of a smile there &mdash; that it is not relevant because it is not in the Bill. It is not in the Bill, but it should be; and, if I have my way, it will be.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter. The reality is that aeroplanes are flying across the country and to the best of our information they contain nuclear explosive devices. Yet we have a Bill here which seeks to protect the public from radiation and there is no reference made to this reality. The whole emphasis and the whole burden of our thinking processes seems to be ignore that, to pretend that somehow it does not exist, because people have taken a clever option, as it were, and refuse to confirm or to deny whether planes and ships which contain these weapons are in our territory.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask for some guidance on that technically, because perhaps the Minister is genuinely trying to be helpful. I do not think there is much point in wasting time. I certainly do not wish to waste the Minister's time or anybody else's but would it be correct to say that this can be kind of retroactively implemented in the Bill if we are successful with the amendment? We will press it because it would be absurd to attempt to control something which is completely undefined. Therefore, in order for my later amendment to operate with any degree of success or rationality or logic there would have to be some definition. Can I get some guidance? Can it be put in subsequently if there is not such a move, because I will be putting evidence on the record of the House that quite a considerable number of nuclear explosive devices are brought into this country and have been brought into this country? The record is perfectly clear. Everybody knows this, everybody accepts it and some of us are worried about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I say, the amendment proposes giving a definition of something that is not actually contained in the text. As I have indicated already, there is a definition of a nuclear device and it covers the intent of the amendment which seeks to put in a definition of a nuclear explosive device. I cannot accept the amendment. I do not see any need for it. If Senator Norris wishes to discuss the matter in greater detail, it can be done if the House accepts his amendment, which would include the word &ldquo;explosive&rdquo;. But, as we have not reached that point yet in the discussion, it is unnecessary and, as he said himself, possibly a waste of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 21, between lines 44 and 45, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(9) The Minister shall by order regulate the entry into Irish territorial waters of any foreign State ship, submarine, or hovercraft, and the passage through Irish airspace of any foreign State aircraft by requiring, prior to any grant of permission for such entry or passage, the production of a certificate from the relevant foreign State authority that the ship, submarine, hovercraft, or aircraft in question does not carry any nuclear explosive device.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is very straightforward. It seeks to make certain that ships and planes do not carry nuclear weapons into Irish territory. It is as simple as that. To make sure that that does not happen this amendment seeks to make it necessary that a certificate will be produced by the appropriate authority to the effect that no nuclear weapons are on board these crafts. The reason for this amendment is the great concern which exists because of the reality that aircraft flying over and ships visiting our territory do carry nuclear weapons. These seems to be very strong circumstantial evidence to support that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also fairly clear evidence that this happens on a wide scale throughout the world. I have in my possession a report from the National Defence Research Establishment produced in Sweden which clearly acknowledges that this type of thing takes place in Sweden. This report was produced by a defence research establishment&mdash;in other words, very much the other side of the case I <Col N="1446" /> would be arguing for and very much the other conflicting point of view from that put forward by organisations such as Greenpeace. When organisations such as the National Defence Research Establishment in Sweden are prepared to acknowledge that vessels and aircraft flying through the territory of other countries carry weapons we can take it as fairly certain that that is happening. If that is the reality, it is highly undesirable and we need to take appropriate precautions to ensure that this cannot happen. Therefore, we are proposing that be done by way of the production of a certificate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment on the basis that the Bill is not the appropriate medium, given its primary aims of establishing the institute, providing for radiation protection measures and giving effect to international conventions. The question is more pertinent to the diplomatic arena, the area of international relations and the responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs. I am satisfied that our existing legislation and policy in this area are fully adequate to cover Ireland's concern with regard to nuclear weapons.</P>
      <P>The following points should be borne in mind. The permission of the Department of Foreign Affairs is required for visits to Irish ports by foreign naval vessels. Permission for a visit will normally be granted provided that the visit does not form part of a naval exercise and the vessel is not carrying nuclear weapons. Thus it has been Government policy over the last two decades not to permit nuclear weapons to enter Irish ports and the Government are not aware of any reason to doubt that our policy in this area is not being respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The entry of foreign military aircraft into Irish airspace, and landings of such aircraft in the State, are already covered under existing legislation. The strict controls which exist under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, provide that no foreign military aircraft <Col N="1447" /> shall fly over Ireland unless at the express invitation, or with the express permission, of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In addition, any aircraft involved must comply with any stipulations as the Minister may make. Information such as identification numbers and aircraft types must be provided. In seeking permission it is also necessary to state whether the aircraft comply with certain conditions, the most important of which are that they are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or intelligence gathering equipment and do not form part of any military exercise or military operation. Again, therefore, it is Government policy not to permit nuclear weapons to enter our airspace. Ireland is not a member of any military alliance and thus remains free from any commitment, in particular, to admit nuclear weapons that such membership might entail.</P>
    <P>Foreign Governments are aware of our policy on ships' visits and overflights and are reminded of this policy on a regular basis. The Government are not aware that any nuclear weapons have been brought into the State in vessels or aircraft, nor are circumstances envisaged under which this is likely to occur. Public safety is not endangered, nor is long established opposition to these weapons being abused, threatened, tested or in any way misunderstood.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Upton and Senator Norris earlier made reference to various apparent incidents. Has the Minister any details of representations from individuals or organisations in relation to the overflying of the country or the entry into our ports of any vessels carrying nuclear devices or nuclear weapons? Have investigations taken place by the Department and have any of these been substantiated? We would be particularly concerned if this was going on and was condoned, on a nod and a wink basis by either the Minister's Department or the Department of Foreign Affairs. Can <Col N="1448" /> the Minister tell the House if the incidents which have been reported have been fully investigated and can he give the outcome of those investigations? Can he assure the House that, as he has stated, there have been no intrusions either in our airspace or, more particularly, by vessels calling to our ports.</P>

Deputies chose to put questions to me in the Dáil which are not appropriate for me to answer. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is available to answer these questions and has answered questions of this nature in the past, as the record of the House shows. If, like some Deputies, Senators have serious concerns about this matter, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, being the appropriate Minister is available to answer any questions they wish to raise in regard to these matters. It is not a matter that the Department of Energy deals with specifically.</P>

      <P>This Bill is about radiological protection. Therefore, it has to cover protection from foreign vessels in Irish ports which carry nuclear weapons. It is good to hear the Minister's reassurances that this does not happen; although I think, if I heard him correctly, that what he said was that there was not evidence of this, as distinct from it being impossible that it ever happened. The Minister was talking in terms fof the evidence not being there, or that he did not have the evidence, as distinct from it being a fact that it never happened. I would certainly be interested to hear whether or not the Minister can state categorically that never has there been a vessel in Irish waters which carried nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way or another, the public in Ireland are now very concerned about this possiblity; and it is a very small matter to ask that people coming into <Col N="1449" /> Irish waters, the owners of boats, planes and so on, provide a certificate to the effect that the vessels do not carry nuclear weapons. That is a simple matter. It has to be very relevant to any Bill which seeks to protect people from radiation. If there is an accident with these vessels there will be very serious consequences, which will have tremendous ramifications in terms of our capacity to protect ourselves from nuclear radiation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have. I placed some of it on the record of the House this morning. There was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> which confirmed this from United Nations sources. I can give you facts and figures. In July 1983 the destroyer USS Scott equipped with harpoon missiles visited Cobh and returned to Cobh in July 1984. I can give you a detailed list. I can place on the record as many of these <Col N="1451" /> instances as you want and declare that they were checked before they left United States territorial waters and confirmed and certified as having nuclear weapons on board. The Minister is not going to tell me that they jettisoned them in mid-Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed to hear the Senator suggesting that that kind of circumstantial evidence is sufficient to come to a definite conclusion. That is the type of thinking that got the British authorities into difficulties with the Birmingham Six and other cases. I am surprised at Senator Norris suggesting that he has evidence which is purely circumstantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it circumstantial at all. The Minister is taking a very cavalier attitude towards this evidence, remarkably unlike that of the Government of Sweden or New Zealand. This evidence was quite sufficient for them but apparently the Irish Government feel otherwise. This is a line that is being parroted. I was reading in the report the very words that the Minister came out with. The Irish Government says it &ldquo;is not aware of any reason to doubt that [Irish policy] is not being respected&rdquo;. However, in the case of naval exercises, all but three of the US navy ship visits to Ireland in the 1980s occurred as part of the ships being deployed to major naval exercises in the North Atlantic. This can be checked out and is a matter of record. Moreover, in three of those cases &mdash; in 1983, 1988 and 1989 &mdash; the visit to Ireland was the only visit to foreign port conducted by the particular ship during its participation in the exercise. Could the Minister tell me how when the ship is engaged in an exercise and doing nothing else except being engaged in a military exercise if, by chance, it comes into an Irish port, it suddenly is not part of that exercise? I do not understand the reasoning there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>May I just say that this evidence was substantiated by a separate Swedish report that confirmed in essence precisely what is going on here. Specific detailed information was released under the Freedom of Information Act in the United States of America. It has been made available here. It is published and there is not a slightest shadow of doubt but that nuclear weapons come in here. The policy of the United States &mdash; and I am not attacking or blaming the United States, they are guiltless while we are the guilty party in this &mdash; is to neither confirm nor deny their presence. Is the Minister actually telling us that no nuclear weapons have come into this State?</P>
      <P>Can I deal with a point which was raised in the Dáil and the Minister might have an argument about the question of right of innocent passage. I do not believe he is right and I am quite convinced that this could be challenged internationally because of the nature of the weapons involved. However, the reason for my amendment is that it is slightly different in wording to the one proposed by Senator Brendan Ryan and it says:</P>
      <P>The Minister shall by order regulate the entry into Irish ports, harbours, internal waters or air space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has no defence by recourse to the question of the right of innocent passage in that, because I am talking about entry into the ports, the international waters and the harbours. It is vital that we are protected here. These ships visit regularly; they visit the Alexandra Basin, are tied up in the heart of a centre of population and everybody knows they carry nuclear weapons, unless we are to disbelieve the American records. I have made it perfectly clear that the manuals of some of those ships show clearly that the ships are part of a military exercise. In some cases the only port they visited was Dublin, so how can the Minister say they are not part of a <Col N="1454" /> military exercise? The records demonstrate with great clarity and detail precisely what kind of weapons are involved and they gave details of the United States certification.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of disinformation. I wish we had the time to put it on the record. It appears we are so unconcerned about the threat posed by these ships that we are prepared to take only 15 minutes to debate this matter. The Minister knows the report. In 1982 there was the USS <i>Comte de Grasse</i> visited Cork and it contained the ASROC system. The nuclear weapons inspections recorded in the United States of America military shows it was inspected on 3-5 December 1980 by NTPI, 3-4 June 1982, 17-20 December 1984, 25-28 February 1985, 30 July to 1 August 1986 and in January 1988. This is all American military information. The Americans are confirming that they have been inspected and certified and it is a matter of public record in the United States that they have been certified as carrying nuclear weapons. There is not time to go through every single ship but there is page after page of this information. Is the Minister saying that the Americans, for some obscure reason, are telling lies and pretending to have atom bombs on board their ships merely to frighten us? I do not follow that reasoning.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with the Minister because he seems to feel this is more appropriate to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will certainly take up his suggestion that the Minister for Foreign Affairs be required to answer for this, because he has a lot to answer for on this matter. Here the Minister has indicated that the blame lies at the door of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would not be living up to my obligations as a public representative who has been placed in possession of this information if I did not press this matter. I would be very grateful if the Minister would indicate if he is satisfied with the redrafting of this amendment to remove <Col N="1455" /> the question of the right of innocent passage and if he is convinced by the information I have placed on the record of the House that American ships come in that are part of military exercises and that, verifiably, they contain nuclear weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody would lend any credence to what Senator Norris has been saying, the matter he has raised here was debated in the other House in great detail. The report Senator Norris referred to, the one concerning US navy warships in Irish ports, has been closely <Col N="1456" /> examined by the Department of Foreign Affairs. The study is detailed and extensive. However, when it was scrutinised carefully by the Department of Foreign Affairs, they found that it does not present any evidence that there had been nuclear weapons on board vessels visiting Swedish ports, which was the allegation in the report.</P>
      <P>The report also contains points that are unclear, and there are omissions, according to the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is clear that a Government could not act on the basis of assumptions and circumstantial indications which is the basis for the argument Senator Norris is making. I am surprised that a man of the Senator's standing would seek to give the impression that something so serious was happening, to imply that the Government were treating it lightly and were turning a blind eye to it. I do not accept that. No evidence of any kind has been presented to him either through that report or from any other source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mention was made of having certification for entry into the ports here. If we were to require certification from international shipping entering our ports or harbours, we would be going much further than the controls imposed by other Governments. The Senator seems to like to quote the case of New Zealand. I want to make it clear that even in the case of New Zealand the Prime Minister there is required to satisfy himself that a ship visiting a port in that country is not carrying a nuclear explosive device. The New Zealand Government, quoted by Senator Norris, do not require certification. Even if we were to demand such a certificate it should not be forgotten that naval ships enjoy sovereign immunity and are exempt under international law from inspection and search by host governments. Therefore, it is impossible to verify such certification so it would not improve the situation that Senator Norris is decrying. The Government believe that the best way this problem should be dealt with is through <Col N="1457" /> nuclear disarmament. This is the policy the Government will follow and which they have been pursuing and promoting at every international forum.</P>
    <P>Clearly, then, I have to oppose the amendments. I could not possibly include them in the Bill for the reasons I have stated. I would have to take into account the ramifications of such an amendment, if I were to accept it. It would have grave implications for the State if it were to be accepted in the manner in which the Senator is proposing.</P>

      <P>May I put on the record what Admiral Laroque, a Senior Admiral of the United States navy had to say on this matter? It is an interesting quotation: &ldquo;My experience has been that any ship capable of carrying nuclear weapons carries nuclear weapons, they do not offload them when they go into foreign ports&rdquo;. I was charmed by the Minister's attack. He is such a gentle and delicate person. It was the mildest attack I have ever experienced. In terms of discrediting the report, it did not go very far. It was rather like what was said in another place about an attack being compared with being mauled by a dead sheep. That was exactly the sensation I experienced when the Minister was attempting to impugn the information in the report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for coming here to address the House on this very important topic. We are witnessing at present a tragedy in our economy. The beef industry which supplies 38 per cent of gross agricultural output and roughly 20 per cent of net national exports is about to self destruct because of the activities of a small number of people pedalling illegal drugs. Some farmers who are in dire straits financially are trying to make ends meet by taking a short term view and making a quick buck by using these drugs. The Minister and myself might disagree on a number of matters about hormones but we are absolutely agreed on the damage that the illegal use of drugs, and particularly &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;, is doing to the beef industry.</P>
      <P>The confidence of beef consumers, not only in Ireland but across the Community, is dwindling. Beef consumption has reduced until we are almost at the point where we have slightly more than half the consumption per capita that they have of beef in the United States. If we had United States consumption figures we would have a deficit of beef in the Community, not the surplus of nearly 800,000 tonnes we have plus the dumping of Community beef at an enormous cost to the Community taxpayer on world markets. We have a dire situation on our hands. Some countries &mdash; and Ireland is making a fair effort at controlling the illegal use of drugs &mdash; particularly in southern Europe are making little or no effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How did we get into this dire situation? The history is that we had five safe products approved by every scientific body in the world, including approval by the <Col N="1462" /> committee set up by the European Commission under Professor Lamming. They were not only approved by the World Health Organisation but actually recommended to be licenced for sale to prevent the use of these illegal or dangerous substances which would arise on the black market. Of course, politicians in the European Parliament and, I regret to say, some kind of political influence in the Commission, totally ignored these warnings and the evidence they got from eminent scientists all over the world. The scientists were unanimous that the five products were safe and that they cut the cost of beef production by somewhere in the region of $150 per head. They were unanimous that the substances reduced the fat in beef and, therefore, made it better quality but, above all, they were unanimous that the ban the Commission were proposing could not be enforced feasibly. One gentleman giving evidence &mdash; Professor Karg from Munich &mdash; said we would need a policeman on every farm to enforce the ban.</P>
    <P>It was admitted by the Commission subsequently that the decision was made for political and commerical reasons and not, as the general public thought, for consumer safety. Indeed, the scientists were absolutely unanimous that the ban was likely to increase the risk for the consumer rather than reduce risks. We alone in the world when every other major beef producer was allowing the use of these substances decided that we would not allow them. We have got ourselves into this mess through our own fault and if damage is now being done, and it is being done, the blame&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Community alone amongst the major producers. I am sure, Minister, if it were left to Ireland we would not have introduced that crazy legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> We brought in this ban to satisfy forces, particularly the Greens in Germany, and we got ourselves into this mess. If damage is being done as it is then the fault rests in the first instance with the people who brought in the legislation. If people's health is being damaged, and there is evidence that some farmers have lost their lives as a result of inhaling this substance, then the blame must be laid at the door of the people concerned. I am selecting the Commission in this respect because politicians at least had to be aware of political influences. The civil servants in the Commission should have overlooked that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>That leaves us with a hell of a mess and it has resulted in declining consumption, black market activity, severe damage to the beef industry, increased risks to both producers and consumers and, above all, it has made millionaires of the racketeers. Three years ago it was estimated that over 70 per cent of the drugs in Italy were off the black market and it is reckoned that the Mafia are making more money now out of hormones than out of cocaine.</P>
    <P>In our country there is clear evidence that the IRA are the chief beneficiaries of this illegal racket. No words of mine could adequatley condemn the proctices now in vogue or the damage that is being done as a consequence but I do not see any easy solution. We are trying to do the impossible. This ban is somewhat similar to the prohibition in the United States and is giving rise to the same results, a black market, gangsters, crime and all that goes with it.</P>
    <P>What should we be doing or what should our Minister be doing? He is trying his best by putting resources in but I have to tell him that the task confronting him is virtually an impossible one. One of my criticisms of this ban is that in addition to the damage being done it has deflected scarce resources which could be doing something valuable in the eradication of disease not only here but throuthout the Community. I refer to the <Col N="1464" /> eradication of bovine tuberculosis, of trichiniasis, of fowl pest, of rabies, of foot and mouth disease but we have a human made problem now gobbling up resources and thereby preventing us from taking proper action against real problems we have to continuously confront with diseases.</P>
    <P>At Community level we have to face facts. It will not be feasible to enforce this ban in its entirely. The hormone directive needs to be amended to allow the use of natural occurring hormones. If the United States has over 90 per cent of their cattle treated with these hormones and have nearly twice the consumption of beef per head, who is to tell us we have better standards than the US or Japan who have a better record in health care than we have in the Community? Consumers who are prepared to pay a premium price for non-treated meat have to be catered for also. In other words, if we have consumers, and I am sure we have, who want non-treated meat, they must be catered for, can be catered for, in the same way as we cater for people who want organically produced food.</P>
    <P>Farmers have to play a much more active role in helping the Minister and his agents to stamp out the use of illegal drugs. Farm leaders are making the right noises but I do not think farmers on the ground are as co-operative as they should be. The Minister must do more to help producers. It can hardly come as a surprise to him to hear that beef producers are losing money. The withdrawal of the hormones knocked nearly £100 per animal off their profits and now they are making losses or very little profit. Three years ago it cost the Community £250 for every animal produced, of which the farmer got 13 per cent. Now it costs the Community £500 per animal of which the farmer gets 5 per cent. There is something extraordinarily wrong there and I do not think the Minister is doing enough about it.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect we have to look at. Beef farmers who are intensive <Col N="1465" /> beef producers are now caught in a trap. They cannot make money because of the loss of the growth promoters and they cannot afford to get out of beef production because of the cost in terms of the tax imposed upon them for de-stocking. In other words the Minister must be more flexible on this. If somebody gets rid of a couple of hundred thousand pounds worth of animals he may have no income at all and yet he could be presented with a huge tax bill. That has to be catered for by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a great deal of work to do in this area where Ireland more than any other country has a huge problem. We have to be realistic about it. There is no point having legislation that we cannot enforce. There is no point driving our farmers to be criminals. There is no point allowing the Mafia, the IRA and various other gangsters to make a fortune putting the consumers at risk, making paupers of the farmers and destroying the beef industry in the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. O'Kennedy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to reiterate my views on this issue. My views on the illegal use of veterinary medicines are well known and I have outlined them to the Houses of the Oireachtas on a number of occasions. We are all aware of the attention which the use of hormones, antibiotics, and particularly the beta-agonists have received of late. This attention arises in the main from a growing awareness among consumers. They are, rightly in my view, demanding assurances that the food they purchase does not contain residues of these and other contaminants and has not been derived from animals which have been treated with illegal substances. I have said many times that the consumer is the farmers' best friend. In my view the consumer is the farmers' only friend, and what the consumer wants the consumer must get. It is particularly important that a country like Ireland which is <Col N="1466" /> so dependent on food exports should be able to give these assurances to both domestic consumers and customers abroad. There may well be arguments that economic pressures force farmers into using these substances or that certain types of hormones are not harmful. However, if the consumer does not want the final produce, then that is the end of the argument.</P>
      <P>I have introduced a range of measures to tackle the illegal use of veterinary medicines. In September 1988 I introduced measures of unprecedented severity to prohibit the manufacture, importation, possession, sale or use of hormonal substances. In July 1990 I introduced legislation to extend these provisions to all illegal veterinary medicines. I took this action because I was aware that certain substances could be used as an alternative to hormone growth promoters which had been banned in 1987 by the Council of Ministers on the proposal of the Commission as Senator Raftery, has said &mdash; incidentially, before I became a member of the Council &mdash; and I inherited a fact that this was now a binding and legal regulation from the Council. On that basis I had no option but to adhere to the law and, if necessary, to make a virtue of it. I wanted to ensure that no apparent loophole of this nature would encourage or facilitate a drift towards the use of illegal substances. I need no convincing on the need to tackle and eliminate the problem or of the risk it poses to our meat industry if it gets out of hand, and I agree with what Senator Raftery said.</P>
      <P>The measures I have taken are more comprehensive and stringent than those applicable in any other EC member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomRaftery" hpid="Professor Raftery Professor Raftery">
      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They comply with the views of the European Parliament which passed resolutions calling on the Commission to extend hormone type controls to the use of all illegal growth promoting <Col N="1467" /> substances. I agree with Senator Raftery that we are dealing with a much more insidious element than hormone growth promoters. I have called repeatedly at Council of Ministers' meetings for a harmonised approach, and I want other member states to introduce measures as stringent as those I have introduced here. I am glad to put on the record for the first time, that the Commissioner for Agriculture has in recent days indicated that he proposes to take these measures on board in the European Community.</P>
      <P>Our legislation now provides the following measures: a total prohibition on the manufacture, importation, sale and possession of prohibited substances; a ban on the use of prohibited substances in farm animals and the sale or processing of meat derived from an animal so treated with prohibited substances; powers for authorised officers to stop any vehicle going into any land or premises and search for or examine or test any animals, meat or meat product or anything believed to be a prohibited substance; search warrants to be obtained by authorised officers; the locking up of herds and meat pending further investigation and surrender of identity cards, and condemnation of meat or meat products containing residues. This is strong legislation by any standards. To ensure observance of the regulations I have stringent enforcement measures in place and over 400 officers are authorised to enforce them. Veterinary inspectors at slaughtering facilities are empowered, on suspicion, to detain and take a sample from any animal or of meat and if the use of illegal substances is confirmed to condemn such animals or meat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be recognised that we have a uniquely comprehensive meat inspection service. Last November I launched an intensive campaign to counteract any drift towards the use of beta-agonists. I assembled a special team of officers to devote their full time attention to this <Col N="1468" /> duty and to carry out on-farm inspections. I think I will have the agreement of this House if I ask specifically that we no longer use the euphemism &ldquo;angel dust&rdquo;. If we are to use any term let us describe it for what it is &mdash; demon dust, devil dust, but certainly not angel dust.</P>
    <P>So far 100 herds have been tested and results to date have shown that 17 herd owners will be prosecuted. The activities of the squad have been broadened to deal with the use of all illegal growth promoters and to cover vanmen, retail outlets, and other distribution points as well as farmers. To date 26 raids of this kind have taken place. There have been some notable successes in seizures of illegal substances and I believe we are making good progress in disrupting the supply of these substances. This campaign will be continued. At present there is a strong body of legislation and resources are being devoted on the ground to enforcement. Again I agree with Senator Raftery, I wish it were not so and that we could use those resources for more positive effect, but I am determined to go ahead with this measure. Liaison between Customs and Excise officers and the Garda Síochána has been strengthened and is working well. While the legislation is strong, very soon I will introduce further legislation to make all members of the Garda Síochána fully authorised officers and to give them additional powers to investigate suspected breaches of the regulations.</P>
    <P>Regulations are also at an advanced stage of preparation to require all sellers of veterinary medicines to be licensed and thus completely outlaw sales by vanmen. I will introduce legislation also to make offences in this area indictable and thereby make penalties even more prohibitive.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that this action I have taken has generated adverse reaction in the foreign media particularly and that we do not appear to be getting credit for tackling the problem head on. In other words, our actions are sometimes distorted and <Col N="1469" /> misrepresented as evidence that there is a problem here on the ground that does not exist elsewhere, which, of course, is blatantly untrue. The reality is that we have reacted quickly to the appearance of these new substances and tests have been developed and perfected. Laboratory facilities have been made available and I intend to persist with this effort. We are continuously improving our tests and work is in progress on developing further tests.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have only found a small number of proven abuses out of specially targeted herds indicates that any problems we have are less than has been suggested in public. Responsibility for this problem should be laid firmly where it belongs. It rests with those unscrupulous people who want to make a quick buck from the importation and distribution of these substances. It rests with those farmers who are so greedy and foolish as to think that somehow these substances will make beef production more profitable. Ultimately, it is their own industry and their own livelihood which they are playing with. There is only so much that any Minister or any Department can do in terms of enforcement and prevention. I am prepared to take my powers to the very limit. However, I need the active support of the beef industry generally in getting on top of this problem and I know that the representative organisations condemn the use of these substances.</P>
    <P>In my view it is time for the industry, and the farming community generally, to work more actively against their use. There is no reason why any farmer found to be using these illegal substances should be allowed to retain his membership of any bona fide farming organisation and the same would apply in respect of any sector of the beef industry whose buyers or otherwise were found to be using this. I call upon all sectors of the industry not only to isolate but to ostracise from any contact with the rest people who are using these illegal substances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1470" /> There is a myth &mdash; I have to say this because Senator Raftery has made this point &mdash; that if we allow the use of hormones, though that is against the European law and we have to face the reality, we would not have the problems we face today. This argument must be rejected as nonsense because the European Community directive banning hormones was adopted in response to concern on the part of the public. Senator Raftery can say the Commission should not have reacted to that, but if he listens to the views of the German and Dutch consumers and their Ministers expressed even after the implementation of the ban, he would recognise that other element having regard to the fact that it is necessary for a country such as ours which is dependent on food exports to be in a position to give those assurances.</P>
    <P>One of the strongest selling points of our beef is its image as a wholesome, natural food product. It is up to us to capitalise on the fact that we can offer such a product and derive a trading advantage from it. Our ban on the use of hormones is a measure which faces up to the facts of marketing. Those who object and protest are ignoring the reality of the market place, but the problem of illegal use of growth promoters does not need legislation to cure it. It is a problem which can be eliminated overnight if the will is there. If those in the beef industry who would use or advocate the use of these substances would accept that there is only one future for the industry &mdash; the path of quality &mdash; and have nothing more to do with those substances, then the problem is solved now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Raftery</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important topic and I thank the Minister for his contribution. If the consumer has not got the choice, then the Minister has no way of knowing what the consumer wants. The British Consumers' Association do not agree with the ban. I have a paper, and I can produce a copy of it, to prove <Col N="1471" /> the point. The Danish Minister for Agriculture who was in the Council of Ministers at the time said it was a mistake and it should have been changed. The former President of BEUC, Mrs. Spederfeldt, whom I have spoken to, has now changed her mind and said that it is a problem and we will have to deal with it as it is dealt with in the US.</P>
      <P>There is one further point which is going to cause problems. Farmers found to be in possession of animals that have been treated may well have bought them not knowing that they had been treated. How are we to deal with that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the legal process. It is a matter that legal procedures will allow, if a person can clearly demonstrate that he did not know. I am not going to anticipate this. If he was not aware at any time or did not have the necessary <i>mens rea</i>, guilty intent, then I imagine that matter can be dealt with in law. As far as the consumer is concerned, our strongest selling point in the markets when there is a downturn in the consumption of beef is that nobody can produce a grass-based product in a natural process to compete with us. That commands a premium price for our produce in Germany, Holland and other countries. That is the strength we have to play to.</P>

      <P>It is not for me. The law is there on a European basis. It is not <Col N="1472" /> a valid argument that if one substance is illegal under European law that is somehow an explanation for introducing an even more insidious substance. I could not allow that that should be the standard which would be applied in the most important sector in our economy. There are no orders of illegality. What is illegal is illegal.</P>

      <P>If the Commission decide to introduce proposals to change the ban on hormones, then that is an issue we can address at the Council of Ministers. Until such time as that is done, what is illegal is illegal and we must adhere to that. I do not want any notion to get across that that is the only reason farmers or the beef industry are forced to use this insidious drug in the manner in which it is being used.</P>
      <P>I look forward to very early and effective action in the legal procedures and I want to assure the House that I will continue to do all possible in the face of what I acknowledge to be a very difficult task. The people who have the answer are those who are promoting it, selling it, using it and encouraging its use. It is not a virus, it is not a BSE; it is a deliberate decision on the part of unscrupulous people who care not a damn for the interests of this industry or for the economy.</P>
