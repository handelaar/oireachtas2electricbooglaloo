      <P>I have notice from Senator Pól Ó Foighil that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>Chun a fhiafraí den Aire Comhshaoil an mbeadh sé sásta leasú caoi a chur i gcrích lena chinntiú nach bhféadfaí cearta vótála a bhaint go héagórach de shaoránach cáilithe i bhfianaise a tharla i gceantar Charna i mbliana nuair a baineadh breis is 200 ainm de liosta na gClár Toghthóirí go mí-dhleathach.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Neville of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education to fulfil her commitment to construct a second level school at Rathkeale, County Limerick.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, in conjunction with CIE authorities, to review the security on the DART following recent incidents and to review security at the various DART stations.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Raftery of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="678" /> The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to take effective measures to prevent the use of illegal drugs in beef production in order to protect our beef sales.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Ross of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to outline the criteria used in the distribution of national lottery funds.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Naughten of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to improve the level of hygiene in schools.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment to provide financial assistance to the Kerry County Council as a result of strom damage to the north Kerry coast, in particular, Ballybunion Golf Club.</P>
    <P>I also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Taoiseach as Minister with responsibility for the Arts to personally intervene to prevent further deterioration in the condition of a building listed for preservation, No. 7 Bachelors Walk, Dublin 1.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Ó Foighil, Neville, Cosgrave, Raftery, Ross, Naughten and Dan Kiely as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senator Ó Foighil's matter and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Neville, Cosgrave, Raftery, Ross, Naughten and Kiely may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>
    <P>I regret that I have to rule the matter raised by Senator Norris is not suitable for discussion on the Adjournment on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, item No. 2 on the Order Paper, until 6 p.m.  There will be a sos from 6 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  We will take Motion 26 on the supplementary list, the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill has 109 sections, it has six Parts and two Schedules.  At the moment we have 232 amendments; in fact, amendments were being received up to 5.30 p.m. yesterday. I am very pleased with the response of Senators in regard to this Bill.  We had over 40 speakers on Second Stage, an indication of great interest in the Bill by Senators.  I have asked the Whips to meet this evening to arrange for a further structuring of the procedures regarding Committee Stage of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="680" />
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, may I ask the Leader of the House if he would grant today, or at the latest tomorrow, an emergency debate on the situation as if affects the Kurds in Iraq?  I realise there is an item on the Supplement to the Order Paper, Motion 44, but what I propose would subsume that and go much further and take into account the degree of aid from this country and also the need for us to take a leading role in trying to devise some way in which the Kurdish people can live in safety and security.  I urgently ask the Leader of the House to see if he can grant time today, or first thing tomorrow, for that debate.</P>
      <P>Also, arising from that, I ask the Leader of the House if he could report on the progress made towards the establishment of a committee on foreign affairs.  It is a strange situation that enormous changes are being made in our status in Europe without being debated in this House.  I know there is all-party support for it and many Senators, including Senator Tras Honan on the other side, have spoken out strongly on this matter in the past.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the House, in a very helpful mood at the end of the last session, promised us a debate on Northern Ireland.  I would like now to press him for a specific commitment to that debate. It is important we have it early so that our Government, taking part in the negotiations, will be seen to have as wide and broad a degree of public support as possible.</P>
      <P>Finally, I ask the Leader of the House if he could fairly briefly indicate the business he proposes to take this session, the major Bills he expects to bring in this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the images that have been hitting us on our television screens over the past number of days regarding the devastation, poverty and deaths of the Kurdish people would prompt any Member of the House to support the call for an emergency debate on the situation in Kurdistan.  I certainly <Col N="681" /> wish to add my voice to the call for a debate on the situation.</P>
      <P>I would also raise with the Leader of the House an issue which has been raised on a number of occasions by different Members during the recess, that is, the fact that it is time to have a look at the operations of this House itself.  I also ask the Leader of the House if he will make time available for a discussion on the relevance and the representation in this House.  Many Members have made comments on it.  It is time we extended the franchise to graduates of all third level institutions, for instance, in the case of the University Senators, but also that we extend the franchise beyond the local county councillors and urban councillors in the other areas of election to the Seanad so that people in different areas of life, be it fisheries, agriculture, labour, education or whatever, would have themselves or their representatives voting and that all the people would be represented in the second House as well.</P>
      <P>Finally, I ask the Leader of the House if he will honour the commitment he gave to me last term, and indeed previous to that, that we would have a debate on education at least on one day per session. I know that was raised with the Minister for Education and that she indicated her agreement to it.  It is now clear that education is a crucial issue politically and socially and I request the Leader of the House to make available, as promised, time for a debate as soon as possible. Certainly, education has been in the news over the past number of weeks.  It is now time to address politically the issues which were considered during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice in support for the calls for a debate on the Kurds. Also, I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for a debate on broadcasting in view of the difficulties which are at present being experienced at the national independent broadcasting company, namely, Century Radio.  Finally, I ask the Leader if he has any matters to report to us on the question of the reform of the procedures of the House, <Col N="682" /> particularly matters relating to how the Order of Business is conducted.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it is proposed to publish the Local Government Reform Bill.  It is a long awaited piece of legislation, particularly by everyone in local government.  I would like to ask the Leader if it is proposed to publish it in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the question of a debate on the situation of the Kurds will be supported by all sides without any problem whatever.  I am a little concerned, however, about the question of the debate on the north of Ireland, not so much about leaving a debate but on the nature of that debate.  I do not think we should have a blanket-type agreement and a debate taking place while talks are going on.  There is the problem of the verbal message and how it can get out of hand.  I ask the Leader of the House to <Col N="683" /> think about how the debate should be structured.  We should not do it in a way that would jeopardise in any way the talks that are going on at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>To follow the people who have looked for a debate on the Kurdish situation, when we are looking for a debate on that matter we should not forget that there is another minority in Iraq who are being subjected to the same type of genocide as the Kurds.  That is the Shi'ite minority in the south.  We should address, not alone the problems inside Iraq related to the Kurdish minority, but also those relating to the Shi'ite minority. We should not forget either that the United Nations are not blameless in this matter.  They were fast enough to act when Iraq invaded Kuwait but they have been very slow to react to the genocide that is taking place inside Iraq at present. If we are having a debate here, we should not forget the people who gave encouragement to the Shi'ites and to the Kurdish minorities to rise up.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House, as a result of the decisions taken in the European Court which were announced this morning in relation to section 31, if he is happy that section 31 should continue.  I feel it should be continued as long as the people who are barred from our airwaves have no concern for human rights at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very doubtful if that is appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very harrowing scenes we have all witnessed and which have been referred to already in this House with regard to the Kurdish problem in northern Iraq, we support the call for a debate on this issue.  Indeed, it is a matter of some urgency.  We question why the world is so slow to react to the great human tragedy that is occurring there.  Ireland has a role, indeed a leading role, to play in a European sense in responding to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, since this Seanad began I <Col N="684" /> have been asking the Leader of the House for information with regard to the formation of a committee on foreign affairs. My question was always in two parts: (1) when will that committee be formed; and (2) that all the Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas be represented on that committee.  I want to ensure that Senators are represented on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise with the Leader of the House item 1 on the Order Paper, which I have been raising since last November.  I refer to The Altamount (Amendment of Deed of Trust) Bill, 1990.  You will recall the Leader of the House promised us in December that, subject to getting an adequate explanatory memorandum from the solicitor involved, progress would be made in that regard in January.  My understanding is that the solicitor in question in Castlebar submitted very adequate memoranda to the Leader of the House in that regard and I am disappointed it has not been dealt with so far.  But, given that this is the last term in this year of the Oireachtas, I will seek an assurance from the Leader of the House that this matter will be dealt with fairly soon.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I would like to compliment the Government on announcing the proposal to establish a foreign affairs committee.  I join with my colleagues in this House in urging that that committee be established as soon as possible and that the Seanad be adequately represented in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrasHonan" hpid="Mrs. Honan Mrs. Honan">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Honan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support Senator Manning, the Leader of the Opposition, in asking for more discussion on European affairs in this House.  That is the road I have gone down for a long number of years and I also want to make sure there is Seanad representation on this famous foreign affairs committee when it is set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I comment on a remark of my colleague, Senator O'Toole.  He said there was much discussion on reforming this House and the way it works and he went on live television or radio and said they were the only properly elected <Col N="685" /> people in this House.  Let me tell Senator O'Toole; we are the people who are properly elected, you are elected by paper cumainn.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>With your indulgence, Chathaoirligh, I do not believe we represent paper boroughs.  There are 20,000 voters in the University of Dublin constituency and 75,000 in the National University of Ireland constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not appropriate to the Order of Business.  The remarks of Senator Honan were not intended to invite you into this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid Senator Honan cannot help being inviting.  I would like, first, to welcome the fact that the Government are taking Motion 26 about Dublin's period as European City of Culture as their motion this evening.  The Leader of the House will recall I asked this very question I think on the last day of the last session.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise two items if I may and I think they will be non-contentious. One is the question of a foreign affairs committee and I add my support in regard to this item.  I believe everybody would like to have a foreign affairs committee. Senators will note that Motion 11 in my name and that of my colleague Senator Ross is very detailed and very specific in dealing with the establishment of just such a committee.  If there is such general universal clamour for this foreign affairs committee perhaps the Leader of the House will give time for this debate or one like it because It is most important that the Seanad should make its contribution towards the composition of such a committee before it is established.  I think it is also important because we have today two demonstrations, one dealing with Tibet and one dealing with Kampuchea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Your question is always relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>My final question is a proposal for an amendment to the Order of <Col N="686" /> Business which, however, I will not press if the Leader of the House gives a satisfactory reply.  Senators will also notice that, with Senator Costello, I have tabled a motion on the plight of the Iraqi Kurds and requiring the Government to instruct our representative at the United Nations to raise this matter in that forum.  I believe I may have a seconder for this in Senator O'Toole and I will listen with interest to the reply of the Leader of the House on this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. S. Haughey Mr. S. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I would like to put on record my sincere thanks to the Leader of the House for taking this evening the motion dealing with Dublin becoming European City of Culture.  Obviously it is a tremendous year for Dublin and there are communities throughout the city bringing forward realistic art programmes to celebrate this great event.  I would like to thank the Leader for arranging to take that motion.  We are looking forward to a very successful year.  May I ask the Leader if it is known at this stage if the Minister will be replying this evening or next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader of the House when it will be possible to have the urgent debate on the Middle East as called for by Senator Manning.  I believe that our people are horrified at what we see on the television and, therefore, it is appropriate that we should have an early discussion and a message from the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the House on the situation to clearly identify in what way people here can be most helpful to aid the Kurdish population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to support the proposal by Senator Manning that we have a debate on the Kurdish problem. As my colleagues have said, we are all appalled at the atrocities that are taking place.  It has been brought to us very clearly on our television screens.  I believe that the United Nations and the world at large are turning a blind eye to what is happening.  As a member of the board of <Col N="687" /> directors of the Irish Refugee Association, which is a registered charitable association that deals with these international problems and is affiliated to the International Refugee Association and the United Nations High Commission, I believe we should be allowed to state what we feel the world should do and that modern technology should protect people rather than destroy them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Leader if he can assure the House that he will give adequate time for discussion on the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  There are 109 sections and 333 amendments and I ask the Leader of the House to give an assurance that the Bill will not be guillotined through the House.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I would like to ask the Leader when the Local Government Reform Bill will be introduced and if it will be introduced in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, am interested to know when the Local Government Reform Bill will come before this House, and indeed if it will be initiated here.  We must remember the majority of Members of this House are elected by local representatives and, therefore, local government reform must be considered a great priority here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern of Senators about the Kurdish situation underlines once again the need for the rapid establishment of a foreign affairs committee.  It is interesting that this is now the universal feeling right across the House.  We will be glad to have news from the Leader of the House on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also suggest that the time is opportune for a debate on the South African situation?  It is about a year since the House debated South Africa on the return of Senator Ross and myself from visiting that country.  Since then there has been a dramatic change in attitudes towards sanctions and so on, particularly in recent weeks.  We will also have the historic visit of President De Klerk here. I think, therefore, that would be an <Col N="688" /> opportune time for such a debate and perhaps the House will have an opportunity next week to recognise the presence of President De Klerk in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to join with Senator Manning in his request to the Leader of the House for a debate on the North of Ireland.  The matter has been raised on a number of occasions.  It is proper that this House should debate the problems and the affairs of the North rather than having wide discussions taking place outside and reported on the British media, which have a slant on the problems and on the Government's attitude. I think it has reached the stage now that some of our partners in Government feel it necessary to comment outside Government.  In my opinion this House could make a valuable contribution and, therefore, I ask the Leader of the House to accede to Senator Manning's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>Adding my voice to others urging reform of the Seanad, I would like to ask the Leader what is the present situation regarding the extension of Seanad voting rights to the University of Limerick, to Dublin City University and to other relevant third level institutions.  I have been raising this for some time.  It is an immediate reform that can be undertaken because those institutions are discriminated against as things stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other speakers in supporting the plea for a debate on the appalling situation in Iraq. The terrible tragedy on the Turkish and Iranian borders leaves everybody absolutely flabbergast.  Of course, the difficulty is that the cause of all that misery still exists and that is why I am rather surprised that people who were so vociferous in their condemnation of the United Nations in the first instance are very silent now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a motion down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyMcKenna" hpid="Mr. McKenna Mr. McKenna">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McKenna</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity <Col N="689" /> to compliment the Irish nation on their magnanimity once again.  They have made an absolutely magnificent contribution to help the people there.  We must acknowledge that the Irish nation has again contributed per head of population far more than any other nation in the world and I would like to put that on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As a co-signatory to Motion 44 I second the proposal by Senator Norris that we deal with this item first on the Order of Business.  We would certainly be prepared, considering the extent of unanimity on the issue, to take on board the suggestion by Senator Lanigan that it be extended to cover the Shi'ite Muslims.  Because we have seen the appalling atrocities taking place in Iraq, we would like to see the same urgency applied to resolving the situation there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must ask the Senator to ask a question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the Kurds as has been shown by the United Nations in relation to Kuwait.  We would appreciate it if the Leader of the House would be prepared to accept that as an amendment to the Order of Business or, if not, that he would indicate at very short notice when that might be discussed.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I am glad to see that Motion 44 has been put down as a Private Members' motion by Fianna Fáil.  I hope the Minister will not reply this evening, as suggested by Senator Haughey, but that he will wait until the entire debate has taken place.  I certainly will have a few things to say about the manner in which the cultural year has been used and the extent to which the Government have applied themselves to ensure that Dublin is a city of culture.  I am not so sure that has been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I ask the Leader of the House if he will indicate to us the programme for the coming session particularly in relation to the items on which we have got a certain degree of commitment in terms of debate on education, prisons and <Col N="690" /> Northern Ireland.  These are matters that have been raised before.  I wonder if the Leader of the House would indicate what timescale he has in mind for those debates in the near future.</P>
    <P>Finally, may I ask whether the Leader of the House has any further thoughts of us in terms of the rescheduling of the work of the House so that current issues, like the matter we raised today regarding the Kurds or the demonstration outside the gates at the moment in relation to the Dalai Lama and Tibet, or the issue of Century Radio and the sacking of its senior journalists&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking the Leader of the House if, considering the discussions we have had on this issue already, current affairs can be incorporated into the schedule of activities of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats join with colleagues on all sides of the House in urgently asking the Leader of the House to make time available for a debate on the appalling tragedy of the Kurds on the borders of Iraq, Turkey and Iran.  We can only wonder how the world can be so quick to respond when it comes to killing people and so slow to respond when it comes to saving their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a separate issue which has not been raised, may I ask the Leader of the House if he intends to make time available for a debate on European political and monetary union?  We debated this earlier in the year, but there has been considerable progress since: it seems in particular that there has been movement in Britain towards greater political union within Europe and that is to be welcomed.  Perhaps Fine Gael, now that they have joined forces with the British Tory Party in the European Parliament, can elucidate what the British situation might be. I join in the calls for a foreign affairs <Col N="691" /> committee and I think the European political and monetary union debate could be worked in within that context.</P>
    <P>My final question to the Leader of the House is: does he have any information as to when we may have the Competition Bill before Seanad Éireann as it will be important legislation to protect the consumer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="DesHanafin" hpid="Mr. Hanafin Mr. Hanafin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hanafin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for an urgent debate on the situation that exists on the Turkish-Iran-Iraq borders at present in relation to the Kurdish people. Some years ago, people claimed they did not know what was happening in Nazi Germany when the Jews were persecuted. No-one can claim that as an excuse any more because we see what is happening on our television screens every night. People claimed they did not know what was happening in Germany, that there was such evil persecution and there is a generation who refuse to believe that persecution ever happened but it did.  It is happening now in Iraq.  The root of the problem lies with the leader of the Iraqi people and until such time as he is removed from office that evil will exist in Iraq.</P>
      <P>I would support the call for a debate by Senator Jackman to allow graduates from Limerick University and other third level institutions to vote in Seanad elections. Graduates from Limerick and other third level institutions have an equal right as graduates from Trinity and the National University of Ireland.</P>

I ask the Leader of the House to consider having a wide-ranging debate on the problems and the famine facing the people in the Horn of Africa.

When will the Competition Bill be introduced?  Will the Leader convey to the Minister the fact that his announcement during the week was welcome.  The Bill is overdue and I hope the legislation will be initiated in this House as happened in the case of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill.  There is a possibility that a competitor will take over that factory in Drumshambo &mdash; one example <Col N="698" /> of many&mdash;and that the jobs of the people in my part of the country could be put at risk.

      <P>I do not propose to mention each Senator individually in reply to many of the queries that have been raised.  At the start of this new session which I anticipate will last for about 14 to 15 weeks, I reiterate what I said previously, legislation will continue to be a priority of the House.  However, that does not mean that from time to time we cannot have debates on important issues of national and international importance. I am open to suggestions on debates of that type but that does not mean we will have a debate on whatever is the flavour of the week or the flavour of the day. I would have to think seriously before having such a debate.</P>
      <P>The question raised by the majority of Senators was in relation to a debate on the Kurds and I fully understand why we have had so many requests for a debate on this problem.  It is impossible not to feel anger and horror at the magnitude of the human catastrophe we see on our televisions and read about in our papers. I am very anxious that this House debate the matter.  I anticipated this reaction from Senators for a debate and I had one almost arranged for next Wednesday but, unfortunately, at the last moment I got a call to say the Minister may not be available.  However, I will discuss the matter with the Whips and I assure the House I will have a debate as quickly as possible on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Manning, among others, raised the question of a foreign affairs committee.  My information in regard to that matter is that it will be established during the current session.  I have expressed a wish that there should be <Col N="699" /> Seanad representation on that committee. I hope that will be the case.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan and others raised the question of Northern Ireland and asked for a debate on it now or in the near future.  It would be inappropriate for the Seanad to debate this tragic problem at this time in view of the new initiative to establish dialogue in the North.  It is very early days yet but I live in hope of successful talks which will bring about a lasting peace in the North.  I know that view is shared by all Senators.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning also asked, as did others, about the programme for the session ahead.  It will be a lively and interesting session.  There is plenty of legislation &mdash; the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Bill, Educational Exchange Bill &mdash; that is the exchange between Ireland and the United States of America &mdash; the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Bill, the Finance Bill, which must be passed by the end of May, the Sea Pollution Bill, the Criminal Damage Bill, the Fisheries (Amendment) Bill, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill &mdash; which we have presently and which will occupy a great deal of time &mdash; the Child Care Bill, Committee and remaining Stages.  In reply to Senator O'Donovan, the Recognition of Foreign Adoptions Bill will be with us this session. We will also be taking the Competition Bill.  Unfortunately, it has been issued in green form, which means that it will be a Dáil Bill and we will not get it first.  Bills that are not published but which I know will come before us, include the Family Planning Bill and the Local Government Bill.  Many Senators had queries about the Local Government Bill.  The aim is to have it published this month and to have it completed before the end of May. There are other Bills which have not been published &mdash; the Roads Bill and Parents Bill.  We have a Bill which the Minister for Labour indicated will be initiated here, the Payment of Wages Bill.  Many other Bills, the amendment of the Health Act Bill, the Solicitors Bill, the Oireachtas Bill, the University of Limerick Bill and the Dublin Institute of <Col N="700" /> Technology Colleges Bill are all in the pipeline.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole and others asked about reform of the Seanad.  This is an ongoing process.  It is more appropriate that it be further debated, as it is from time to time, by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and all the points made by Senators taken on board. He asked for a debate per session on education.  I discussed the matter recently with the Minister for Education and she said how anxious she was to come to the House for such a debate.  That debate will take place possibly within the next three or four weeks.</P>
    <P>Senators Upton and Cassidy referred to local government reform.  Senator O'Reilly raised queries which were not relevant to the Order of Business.  I have noted what Senator Harte, the wise owl of the House, said about Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan referred to the Kurds. I note what he said in regard to section 31.  Senator Cullen referred to the Kurds and the committee on foreign affairs. Senator Staunton asked about item No. 1.  As Senator Staunton knows, item No. 1 is a Private Business matter.  I indicated to the parliamentary agent before Easter that we would not take it before Easter.  We are now in a new session and I will give it some consideration to see if we can move it a stage further.</P>
    <P>Senator Honan asked for more debate on Europe.  She also referred to paper cumann, something I could not fully understand.  Senator Norris welcomed item No. 26, as did Senator Haughey.</P>

As I said, the proposal is that the Whips will meet this evening and go <Col N="701" /> through a proper structure for an organised way of going forward with Committee Stage of this Bill.  Senator Finneran asked about local government. Senator Murphy asked about a debate on South Africa, as did some other speakers. I have no proposal at this stage in regard to that matter.  Senator Jackman raised the issue of reform of the Seanad and that is something that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should discuss. Senator Costello asked for a programme for the new session.  He seems to suggest that every current issue should be discussed. Unfortunately, that is not the situation.  We have procedures and I have to live within them and within the structures available to me, a point fairly and squarely made by Senator Ross.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis asked about a debate on European political union, something I will consider.  He also inquired about the Competition Bill.  I have explained the position in regard to that.  Senator Kennedy asked about a debate on health. I have no proposals for that at this time. Senator Ross asked about a debate on South Africa.  I have no proposals for such a debate.  Senator Kiely asked about a debate on the role of the IDA.  I have no proposals on that matter.  Senator Doyle asked for a report on the committee. She is a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and should ask questions there.  There were also requests for a debate on agriculture.  We had a detailed debate on agriculture.  I accept that the position changes from time to time.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food, when he was in this House before Easter, went out of his way to explain the problems in agriculture and spoke for an hour at least without a script.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, lines 17 and 18, to delete &ldquo;the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1990&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the Pollution Control Act, 1991&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Our Members on the Independent benches and all Members of the House are pleased by the signals from the Minister of State that she will be prepared to accept amendments to this Bill.  That is a very welcome move by the Minister and I hope that when this Bill finally gets through the House, hopefully before the summer, it will be a greatly improved Bill and that it will follow the precedent set by the Companies' Bill, the Clinical Trials Bill and other Bills which have gone to the Dáil massively changed but greatly improved.  I hope we will see this first amendment of 330 amendments being considered seriously by the House and illustrating that the Seanad is doing an effective job in amending the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose this amendment to change the citation and, therefore, the Long Title of the Bill in response to submissions I have received, as I am sure have many other Senators, from such environmental groups as An Taisce, the Cork Environmental Alliance and other concerned groups who gave serious consideration to this Bill.  The reason for the amendment is that the Bill does not indicate in its present Title that there is much of unfinished business to be done regarding the protection of the environment. The impression might be received from this Bill that it was an all-purpose Bill which would effectively protect the environment and prevent pollution. I want to change the name of the Bill to the Pollution Control Act, 1991. That in the main is what this Bill is doing, <Col N="704" /> and that title would reflect the functions of the Environmental Protection Agency which we are setting up under this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency Bill, as it is known for short, is a Bill which is committed to pollution control. The main functions, purpose and effect of this Bill will be the control of pollution in Ireland, not, as the Title says, the absolute protection of the environment in Ireland.  Many submissions which I have received, particularly from An Taisce pointed out that one of the primary principles of environmental protection is the prevention of pollution which this Bill fails to tackle.</P>
    <P>I do not wish the Minister or anybody else to think that in trying to amend this Bill, or in criticising the Title, that I am in any way opposed to the Bill.  It is an extraordinarily good Bill, one of the best pieces of legislation which we have been privileged to consider in this House.  The Bill concentrates, especially in its later parts, on the regulation, licensing and control of pollution.  What it is, reflecting the general philosophy which runs through this Bill, is a damage limitation Bill.  It indicates that the Government and the House accept that a certain level of pollution is acceptable and inevitable. That is an assumption which we should question by changing the Title of the Bill to reflect what the Bill does.  The Bill does not attack or concentrate the causes of pollution; what it attacks are the symptoms. It is known in environmental terms as the end of pipe philosophy, maintaining that there is a certain acceptable level of pollution which should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It should be changed <Col N="705" /> because it does not tackle the clean production principle which should permeate industrial production in Ireland and elsewhere. This proposal is not only coming from me but from environmental groups who are very concerned and who have made submissions which the Fianna Fáil benches who are attempting to interrupt now will have received as well; probably none of them will have read these submissions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>That's pure coincidence, as you know I want to point out that in the Schedule to the Bill, where the powers to grant licences are given to the Environmental Protection Agency, we are dealing with processes which the agency should be attaching rather than confining itself to the control of pollution.  Instead of acting as a Pollution Control Bill as it does, the Bill should be stopping the sort of activities that are named in the Schedule, such as waste incineration and asbestos processing.  It is in that area that the Title to the Bill is inadequate because the Title gives an incorrect impression, that the Environmental Protection Agency will be able to prevent pollution.  That is not so, and to call it a Pollution Control Bill would reflect what is contained in the <Col N="708" /> First Schedule, the powers of the agency and the very good work which the agency is going to do.</P>
      <P>I would like to change the name of the Bill in order to remind future generations that this business is unfinished, the environment is not protected by this Bill but pollution has been controlled.  This Title change would reflect the great work which the Minister has put into this Bill. We should not sit back and say that this is the final word in environmental protection.</P>

      <P>I would question and oppose the amendment as put forward by Senator Ross.  His name for the Bill would narrow the perception of the Bill. If he reads the explanatory memorandum that accompanied the Bill he will see that control and regulation are but one area covered by the Bill.  There is provision for a general monitoring of environmental quality and for support and back-up and an advisory service to the public authorities. There is provision for the promotion and co-ordination of environmental research.  To call the Bill a Pollution Control Bill would narrow the whole concept of it.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross stated that pollution is out of control.  I would not accept that. There is a general perception that Ireland has an excellent environment.  If such a Bill was being promoted in certain other European countries then I could see how the level of pollution there would justify the name he wants for the Bill.  We are talking about the protection of what we already enjoy.  The Title of the Bill is excellent.  I want to compliment the Minister on it and to welcome her to the House.  Obviously when this Bill was being thought out by the Government they were conscious that it was the intention of this Bill to protect what we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for moving the amendment. The Title of legislation should reflect the purpose of the Bill which is, in this case, to effect major institutional change in how environmental protection <Col N="709" /> legislation is implemented and how environmental standards are reflected. Senator Ross believes that the Bill should not be a Pollution Control Bill, which I would argue very strongly that it is not, but should be an Environmental Protection Agency Bill and yet he seeks to make it a Pollution Control Bill.  I do not understand how somebody who wants to broaden the scope of the Bill is seeking to narrow it from the beginning.  I have never seen so many attempts before to move amendments to the Title of legislation and I have to question why this seems to be a new feature in our approach to legislation.  The Government are establishing this agency because there was a lot of public disquiet at perceived partiality in the way in which local and public authorities dealt with the licensing procedure, particularly as far as controversial developments were concerned.</P>
      <P>It is a fact of modern life that the licensing of certain activities is now very specialised and complex and requires a different approach, involving the employment of experts to deal with chemical companies, mining operations, pharmaceutical companies, the food industry and the various other activities listed in the First Schedule.  I believe that legislation should be easily understood by the lay person and if the Title of legislation does not explain its purpose readily then it is not going to be widely used. This will not be user-friendly legislation and many people will feel that it is not for them.</P>
      <P>We are trying to establish an agency which will be independent of the Government, of the local authorities and of vested interests.  We aim to set high standards and to enforce a new integrated licensing regime for certain classes of development.  I say to Senator Ross that the most effective way to control the discharge of pollutants into the atmosphere, or into the water, is to set down very strict criteria when new or existing developments are being given permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is extremely important that this agency should have the function of operating an integrated licence.  If this Bill <Col N="710" /> were simply about bringing all the environmental protection legislation together as a Consolidation Bill then it might be appropriate to change the Title. But it is not.  It is concerned with the establishment of a new body comparable to what exists in the United States, in the Scandinavian countries and in the Netherlands.  The French are about to establish such an agency, as are the Australians.  It is the way modern environmental legislation is going to be enforced and this country should be ahead of the posse rather than waiting until everybody else has done it first. Therefore it would be very wrong indeed to limit the scope to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I received 50 submissions from various organisations in relation to this legislation. I held a one day seminar at which I met many organisations and nobody suggested that it should be called the pollution control agency.  Nobody, in any of the submissions I have received since the Bill was published, has asked me to change the Title.  I cannot agree with Senator Ross and I would think that rather than limiting the focus of the Bill he should deal with some of his other queries on particular Stages, for instance, when we are dealing with BATNEEC.</P>
    <P>Some of the comments he made are more appropriate to individual sections. I regret that I cannot accept this amendment; I will be accepting many amendments from all sides of the House and many of the amendments I put forward bear in mind what was said on Second Stage.  In all there are 330 amendments. The Government are anxious that this legislation should be through this House by summer and therefore I would ask everybody to co-operate.  I will be as receptive as possible and will accept any amendment that I sincerely believe, and that I am advised, will help in environmental protection and not narrow the scope of the Bill.</P>

      <P>On both of these amendments I think the Minister will have to change her response because far from narrowing the scope of the Bill, what I require is the Title to reflect what is in it. The Minister will be aware of having received submissions from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, from SIPTU and from various other professions who asked that the range of the Bill be broadened and my amendment reflects that, as do many of the other amendments I have put down.  I do not intend to make a long speech but to make the point which I will be elaborating upon later.</P>
      <P>The first proposal is one that limits the Bill.  The Long Title of the Bill makes clear that the legislation is to make further and better provision for the protection of the environment, to control pollution and to establish an environmental protection agency.  The establishment of this agency is the third issue in the Long Title of the Bill.  Both the amendments which I have proposed would have the effect of deleting the word &ldquo;protection&rdquo; or the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; and call it the Environment Protection Bill.</P>
      <P>I checked the position in the UK, which I am sure you know yourself, and the position in the US and I looked at some of the consolidated Bills which have been enacted in the US.  The name of the Bill in the UK is the Environmental Protection Bill.  The proposal I have before the House today is that it be referred to as the Environment Protection Bill which would reflect what is in the Bill.  The Bill does more than set up an agency.  It seeks to respond to many other needs, but I believe the Minister is not doing the Bill justice by this Title.  I thought the Title might well reflect the scope of the Bill.  I do not intend pushing it any further than that, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

I am delighted the Minister has made it quite clear to us that she will be doing so. We are talking about an Environmental Protection Agency Bill which is a Bill to protect the environment.  The Minister has said quite clearly that the Title should be simple and the scope of the Bill reflects the Title.  To change it, as Senator Ross proposed, to the Pollution Control Act, 1991 would weaken the aspirations of the Bill.</P>

It is impossible to legislate for emergencies no matter what you call the Bill but here we have a determined effort on the part of the Minister who is committed to doing something for the environment and we have, as a result, a massive Bill.  Senator Ross tried to suggest that this side of the House did not speak on the Bill; in fact about 80 or 90 per cent of this side spoke on Second Stage and will speak, I am sure, on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I could not accept Senator Ross' amendment that we rename the Bill the Pollution Control Act and I think the Minister is totally correct in leaving the Title of the Bill as stated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Ross got his way he would actually take away from what the Bill intends to do because, as I read it, it is for the purpose of environmental protection.  It is not a question of pollution protection, and does not read as such.  The agency itself will have to prepare, revise, revoke or approve codes of practice to protect the environment so, therefore, it does not seem consistent to change the name to pollution control. The Bill covers the broad aspects of environmental protection and that is the way it should be left.</P>

      <P>I oppose the amendment by Senator Ross.  I do not see the need for it at all.  I share Senator Ross' enthusiasm for the Bill and I congratuilate the Minister on her energy and determination in bringing it before Seanad Éireann.  We have heard about her openness in relation to all the bodies she has heard from and in listening to the representations that have been made and since none of those people wanted the Title of the Bill changed I do not see the need to change it.  To accept this amendment would restrict the scope of the Bill and that is not something that should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if some of the contributions we have heard today, as you remarked yourself, a Chathaoirligh, had more to do with factors outside the House than <Col N="714" /> within the House and I wonder how well we have conducted ourselves in those circumstances and how approving the public might be of the way in which we have demonstrated our relevance to life in general.  The Bill has enormous relevance for the country, and for the welfare of our tourism, farming and food industries and for that reason I am very happy to support it as it stands.  I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I found the discussion ragarding the Short Title useful and may I say a number of legal people have suggested to me that the Short Title could be changed and the Short Title in the UK is considerably different.  From reading the Short Title and the Long Title I support the view of Senator O'Toole and I would suggest that the Short Title should read The Environmental Protection Bill, 1990 because that summarises and crystalises the purpose of this Bill and does not delimit the essential role of the agency.  When we look at the 109 sections, at the six Parts and the two Schedules, we will see that Part II deals with the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
      <P>This is an excellent Bill.  I welcome all the principles and the ideals enshrined in it.  I think it is good for the environment, for the citizens, for industry and for agriculture. I am pleased the Minister of State has brought the environment to the top of the political agenda.  It is clear that environmental issues will feature very much in national and international debates.  If the Minister is open to suggestions I would like to suggest to her than a similar Bill was debated at considerable length in the House of Lords and in the House of Commons and they have an Environmental Protection Bill.  Various commissions in the UK, the United States and in other countries have examined these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we want simplicity then the Short Title should read: the &ldquo;Environmental Protection Agency Bill&rdquo; and, thereafter, the &ldquo;Environmental Protection Act&rdquo;.  It is important that we should look at the Long Title because there are four <Col N="715" /> points in that, first, to make better provision for the protection of the environment; secondly, to make provision for the control of pollution; thirdly, to set up the environmental protection agency and, fourthly, to provide for penalties and other related matters.  Therefore, the Minister should be open to my suggestion. Indeed, I have discussed this with a number of eminent lawyers who see the Title, the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, as being more appropriate. It is more than the setting up of an agency.  It is dealing with the global position.  We need not put the matter to a vote at this stage but on Report Stage the Minister and her officials might examine the Title of the Bill.  If she thinks it appropriate to amend it I hope we will have unanimity in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross has prompted a very worthwhile discussion.  His amendment is too limited and does not sum up what the Minister is trying to achieve.  I could not support the amendment.  It is a simple matter of deleting the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; and letting it stand as the Environmental Protection Bill, 1990.</P>
    <P>I join other Members in welcoming the Minister of State to the House and express to her and the Department of the Environment our appreciation of what they have done to promote the environment as an issue over the past number of years.</P>

      <P>I will be brief in my remarks.  As has already been mentioned, there are 333 amendments and I believe we all want to see this Bill become law as quickly as possible.  If we are to get through that number of amendments and if the Bill is to go through all Stages, <Col N="717" /> we will need to keep our contributions to a minimum and I hope to do that.</P>
      <P>If it is any comfort to Senator Ross, I checked this morning with An Taisce about his amendment.  I also got their suggestions and I read through them carefully. I noted that Senator Ross had taken many of his amendments from their suggestions and I wondered if they would support this amendment, but they said they would not support it for reasons which have already been stated.  We need to broaden the scope of the Bill and I hope that will happen.  I have some amendments down which I hope will help to do that.  Many of the 333 amendments endeavour to broaden the scope of the Bill so that it will not just deal with pollution control but instead do something much more positive about the environment. I will not be supporting the amendment.</P>
      <P>In regard to Senator O'Toole's amendment, taking out the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; and making it the &ldquo;Environmental Protection Bill&rdquo; may be the other extreme.  That might give the impression that this Bill, exclusively, will bring about environmental protection.  There are other Bills in existence already which play a part in this &mdash; planning Bills, fishery Bills, the Water Pollution Act and so on.  I am happy with the Title as it is.  Therefore, I will not be supporting any of the amendments.</P>

The title explains what the Bill is <Col N="718" /> about and I totally agree with the wording.

I only do this after considerable thought and having listened to the other contributions here. I ask the Minister to reflect on it.  We will not pursue it now but perhaps we could come back on Report Stage.  One reference to the Long Title of the Bill makes it obvious that the Bill before us is about far more than establishing an environmental protection agency.  It is doing that and that is its most important function, but it is much more than that.  I support Senator O'Toole's amendment to delete the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; so that it reads &ldquo;Environmental Protection Bill&rdquo;.  I refer Senators to section 108 which does not mention the Environmental Protection Agency at all.  It is a section that was tagged on to the Bill.  It concerns genetically modified organisms as if, with respect, somebody had a brainstorm; it was stuck in quickly so there would be some control if such organisms got loose in the laboratories of Ireland.  A very important section was shoved in but it is at the tail of the Bill.  There is no mention of an environmental protection agency in section 108.  It sits uncomfortably with the rest of the Bill.</P>

The Title is not a major issue.  We all know what we want to achieve but if one considers all the arguments that have been made and similar legislation in other countries &mdash; Senator Kennedy referred to the British Environmental Protection Act &mdash; and the very important job over and above the establishment of an agency the Bill purports to do, perhaps it would be more correct to drop the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;.

The establishment of the agency is the core of the Bill and it is vital that the Bill should retain the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.  I must disagree entirely with Senator Ross. To drop the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; immediately restricts and limits the Bill. The Bill must aspire to be as comprehensive as possible.</P>

If there are problems with the content of the Bill, it is those problems and the content that should be addressed and amended rather that putting the cart before the horse and changing the name of the Bill.  Senator Murphy spoke about the prospect of appearing on the television screens making people old; in many ways the whole experience today has made us all young.

If you take together the Short Title and the Long Title, which is a gloss on it, it appears to me to meet every argument that has been made here today. The short title is &ldquo;Environmental Protection Agency Bill, 1990&rdquo;; I will not read the Long Title into the record because it is already there and anybody who reads can see that it specifies the areas of anxiety Senators have spoken about.  I am tempted to use the colourful phrase of the late Brendan Behan, that it actually does not matter a fish's tit one way or the other what the thing is called as long as we now get on to discuss the substance of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for introducing this very fine Bill. Perhaps what we should have done at the outset was to add together the three <Col N="722" /> amendments and say something like the &ldquo;Pollution Control and Environmental Protection Agency Bill&rdquo;.  As a teacher, I am concerned about the grammar.  If we have an Environmental Protection Agency Bill, I see three nouns qualifying each other: protection &mdash; an abstract noun &mdash; agency, bill, and environmental. There is a second proposal that we change &ldquo;environmental&rdquo; to &ldquo;environment&rdquo;.  Perhaps we could add &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and have four nouns.

      <P>The meaningful question here is whether we have a grammatically correct Title.  I have some sympathy for Senator Ross's proposed amendment that the Bill is very substantially concerned with pollution control but it does not feature as such in the Bill, the point being that control is the issue of dealing with symptoms.  We are regulating matters, we are controlling matters, as distinct from stopping the process that requires the control.  That reflects much of what is in the Bill.  The ultimate purpose, of course, is the protection of the environment but much of the Bill and the explanatory memorandum is concerned with controlling, regulating and monitoring rather than any strong emphatic statement dealing with the causes that attack and destroy our environment.  It is difficult to see what this Bill can do to protect various areas of the environment like our heritage, the city of Dublin and to prevent the destruction that is taking place. The Bill controls waste, water and the soil, but in terms of protecting our heritage, or listed buildings, or dealing with our transport policy, which is interfering with our environment, it will do nothing. I sound a note of caution in relation to the Bill.  While there is no great advantage in <Col N="723" /> amending the Title, certainly what Senator Ross said reflects on the question of pollution control and much of what is covered by this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will respond to some of the comments made in relation to Senator O'Toole's amendment.  I distinguish between the two amendments although I am not happy to accept either.  Senator Ross's amendment is limiting in that he wants to limit the scope of the agency even though he argued for extending the scope.  He sought to limit it by way of the Title.  To omit the whole reference to the environment and to protection from the Title would be wrong.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator O'Toole's amendment, I accept that this has a different purpose but I do not accept that it is appropriate.  We sought to establish a new body to enforce and set high environmental standards to ensure that complex processes, and so on, which can pose a threat to the environment if something goes wrong will be monitored by an independent body.  If we were to drop the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; from the Bill we would confuse the public.  They would not readily know what this Bill is about.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not just about environmental protection.  It is not consolidating all the Environmental Protection Acts.  We still have the water, air and oil pollution legislation.  That is existing legislation in relation to waste and new legislation is to be introduced shortly in that area.  As Senator Hederman said, there is an extensive range of legislation in the whole area of planning which has a huge impact on environmental protection.  Therefore, it would be wrong to simply say that this is the Environmental Protection Bill. This Bill seeks to establish a new body to enforce the law, to set the standards and to do so on an independent basis.  That body should be acceptable and accessible to the public and carve out a distinctive image for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Government agreed to the establishment of this agency, I was keen that the Title would remain as simple as possible.  Many bodies were set up by the <Col N="724" /> Oireachtas and while I am very supportive of the Irish language sometimes those bodies become known by their Irish form and many people do not know exactly what they do, apart from the narrow range of people that use the particular body.  I do not want to instance names because people would accuse me of being anti that particular body, but it is important that as many people as possible are aware there is an agency available for them, that they should use it and find it accessible, particularly to get monitoring results and information generally.  Therefore, if we drop the word &ldquo;Agency&rdquo; we will confuse people since it is now acceptable to the public.  There has been public debate on this for a long time and it has taken some time to compile the legislation.  We would end up confusing the public.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle quoted from section 108.  With the exception of Part VI of the Bill, all the other Parts deal with the agency.  In Part VI we used the opportunity to do other things which are required. When the opportunity came to present legislation to the Oireachtas &mdash; it is difficult to get legislation together &mdash; we thought we would not miss the opportunity to bring into force certain matters we have to do anyway because of EC directives.  We used the opportunity to do that in a number of respects which otherwise we would have had to do by way of separate legislation.</P>
    <P>As Senator Murphy and other Senators said, the important aspect of this debate and what the agency will do, is the substance of the Bill.  At the end of the day, no matter what we argue about the Title, that will not change the powers one way or another.  We should now concentrate our efforts on the specific powers and functions of the agency.  I hope to accept amendments, as I said earlier, across the House because I want this agency to have widespread support.  If it is to be acceptable to the public it is important that it should command the support of all sides of the House.  The fact that there was no division on Second Stage is welcome, it shows that the principle of what we are doing is acceptable and I hope we will be <Col N="725" /> able to agree on the substance as we go through this Bill.</P>

      <P>I would like to reply to one or two matters raised on the other side of the House, not in the same personal vein, but sometimes I think people deliberately misinterpret things which are said in this House.  This amendment is not meant to limit the functions of the agency or the Bill in any sense nor would it limit the performance of the agency.  What it is meant to do is to reflect the general contents and thrust of the Bill.  Senator Honan asked where I got the idea for this amendment.  I will reply specifically, notwithstanding what Senator Hederman said about her own conversation with An Taisce this morning.  I got it from two sources, the Cork Environmental Alliance and An Taisce, the National Trust for Ireland.  I will read very briefly into the record, for the benefit of Senator Honan, what the submission says.  I quote:</P>
      <P>Before commenting on a complex piece of legislation of this nature, it is useful to examine what should be the basic legislative requirements for effective environmental protection.  In order to attain the objective of protecting the environment, public good and the quality of life, legislation should go beyond mere pollution control.</P>
      <P>It goes on in that vein.  On the assessment of the Environmental Protection Agency Bill, An Taisce is quite specific.  I am fallible and I do not necessarily spurn ideas from organisations expert in their own field.  In the second last paragraph of page two the submission states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Bill does contain some significant flaws, weaknesses and inconsistencies which could have the effect of making the proposed Environmental Protection Agency unable to carry out its functions effectively. There are conflicts with existing legislation (particularly in the fields of planning and environmental impact assessment) there is no right of appeal <Col N="726" /> from the Agency on technical or environmental issues, certain aspects of local democracy are weakened, and the Bill might be better described as a Pollution Control Bill rather than an Environmental Protection Bill.</P>
    <P>That is where I got my amendment from and that is why I put it down.  I do not know as much about the environment as the people of An Taisce but I accept, when they send me a submission of that sort, that the are doing it bona fide and that they are to be taken seriously. Having read that, I put down my amendment and I stand over that amendment. I understand the Minister's point of view and the point of view of many members of the House who feel it should stay as it is.  To question, as Senator Honan did, anybody's bona fides is reprehensible and I hope I have adequately answered that for the benefit of Senator Honan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly would not question Senator Ross's bona fides.  It is noticeable that he has a very considerable number of amendments down, many of which he has indicated he has taken from An Taisce.  I support the Minister when she says that the principle function is the establishment of an agency.  I do not think that we should waste too much time on it.  That is what this Bill does.  I will deal with the point raised by Senator Ross about the submission from An Taisce, which we all received.  It actually states that it would be better described as a Pollution Agency Bill.  It is the kind of polemic point they are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not alone that, but many of the amendments suggested by An Taisce, which Senator Ross has very wisely and appropriately put down, will have effect, if accepted by the Minister &mdash; and there are 339 amendments and they deal with precisely the questions that were read into the record by Senator Ross.  The Bill is not absolute yet.  It has not been passed by this House.  It has not even been introduced in the Dáil.  I believe that whatever little qualms might be raised at the moment about the status of the Bill in its present form these will be met when the <Col N="727" /> Bill has been refined as a result of passing through this House.</P>
    <P>My point is really that this is a commentary, making a polemic point that at this stage it might be described as a Pollution Control Bill, it might be better described as such, and so on.  But I do not actually think that is an invitation to us to call it that because An Taisce are saying this is a limitation.  The Bill could be improved in certain ways.  It seems to me to be paradoxical to take on board that point, then put down all the amendments and still require the change, because it is almost as if Senator Ross, most uncharacteristically, was anticipating defeat.</P>

I am not going to go into the arguments.  I would like to formally propose amendment No. 3 but not push it to a vote because, in light of the discussions right through Committee Stage, I would like to refer back to it on Report Stage and ask the Minister to consider it on the way through.  I have looked at the Titles of all the legislation on the environment in this country and other countries.  The Bill is much broader than an agency, but I am not going to go into those arguments again.  I am not clear how it is intended to take it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that. The only difference really is that my <Col N="729" /> amendment produces a definite date.  The general principle here is the itolerable delay in legislation generally.  I might instance two pieces of legislation which in different ways dragged their weary way through this House and afterwards.  The Marine Institute Bill took ages.  I remember also in regard to the Tobacco Act, even when it was enacted into law, asking the Minister, by way of an Adjournemnt Matter a year later, when it was proposed to bring the regulations into effect.  This really is intolerable.  I would think the Minister herself regards it as scandalous, because it is a central policy with the Progressive Democrats that the pace of legislation should be expedited.  Even within the last few weeks the spokes-people of the Progressive Democrats have again been saying how intolerable indefinite refusal to implement parliamentary reform will be for them.</P>
      <P>That is the general principal.  Theoretically, the process of bringing in this Bill could go on forever.  There is nothing in the Bill which introduces any sense of urgency.  The Minister can make one set of orders to bring legislation into force and then another order to establish the agency, another order to fix a date when the agency's licensing powers come into operation and, beyond that, a massive body of regulations to make the legislation fully effective.  The point of my amendment is to try to obviate this indefinite aspect of legislation.  A definite date would concentrate minds fearfully everywhere &mdash; within Government, within the Houses of the Oireachtas, within the Civil Service.  I suggest also, through the Chair, that if there is a promise at the outset that this will become law and become effective at a definite date, it will enhance the credibility of the legislation in the popular mind and, moreover, it will enhance the credibility of politicians and the whole political process.  This is a very important point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in my possession a letter written by the Minister's Department to a colleague of mine in which one of the aspects behind the legislation was discussed.  The last line of the letter from the Private <Col N="730" /> Secretary to the Minister, written on 9 January 1990, was: &ldquo;It is hoped to have the Agency in operation this year&rdquo;.  That was the hope in January 1990, from the Minister's own Department.  Therefore it is not widely unrealistic to suppose that everything could be ready in time for total implementation by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how for long the Bill is going to go through this House.  The Leader mentioned a legislation period here of this session of 15 weeks.  Surely we will have dealt with it by then.  If it takes the autumn term to go through Dáil Éireann, there is still a vast amount of time beyond that to make sure that everything is brought into operation.  This amendment is not unreasonable and I urge the Minister to consider it seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have the same fears as Senator Murphy wth regard to the starting date for this agency.  In the past we introduced legislation and put it through both Houses but, unfortunately, in many cases, like the Marine Bill and the Tobacco Bill, it took ages to get it up and running and on stream.  Despite the fact that many hours were spent here discussing them &mdash; they were found necessary, otherwise they would not have gone through both Houses of the Oirachtas &mdash; yet they were not put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like just to reflect on a couple of pieces of legislation that went through both Houses of the Oireachtas but which, for one reason or another, are not being implemented at present.  Take, for example, in the health area the Nursing Home Bill.  There is no money to implement it.  We have the Child Care Bill, and again there is no money to implement it.  I will say this for the Minister, that in regard to this Bill a sum of money is being put in place.  Again, we saw the Office of the Ombudsman collapse because of the lack of adequate funding.  The Abattoirs Bill, again under the Department of the Environment, broke down simply because again there was not adequate funding in the local authorities to implement it.  We saw a similar situation in regard to the Water <Col N="731" /> Pollution Act.  There was no money in the local authorities to implement it. Although the money is being provided in this Bill, there is no starting-up date.  I have put down an amendment that it should start not later than six months after the passage of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I think it is fair enough to give six months to the Minister to set up the agency, to get a director general and an assistant director general. I do not think it is unreasonable to put a six month's time limit.  I feel that if we do not put a time limit on it, and if we do not concentrate our minds on getting this agency underway, it can lie there on the Statute Book with absolutely nothing done to have it implemented.  Let me remind the Minister that the Fianna Fáil Government of 1987 abolished An Foras Forbartha and the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  It is important, therefore, that this Bill be put in place as soon as possible.  Hence the reason I put down this amendment that within six months of the Bill passing both Houses of the Oireachtas the agency would be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a lot of substance in the point made by Senator Murphy.  It would add credibility in the Bill, as he stated, if a definite time period was put on the Bill.  I ask the Minister, therefore, to consider amendment No. 4. It would be assuming that the Bill would go through this year; it would be a 12 month period.  That would be 31 December 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to add a great deal to what has been said already. There is a mistake in the typing of my amendment it says &ldquo;Acts&rdquo; but it does not really matter.  In essence, my amendment is the same as Senator Naughten's and is not all that different from Senator Murphy's. Senator Murphy and Senator Naughten have been here a great deal longer than I have and are, therefore, more likely to be able to assess how likely this Bill would take to go through, but in the unlikely event of it having a very <Col N="732" /> speedy passage perhaps Senator Murphy might agree that December 1992 might be a year away from the actual passing of the Act.  I do not mind.  I am not going to quibble over whether it is either six months or December 1992.  But, as has been said by both of the previous speakers on this side of the House there has been a great number of measures that have not come into effect.  I will mention one.</P>
      <P>I think I am correct in saying that the Bantry Bay Harbour Act was delayed because, while the order was signed creating the Authority, the order for the harbour dues was not signed and the whole thing became ineffective.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has played a very prominent and forceful role in steering this legislation through &mdash; I am sure against a good deal of opposition but she might not always be the junior Minister in that Department.  I would feel happier that these provisions were written into the Bill so that we could be assured it would become effective and meaningful as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy for these three amendments and I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to them.  The amendments come out of frustration and, if I can say so without being too disparaging, a lack of trust in the Establishment to get on, to get out and get working with the legislation on which we all, in both Houses, labour long and hard, if I paraphrase Senator Murphy's words correctly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point that has just struck me as I have been listening to the contributions on these amendments.  I understand that legislation was passed during the Irish Presidency about 12 months ago which was a regulation on the establishment of the European Environment Agency.  We were obviously party to it and that was passed this time last year.  Is it not so that we must ratify, if that is the correct word, that regulation by 31 December 1992?  Could this legislation not be used as a vehicle to do so, even if it meant the Minister coming back to the House next week or whenever with <Col N="733" /> a Government amendment to allow us to ratify that regulation?  If so, that date given by Senator Murphy in his amendment would make good sense because in theory I think we are supposed to ratify all of these by the end of December 1992.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I can imagine that for a Minister to accept a date deadline for the implementation of any Bill might be questionable, because in theory when it goes to the President to be signed we do not have control over what Bills will be sent on or questioned on constitutional issues or what any other difficulty the President may or may not find in this or any other Bill.  If we tie our hands or the Minister's hands to implementing a Bill by a certain date and that Bill then finds its way to the Supreme Court on some constitutional issue, I am not sure how it would fare logistically.  I have that query at the back of my mind.  I am wondering why so many Bills do not have an implementation deadline.  I think it is because of that possible hiccup in the system, but I fully support the sentiments in the three amendments and I look forward to the Minister's response to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Senators for moving the amendments.  I share the concern of the Senators. Indeed, when this Bill was being drafted I sought to have a time limit provision included and it was immediately shot down by the Attorney General's Office for precisely the kind of reasons Senator Doyle has mentioned.  If the deadline could not be met for any reason, perhaps because the Bill was delayed at the Office of the President &mdash; although I do not expect that would be the case &mdash; or had to be appealed on constitutional grounds to the Supreme Court, the Bill would then fall completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are also difficulties, I am advised.  Because it is a framework Bill eastablishing a new body and so on there is obviously going to be recruiting of staff, recruiting the Director-General, getting the kind of specialised staff to deal with the licensing procedures and so on.  It may not be feasible to do all of that within a period of six months.  There may be <Col N="734" /> some aspects of the Bill in regard to which the Director-General and the directors may feel they need some time to be established before they would feel happy to take on board certain matters that are going to be referred to them.</P>
    <P>For all of those reasons it was impossible to put in a time limit.  However, I do not want to be totally negative about the idea, particularly since Senator Murphy seems to be giving us the end of 1992 &mdash; although with 330 amendments here and probably a similar kind of debate in the other House I certainly hope we will be able to proceed through them fairly quickly.  If we take as long with all the amendments as we did on the previous three, I was counting up the number of hours and unless we are going to meet through the night on Saturdays and Sundays we will be here a long time.</P>
    <P>There are practical reasons why it might not be possible, but I do not want to shoot down the possibility totally.  I will have a look at it again and in the context of Report Stage will discuss what aspects of the Bill on which we might be able to put some type of limit.  I will come back to you again if I can.  It is my intention that the provisions of this Bill will be put in place as quickly as possible. I accept there was a delay in producing the legislation, although it still has been produced much sooner than other legislation that was promised a lot longer.  We do not have total control over that.  My officials have worked tirelessly on the production of this legislation.  It was a mammoth task.  Even dealing with all of the amendments and so on it has been a really difficult job for a few people to handle.</P>
    <P>I have to be realistic, fair and straight about it.  If we could put in a time limit it would be my intention to do so.  We cannot because of constitutional difficulties and so on and the fact that the whole thing would fall if for some reason the limit could not be met; or if we had an agency that was up and running but did not have an expert to deal with particular licences and could not actually operate for that reason.  There may be difficulties there, too.  For all of those practical <Col N="735" /> reasons, I would ask the Senators if they would reconsider putting in the limits and perhaps we could discuss the general thrust of what this is about at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMurphy2" hpid="Professor Murphy Professor Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Professor Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a comment related to the point Senator Doyle brought up about complying with the EC directive.  There is also a more general point, of course, that the sooner legislation like this is up and running the more it is going to benefit generally from European Community assistance anyway.  That is another reason why time is of the essence.  That applied to the Marine Institute Act particularly.  I accept what the Minister says.  I am in no position to challenge the constitutional advice.  I must say that, quite honestly, I suspected there would be some catch in this.  I am not sure whether the advice applies both to the definite dates suggested in my amendment and to the six months clause suggested in the other two amendments.  I accept also the Minister's promise to have regard to our amendments as far as is practical, as far as is possible, because I know she shares our anxiety that the legislation be implemented as quickly as possible. Under those circumstances I, for one, would not press the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the points made on both sides, I think we should call it a draw at this stage.  What the Minister says has to be absolutely clear, that were Senator Murphy's amendment to be put into the Act and were the dates not capable of being implemented, then the whole thing would fall and we would have to start all over again.  I certainly recall the introduction of the Companies Bill.  It was more complicated than this Bill in the sense that there were more aspects of legislation being dealt with, but at the same time it is a similar type of Bill and everybody was keen to get it through as quickly as possible.  We know the history of that and the finger cannot be pointed at anybody.  It just needed to <Col N="736" /> be amended time and time again and it needed long discussion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the Bill before us should be implemented as soon as possible and so also have the movers of the amendments.  It certainly will be appropriate for us to look at that on Report Stage and the fact that the amendments have been proposed means they can be raised again at the very first discussion on Report Stage, where we can then perhaps have some indication in regard to Senator Murphy's point that the Bill would come into operation as quickly as possible.  It would indeed be easier to make a judgment at that time as well.</P>
      <P>It also incidentally raises another point which I think we should not be afraid to address and that is the question of whether or not we should put a time limit on aspects of the debate on this Bill.  The first three amendments took over an hour to dispose of which means over a hundred hours of discussion if we were to continue to give them the same amount of time.</P>

I would say that we will have to agree to be prepared to &mdash; I hate to use the word &mdash; guillotine discussion at certain points as we go along just to ensure that we make progress.  Certainly, on the Independent benches everyone of us has indicated that we want this Bill to be enacted as quickly as possible and we will certainly co-operate in every way possible to get it through.</P>

Having said that, there are many amendments which will have to be teased out and discussed but I am sure it will not be necessary for every amendment to have <Col N="737" /> the same discussion as the amendments to date.</P>
      <P>Having listened to what the Minister has said with regard to the time aspect, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment at this stage since the Minister has said she would consider what could be done for Report Stage.  I believe it is important that some time span is put on getting this Bill in place and, if the words there have to be amended, fair enough; but I would ask the Minister to have it examined for Report Stage.  We look forward to the Minister coming back on Report Stage when, hopefully, we will have the Bill amended to allow some timescale for its implementation.</P>

I am sorry that Senator O'Toole has had to leave the Chamber briefly because I would not favour or agree that we should put a guillotine on the debate.  There are aspects of this Bill which are complex and which will have to be teased out.  I think there is goodwill on all sides of the House to press on with it and I hope there will not be a repeat of what happened over the first group of amendments.  Everybody wants to press on, but if we put on a guillotine we put ourselves in a situation where, when an important issue comes up, over which there is genuine concern, we find ourselves being guillotined.  I think we should proceed, see how we are going and hope that things will ameliorate.</P>

      <P>The next amendment in the name of Senator Ryan, which I will be moving on his behalf when it is appropriate to do so, also deals with the same issue.  The effects of the nutrification process and the addition of nutrients into water is not quite clear.  I am not just 100 per cent sure of what the Minister is saying.  I do not have that legislation in front of me and I am not sure whether that precisely covers the issue of both of them.  Certainly, the question of non-point pollution as well as point pollution has to be addressed.</P>
      <P>In my Second Stage speech I referred at some length to the need for tertiary treatment plants.  This is one of the reasons why I dealt with them.  Since then, I received a number of letters from people in the Kerry area pointing out that the reference to the problems in Lough Léin in Killarney were very much highlighted by the media and the Killarney people and the Kerry County Council were very vehement in explaining to me that they had in fact put in a tertiary treatment plant.  I want to raise that for the record because in my Second Stage contribution I referred to the fact that Cavan town was the only place I knew of to have a tertiary stage treatment plant. I did that in good faith because I took it from the documentation which was published by the Minister's Department, dated October 1990, and I would ask you please to correct that piece of information so that Kerry Council do not suffer indignities from fellow Kerry persons like myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt with the question of tertiary stage treatment at some length.  If the Minister says to me that this matter is completely covered by the reference in paragraph (b), then I will certainly accept that and that is the end of the matter.  It allows us to deal with it as we go along through the Bill.  The Minister will assure me that it deals with both straight pollution from a pipe and also non-point <Col N="740" /> pollution and that it deals with all the effects.  I listened carefuly to what the Minister said.  It may not necessarily always be a killer.  The extra nutrients lead to the growth of algae and to an enhanced, increased and unnatural growth in some cases which by changing the balance of the oxygen content of the water can then result in deaths, fish kills, etc., later on.  The Minister is saying that the section of the Water Pollution Act, 1977, which deals with the discharge of polluting matter, covers the Senator Ryan's amendment dealing with the discharge of nutrients and the fact that nutrients can be equated with pollution matter and sewerage effluent as referred to in the 1977 Act.  I want to be quite specific. I will listen closely to the Minister's response.  I do not want any doubt about it.  If it covers the matter, then it covers it; if it does not, then we need to address it.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c) an emission which is a pollutant by reason of its smell,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Both my amendment and Senator Finneran's attempt to introduce the concept of smell into legislation for the first time. It is important even though it may be considered superfluous under the Air Pollution Act, but smells generating from different sources are becoming an ever-increasing nuisance to the ordinary person.  Our concept of air pollution often does not go beyond smell in many cases. In other jurisdictions, they introduced the concept of smell into legislation.  The UK Environmental Protection Act has the concept of smell in it under the statutory nuisance and clear air section. I ask the Minister to consider it because to the lay person it is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unpleasant smells from different sources, be they big farms, industries or whatever, are perceived by the ordinary man or woman in the street as a major statutory nuisance.  In order to assure <Col N="742" /> people that there would be complete control by the Environmental Protection Agency in regulating for this area I would like it specifically mentioned, albeit for the first time, in legislation now.  I will not be pedantic about the wording of my amendment.  Perhaps there would be a more appropriate parliamentary expression to introduce the concept of smell but I would like the Minister to accept the introduction of that concept now, either in my words or in her words, which would be infinitely better, with the advice available to her.</P>
    <P>I refer to the UK Act which is interesting in that it gives tremendous detail and 80 per cent of the area covered is exactly the same area we are trying to cover and protect today.  In the UK Environmental Protection Act, 1990, on page 87 under Part III, Statutory Nuisances and Clear Air, (c) defines as a statutory nuisance fumes or gases emitted from premises so as to be prejudicial to health or a nuisance and (d) any dust, steam, smell or other effluvia arising on industrial, trade or business premises and being prejudicial to health or a nuisance. I would like to see that introduced here. We have introduced the concept of noise in this Bill for the first time in legislation. Noise might be hard to nail down in terms of clear definition.  I accept that smell may be also hard to nail down in terms of definition but in terms of environmental protection and the elimination of a statutory nuisance in the environment, smell rates very highly.  I request the Minister's indulgence in relation to this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">

      <P>I support what Senator Doyle said because, for the first time, in this Bill noise is defined as a nuisance.  I would like to see offensive odours also included as part of this Bill.  We had a very difficult situation in Roscommon last year which created a major difficulty.  It was a sweet odour which polluted an area for about two miles.  The people who lived there found it objectionable and were very concerned about it from a health point of view.  It was difficult to deal with it.  There should be a section in <Col N="743" /> the Bill to deal with that problem because it can be very offensive and ruin the tourist potential of a particular area.  I ask the Minister to take this amendment on board.  It would strengthen this section of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Both are being taken together.  As I have said, I consider that there is an essential difference between the two amendments.  I was very conscious when I submitted this amendment that it would be somewhat specific.  I would be quite worried that to include emissions that are pollutants by reason of their smell might interfere with the activity of our agricultural industry.  This could be perceived to be anti-farming and anti-rural and possibly anti-countryside in so far as our countryside, to a large extent, survives by reason of the activities of the farming community.  I would be interested in distinguishing between that scenario and the persistent odour from an industrial development.  I do not think any of us could equate the two.  In the case of a farm smell, whether from slurry or some other activity, it is usually of short duration.  It is something that is part and parcel of the life style, the development and activity in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other situation has far more serious aspects.  I believe that where industrial smell interfere with a neighbourhood there should be legislation to control it.  I appreciate that we have the Air Pollution Bill and it is possible that this can be dealt with under that Bill.  I <Col N="744" /> will be guided by the Minister and I will listen with interest to what she has to say.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the Air Pollution Act, to control industrial smell is a pretty cumbersome process.  There is the problem of how to gauge smell.  What equipment and what technology is there to do so?  In the final analysis, as far as I am concerned, the only technology you have is your nose.  Some possess better equipment than others, but that is another matter.  I come from a part of the country where a whole catchment area suftered as a result of a smell.  I did not put down this amendment lightly.</P>
    <P>We have the Environmental Protection Agency Bill before us.  Persistent odours from industrial development are offensive.  I want to see that, at the end of the day, either in this Bill or under existing legislation such as the Air Pollution Act, we have that control.  I found it somewhat cumbersome to deal with it under that Act.  We have now established in this Bill that noise can be determined a nuisance and I believe smell can and should be identified here also.  I will listen to what the Minister has to say and proceed from there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with amendments Nos. 9 and 10 but I fail to see how they could be implemented.  In the context of where they are in the Bill, it is very clear they come under the definition of emission &mdash; a definition which leads to action at a certain stage.  I sympathise with the point made by Senator Finneran about the difference between agriculture and industry.  His argument is lost completely.  I am sick and tired of hearing every time I turn on the radio that agriculture is our biggest industry.  Despite the attempts to call it otherwise agriculture is an industry and it is an industrial smell.  I accept his point that it is different.  One of my near neighbours is a pig farmer and I am used to the smell of slurry around the place. People who are used to agricultural smells can make the distinction between them.  The reality is that there is no way of measuring a smell.  If we expect an emission to be measured so that action <Col N="745" /> can be taken, then I cannot see how it fits in with this section of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I thoroughly support the point made by Senators Doyle and Finneran but I cannot see that it is capable of being implemented.  I have said consistently from the first day I came in here that the worst kind of legislation is legislation which cannot be implemented.  Senator Finneran put his finger on it.  There is no way of gauging or measuring smell.  Not only that, but in terms of smell and taste, most of us cannot even describe them. Our greatest single lack in vocabulary is vocabulary to describe taste.  Listen to two people trying to describe the taste of something and they do not even have the vocabulary to do it.  I have been saying to teachers all my life that it is the one aspect of the senses which we have neglected to pass on to a new generation. Families have certain ways of describing certain kinds of tastes and smells.  The Chinese have given us sweet and sour but most people when they taste a Chinese meal cannot quite distinguish which is sweet and which is sour.</P>

      <P>Yes, there is good and bad taste.  I thoroughly support the sentiments expressed by Senators Doyle and Finneran.  I cannot see how they can be implemented.  What I hear is: we would like it to be said that smell is a pollutant. Anyone would agree with that.  Once we have agreed and established that point we then want to say: well, the next step is how do we implement this as part of legislation?  Senator Finneran has told us that it cannot be done.  Despite what Senator Finneran said, agriculture is an industry and agricultural effluent is industrial effluent by any standards.  It does not need a very big dictionary to get us to that point.  The Senator is aware of that himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the UK they attempted to address this and failed to do so.  They failed to find a way to implement it.  My information is that they have failed to find a way of measuring it.  I know that in continental <Col N="746" /> countries they have certain restrictions on industry and agriculture inasmuch as they are restricted to certain times of the week when they can release smells into the atmosphere.  They are not allowed do it at weekends or after certain hours of the day.  This is recognition of the inconvenience it causes to residents in the surrounding area.  They have not managed to measure it.  We would all like to include it in the Bill but I fail to see how we could implement it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with both amendments.  I know it would be difficult to implement or even to define industrial smell as against agricultural smell.  Those of us living in rural areas recognise those smells &mdash; pollution from slurry and so on, which is not too bad.  There is another kind of pollutant that I am very worried about and it is something that has affected my particular area over a long period of time, that is the dumping of belly grass and blood from the local meat factory.  I will not name names.  We all know who it is.  This has caused considerable trouble to the local community in County Galway and parts of Mayo.</P>
      <P>Something should be done, whether in this Bill or in some other Bill, to try to stop that kind of activity.  Lorries dump belly grass and blood in certain areas at night and you have people dumping into drains.  I saw in the local paper last week where families were actually getting sick in their own homes and had to leave because of this terrible odour.  Senator O'Toole spoke about measuring smell.  I can assure the Senator that he would have no trouble measuring that smell.</P>

Something should be done about that situation.  There is no reason why a community should be disturbed by meat barons who are prepared to dump their waste on the side of the road or on <Col N="747" /> waste ground.  Something should be done to stop that kind of activity.</P>

      <P>If, as Senator O'Toole said it would be impossible to implement this because smell cannot be measured I would be very preturbed because the whole question of smell is extremely important.  I will not repeat anything that has been said.  If I understood Senator Finneran correctly, he said he was worried that if Senator's Doyle and Naughten's amendment were accepted it would include agriculture and his amendment was specific to industrial emissions.  He said we would not want to be seen as anti-farming, anti-rural and anti-agricultural.  If anything is to be said about this Bill, it is that it comes down too heavily on the side of assuming that all pollution is necessarily industrial pollution. The Schedule deals with intensive agriculture and on very large units.  They are far too big and I would not agree with Senator Finneran that agriculture should be excluded.  It is an industry and it is going to be one of the chief causes of pollution.  We should not accept the argument that because we want to tidy up agriculture we are anti-rural and anti-farming. If it has to be done, it has to be done.  At a later stage I will propose amendments to the relevant Schedule.</P>

There was very strong objection, it was a very big industry and the cost of monitoring was huge.  On one side, we had to try to hold the industry because of its importance and the jobs it created and, on the other side, there was a strong smell in a whole village.  It was a chemical smell.  I have sympathy with the Senators moving the amendments but the cost of monitoring equipment that the Minister would have to put in place to monitor such smells would be very large.</P>

It is difficult to nail down this issue. I agree with Senator Hussey that if meat factories are dumping waste that must be covered by some legislation.  If it is not, it should be considered.  It is very difficult to say that anything that causes a smell should be legislated for in some way.</P>

I said it against the kind of people who want to live in a fragrant paradise, frequently at the expense of other people's employment.  If I have to come down on one side or the other, I am a jobs man.  In terms of smells created by local authorities, the most glaring example at the moment is the corporation refuse dump in the southern suburbs of Cork on the Kinsale Road and I live within inhaling distance of it.  Nevertheless I accept that there are strong reasons in the corporation's case and I am not particularly concerned about the value of property declining as a result of the smell.  I would not <i>ipso facto</i> accept this kind of amendment because of the difficulty in defining smell and because of my principle that life is not entirely odourless.  I like some of the odours that Senator Harte referred to.</P>

      <P>I support amendments Nos. 9 and 10.  My local town, Cahir, has been virtually destroyed over the years by a well-known international company involved in many areas of the meat business.  They have a meat and bonemeal industry there and have virtually destroyed the town.  The local authority <Col N="749" /> have not been able to control it under the Air Pollution legislation.  The firm got a minor fine.  This problem must be tackled in some way.  People had to leave their homes and get out of town.  Property has been devalued, both land and house property.  People will not buy a house within three or four miles of the factory. I get the stench five miles away from that industry depending on weather conditions. The tourist trade has been destroyed in the town and business has been affected.  People must be allowed to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there is a lull in the meat trade due to market conditions.  We have two such industries in the constituency and both are causing great concern.  The one in Cahir is the worst offender.  There are trucks travelling around the country with offal from meat factories, often unsealed and uncovered.  This is from industries that are State and EC-funded.  The smell is not very nice.  They can bring this stuff through town and country, leaking offal all over the place.  The Garda tell the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Agriculture tell the local authority and the local authority tell the health board.  I appeal to the Minister to tidy up that area.  They are delivering that horrible stuff to the factories and causing a terrible stench.  This is not only the case in processing it but also in relation to storage.  There are often storage areas with thousands of tons of rotting material.  It is a real health-hazard and is a hazard to livestock because vermin distribute parts of carcases around the place.  It is a very serious problem and I appeal to the Minister to take these amendments seriously.  It affects people's livelihood, tourism, homes, property values, health, everything.  We must deal with the problem in some way because the Air Pollution legislation has not sufficient teeth to tackle it.  The local authority appear to be helpless.  There are three Departments involved, showing it from one to the other &mdash; the Department of Justice &mdash; there is no justice in it &mdash; the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health.  It goes through the three Departments to no <Col N="750" /> avail.  It is a major problem.  Regulations for the transportation of the material should be tightened also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the purpose behind these amendments.  The Senators who have spoken are concerned to control these offensive odours.  I agree with Senator Murphy when he says that local authorities &mdash; as is the case in my own local authority in Limerick &mdash; have problems with regard to offensive odours especially in the vicinity of large housing estates.  This is a definition section and matters such as activity, authorised persons, development, disposal, emission and so on are defined in it.  The purpose of these two amendments is to give an extended meaning to the word &ldquo;emission&rdquo;. The first definition of emission is an emission under the Air Pollution Act, 1987, the second is a discharge under the Water Pollution Act, 1977, the third is the disposal of waste and the fourth one is noise.  Senators are suggesting that offensive odours are not already covered under any of those four headings.</P>
      <P>While there is reference to a waste management plan and what it might mean there is no definition of waste. Everybody knows there is a difficulty in defining waste.  The courts over the years have found great difficulty in doing so. Has the Minister considered giving a definition of waste?  There are various forms of equitable waste such as voluntary waste, permissible waste and concepts such as statutory waste have been considered by the courts.  I ask the Minister to consider the whole question of waste.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to consider the eleventh report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution on the question of managing waste.  The duty of care is an important concept which was emphasised on page 38 of their report and I quote:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first task is for society to identify where the responsibility lies for ensuring that wastes are properly handled and disposed of.  In our judgment this must rest with the individual or organisation who produces the waste.  The <Col N="751" /> producer incurs a duty of care which is owed to society and we would like to see this duty of care reflected in public attitudes and enshrined in legislation in codes of practice.</P>
    <P>In the Bill there is provision for the drafting of codes of practice but there is no reference to this basic duty, the duty of care, placed on individuals and organisations in this matter.</P>
    <P>This duty of care has been enshrined in health, safety, welfare and labour legislation.  Does the Minister see any possibility of including this general common law duty of care in this legislation, or does she think that it should not be included?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am enjoying this discussion. There are some things we make smelly in order to make them safe. Methylmercaptan is released into natural gas so that we can detect a leak by smelling it.  Smells are covered by the Air Pollution Act.  Senator Byrne made the point that an offender was convicted but he took offence at the low level of the fine.  I appreciate the points being made by the Senators.  The problem is detection and enforcement.  I would like to discuss this matter again with the officials to see if the law can be improved.  What is a bad smell to one may be a good or less offensive smell to another.  Smells associated with agriculture seem to be acceptable in many quarters because they are natural or native, or whatever, and not seem to be as offensive to some as a smell from industry.  Perhaps fear of the unknown causes associations to be made between unfamiliar smells and danger. Many people find the smell from Guinness's brewery unacceptable.  I find it quite attractive.  It is extremely difficult to define an offensive odour.  Enforcement is essential so that major nuisances can be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I will quote from the Air Pollution Act:</P>
      <P>Anything that impairs or interferes with amenities or with the environment is considered a nuisance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="752" /> Odours and smells which cause a nuisance come under that definition.  In the light of the discussion I will try to strengthen the provisions.  Senator Finneran, in particular, made a strong case.  I discussed it with my officials but they felt his case was adequately catered for in the Air Pollution Act.  The question comes down to enforcement.  One of the main reasons for establishing an agency of this kind is to have the best expertise and equipment available to detect smells that are causing particular nuisance.</P>
    <P>The point made by Senator Hussey would be more appropriately dealt with in the proposed waste legislation that we are currently framing.  I will try to deal with the kind of problems which have arisen from mad cow disease at a later stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank the Minister for her comments because she covered some of the points I intended to raise.  Some materials and gases are highly toxic and are not smelly.  I take the point that there may be a need to include substances to create a smell to warn people about the type of materials being dealt with.  Paraquat is a case in point, where something was introduced to give it a smell to warn people of its presence.</P>
      <P>We have a great deal of sympathy for the sentiments behind both of the amendments. The problem is how to achieve the intentions in practise.  The smell is a product of the emission so we have to concentrate on controlling the emission. I would challenge Senator Hederman when she said that agriculture was one of the chief causes of pollution in the country.  That has not been established by any independent evidence.  It is a serious cause of pollution but I am not sure that it is the chief cause of pollution.  Local authorities may be the chief offenders in regard to pollution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators who are accustomed to travelling on the Naas motorway by-pass will know that there is a sewage farm beside it and the smell on some days can be quite objectionable.  There is a livestock mart just a few hundred years down the road on the other side and I have never <Col N="753" /> detected a smell from it, so obviously they can deal with their situation.  I know of a court case involving a farmer who put up a cattle shed adjacant to a private dwelling.  The householder took the farmer to court.  The farmer won the case on the basis that if one lived in the country one had to tolerate the smells and sounds of the countryside.  The question arises as to what is an acceptable smell in the country.  If an objectionable smell can be dealt with by the courts on grounds of nuisance it might not be necessary to have this matter included within the scope of the Bill.  I accept that it is highly desirable that smells be legislated for.</P>
    <P>There is a confusion between smells from agriculture and from farming.  Pollution from agriculture and of the food industry in the global sense, and in particular from meat processing plants is a serious problem.  The vast majority of farmers are as concerned as any other citizen to preserve the quality of the life they have in the country and to preserve the countryside in its pristine state.</P>

      <P>In case there was any misunderstanding by Senator Hederman, it was not my intention to exclude all smells from agricultural or farming development and to support an amendment to control industrial odours I was attempting to distinguish between ordinary agricultural practices on the one hand and industrial farming practices and industrial agricultural practices on the other.  In normal farming practice if something goes wrong, such as slurry getting into a stream or silage leaking into a river, we have adequate and effective legislation to deal with that in the Water Pollution Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the smell of Guinness and some people would even have a liking for the taste of it.  At the industrial end, there might be objections to the smell from a fish and chip shop &mdash; that is a commercial industry.  We could take this to extremes but Senator Dardis put his finger on it when he focused on the actual emission from the process.  The fear is &mdash; and the Minister referred to <Col N="754" /> this&mdash; that there may be chemicals contained in an emission.  I am not satisfied with this area and I am glad that the Minister said she will go back to it because it is a matter of public concern. I do not mind what legislation covers smells as long as we have the opportunity under some Act, legislation or agency to deal with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her response and I am quite happy to wait until Report Stage to further tease out the problem we have all tried to explain today to the Minister.  Two points were made that struck me.  One was in relation to local authority waste tips.  If the rest of the Bill goes through unamended particularly section 60 &mdash; if I am correct the local authorities will not be subject to most of the directions in relation to this Bill but I hope we may be able to change that &mdash; and if the BATNEEC principle goes through unamended, also I do not accept the concerns of the farming community that this might be excessively severe on them.  I think I am the only person, in either House who has produced a pig production policy document so I am very sympathetic towards those who may be considered the greatest defaulters in this area, namely, pig farmers and particularly intensive pig farmers.  There are major difficulties in controlling emission and smells from pig farms but it can be done particularly by starting from a greenfield situation or by retrospectively imposing certain technology on existing plants.  We cannot exempt local authorities from the directions of the environmental protection agency or exempt any one sector of our community.  We are talking about reasonableness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully accept Senator Murphy's point <Col N="755" /> that we are living in a world which is not free from smells, nor would we want it to be.  The difficulty is to decide on the sort of monitoring or metering we could put in place to decide what smells are acceptable or what are noxious and at what level a smell becomes unbearable.  Some people can tolerate and enjoy strong smells while others find even minimal smells nauseating.  There is a real difficulty here.  What is the generic name for this area?  Is it olfactometry?  Certainly the scientists in Teagasc are very concerned. Many scientists are concerned that the concept of smell is not contained in this Bill as it is being covered under similar legislation in other jurisdictions. The ordinary public are concerned about this issue.  If the Minister could accommodate it I will look forward to discussing it further on Report Stage.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;environment&rsquo; includes&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  ecosystems,</P>
    <P>(b)  all natural and physical resources,</P>
    <P>(c)  the social, economic, aesthetic and cultural values of the environment,</P>
    <P>and &lsquo;ecosystem&rsquo; means any system of terrestrial or aquatic organisms within their physical environment.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment attempts to define &ldquo;environment&rdquo; or to include a definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in the definitions section. I like the extensive definition there and I hope the Minister will accept it and take it on board.  I know other environmental protection Acts have had a simpler, more concise definition of environment but I cannot understand how we can be discussing an Environmental Protection Agency Bill without having a definition of what constitutes the very basis of the Bill, namely, the environment.  I am prepared to change my words for the words of the Minister so long as we have the concept of the definition in the Bill when it is completed.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Act in the UK defines the environment, and I quote from page 2, Part I subsection (2):</P>
    <P>The environment consists of all or any of the following media, namely, the air, water and land and the medium of air includes the air within buildings and the air within other natural or manmade structures above or below the ground.</P>
    <P>That is a very clinical and limited definition. I prefer the more extensive definition which includes a visual dimension to the environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to move the amendment but to speak on general issues.  I find it extraordinary that we do not have a definition of the environment at this stage of the Bill.  I have looked through the Bill at some length and I recognise that on page 79 there is for the purposes of a section a definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; which includes atmosphere, land, soil, water and all living organisms.  Unfortunately that definition is only for the purpose of section 108.  A definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is needed in the Bill.  In section 4 &ldquo;environmental medium&rdquo; is defined.  I have looked very closely at it.  I think there is a difference between environmental medium and environment.</P>
      <P>In my own amendment No. 24, I have tried to take on board what is defined in &ldquo;environmental media&rdquo; and I have also tried to add to it the section from the UK Bill defining &ldquo;environment&rdquo; which Senator Doyle has just quoted.  I have taken the second half of that and put the two of them together and I have added &ldquo;air&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;.  I have looked at some length at the difference and similarities between air and atmosphere. They are not interchangeable.  I am absolutely convinced of that.  I do not want to go into a long discussion on the definition of the atmosphere with its five different strata and different aspects and the changes that take place in different parts of it.  The atmosphere refers only to that mixture of gases above the surface of the earth which change all the time. Air is not necessarily atmosphere and certainly the atmosphere at higher levels could not be considered to be air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister agree that the Bill should include a definition of the environment.  If the Minister would give us such an assurance we could all come back to the basic request which is that the Bill should contain a clear definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; and the explanation of &ldquo;environmental medium&rdquo;<Col N="758" /> does not satisfy that request.  An environmental medium is just simply one aspect of the environment.  The environment must include all the environmental media.  The list of environmental media given in section 4 is not exclusive.  Would the Minister be willing to take on board a definition of &ldquo;environment&rdquo; in the Bill? If we could agree on this we could come back to it on Report Stage or with an amendment at another point.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(c)  the protection and enhancement of all aspects of the environment, including fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climate, landscape, architecture and the cultural heritage.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole has covered practically all of the concerns of the people associated with amendments which have been linked together.  We are concerned with the question of the protection and enhancement of all aspects of the environment. We feel that the Bill in the way it is framed at present does not go deeply enough into the question of fauna, flora, air, water, climate and cultural heritage. We could quibble for hours about this. Since we are all interested in the same question, no matter how we put the amendment down, I suggest in the interest of the Bill's progress that we make a short statement on our amendment having regard to the fact that they all link together and see if the Minister can come back to us on Report Stage with something that would meet the concerns expressed in all those motions.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that it had.  I was listening on the monitor and missed part of the debate as I came over.  I asked advice from my colleagues and I was told they were all linked.  In this Bill the environment is construed principally as the natural environment. There is a difference between the natural environment on one hand and the built environment on the other.  I believe the Minister is concerned about both areas, which she has made clear to the public, but this instrument deals specifically with the natural environment.  Amendment <Col N="760" /> No. 17 in the name of Labour Party Senators takes in the natural environment including fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climate, landscape, architecture, agriculture, health and adds architecture and cultural heritage.  The last two elements in that description stray beyond the purposes of the Bill.  It is perfectly appropriate to deal with fauna and flora and we have in this country some unique species of fauna, such as certain species of toad in Kerry.  I am not sure that our pinemarten is not a sub-variety of this genus. I do not know.</P>

      <P>I am most grateful for the additional information supplied to me by Senator O'Toole but I do not think he should limit himself to one Kerry slug. There are quite a number of them around.  The Minister must have had in mind places such as the Burren in County Clare which is not only a refreshment and delight to people but is also of major scientific interest and draws foreign tourists to the country.  It is most important to protect that and it is appropriate to do so within the provisions of this Bill.  We will not make this instrument efficient by arbitrarily widening its scope to deal with areas that should be dealt with but are not properly dealt with by this Bill.  I say that with some regret.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to look at the question of the built environment.  An Cathaoirleach ruled out of order a motion I put down regarding No. 7, Batchelor's Walk.  That is precisely the kind of thing I would like to see properly dealt with. There is no direct ministerial responsibility apparently.  I tried the Minister for the Environment during the last session and I tried the Taoiseach this morning. Neither of them appear to have any responsibility.  I wish we could have a Bill in which there would be direct ministerial responsibility for protecting our environment in this area.  It is scandalous that British Aerospace are allowed to get away with demolishing this building which is clearly what they are set upon. It does not come under the provisions of <Col N="761" /> this Bill.  The natural environment does and for that reason I would have difficulty in supporting the Labour Party's amendment. However, I will certainly support Senator Hederman when she moves her amendment.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the designation of Dublin by the EC as European City of Culture for 1991.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the Leader of the House for deciding to take this motion this evening.  It would be fair to say that this House has always given special attention to the cultural affairs of our nation so, in that respect, it is probably timely that we should take this motion this evening.  The motion is non-contentious in nature and I hope that the debate will be constructive.  I felt I sensed a negative approach on the Order of Business today when this matter was mentioned so I would appeal to Senators not to be negative about the motion.  As I said, it is not supposed to be contentious and I would appeal to Senators not to highlight our national inferior complex which seems to involve giving out about everything and anything and generally being negative about all sorts of things.  In short, I would love the debate to be positive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, I would like to outline why Dublin is worthy of the title of European <Col N="762" /> City of Culture.  Dublin is a beautiful city in European terms, nobody can deny that, and it is, in fact, oozing with culture. Dublin as a city over 1,000 years old had a fine history and culture.  We can boast a wide variety of influences: Irish, Scandinavian, Norman and British, to name but a few.  The writer H.B. Morton once wrote, and I quote: &ldquo;The three great feminine capitals are Paris, Vienna and Dublin.  The first two have all the lure of woman and the last has all her charm and spite&rdquo;.  Vincent Caprani wrote that Dublin is not to be flirted with or taken too lightly.  Dublin is a mature beauty, all right, maybe a teeny bit on the spiteful side, but certainly charming with the <i>persona</i> of a mother.  This woman, however, has altered in looks and character with the passage of time and so for better or worse Dublin is th European City of Culture in 1991.</P>
    <P>We have a lot to celebrate this year. Dublin is the city of James Joyce, the city of Oscar Wilde, of J.M. Synge, of Brendan Behan and of Seán O'Casey, to name but a few.  Dublin is also a city that can claim three Nobel Prize winners for literature.  We are a university city, with TCD celebrating 400 years of history this year.  We have a fine architectural heritage to display and some of the most noted libraries and museums in the world.</P>
    <P>Dublin is a modern city with a large, young population.  It has a great literary and cultural tradition.  It is a city of music and rock, with stars like Sinead O'Connor and U2, now known throughout the world.  The famous Dubliner, Christy Brown, was the inspiration for the Oscar winning film &ldquo;My Left Foot&rdquo;.  Above all, however, Dublin is intimate.  It is human and it is friendly.  We do not take over-selves seriously in Dublin.  This can be seen in the 600 pubs throughout the city. Our pub culture is world renowned and it is highlighted by a ready, dry wit to demolish any pretention that anybody may have.  What I am saying simply is that Dublin is a true European capital and city of culture.</P>
    <P>I now propose to deal with the whole question of the rejuvenation of the capital <Col N="763" /> city.  A lot of rejuvenation has taken place over the last two or three years.  As Dublin enters the nineties we have every reason to be confident.  After several decades of gloom and decay, the conditions are now right for the opening up of a new era of progress and development.  There is now a widespread feeling of confidence and optimism in our capital city, brought about in no small way as a result of the Millennium celebrations in 1988.</P>
    <P>There has been a restoration of civic pride by Dubliners in Dublin.  Something has emerged in the city, a feeling that at last things are improving, a feeling that we are at last getting our act together. Business is good and for the first time in a long time success is not a dirty word and success can be celebrated.  There are many reasons for this.  Dublin Corporation has also contributed to this. Their improvements in the physical environment of the city is one factor.  Streets are being pedestrianised.  There has been a comprehensive programme of repaving and public lighting improvements.  I would draw the attention of the House to O'Connell Street, for example.  You all recall the condition of O'Connell Street two or three years ago.  That has now changed.</P>
    <P>Derelict sites are being cleared.  New parks are being developed.  Georgian style public lighting has been installed in key areas of the city.  Government financial incentives have also helped and have brought about a dramatic rise in investment in centre city areas, for example, the Liffey Quays and the Custom House docks area.  The financial incentives have also brought about investment in areas outside Dublin, places like Tallaght, and so on.  All this is good I am sure you will agree. However, we should fully utilise and maximise these achievements and build on them for the future.</P>
    <P>I would now like to examine past cities of culture and to see what they have achieved.  The concept, of course, was the idea of the Greek Minister for Culture, Melina Mercouri.  The concept of designation and the concept of the European <Col N="764" /> City of Culture is in fact a very nebulous one.  The first city of culture was, of course, Athens, and their celebrations were very low key.  Florence came next and they, too, did nothing particularly special in 1986.  Berlin concentrated on methods of bringing about urban renewal; their emphasis was on the whole question of urban rejuvenation and urban renewal.  Paris was another European city of culture and they simply linked their designation with the bicentennial celebrations of the French Revolution. Glasgow had the title last year, and I had the honour to attend the opening ceremony of the Glasgow year in March 1990.  They made their celebrations part of a long term strategy.  Their long term strategy was, and still is, to improve their once undoubted poor image and they utilised 1990 to contribute to that and to bring about an improvement in the city's image.  It would be fair to say that they are indeed making great strides in that regard, given that their neighbour is Edinburgh.  So we come to Dublin and what should Dublin achieve.  What should our objectives be?</P>
    <P>As I said already, the concept of a European City of Culture is a very nebulous one.  There are no set rules as to what such a year involves.  The EC have not laid down strict guidelines on what should be done when a city is fortunate enough to be designated European City of Culture.  The first point that should be made in this regard is that Dublin is in reality a cultural city.  It has a rich culture. I say that following my comparisons with the other cities that have had this title. We do not need to create an image.  We have a rich culture.  We have the goods, so to speak, so we are not in the business of image-making.  I would suggest, therefore, that the year should be one of celebration and should be reflective.  We should celebrate what we have and then build on our artistic achievements.  The year must be a catalyst for new cultural endeavours.  We should celebrate the year in our own way and in our own style. I would like to highlight that.</P>
    <P>We Irish have a distinctive style.  We have a distinctive flavour and we do <Col N="765" /> things in our way.  This, for example, was seen when we conducted the EC Presidency in this country and in many other international events, the Eurovision Song Contest, and so forth.  We do things well and we have a good reputation throughout Europe.  It is worth highlighting why 1991 is an appropriate year for Dublin to be European City of Culture. For the record, there are several anniversaries being celebrated this year. TCD is celebrating its fourth centenary. We have the 200th anniversary of the death of Mozart.  We have the 200th anniversary of the opening of the Custom House.  1991 involves the 50th anniversary of the death of James Joyce.  We also have the 800th anniversary of the opening of St. Patrick's Cathedral and last, but by no means least, we have the anniversary of Charles Stuart Parnell's death.  It is interesting to mention as an aside that the current Lord Mayor of Dublin, Michael Donnelly, has commemorated in particular this anniversary of Parnell's death by resurrecting an old portrait of Parnell and installing it in the Mansion House, in perfect splendour. All these anniversaries should, of course, be celebrated.</P>
    <P>It should also be mentioned that 1991 involves celebrations in Limerick and Belfast.  Belfast are in the business of image-making this year and have brought forward a programme of events to celebrate the year.  Limerick, of course, is celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Treaty.  The first thing we should do in this House tonight is send good wishes to those two cities.  I hope that this year will bring us closer to those cities, given our common interests, and also improve relations between North and South. Above all, however, we should have the objective of strengthening our European cultural identity.  We call ourselves the young Europeans and 1991 can be seen as an important link between our EC Presidency last year and the completion of the Single European Market next year. The year should make us more Europeorientated and bring us into contact with the cultures of Europe while highlighting our cultural identity.  This year will open <Col N="766" /> up Dublin and Ireland to the cultures of Europe and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>There are also economic objectives. Bord Fáilte and Dublin Tourism are very anxious to attract a large number of visitors to our city.  That will be realised, particularly around the time of Bloomsday which, of course, is now a big international event, as I am sure Senator Norris realises.  We need also to provide entertainment for our citizens.  We need to enjoy ourselves.  We want to sample the best that Europe has to offer in the way of theatre and all forms of art.  We look forward to many cultural visits to the city during the year.  It is important also that we would simply enjoy ourselves this year.</P>
    <P>There are many more material objectives which we should look at. Already we have had the opening of the Civic Gallery of Modern Art.  We look forward to the opening of the Writers' Museum in Parnell Square and also the Irish Museum of Modern Art in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  All these are very welcome developments.  Later on, in May, we will have the formal launching of the restored Custom House.  Of course, Gandon and the Custom House are synonymous with Dublin.  That too, will allow us time to reflect and celebrate our architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>It would also be very important this year to develop a Community arts programme. Dublin is not just a centre city but is made up of many communities in places like Coolock, Darndale, Tallaght, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin, Finglas and so on.  It is made up of many neighbourhood communities and they, too, have to celebrate the year and come forward with community arts.  That is anoother nebulous concept but I believe that the company involved in promoting the year will give that a priority and encourage the promotion of the arts in the communities where it needs to be encouraged.</P>
    <P>There will also be physical improvements to the city this year.  There are plans for the making of a modern street in the Liberties area and we should also look at what is happening in the Temple <Col N="767" /> Bar area.  I feel very happy about what is happening in relation to the Temple Bar. When I was Lord Mayor of Dublin, and I know we have one of my predecessors here &mdash; Senator Hederman &mdash; I set up a special Temple Bar Development Committee. It was chaired by the Lord Mayor and made recommendations to the Government and those recommendations have now been acted upon. Two property development companies have been established.  One is being formally launched tomorrow by the Taoiseach and it would be fair to say that incentives are promised in the future and further legislation is also promised.</P>
    <P>This will be one of the major achievements for 1991, the creation of our own real left bank in Dublin.  It is happening and 1991 has been the catalyst for that development.  We can see how the year can bring about a reflection of what we have achieved and act as a catalyst to decide what we can achieve for the future.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris will excuse my ignorance.  He has pointed out a fact of which I was unaware but, no doubt, he will deal with it in his contribution. Senator Norris will welcome the opening of our film centre, or rather the initiation of the renovation later on in June.  Things are happening in that area and that is all to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Above all, however, 1991 is going to be what we make it.  There are some 400 different events taking place during the year and they, too, will be enjoyed by the citizens of Dublin.  As I said, we will do things in our own style, in our own way.  One thing that should be remembered is that anything and everything that happens in 1991 in connection with the European City of Culture is a plus for the arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there have been critics of what is happening in relation to 1991 and <Col N="768" /> I would be very naive to think that these critics will not surface here tonight.  The criticisms which have been levelled about plans and preparations I am sure will be raised here tonight.  The one question which is raised again and again is that of finance.  On that score, I know from my own experience that the Millennium was run on a shoestring.  There was less public money available for the Millennium that is now available for 1991 and the European City of Culture.  Of course, there is the key core funding, the national lottery funding, running in the region of £2 to £3 million.</P>
    <P>One good thing about this whole development, and it also occurred during the Millennium year, is that the private sector is now coming forward in a partnership with the local authorities and with Government and it is hoped private sponsorship will raise between £1 and £2 million this year to carry out the activities and to develop our plans in relation to 1991.  That is a very welcome development in that the private sector is not leaving everything to Government. Private business feels that it is worthwhile investing in the arts and culture and the city generally and that is something which should be lauded.  Many other agencies have come forward with funding also, including the EC, Bord Fáilte and the local authorities.  If you were to include also the many capital projects which are coming onstream this year, which Glasgow did in their funding calculations, then the funding for 1991 comes to many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>We must have a sense of priority in relation to funding and spending.  I do not think the general public would welcome spending millions of pounds in one year on arts and culture when there are other areas which need funding also, including health, education and social welfare.  I think we should bear in mind that finance is not in abundant supply in this country. We have to get our priorities right and we have achieved a balance in relation to public funding for the arts for 1991 in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The other comparison is always made with Glasgow and what they achieved. <Col N="769" /> This is also a criticism of what we are trying to achieve here.  As I said already, Glasgow had different aims and different objectives.  They were trying to impove their image.  We are doing something different. We are celebrating and reflecting. If we look at the debate which is now taking place in Glasgow following their year, we can see that it was not quite the success and role model we should have copied.  Time has disclaimed the view that Glasgow was doing a much better job than we were going to do.</P>
    <P>There is the question of planning and whether we planned the year right.  I have every confidence in the Dublin Promotions Organisation Limited.  They are a group which represent the key interests in the city from an economic and cultural point of view and they are the same group who organised the Millennium celebrations. I am sorry to deal on the negative there but it would be important to answer the criticisms that are being levelled at this stage.</P>
    <P>Dublin is indeed a great city.  We have a great artistic talent.  The city merits the title and, as I have said, everything that happens in 1991 is a plus for the arts.  We have to grasp the opportunities as they present themselves to us.  We should celebrate what we have, we should enjoy ourselves, we should contemplate and we should preserve and plan for the future.</P>
    <P>The other main target we should consider is to plan for the arts and culture for the future on a city-wide basis.  In association with the Arts Council, the corporation and the Government, we should plan during the year what we want to achieve in future years and bring together this year all interest groups and others involved in the arts and culture to do that.  I know the Arts Councils are setting about the task, and that is to be welcomed.  It would be another major achievement for 1991.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to move the motion.  I hope it will not be contentious.  I know other Senators may raise other issues and I look forward to listening to the debate.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit chuig an díospóireacht seo.  Is <Col N="770" /> maith liom é a fheiceáil sa Chathaoir nuair atáimid ag caint faoi rudaí a bhaineann leis an gcultúr.</P>
      <P>Táimidne, tá mé a cheapadh, ar an séú cathair san Eoraip atá roghnaithe ó thaobh chúrsaí de, agus caithfidh mé a rá gur thug an Seanadóir O hEochaidh an-chuntas agus an-chur síos go deo ar na himeachtaí éagsúla cultúrtha atá ar siúl, agus beartaithe, i mBaile Átha Cliath i rith na bliana seo.  Bhí liosta mór fada aige faoi sin ach, tar éis a bheith ag éisteacht leis, tá an-díomá orm nár luaigh sé an focal &ldquo;Gaeilge&rdquo; ó thús deireadh. Níor labhair sé oiread is focal amháin faoin gcultúr is ársa, faoin gcultúr is mó agus is suntasaí dá bhfuil againn, sin é an cultúr Gaelach agus an Ghaeilge mar chuid den chultúr sin.</P>
      <P>Bhí ainm Bhaile Átha Cliath, ar ndóigh, in airde againn thíos faoin tír mar &ldquo;the Pale&rdquo;, mar a tugadh air i mBéarla, go raibh an cultúr díbrithe as Baile Átha Cliath agus go raibh fíor chultúr na tíre lonnaithe faoin dtuath agus ar chósta thiar na hEireann.  Tá súil agam n-éireoidh go maith leis an gceiliúradh seo atá beartaithe agus go ndéanfaidh sé rud éigin ar son an chultúir.  Ach, maidir liomsa, ar chaoi ar bith, mar fhear atá tagtha aniar, caithfidh mé a rá go fírinneach gur beag eolas nó tuairisc a bhí le fáil, agus is beag impact atá déanta faoi láthair ag an bhliain chomórtha seo i mBaile Atha Cliath.  Cuirfidh mé geall le duine ar bith sa Teach seo, dá gcuirfí ceist ar aon duine in iarthar na hÉireann faoi imeachtaí cultúrtha Bhaile Átha Cliath sa bhliain seo 1991 nach mbeadh tuairim dá laghad acu céard faoi a rabhamar ag caint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nach dona an rud é, agus ceiliúradh á dhéanamh ar chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath mar ionad lárnach cultúrtha na tíre seo, nach bhfuil a fhios againn céard atá ar bun.  Labhair an Seanadóir ar ball agus dúirt sé go raibh sé sásta go ndéanfadh lucht cumarsáide jab réasúnta maith maidir lena chur ar a súile don phobal i gcoitinne céard a bhí ar bun acu ó thaobh imeachtaí de.  Ach, go dtí seo &mdash; agus tá an tríú cuid den bhiain caite cheana féin &mdash; is ar éigean a bheadh a fhios againn go bhfuil a leithéid de rud ann mar chathair <Col N="771" /> chultúrtha na hEorpa.  Anois, d'iarr an Seanadóir orainn gan a bheith cáinteach, gan a bheith ag caitheamh anuas ar an iarracht seo atá á déanamh.  Níl sé i gceist agamsa, agus ní hé mo mhian é, bheith ag caitheamh anuas air, ach ba chóir go mbeimis, mar a déarfá, ag iarraidh ár gcuid prióireachtaí a bheith i gceart againn.  D'fheicfí domsa, mar Éireannach &mdash; i mbliain chultúrtha seo Bhaile Átha Cliath, mar chathair Eorpach &mdash; go mbeadh an teanga chun tosaigh sa liosta sin.</P>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach n-aontódh an Seanadóir ná lucht eagraithe na bliana liom; níl mé ach ag nochtadh mo bharúla faoi.  Níl aon rud ráite ag an Seanadóir sa chaint a rinne sé a thugann uchtach ar bith dom go bhfuil aon iomrá ar an chultúr is ársa agus is saibhre dá bhfuil againn, an teanga Ghaeilge, i gcomóradh na bliana seo. Inseoidh mé don Seanad cén fáth, mar chuaigh feidhmeannach de chuid Bhord na Gaeilge &mdash; eagraíocht Stáit faoi Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; chun cainte le feidhmeannaigh chomóradh na bliana cultúrtha seo agus chuir siad moltaí faoina mbráid, moltaí suntasacha a dhéanfadh an-leas ar bhealach simplí lena thaispeáint go raibh an ghné sin den chultúr beo beathach sa tír.  Mar shampla, mhol siad go mbeadh taispeántas ar láthair speisialta i gcomhair na bliana a léireodh stair na Gaeilge, ach níor glacadh leis an moladh.  Moladh freisin go mbeadh oícheanta ceoil agus filíochta ar siúl sa Chafé Gorm.  Baineann daoine, is cosúil, sult as a bheith ag éisteacht le daoine ag aithris filíochta, bíodh sí i nGaeilge, i mBéarla nó i dteanga ar bith eile.  Tá rud ar an dul seo ar siúl sa Chafé Gorm le tamall anuas, agus freastal maith air.</P>
    <P>Moladh go mbeadh oíche cheoil nó fhilíochta ar siúl uair amháin in aghaidh na seachtaine i rith na bliana comórta sa Chafé Gorm.  Ar a laghad ar bith d'fhéadfaí seo a fhógairt le go mbeadh a fhios ag daoine cén áit a bhfuil fíorthobar cultúrtha le blaiseadh agus le feiceáil, ach níor glacadh leis seo.  Labhair an Seanadóir ansin faoi na scríbhneoirí móra cáiliúla, Synge, O'Casey agus na daoine eile a raibh clú orthu i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Tá <Col N="772" /> an ceart aige agus molaim é dá bharr sin. Is ceart, cinnte, go mbeadh áit speisialta acu siúd in aon chomóradh atá á dhéanamh againn ó thaobh cultúir de, ach ba cheart a chur ar a súile do dhaoine gur mhol Bord na Gaeilge go mbeadh féile sheachtaine ann in ómós scríbhneoirí na Gaeilge, agus go háirithe scríbhneoirí ar nós mhuintir Uí Neachtain, Baile Atha Cliath a shaothraigh sa seachtú haois déag.  B'fhéidir nach bhfuil mórán eolais ann futhu ach nárbh iontach an deis é sin i rith na bliana seo, chomh maith le Synge, O'Casey agus Behan, agus chuile dhuine eile, go dtaispeánfaimis ár meas ar chlann Uí Neachtain as Baile Átha Cliath a bhí dílis don Ghaeilge, a labhair agus a scríobh as Gaeilge, go mbeadh seiminéar ann futhu i rith na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé, níl focal, go bhfios domsa ar chaoi ar bith, faoin nGaeilge, faoi labhairt na Gaeilge, faoi scríbhneoirí na Gaeilge nó faoi lucht drámaíochta na Gaeilge.  Moladh freisin go mbeadh rud speisialta ann do pháistí na cathrach seo agus páistí lasmuigh di a thiocfadh chun na cathrach, páistí a bhainfeadh sult agus taitneamh as ceol Gaelach, sceitsí beaga as Gaeilge, agus mar sin de.  Is cinnte freisin go mbainfeadh na cuairteoirí ó thíortha thar lear sult as a leithéid freisin agus gurbh fheasach dóibh go raibh ár gcultúr féin againn.  Is é an rud iontach faoi seo uilig &mdash; agus ba mhaith liom seo a rá leis an Seanadóir a bhí ag caint ar ball faoi mhaoiniú na n-imeachtaí seo uilig &mdash; go raibh Bord na Gaeilge féin sásta cúnamh fial flaithiúil airgid a chur ar fáil chun na rudaí seo a chur chun cinn agus é a chur sa chaoi nach mbeadh aon chaiteachas ar an Stát, ach, faraor géar, níor glacadh leis sin.  Is trua liom nár glacadh leis agus is trua liom go gcaithfidh mé coiste eagraithe an cheiliúrtha a cháineadh anocht.</P>
    <P>Bhí rud beag simplí eile ann.  Mar shampla, tá logo deas acu ansin, Dublin, European City of Culture ar aghaidh an logo i mBéarla agus an Ghaeilge ar a chúl, backstage, rud a léiríonn, dar liomsa, an intinn chultúrtha atá taobh thiar den brochure álainn atá curtha i dtoll a chéile.  Bhí moladh an-mhaith ag Bord na Gaeilge go mbeadh logo dá <Col N="773" /> theangach ann, rud a thabharfadh le fios don chuairteoir sa chathair le haghaidh na hócáide speisialta seo go bhfuil dhá theanga againn, Gaeilge agus Béarla, a thabharfadh a háit cheart dár dteanga féin.  Rud beag simplí, a dúirt mé, ach rud a dhéanfadh maitheas dúinn féin i súile na gcuairteoirí, go léireofaí go bhfuil teanga dár gcuid féin againn.  B'fhéidir go gceapfadh cuid de na Seanadóirí nach bhfuil ar siúl agam ach seafóid agus mé ag caint ar rud beag mar logo dátheangach nach gcosnódh oiread agus pingin amháin sa bhreis mar bhí Bord na Gaeilge sásta an logo a dhearadh ar a gcostas féin. B'fhéidir go gceapfaí freisin go bhfuil luí róláidir agam leis an gceist seo, ach, i dtaca liom féin de, is é an chéad chloch ar mo phaidrín é an Ghaeilge, ó thaobh cultúir de, agus d'fhéadfainn go leor a rá faoi céard is cultúr ann.  Ach is í buaic ár gcultúir sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ná an teanga agus, dar liomsa, ba cheart go mbeadh an teanga Ghaeilge le feiceáil go hard agus go suntasach ar imeachtaí den chineál atá á n-eagrú againn i mbliain seo chomóradh na cathrach mar chathair chultúrtha na hEorpa.  Thairg Bord na Gaeilge don choiste eagraithe seo i mBaile Átha Cliath go ndéanfadh siad aistriúchán Gaeilge ar aon rud gur mhaith leo a dhéanamh i rith na bliana seo, ó thaobh preasagallamh agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Mar fhocal scoir, tá siúl agam go n-éireoidh go maith leis an iarracht atá á déanamh ag an gcoiste eagraithe seo ach is trua liom nach bhfuil tagairt dá laghad ann don Ghaeilge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to speak in this debate on Dublin as the cultural capital of Europe.  Could I just, in reply to an Seanadóir O'Foighil, tell him that it is not all that glum.  In fact, myself and my colleague, Senator Ó Cúiv, have organised 50 children from Dublin's inner city to go to the Gaeltacht this summer. That is going to be sponsored by An Bord Gáis, one of their small but significant contributions towards culture in Dublin city and the country.  The idea behind it is that they will study before they go, and while they are there, not only the language but the whole fabric of society <Col N="774" /> and see how rural Ireland works.  When they come back they will have classes continuing on until Christmas.  We hope that it will be a big success.  We are grateful to An Bord Gáis for coming up with the money.</P>
      <P>Dublin enjoys the distinction of being designated European City of Culture 1991.  Dublin is certainly equipped to bear such an identity because our city is steeped in cultural activity and awareness. Our literature, theatre, music and arts have attained a standard that ranks with the world's best and, what is more, our citizens are keenly aware of this and are lively in their appreciation.  Dublin may be small as capital cities go but the quality of its talent is totally disproportionate to its size.  Equally, we have the ability to organise and produce our talent.  Dublin does not tolerate the second rate.  We are our own best critics and to impress Dubliners in Dublin is the ultimate aim of all our creative people.</P>
      <P>Being European City of Culture demands much more than favouring our elite and emphasising our world class achievements; it demands our embracing all the cultural achievements of our people.  We are required to look at what is going on in our communities, among voluntary and amateur groups, and among those with ability and talent but perhaps lacking in encouragement and opportunity.  This is why the programme of events in Dublin 1991 is all-encompassing. We have not failed to address the city itself either.  We have focussed on the rejuvenation of charming enclaves like Temple Bar and the Blessington Street basin.  We have encouraged public sculpture, for instance, and we have created forums for ideas and projects that otherwise might not get the airing or the space they deserve.  In other words, we want to involve all aspects of the city in Dublin 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin has undergone dramatic changes in recent years.  The success of the designated incentives have stimulated investment along the city quays and in the Christchurch area, not to mention the Custom House dock development.  The new pedestrian areas around Grafton <Col N="775" /> Street, Henry Street, Crown Alley, Merchant's Arch and the newly improved O'Connell Street, have brought new life and style to the city.  Equally, new shop front designs have reinstated the character of our city's trading areas and with the renewal of old lamp standards, stone sets and paving stones we have a city centre of great visual appeal.  The night time environment is enhanced by the trend towards floodlighting of buildings.</P>
    <P>A recent but significant trend in Dublin is the number of people coming back to live in it.  Six years ago we would not have seen any planning for people to live in the inner city, but in the last few years there has been a significant move towards people living in private accommodation in the inner city.  We have seen building applications for, and buildings built on, the quays, both on the north and south sides of the city, the Custom House dock area, around Christchurch, and recently there was a very important planning application by the Gas Company for 1,500 houses around Grand Canal Dock. This is a very significant and important feature in the city.  As has been mentioned already, the new plan for Temple Bar will be announced shortly and hopefully that will have a very significant impact on people living there.  This is an important trend and will in the long term have a very great impact on the cultural aspects of the city, because if it is carried out as we are led to believe it is planned, it would be a Left Bank type of area and would be alive with young people and tourists, both living and working in that area.</P>
    <P>I see Dublin '91 and our place as a European cultural capital as an opportunity to give ourselves credit where credit is due.  We have a lot to be proud of and a lot to celebrate.  We have a duty to be positive, as far as I am concerned, but that is not saying that we should ignore or turn a blind eye to things that need improvement, on the contrary. However, Dublin '91 is an occasion to promote our city &mdash; show off, so to speak &mdash; and to get the best out of ourselves. At any time Dublin is culturally a <Col N="776" /> dynamic and vital place to live in.  A great number of activities take place.  RTE, the National Gallery, the National Theatre, the Concert Hall, the National Museum and the National Library all have plans for 1991.  During the year happenings of particular interest will be the opening of the new Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Writers' Museum, the Custom House Birthday Party and the remarkable number of anniversaries, including, for example, the Easter Rising of 1916, which has already taken place, St. Patrick's Cathedral, James Joyce, Charles Stewart Parnell, Mozart, Vivaldi, etc. In addition to this, we look forward to displaying our treasures and a continuance of the significant environmental improvements which have transformed our city in recent years.  On a personal note may I say particularly look forward to the May Day to Bloomsday period celebrating both a literary and spring festival of theatre.  It strikes me that the theme May Day to Bloomsday should evoke virtually every conceivable artistic vibe in our cultural tradition.</P>
    <P>The imaginative and stimulating programme being put forward by many organisations will enhance Dublin's reputation abroad and encourage visitors to see the city as a place of culture, present as well as past.  For me the real success of Dublin 91 will hinge on the extent to which it catches the imagination of the people of the whole city.  The culture of Dublin is as much about talk, wit and character as it is about writers, artists, musicians and architects.  The essential purpose of the involvement in Dublin, city of culture, is to get the best out of ourselves and the city.  For that reason plans are afoot for a full and imaginative community arts programme which will ensure that the arts are not the preserve of the temples of culture but are alive in all communities, making the city of culture a truly citywide cultural celebration. Dublin 91 has a community arts officer and has set aside a special fund to encourage initiatives among community art groups around the city.  The city treasures are in a display in a unique Treasures of Dublin Exhibition.  A further exciting <Col N="777" /> innovation is the introduction of Writer's in Residence in the city's libraries, involving lectures, workshops and seminars for adults and children.  This is in addition to the libraries programme, which will involve music, writing, exhibitions and special publications on Dublin.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation propose to spend a further £1.25 million in 1991 in additional pedestrianisation and environmental works, which have done so much to raise the quality of life in Dublin's inner city. There are two further environmental proposals worthy of special mention.  One which I have already mentioned is Temple Bar and some time ago the corporation produced a well received action plan.  Smithfield is designated as one of the rejuvenation areas in the city's development plan and the planning department will produce a suitable action plan there.  There is a welcome proposal for a sponsored architectural competition in conjunction with this.  Another exciting proposal is the making of a modern street, the development of a corporation inner city site by a group of architects. This has been very well received and they are actively looking for private sponsorship at present.</P>
    <P>You will take from what I have said that the character of Dublin as European city of culture in addition is being a celebration of the arts in the city will also be reflective and, above all, constructive, looking very much to the future of cultural life in Dublin at the beginning of a new decade and indeed towards the beginning of a new century.  Dublin 91, European City of Culture, is both an honour and a challenge.  We happily accept the honour, confident that with all our support we will also meet the challenge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CarmencitaHederman" hpid="Mrs. Hederman Mrs. Hederman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hederman</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest and with great pleasure to Senator Haughey and Senator Ryan extol the virtues, benefits and all the goodies we were having in 1991 for Dublin as the European City of Culture.  I was very proud when they listed off the great wealth, the plethora of events, happenings, good things in the city generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> They were extremely comprehensive, they forgot nothing, if I might say in congratulating them on the way they spoke.  They covered every aspect of all the good things that are happening in the city.  I would like to add my support for this motion.  I suppose everybody here welcomes Dublin's designation as a European city of culture.  I think it would be very strange if anybody was to oppose the motion.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey referred to Glasgow and that perhaps everything had not turned out as well there as might have been expected.  I do not know if Senator Haughey was in Glasgow during their designation as European City of Culture but I was over there and I looked into it in some depth because I was writing a couple of articles on their designation.  I was enormously impressed with the renaissance which had taken place in Glasgow.  I would like to feel that at the end of our year we will have as much to be proud of.  I hope we will.</P>
    <P>What I rather wonder is: what exactly is the purpose of this motion?  What purpose is it serving to welcome the designation of Dublin as city of European culture?  It is fairly obvious that we all welcome it.  Is it for members of the Government benches in some way to give a litany of all the good things?  Surely if things are as good as they are saying we can all see them.  I never think it is necessary to go around proclaiming how wonderful it is.  If it is so good can we not all go down and see these things?</P>
    <P>I would like to ask what particularly is the purpose of this type of self-congratulation? Perhaps it is to make us feel proud of the city.  I hope, if that is the case, that it will do so in some measure, but there are not very many of the public involved. There are five in the Public Gallery.  Perhaps they will have heard something that they did not know before, but I do not imagine it is going to get out in a very extensive way to members of the public and in that in some way it is going to help augment pride in the city.  If that was what it was for, I would greatly welcome it.  I feel there is sometimes in Fianna Fáil, or perhaps in Dublin Corporation, <Col N="779" /> an idea that if you keep saying things are good, people will believe they are good. The corporation some years ago introduced an &ldquo;I love Dublin&rdquo; campaign &mdash;&ldquo;love&rdquo; being represented by a heart &mdash; and everyone put &ldquo;I love Dublin&rdquo; stickers on their cars.  The idea was that as a result of these posters and stickers people would love Dublin.  I do not think that one person will love Dublin one jot more as a result of those stickers.  If people see and experience things improving then perhaps they will love Dublin.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the programme which is beautifully produced in this very glossy magazine is very extensive and impressive. I do not wish to suggest anything else.  An excellent programme has been put together.  It covers many aspects of the cultural life of this city, not perhaps all aspects but I will come to that point later on.  Previous speakers referred to our great cultural diversity, literacy traditions, etc.  It is right and proper that these should be developed in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Dublin is the European city of culture and for that reason we must promote, as far as possible, those special aspects of our culture for which we are well known. Our literary background, famous writers and authors and our theatre immediately spring to mind.  There are many other things, like the film festival.  There is a great programme of artistic events which is worthwhile.  Many specific events will be put on, concerts and so on, but I am not so sure from what I have heard of the extent to which the programme will reach into the community.</P>
    <P>We depend on the private sector so much for promotion because the purse is small.  The Government have not given much largesse.  When they opted to take on this title &mdash; we were not obliged to take it on &mdash; they should then have thought about what it would cost.  We are particularly indebted to groups such as those mentioned by Senator Ryan &mdash; the Dublin city treasures, the magnificent exhibition which is being facilitated by the Bank of Ireland, and Irish Life for sponsoring the Viking Adventure <Col N="780" /> Centre.  There are a range of private bodies involved and I thank them for their input.  I would also like to say how much I appreciate, having a particular interest in architecture, that many fine 18th century buildings have been restored.  A magnificent job has been done on Kilmainham.  The Custom House is looking splendid and will be opened in the not-too-distant future. Some of us have not seen the Taoiseach's office but from what I hear it is splendid. I hope that one day I will have the opportunity to see it.  Seventeen million pounds was spent on it and Senators should get the chance to see it.  From the photographs I have seen it is delightful.  I still question whether we are right to spend huge sums of money on individual buildings and then say finance is not available for other projects, but I do not begrudge the Taoiseach the £17 million he spent on his office.  It was money well spent.</P>
    <P>The Phoenix Park is looking remarkably well and is a great credit to the Office of Public Works.  We have our own municipal gallery.  Newman House is to be turned into an 18th century house.  I could go on and on.  I want to make it very clear that I am positive and enthusiastic about what is being done.  I congratulate all those who have been involved in the organisation of this celebration because it could not happen without a great deal of hard work.</P>
    <P>As the Senators here are city councillors, it would not be amiss to look at the role Dublin Corporation has played in what has happened to date in the city. Senator Haughey gave a very lengthy list of all the good things, as did Senator Ryan.  He said that it was important to give credit where credit was due, but we must not turn a blind eye to the bad.  I thought, ha, ha, here goes, we are now going to hear some of the things that he thinks might be improved.</P>
    <P>It is very important to be positive and see the best in our city but if we pretend that everything is perfect and beautiful, that there is no need for any improvement and if we simply had a litany of how wonderful and beautiful it all was, it would not do us any good.  It is a complete <Col N="781" /> waste of time, not to put a tooth in it, to move such a motion and speak in the way those on the Government benches have spoken so far.  I would like to throw in a few suggestions to rattle a few memories. Who here has spoken about the destruction of Wood Quay?  Was that mentioned at any stage?  Wood Quay which should have been one of the great cultural projects of this city was lost.  It was not for want of effort on the part of the population at large or some members of Dublin Corporation.  We heard mention of the writers' museum and I welcome more than anybody the fact that the house in Parnell Square is to be renovated and that at least two rooms will be opened for the writers' museum during this year. Why has some £2 million to be spent on that house?  Why was it allowed to deteriorate?  Who owned it?  The VEC owned it, as they own many other buildings in this city.  They have allowed them to decay in the most outrageous manner.  Have they been called to account for that?  So often it is public bodies, State bodies and semi-State bodies, who have been responsible for so much decay and dereliction in this city. Dublin is famous not only for all the things I mentioned earlier but also for its great architecture and its 18th century buildings.</P>
    <P>It is mentioned in the programme that throughout Dublin derelict sites are being revitalised.  Has anybody stopped to think why there are so many derelict sites in this city?  In many instances, those derelict sites have been caused by the depredation of this city by Dublin Corporation.  I have no compunction about saying that they caused more decay and dereliction than all the worst developers put together.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, for about 35 years, have not had proposals for road widening and new roads in this city.  That has caused much damage to this city.  If one takes a tour around the city, away from areas like Grafton Street, Dawson Street and O'Connell Street, one will see the damage that has been done.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have a range of very important buildings.  I will mention a few <Col N="782" /> off the top of my head.  No. 29 Clare Street, down at the bottom of the road here, a magnificent 18th Century house with a most outstanding interior, was allowed to fall down.  No. 7 Bachelor's Walk, which my colleague Senator Norris mentioned was also allowed to fall down. No. 88 St. Stephen's Green, a very early 18th Century building, which has unique wood panelling throughout the building in extraordinary good condition, is either falling down or has been taken down. Something quite unique has been lost. There are many houses in Lower Baggot Street.  Across the road from here, in Upper Merrion Street, there is a row of magnificent houses &mdash; I believe the Duke of Wellington was born in one of them &mdash; which are decaying before our eyes. As the Taoiseach looks out of his window he must be able to see them.  Members of the Oireachtas pass them every day.  It is a crying shame and a scandal that they are allowed to decay.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear support from that side for one criticism. We are coming on.  We have so many buildings that have been allowed to decay.  Why did Senators Haughey and Ryan not put down a motion that would have had something constructive in it? Why did they not put down a motion calling on the Government to introduce legislation so that local authorities could take action against developers or owners of buildings that allowed them to fall down?</P>

      <P>Senator Haughey has not been as long on the council as I, but I am sure by now he knows that the city council have no power to take action against a developer who allows a house to fall down.  If a developer goes in to destroy a house we can stop him but if he just leaves it there and lets it rot there is nothing we can do.  If they had put down a motion suggesting new legislation that <Col N="783" /> would have been something which all of us would have been able to support but perhaps they felt that would be a sort of criticism of the Government.  I do not know.  All I can say is thank God I am not on the Government benches.  I would find it very boring to have to put down innocuous motions like welcoming the designation of Dublin as the European City of Culture.</P>
      <P>Lewis Clohessy is the director or head man &mdash; I am not sure of his title &mdash; of the European City of Culture.  When I was writing an article I asked him if there was one present he could give to the city for this year what would it be and unhesitatingly he replied that the traffic regulations be implemented in this city.  I was extremely surprised, but agreeably so. What he was saying basically was that for people to enjoy this city and all its culture they must be allowed to move freely through the city unhindered by motor cars belching out dirty fumes all over the place.  They must be able to walk on the pavements without cars being parked on them.  They must have freedom to enjoy the city away from the motor car.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil's policy on Dublin Corporation has been consistently pro-motor car, commuter and roads and unless that changes we will not have a beautiful city. Look at Clanbrassil Street and go from Stephen's Green corner the whole way round the inner tangent up to Parnell Square in the very heart of the city and experience its visual aspect.  Within the last few days, the president of the Institute of Architects made a very forceful statement in which he said that Dublin Corporation should not be allowed to build any more roads until they had reinserted some of the streetscape which they have destroyed.  I wholeheartedly support that.  It is an outrage that they should be planning to perpetrate more indignities on the city before they have made any attempt to put back some of the streetscapes which they have so wantonly destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan spoke about new life coming into the city.  I would remind him that the population of this city has halved <Col N="784" /> in the last 20 years.  It is now down to 80,000 in the inner city.  While I welcome the incentives which the Minister has introduced, they are not all that wonderful with regard to bringing new life back to the city.  The city manager told me recently that between 60 and 70 new units were built in the city since the tax incentives were introduced.  We should not get things out of proportion.</P>
    <P>Senators Haughey and Ryan have it in their power to make changes.  It is a power which the Minister may not have in that they can actually vote down the road proposals which have decimated the city.  People are fleeing from a city in which they can no longer live because it has been given over to the motor car.  If the Senators made constructive suggestions about how we could improve some of the bad things rather than giving us a litany of the many good things about which I agree, this could be quite a constructive debate.</P>

      <P>Yes.  I assumed that this debate would continue into next week.  I am sorry it will not.  It is a shame.  I am glad that Senator Haughey was courteous enough to point out that I wished to speak.  I had asked at the end of the last session that this matter might be taken and I was very glad to see this morning that Fianna Fáil were taking this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not one of the instinctive begrudgers in this city and Senator Haughey would perhaps agree with me on this because I formed part of a committee which he very graciously took a considerable interest in, that is, the committee for the Faces of Dublin Business Awards.  We travelled around the city looking at the external appearance of the businesses in the city and gave recognition to those businesses which had improved their appearance.  This event, which was sponsored by the Dublin <Col N="785" /> Chamber of Commerce, proved extremely successful in helping to put a better appearance on the city of Dublin.  I was at least partly responsible for getting that scheme extended.  It originally covered quite a small area of the city and I had it extended to take in Parnell Street and another member, Mr. Shaffrey, got it extended to take in Capel Street.  That was very important because we were taking in two of the most troubled streets in the city which were unattractive to look at but which were important shopping streets.  The effect was quite significant.</P>
    <P>In Parnell Street, which was very run down, on the first occasion a small garage won a prize for the effort they put in and, last year, a small newsagent's shop run by a family living over the shop won some degree of recognition.  They did not win one of the major prizes but those two awards were significant in alerting people in a distressed area of the city to the significance of the appearance and the maintenance of businesses within the inner city.  If one looks at the top end of Capel Street one will see that a series of buildings there have been renovated in recent years.  That street shows quite remarkable change.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey mentioned a number of anniversaries and matters that we should celebrate.  I am very glad that he mentioned Trinity 400.  This is a significant event which will take place next year.  There was some historical dispute about whether it should actually have been in 1991 rather than 1992 but there was some change in the calculation of the calendar that makes it appropriate that it be celebrated in 1992.  It is a very important event internationally and is one that the college is making every effort to celebrate in a worthy fashion.</P>
    <P>One of the things the college has done to celebrate that event is to expand the amount of student accommodation on campus.  In terms of the culture of a city it is very important that we have people moving back into the city.  We have been able to block book 200 rooms for the international James Joyce symposium which is coming back to Dublin in 1992 after an absence of ten years.  I have <Col N="786" /> just returned from Chicago and Madison, Wisconsin, where I spoke to a meeting of the American Committee on Irish Studies.  There were 350 delegates there and I did a certain amount of what I would call show casing in order to bring the American contingent back here.  I anticipate we may have up to 1,000 scholars from all over the world, many of them Irish, coming to Dublin because Dublin is such an internationally renowned focus for Irish culture.</P>
    <P>I listened to what Senator Ó Foighil said and I am sure that it was an oversight on Senator Haughey's part and does not reflect any distaste for the language &mdash; it would be highly unusual if it did &mdash; but he did not say very much about the Irish language.  However, one cannot squeeze everything into a half-hour contribution. I was rather taken with the fact that in America so many people were not only interested in Dublin but also had taken the trouble to learn the Irish language. My first two paragraphs were in Irish.  I did not attempt to go any further due not only to the anticipated discomfort of the audience but also my own difficulties in going much further in this language.  It is appropriate that we are now embarking on an intensive language course for Members of the Oireachtas.  That is good. There should be an attempt made to speak Irish in the national Parliament.</P>
    <P>Senator Haughey also mentioned the 800th anniversary of St. Patrick's Cathedral which was celebrated with an ecumenical service recently.  It is an important indicator of our culture that unlike 30 years ago where such an event would have been totally impossible, we had both Archbishops of Dublin, the Roman Catholic and the Church of Ireland Archbishops, and the Chapters of three cathedrals &mdash; the Roman Catholic Pro-Cathedral in Marlboro' Street, Christchurch Cathedral and St. Patrick's. This demonstration of religious harmony in the capital city is extremely important and one that should be emphasised particularly because this degree of harmony, which is also part of our wider general culture, is not always the image that is presented of this country abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> I would like to turn to some of the specifics of Dublin's year of culture.  I emphasise that there is inexactitude in the way it is frequently presented in the popular press.  We are not the European cultural capital.  That would be an absurd pretension in a continent that contains Florence, Paris, Berlin, London and so on.  It would be just ridiculous.  We are European City of Culture and we are celebrating our culture.  We are also opening ourselves up and inviting comment from other European cities.</P>
    <P>I supported the Millennium.  It was a slightly artificial production because, apart from anything else, the evidence demonstrates quite clearly that Dublin was marked in Ptolemy's map in the 2nd century AD which puts us at least 600 years older than the Millennium would suggest but I supported it because it indicated a movement and a capacity for taking pride in our city.  It dealt a death blow to people who, because of a lack of sophistication, felt a resentment against the built environment of the inner city which is essentially the Georgian core, on the basis that these houses were not an expression of Irishness but were a colonial excrescence and an offence to the nationalist spirit.  We all remember that this was the case in official circles 25 years ago.  There was active ill-will towards the Georgian core and Ministers are on record as glorying in the destruction of part of our heritage.  We moved then into what I call passive ill-will and we are now in a stage of passive goodwill towards our Georgian heritage.  I hope this will help to push us that little bit further into active goodwill towards the Georgian core.</P>
    <P>There are two principal reasons why I say this.  One is because it is financially in our interest to do so.  People do not visit this country for our weather.  Cultural tourism is the kind of tourism we have and, thank God, cultural tourism is the sector of the market which shows the greatest potential growth.</P>
    <P>The second reason is equally important. Some of those who lived in the houses were arrogant and offensive.  I <Col N="788" /> think, for example, of Henry Moore, Earl of Drogheda, who wrote his name right across the map of the centre of Dublin with Henry Street, Moore Street, Earl Street, even Of Lane and then Drogheda Street so that if you looked at the map of Dublin in the 18th century you saw Henry Moore, Earl of Drogheda, written across it.  That is arrogance personified. I do not care who lived in those houses and who paid for their building. The important thing is the Irish craftsman, artists, stuccoers, bricklayers, carpenters and so on who constructed the houses.</P>
    <P>The preservation of this environment is very important if we are going to do something permanent.  The danger of an event like Dublin's year as European City of Culture is that it will be almost entirely event-orientated.  We will have fireworks, street parties, the kind of community arts festivals of which Senator Haughey spoke which are vitally important but the problem is, if one only has a party then after the party one is left picking up the bottle tops and cigarette ends and there is absolutely nothing left behind.  For that reason it is important to concentrate on doing things that will last.</P>
    <P>We have linked our festival next year in celebration of James Joyce to the preservation of a very important House, No. 35 North Great George's Street, which is being rehabilitated as a cultural centre in memory of James Joyce whose name has been mentioned so many times this evening.  We have secured a grant of £300,000 from European Structural Funds and this has to be matched domestically before we can draw any more money after the initial £50,000 we have drawn down.  I hope that Irish business will take this message on board and be prepared to sponsor us to the greatest extent possible.  They now have a bargain because for every £ they give us it is matched by an equivalent amount from the European Community so the impact is immediately doubled.  It would be important that we have a showcase in memory of James Joyce.  When he left this city he said that Ireland, and Dublin in particular, represented for him the <Col N="789" /> centre of spiritual paralysis.  It was a focus of this kind of paralysis.  He said that the brown brick houses represented the incarnation of Irish spiritual and cultural paralysis.  If we can take over a house, restore it, put in a library, put in Waterford Glass chandeliers like we have here, put down Donegal Carpets, the best of Irish manufacture, then when people come from abroad and see this magnificent environment they will say, &ldquo;what beautiful chandeliers&rdquo;.  We can say, &ldquo;of course, Irish manufacture we are celebrated for it.&rdquo;  That is the hopeful side of things.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on some of the less hopeful things.  I have deliberately put it into a positive context.  With regard to the built environment and the 18th Century buildings and so on, I am very glad we have a Dublin writers' museum.  I welcome it and I pay tribute to the efforts and the work of Dublin Tourism, Matt McNulty and so on. However, it is a public scandal that the Dublin Vocational Education Committee were allowed to get away with the destruction of that building.  It was vandalised with the connivance of the VEC; ceilings, staircases and fireplaces were ripped out of it over a period of a couple of years, while people like Ian Lumley, Frank McDonald and myself were howling about it.  They did not have caretakers.  They did absolutely nothing. They turned a blind eye to it.  I estimate that restoration work has cost the taxpayer at least £225,000.  Why does the VEC not have to pay for that?</P>

      <P>Labhair na cainteoirí a ghabh romham mar gheall ar ársacht agus <Col N="790" /> uaisleacht cultúr Bhaile Atha Cliath. Beidh mise ag caint faoi ghné áirithe ar chóir dúinn mar pholaiteoirí, spéis speisialta a bheith againn inti.  Ba é seo an scannal polaitíochta ba mhó a tharla i nGaeltacht Chonamara le linn an gheimhridh seo caite.  Mar is eol don Aire Stáit, bíonn cead ag daoine athruithe a dhéanamh ar Chlár na dToghthóirí, mar is cuí, gach bliain idir lár mí na Nollag agus lár mí Eanáir.  Tig le daoine ainmneacha nua a chur ar an gclár nó ainmneacha a bhaint, de réir mar is cóir.  An t-oifigeach comhaireamh nóan t-oifigeach toghcháin atá i gceannas air seo.</P>
      <P>I mbliana, tharla rud an-aisteach, scannalach i gConamara.  Baineadh cearta votála de dhaoine faoi leith i nganfhios dóibh féin.  Chuir mé síos an gnó seo sa chaoi is go bhféachfaí chuige nach dtárlódh sé arís.  Mar is eol dúinn, cuirtear in iúl don chomhairle chontae é nuair is cóir ainm a bhaint de Chlár na dToghthóirí ar chúis bháis nó imirce as an áit. Ní gá, fiú amháin, an píosa páipéir lena gcuirtear é seo in iúl a shíneáil.  Tá sé chomh furasta sin faoi láthair, iarracht a dhéanamh ar ainm a bhaint den chlár.  Tá Carna suite ar imeall Ghaeltacht Chonamara agus tá aithne ag gach duine ann ar a chomharsana; ní hionann Carna agus cathair Bhaile Átha Cliath nó bailte eile faoin dtír.  Sa cheantar beag tuaithe seo, fágadh suas le 250 duine amach as Chlár na dToghthóirí.  Baineadh ainmneacha áitritheoirí i mbailte fearainn iomlána den chlár.</P>
      <P>Ní dearmad clódóireachta a tharla anseo nuair a bhí liosta na n-ainmneacha á chur le chéile.  Fuair an chomhairle contae liosta de 250 ainmneacha a bhí le baint den chlár.  Tá sé scannalach go bhféadfadh saoránach amháin ainm saoránaigh eile a bhaint de Chlár na dToghthóirí, trí é a scríobh ar phíosa páipéir agus éa shíneadh isteach chuig an chomhairle chontae, agus saoránach a fhágáil gan vóta dá bharr.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá cosaint éigin againn sna cúirteanna athbhreithnithe agus is maith ann iad. Murach iad, bheadh 250 duine gan vóta i dtoghcháin áitiúla na bliana seo.  Conas a bhféadfaí líon mór ainmneacha de dhaoine atá le feiceáil beo ina gceantar <Col N="791" /> beag féin agus a bhfuil aithne ag daoine eile orthu, a bhaint den chlár?  Bhí múinteoirí scoile agus daoine eile a bhfuil a saol caite acu san áit sin, i gceist.  Iarraim ar an Aire a chinntiú nach dtárlóidh sé arís agus cosaintí a ainmniú a chuirfidh ar ár suaimhneas sinn nach dtárlóidh sé arís. Ba mhaith liom go n-inseodh sé dúinn cé rinne an ghíomh seo.  Tá daoine fostaithe ag an gcomhairle chontae chun seiceáil a dhéanamh ar an gclár ionas go mbeadh sé ceart agus fírinneach.  Ní thuigim conas nach bhfaca an duine a chuaigh tríd an liosta go raibh an oiread sin ainmneacha fágtha ar lár, nó conas nár cheistigh an chomhairle chontae é sula d'fhógair siad &ldquo;delete&rdquo; i leith leathanaigh ar a raibh 250 ainm de mhuintir cheantair amháin nach bhfuil mór go leor le séipéal dá chuid féin a bheith aige.  Agus é sin uilig ráite agus déanta bhí siad in ann teacht go dtí an pointe go bhféadfaí an díspeagadh, an rud scannalach sin a dhéanamh, ainmneacha a bhaint.  Cén fáth nár cuireadh ceist riamh ar an gcomhairle chontae, ar oifigigh na comhairle contae nó ar an bhfear a bhí a breathnú?  Níor chuir duine ar bith riamh an cheist cén fáth gur tharla sé seo.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí na liostaí ag an gcomhairle chontae ní thiocfadh duine ar bith amach chun a fháil amach chun a shástachta féin céard a tharla.  Bhí boscaí áirithe, mar is eol dúinn, ó thaobh toghchánaíochta de, abair i scoil áirithe, nó i halla i gceantair, agus bhí boscaí áirithe sa cheantar thart ar Charna agus i gCill Chiaráin i gContae na Gaillimhe, agus bhí 85 faoin gcéad bainte den liosta.  Is uafásach an smaoineamh é go mbeadh an Stát, an Roinn Comhshaoil, an chomhairle chontae agus chuile dhuine eile a bhí ag plé leis, bainteach le scéal mar sin.  B'éigean don fhear a bhíi gceannas air seo nuair a bhí an chúirt achomhairc ann fios a chur ar an té a bhí fostaithe ag an gcomhairle chontae agus fiafraíodh de cén fáth gur baineadh 250 ainm den liosta.  Cuireadh ceist ar chláraitheoir an chontae agus ar fheidhmeannach de chuid na comhairle contae. Ní raibh aon eolas acu.  Ní raibh siad in ann a mhíniú ach amháin gur thug an fear a bhí i gceannas ar ainmneacha a bhailiú cineál barúla faoi chaint a bhí ag dul <Col N="792" /> thart.  &ldquo;Ba dhaoine iad seo&rdquo;, a dúirt sé, &ldquo;nár vótáil sa toghchán roimhe sin agus, mar gheall air sin bhí siad ag léiriú nach raibh aon suim acu i gcúrsaí toghchánaíochta agus nár chóir, mar sin, go bhfágfaí a n-ainmneacha ar an liosta&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Níl a fhios agam cé chomh fíor, bréagach is atá an ráiteas sin ach más é sin an fáth a tugadh don fhear a bhí i gceannas ar an gcineál sin oibre, is scannalach an rud é agus tá iontas orm nach raibh fiosrú poiblí ar bun ag an Roinn Chomhshaoil lena fháil amach cé rinne é seo agus cén fáth go ndearnadh é.  Níl smid ná focal as an gcomhairle chontae ná ón Roinn Comhshaoil faoi.  Níor tharla rud ar bith riamh lena chinntiú nach dtarlódh sé seo arís.  Tá bailte beaga ar nós Charna, Ard Mór, Ard Thiar, Maoinis, Cill Chiaráin agus Ros Muc, agus is beag duine atá fágtha sna ceantair sin de dheasca chúrsaí imirce agus go leor cúiseanna eile.  Níl mé ag caint faoi dhaoine a fuair bás &mdash; agus tá súil agam nach n-abróidh an tAire, agus éag freagairt na ceiste seo, go bhfuil rialacha ann, agus má bhíonn duine básaithe nó imithe as an áit go mbainfear den liosta é.  Tuigimid uilig é sin.  Níl mé ag caint faoi sin, beag ná mór.  Tá mé díreach ag cur ceiste ar an Aire, cén chaoi ar tharla sé go bhféadfaí 250 ainm a bhaint de chlár liosta na dtoghthóirí agus nach raibh an Roinn Comhshaoil ag dul a dhéanamh tada faoi.</P>
    <P>Is é an rud a dúradh liom féin, bhuel, tá rialacha ann le cosaint a thabhairt do na daoine sin.  Cá raibh an chosaint ag an 250 duine seo ach amháin sa chúirt achomhairc, agus murach go raibh daoine ann a bhí airdeallach agus a chonaic an scannal seo agus a d'ardaigh an cheist seo ag an gcruinniú sin, bheadh na daoine sin uilig inniu gan vóta.  Níl mé ag caint faoi dhaoine a bhí bainte den liosta de bharr na ngnáth chúiseanna a luaigh mé agus níl mé ag iarraidh go mbeadh aon chaint faoi sin nuair a bheidh an tAire ag freagairt. Ach tá mé ag caint faoi rud amháin agus tá súil agam go dtabharfaidh an tAire freagra air, cén chaoi gur féidir le 250 ainm a bhaint i gceantar beag tuaithe amháin, bíodh sé sa Ghaeltacht.  nó sa Ghalltacht nó áit ar bith eile.  Tá a fhios agam dá dtarlódh a leithéid i gContae Uí <Col N="793" /> bhFáilí nó i gContae Laoise, go chuirfí sin in iúl don Aire ar an toirt agus bheadh rud éigin déanta aige lena chinntiú nach dtarlódh sé arís.</P>
    <P>Tharla sé seo; ní finnscéal é.  Ba mhaith liom a fhiafraí den Aire, cén bealach a leigheasfaidh sé an scéal seo.  Níl aon mhaith a rá liomsa nó le daoine eile go mbeidh siad níos cúramaí agus níos géire an bhliain seo chugainn agus déanfaimid a chinntiú nach dtarlóidh sé arís.</P>
    <P>Is cuma cé chomh cúramach is atá duine, fad is tá riail ann go bhféadfadh duine ar bith ainm duine a scríobh ar phíosa páipéir: &ldquo;is mian liom an fear seo a bhaint&rdquo;, &ldquo;is mian liom an duine seo a chur air&rdquo;, nó &ldquo;is mian liom an bhean seo a bhaint mar tá sí imithe as an áit nó tá sí caillte&rdquo;, gan aon ainm a chur leis agus go nglacfar leis sin agus cuirfear ansin ar an liosta é le hathbhreithniú a dhéanamh air.  Ba chóir go mbeadh bealach níos éifeachtaí, go mbeadh slándáil níos fearr i bhfeidhm lena chinntiú go bhfuil cearta ag saoránaigh agus is cuma cérb as don saoránach céanna, cé chomh saibhir is atá sé, nó cé chomh bocht is atá sé, ba chóir go mbeadh an chosaint dhlíthiúil sin ann.  Tá a fhios againn uilig an méid troda agus achrainn agus príosúntachta a d'fhulaing ár sinsear romhainn le go mbeadh cearta vótála ann.  Seo muid anois beagnach san fhichiú haois agus tá bealach fós ann le go bhféadfadh duine éigin, go mailíseach, ní trí thimpiste, an oiread sin dochair a dhéanamh do chearta an tsaoránaigh.  Tá súil agam, de bharr na cainte seo anocht go bhfuil an tAire in ann a gheallúint domsa nach dtarlóidh rud mar sin arís go deo agus go mbeidh sé in ann a rá liomsa cad iad na céimeanna atá tógtha aige lena chinntiú nach dtarlóidh sé seo arís.</P>

      <P>This motion calls for a change in the way the register of electors is prepared to make sure that no one who is entitled to be on the register is unfairly removed from the draft register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be helpful to refer briefly to the way in which the register is prepared.  Under Part 2 of the Electoral <Col N="794" /> Act 1963, and regulations made under that Act, each county council and county borough corporation is required to prepare and publish the register each year.</P>
    <P>Work on the register starts in September. The registration authority must make house to house or other adequate inquiries to find out who is entitled to be registered in their area.  From this information they must publish a draft register on 1 December each year.</P>
    <P>During the period up to 15 January, the draft register is put on display in post offices, Garda stations, libraries and local authority offices where it can be inspected by members of the public.  The public are advised in advertisements arranged by the Department and by local authorities to check the draft to make sure they are registered.  Copies of the draft are provided to all elected representatives for the area.</P>
    <P>Anyone can make a claim to have a name added to the register or to have the name of a person who should no longer be registered for an address to be removed. A list of claims is published and a copy of the list is supplied to each elected representative.  The registration authority carry out appropriate inquiries in relation to each claim.</P>
    <P>All the claims are referred to the county registrar and are ruled on by him. The county registrar can make any inquiries he thinks necessary before ruling on any claim.  The county registrar is a legally qualified official.  He is entirely independent and is not subject to direction by the Minister or anybody else.</P>
    <P>Before ruling on a claim to delete a name of a person from the register the county registrar must give that person at least five days' notice in writing of the time and place he will consider the claim. The registrar considers, and rules on, the claims at a public sitting usually known as a &ldquo;revision court&rdquo; or a &ldquo;revision sitting&rdquo;. Anyone may attend this sitting, and give evidence if he so wishes, including evidence on oath.  Anyone who is not satisfied with the ruling of the registrar has the right to appeal to the Circuit Court and, on a point of law, to the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> In relation to the case which is the subject of this motion concerning the revision court hearings for the Carna area of County Galway, I read the report on the matter in the <i>Connacht Tribune</i>, and the Department have also received details of it from the local authority.  I understand that 286 claims were received requesting the removal of names from the draft register.  Having considered these claims in the usual way at the revision court sitting in Clifden, the county registrar was not satisfied that the details in the majority of the claims were accurate and he rejected the majority of them at the revision court hearing.  In fact, I understand that he accepted only about 40 of these claims, and most of those claims related to people who had died.</P>
    <P>I think the House will agree that this case shows that these are strong safeguards in the existing arrangements to make sure that no one is unfairly removed from the register.  I have no information about who made the claims in this case and on what grounds they were made. The important point is that the claims were wrong and were rejected.  The people concerned were properly registered.</P>
    <P>We all agree that no one should be unfairly removed from the register but the motion is based on information which is not accurate.  At any rate I think that it is important that there should be a method available for people to make <Col N="796" /> claims to have corrections made to the draft register.  We would all like to see an accurate register.  We need help from people in general to ensure that all qualified people are registered and that any names wrongly included in the register are removed.  I think this is a very basic democratic right.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the register is as accurate as it should be.  In fact, it is no better or no worse than the standard of the register of electors in other countries. However, the aim is to improve the accuracy of the register as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator when he says that it is wrong for individuals or parties to make wild or unfounded claims for correction of the draft register.  This is wrong and unhelpful.  Reports have been received this year of unfounded claims in different parts of the country.  The proximity of the local elections has, no doubt, stirred up interest, particularly among people who do not usually show an interest in the register.  I welcome this increased interest as it is important that the draft register be examined by the general public and by those especially interested in politics, to ensure its accuracy. This should be responsibly done and nuisance or invalid claims should not be made.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 April 1991.</P>
