    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Second Stage of item 1 will be taken today, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes, and Members may share time.  Item 2 is statements on literacy and primary education, on which the contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I draw the Leader's attention to the recently published report on the Presidency by the All Party Committee on the Constitution.  We should debate this in the House; I realise we are approaching the end of the session so I ask the Leader to make time available in the next session. He might follow the precedent of an earlier occasion and invite the Chairman of the all party committee, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to respond to the points made &mdash; it was useful when his predecessor, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, came here on an earlier occasion.</P>
      <P>We are approaching the last two weeks of the session, the time of year when business appears from nowhere and enormous pressure is applied to have all Stages of Bills taken before Christmas. The Leader will have the full co-operation of this side of the House on important Bills but I ask him to steel his nerve against taking Bills which are not urgent and have been around for a long time but which he is told must be passed in three days.  The Bill on the Bretton Woods Agreement, for example, has been in a Department for four years &mdash; it is an insult to the Houses of Parliament to say we should pass it in a couple of days.  We are being asked to rubber stamp legislation without giving it proper attention.  When a plethora of Bills lands on the Leader's desk, as they are now doing, we will co-operate when they are urgent and essential but the House should not rush them through without proper scrutiny.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Order of Business. Could the Leader indicate a time for item 2?  The Minister for Education and Science is busy this morning so I presume it will not begin before 2 p.m.</P>
      <P>I have previously requested that we debate the reports of committees.  That should be structured into the operation of this House &mdash; on a certain number of days in each session reports from joint committees of the Houses should be discussed. The danger is that much of their work is not being noticed by Members who are not on the particular committee.  The work of the committee dealing with ethics in public office will require a detailed discussion in the next session so that Members will have a clear understanding of what is happening, what is likely to happen, and how it might impact on them.  This afternoon's debate on literacy will allow us to discuss the report of the Joint Committee on Education and Science. There should be more debates like that and we should work them into the business in the next session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree the Order of Business. Could the Leader clarify this afternoon's debate?  The Order Paper provides for &ldquo;Statements on Literacy and Primary Education&rdquo;. While literacy is also related to adult education we should have a separate debate on the Green Paper on adult education, published last week by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.  The Minister has opened the matter for discussion and consultation and the House should present its views to the Minister on that broadly based Green Paper, focused not only on literacy but other aspects of adult and further education.</P>
      <P>In respect of item 18, motion 30, it was a mistake that we did not debate last week the motion on overseas development aid.  It would have strengthened the views expressed to the Government on the need to provide extra money in the budget for overseas development.  It was disgraceful that the position of the Minister of State and of both Houses was not taken into account by the Minister for Finance.  It leaves the Minister of State in an unfortunate position with which she must deal.</P>

      <P>I ask that a motion on the matter be placed on the Order Paper as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government when the long promised fundamental reform of planning legislation will be brought before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest an amendment to the Order of Business to allow statements on the treatment of Senators yesterday.  The House adjourned to allow Senators to be present in the Dáil for the budget debate.  The Department of Finance <Col N="779" /> insulted this House by its treatment of Senators in refusing to give us copies of the Minister's speech although they were requested on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>The House was treated very badly yesterday in the Dáil Chamber by the Minister for Finance.  This put Senators in an invidious position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Cox.  I received a copy of the speech because I requested it as this side's spokesperson on Finance.  However, I support the Senator's point; perhaps the Committee on Procedure and Privileges could consider the matter to ensure it does not happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat my request to the Leader to organise a discussion rather than statements on BNFL's proposal for the extension of reprocessing facilities at Sellafield.  This issue needs to be discussed properly in the House with the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.</P>
      <P>As I requested last Thursday, I ask the Leader to organise the laying before the Houses of the draft report and the final report and summary on rail safety in view of the fact that the consultants' independent report was amended by officials under the direction of the Minister.  I ask the Leader to ensure that both reports are laid before the House for the benefit of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Cox's request for statements.  I ask the Leader to ensure the system is changed to allow Members of Seanad Éireann to receive a copy of the Minister's speech as it is being read to Deputies in the other House. It appeared that the media and all others in the Dáil had the speech yesterday, but Senators could not get copies.  I ask the Leader to ensure the system is changed so that Senators are afforded the same treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the views expressed by Senator O'Toole regarding the reports of committees. Much worthwhile work is done by the committees but unless one is a member of a committee, one has no idea what is taking place in others.  Senator O'Toole's suggestion is very useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with the views expressed by Senator Cox.  I requested a copy of the Minister's speech yesterday but I was refused.  I respect that Senator Doyle received a copy as a spokesperson, <Col N="780" /> but everybody in the other Chamber, with the exception of Senators, had copies of the speech. This is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday there was a comprehensive debate on water pollution.  Will the Leader arrange a debate as early as possible in the next session on litter pollution?  The Government has the wit, wisdom and guts to take the taxation system, which was riddled with anomalies and threadbare from constant stitching and darning over the years, and turn it upside down in one budget.  It defeats me that the same Government cannot tackle the issue of litter, which is disgusting and appalling with the same level of energy and intention.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on the issue.  When I look up during Christmas I will see jingle bells, but when I look down I will see cans and rubbish everywhere.  I find this difficult to contend with as a citizen of the Republic.  There is a litter pollution law on the Statute Book.  This is good legislation but it is not being enforced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Senator Cox and others.  It is very significant that this matter was raised conscientiously by a member of a Government party.  This shows that it is not a partisan issue but a matter about which we all feel very strongly.  I have attended many budget debates and in the past it was always the practice to hand out copies of the Minister's speech to Members of the Upper House.  Yesterday officials of the House were reading the speech in front of us.  Members of the press and the diplomatic staff all had copies, but Senators did not.  Will the Leader ascertain who made that decision?  That person should be given the benefit of the views of the House.</P>
      <P>It is unacceptable for a person, regardless of whether they are a political being or an official of either House, to decide that this material should be made available only to spokespersons.  This negates the existence of Members who are Independent. Members on the backbenches are expected to contribute on all issues and the budget is a very important and significant matter. I spoke during the debate on the budget which was initiated by the Independents last night.  It was the first occasion on which the House had such an immediate contribution on the budget. All the Independent Senators spoke but it cannot be said that we have an official spokesperson. The position yesterday was insulting to this House.  It may have been an oversight or a technicality. Given the season perhaps we should not make too much of a meal of it, but we should ensure that it never happens again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-circulation of the budget speech to Members is an important issue.  It showed a lack of respect to Members of the House that the speech was not available to us. I was in a similar position to Senator Doyle.  In addition, I was due to deal with the matter on live television at 6 p.m. I had to wage a considerable battle to get a copy of the speech.  When I left Leinster House during the Minister's speech, I met a journalist on the plinth who was carrying a copy under his arm.</P>
      <P>There are good reasons that speeches should not be circulated in advance, particularly the budget speech.  Everybody knows why that is the case.  I do not suggest copies should be placed in Members' cubbyholes beforehand, but if one attends the Minister's address to the Dáil, one should be given a copy of the speech.  This should be the beginning and end of the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by Senator Cox.  I was listening to the radio before 5 p.m. yesterday and Mr. Myles Dungan said that he had a copy of the Minister's speech but he could not run ahead of him.  Many people had copies and it is a shame that Senators did not.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to come to the House and withdraw the comments she made about Senator O'Dowd last week?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring the serious levels of overcrowding on trains coming into and leaving Dublin to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise?  Hundreds of people are forced to stand between carriages, giving rise to concern for public safety.  Many of the trains leaving the city are full at the first station and become more dangerous and overcrowded as they travel down the line.  Urgent and immediate action must be taken to protect the public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the abolition of duty free?  The Taoiseach stated yesterday that the best we could hope for was a postponement of the introduction date.  We should have a full debate on this important issue.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for presenting me with his own copy of the Budget Statement at a late stage yesterday afternoon.  I was expected to come into the House at 6 p.m. for a debate on it.  I do not see how one could be expected to contribute in a meaningful way to such a debate having had little time to prepare for it.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning requested a debate on the report on the Presidency and suggested that the chairman of the All Party Committee on the Constitution, Deputy Brian Lenihan, be present.  I will leave time aside for that early in the next session.  I thank Senator Manning and other Opposition Members for their continued co-operation.  We have a heavy workload of legislation over the coming two weeks.  I also share Senator Manning's concern about the Bill on the Bretton Woods Agreement.</P>
      <P>In response to Senator O'Toole, item 2 will not be taken before 2 p.m. and I will attempt to ensure that the same number of reports continue to be discussed in this House in the future as have been in the past.  I assure Senator Gallagher we will have further debate and discussion on the Green Paper on adult education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Cox, Doyle, Moylan, Coghlan, Norris, Dardis, Callanan and Bonner referred to the unavailability of the Minister's Budget Statement yesterday.  This was regrettable and will be taken on board by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I assure the House the matter will be looked into urgently.  When I asked an usher for a copy of the statement, I was provided with one. It is not acceptable that members of the public and the media had a copy of the statement in advance of Oireachtas Members, especially when this House was due to debate the matter at 6 p.m. yesterday.  I congratulate all Senators who contributed <Col N="783" /> to the very worthwhile debate yesterday evening which served to enhance this House.</P>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle called for a discussion on reprocessing at Sellafield and I will facilitate that. I am also mindful that we must take statements on 1798 over the next two weeks; Senators from the south-east, in particular, should prepare themselves for that.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill requested an urgent debate on litter pollution and I will facilitate that.  We all received a press release from Senator Chambers this morning and I am in agreement with it. Senator Kett welcomed the provision of £4 million for disability services in the budget.  The Bill on the National Disability Authority will be initiated in this House next week and I look forward to a worthwhile debate on it.  I will pass Senator O'Dowd's comments on train overcrowding on to the Minister and I will leave time aside for a debate on duty free early in the next session.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1998 [Certified Money Bill]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid) Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1998, is to increase the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of Exchequer grant-in-aid which may be paid to Bord Fáilte Éireann to support tourism capital development works which are non-accommodation related in nature.  Funding for this purpose is provided to Bord Fáilte under subhead B2 of my Department's Vote.</P>
      <P>At the outset I should say that provision for this statutory limit was first introduced under section 2 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1975, and most recently amended by the Tourist Traffic Act, 1995, which increased the limit to £22 million. Taking account of the 1998 subhead B2 Estimate, this limit is set to be exceeded before the end of this year.  The Bill proposes that the limit be increased to £50 million to enable continued payments to the end of the year and in future years.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that the Bill does not imply any commitment to provide funding at any particular level nor does it commit either the Government or the Oireachtas to any financial commitments, including the continuation of any particular grant scheme.  The provision of capital funding to Bord Fáilte will, as always, be considered on a yearly basis in the annual Estimates exercise and the budget.  In this context, Senators will be aware of recent proposals in the 1999 Estimates to provide an additional £8.5 million over the next two years to Bord Fáilte for capital expenditure which is covered by this statutory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="784" /> From the point of view of our economy and the Government's strategy for its development, Bord Fáilte is working with one of Ireland's most important and vibrant economic sectors.  Irish tourism has seen a dramatic acceleration of growth over the period 1986 to 1996 after steady growth over the previous 15 years.  This growth has now continued consistently for more than a decade and has contributed significantly to the creation of a more mature, dynamic, expanding and profitable economic and business sector.  The number of overseas visitors has also increased, growing from 2.4 million in 1988 to more than five million in 1997, a significant increase by any standards.</P>
    <P>Tourism is now our second biggest industry, supporting almost 120,000 jobs &mdash; that is one in 12 of the workforce &mdash; and, when domestic tourism is taken into account, it generates almost £3 billion annually.  With economic indicators such as these it is easy to see why tourism has become the vital force in the Irish economy that it is.</P>
    <P>The industry generally is performing today at a level of success unprecedented in its history with new records achieved each year in visitor numbers and in the yield in overseas revenue.  Figures released by the Central Statistics Office for the first six months of this year confirm that growth in visitor numbers to Ireland from abroad is running ahead of target at almost 11 per cent and the available figures for revenue are up by almost 13 per cent.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte estimates on tourism revenue over the past number of years show that growth rates have been achieved in all regions of Ireland which are better than international and European annual averages.  The continued promotion of a good regional spread and extension of the tourism season are vital elements in our tourism policy, and while it is clear that we cannot direct tourists to areas where they do not wish to go, we can encourage and promote the beauty and quality of facilities and the all round attractiveness of our lesser known regions.</P>
    <P>Last year I secured a Supplementary Estimate of £5 million for special international marketing with a specific regional emphasis.  Some of these initiatives targeted a range of advertising, publicity and other activities in the area of niche marketing on activities such as angling, golf, equestrian and walking.  Another dealt with providing additional funds to integrate and supplement local and regional marketing activity consistent with national destination spend.  Advancing the seasonality profile of Irish tourism has also received support with the promotion of early season events such as the national St. Patrick's Day festival.</P>
    <P>Industry, working in conjunction with their regional tourism authorities and Bord Fáilte, can put in place sound business strategies to successfully market their facilities.  The evidence would suggest that those operators who apply professional marketing practices are winning market <Col N="785" /> share over those that do not.  For my part, I will try to ensure &mdash; in so far as I can &mdash; that the benefits of the continuing record growth in tourism are spread throughout the island as a whole. In this context, Senators may also be aware that this week &mdash; this evening in fact &mdash; I will be seeking approval, by way of Supplementary Estimate, for a further allocation in 1998 specifically to assist Bord Fáilte's marketing campaigns with a view to maintaining tourism growth and addressing regional spread.</P>
    <P>Access both to Ireland and within Ireland is a very important issue.  Ireland as a destination, on the western edge of Europe, has access challenges to face and solve.  While much has been achieved in this regard by my colleagues in the areas of air, sea and road, it is clear that much remains to be done.  For my part, I will continue to pursue with my colleagues in Cabinet the development of more competitive, regular and good access links with a particular emphasis on exploiting the opportunities for expanding access to the regions generally.</P>
    <P>The benefits of a vibrant and expanding tourism sector have led to continuing and increased emphasis on the sector as an engine for growth in successive national economic programmes.  The results of this have become very evident to anyone who has travelled around the country in recent years.  The discerning visitor can now avail of new and disparate tourism infrastructure, such as conference, leisure and all weather facilities which have added a new dimension and quality to the type of tourism product available in Ireland.  The scale of private investment which has flowed into tourism over the last decade is also highly evident in the development of hotel facilities and in the upgrading of accommodation and hospitality facilities generally to meet and even exceed international standards.</P>
    <P>As we face the remainder of the decade and into the new millennium, the challenge to create further economic growth and employment has never been greater.  The targets for our tourism industry are ambitious and ongoing investment in marketing, product development, training and visitor services is vital to maintain growth in the face of increased international competition.</P>
    <P>The substantial support of the European Union for the tourism industry over the past ten years now has proved to be a sound investment. Senators may be aware that some time ago my Department produced a draft discussion paper on the development of tourism into the next century in the run up to the negotiations for the next round of EU Structural Funds.  Preliminary consultations with the State tourism agencies and the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation have already taken place on these proposals, and indeed on many of their own proposals.  The objective of this exercise is to prepare the most persuasive case possible for the continued partnership between the Government, the tourism industry and the EU in the further development of Irish tourism.  Tourism has already shown itself <Col N="786" /> as a powerful instrument of regional policy, assisting in raising incomes and providing employment in the more remote and less advantaged regions and my wish is for that to continue.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the progress of the peace process and the improved prospect of peace and stability in Northern Ireland will be of substantial benefit to Irish tourism, not only in the British market but in our markets worldwide. Tourism's future requires that the principle of co-operation be at the centre of our policies and marketing decisions as we work together to promote the whole of Ireland in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</P>
    <P>There is already much to build on in this regard as there has been significant cross-Border co-operation at both departmental and agency level for some time.  At agency level, co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, has existed since the 1960s and this has been considerably strengthened and facilitated in recent years by the availability of financial assistance for marketing and product development from both the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland.  In addition, there have been regular contacts and co-operation between the two Departments on a range of issues of common interest in the tourism area.</P>
    <P>As we approach the new millennium there will be a major focus on the twin issues of economic and monetary union and on finding the right way forward for the industry when the current operational programme for tourism ends.  For the tourism industry in particular, the introduction of EMU next January will mean, not only the adapting of our marketing strategies to a new scenario but also the modification of computer technology and the provision of relevant training.  With this in mind, a guide to the key issues of EMU for tourism businesses was produced as a co-operative venture between Bord Fáilte, CERT, ITIC and AIB specifically for the tourism industry. This, of course, is in addition to the national EMU awareness campaign and other private sector packages and initiatives.</P>
    <P>Over the past decade or so we have witnessed &mdash; and indeed continue to witness &mdash; the greatest programme of tourism infrastructural development in our history which has involved huge levels of assistance from EU sources.  This assistance, amounting to £220 million alone under the current operational programme for tourism, has played a critical part in raising the standard and quality of Irish tourism and in bridging the gap between it and international destinations, identified in the two co-funded programmes to date. In view of the resultant progress achieved, it is probably unlikely that EU assistance will be maintained indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Industry self-sufficiency to a far greater extent will become the order of the day and this is a scenario for which we should be properly prepared. It is important, therefore, that with the advent of the euro we must not allow a perception to develop, especially abroad, that Ireland <Col N="787" /> might be on the way to becoming a high priced holiday destination for foreign tourists.  This means that everyone in the industry must resist the temptation to edge up prices here and there for one service or another.  While the issue of prices is a commercial one for the industry at large, and one in which neither I nor Bord Fáilte have any direct control, I will continue to use every opportunity to impress upon the industry that competitive and fairly priced products must be offered to all our visitors.  I want our overseas visitors to be able to say to their friends and work colleagues when they go back home that they got good value in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I mentioned the fact that the number of visitors to Ireland over the past ten years had more than doubled.  Based on Bord Fáilte and industry growth projections for early in the next century the number of visitors coming to our shores is set to rise to over seven million by 2003. This will present us with a number of new and additional challenges with regard to environmental and congestion issues and in the provision of adequate visitor services.  With this in mind I launched a special pilot tourism and environmental initiative earlier this year under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 seeking practical proposals to address issues where tourism and the environment interface.</P>
    <P>The intention of the initiative is to encourage projects which would point to ways of supporting tourism development, while at the same time, sustaining the environment on which it is based. Examples of the types of projects sought included visitor management schemes such as those proposed for individual sites, towns or cities, environment awareness projects and innovative litter control systems to address one of the scourges of modern Ireland.  I am pleased to say that this initiative has already come to fruition with a number of projects recommended for consideration by the project development management boards. Once approved, the successful projects will be closely monitored so as to provide a useful insight into how best practice can actively be promoted among the wider tourism industry.</P>
    <P>With this increased level of visitors it is important that the services provided by our tourist information offices keep pace with the changing times and increasing expectations of tourists, both domestic and foreign.  Investment programmes are being undertaken by the regional tourism authorities to expand their network and to upgrade existing facilities.  The major part of the money provided to Bord Fáilte under subhead B2 since 1995 has been allocated by Bord Fáilte to the regional authorities towards the implementation of these investment programmes.</P>
    <P>Other areas benefiting from expenditure allocations by Bord Fáilte from subhead B2 include the development of regional tourist amenity sign-posting and regional heritage and tourist projects.</P>
    <P>This work has also benefited from European Regional Development Fund support under the <Col N="788" /> current operational programme for tourism.  By the end of the programme approximately £10 million will have been contributed by the State and EU for these developments, including the provision of a new computerised system to improve the quality and efficiency of information and reservations services.  The number of visits to tourist information offices last year was 4.3 million, an increase of 139 per cent on the 1998 total of 1.8 million.  Over the same period the number of bed nights booked through these offices increased by 153 per cent to 670,000.  The tourist information office network is, therefore, a vital ingredient in the tourism infrastructure, providing as they do an after sales service to visitors as well as being a major player in the promotion of home holidays to Irish holidaymakers.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill deals with grant expenditure for the development of tourism related facilities and amenities.  The existing statutory limit on grants of this nature is £22 million and expenditure up to the end of 1997 amounted to £21 million. The 1998 allocation for this type of grant expenditure is almost £1.1 million bringing aggregate expenditure on amenity development by the end of this year to over £22 million.  The current statutory limit last set in 1995 must, therefore, be increased to ensure completion of this year's amenity development programme.  I am accordingly proposing that the limit be increased from £22 million to £50 million.  Thank you, a Chathaoirligh.  I look forward to the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tourism opportunities in this country are enormous.  I congratulate the Minister for providing extra facilities and funding for the tourism, our second largest industry.  With the way the farming sector is suffering at the moment it will probably be our largest industry.</P>
      <P>However, there are many areas where the tourism industry is not working to its full potential. Bord Fáilte does not seem to blend with the other regional authorities and tourist boards like Leader programmes, Cork/Kerry Tourism and many others.  I will debate this issue in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and other Ministers for ensuring that we are keeping up to date with the industry.  Ireland is availing of a golden opportunity.  We are very lucky we can provide a type of atmosphere and character that more and more people want to experience but we want to continue doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made some very strong points in his report.  I welcome the fact that he said he does not have any direct control when he looks for money, that he does not have any right to question prices, particularly the £3 extra per night that tourists have to pay for staying in Dublin.  This is a very sad reflection on tourism.  We should not allow an extra £3 to be charged in Dublin or the eastern region.  We must strongly emphasise that a tourist coming to Ireland must be welcomed. Tourists should leave here saying they got very <Col N="789" /> good value for money and that they enjoyed their visit immensely.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that 1.8 million people visited tourist boards in 1998.  When we compare the 1998 tourist figure of 1.8 million visitors with the years 1996 and 1997, we realise that was not a bad figure.  Other countries were in a deep depression during those two years.  Ireland is also a very popular destination.  People want to be seen to be visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the relationship that is being built up between the North and South. We must promote the island of Ireland because it will be more profitable for more people.  Bord Fáilte must emphasise that they want people to visit the entire island, to fly into Belfast, visit Cork, the West and other regions.</P>
    <P>Some people felt that the industry got off to a late start in some of the regions this year because Shannon Airport is not being utilised.  In Dublin and the eastern region, the opposite would be true.  Tourists fly into Dublin and they are not inclined to travel west.  The Minister should push at Cabinet level to ensure that the infrastructure is improved to get people to travel at little cost to the other regions, especially the south, west and south-west.  Travellers from Europe are very important, but even more important are the English, Scots and Welsh who, unlike travellers from the Continent and America, spend all their money.</P>
    <P>There is a big problem with tourists staying on the east coast.  It is a sad reflection on us.  We need to provide better facilities, such as coaches and railways.  Bord Fáilte is not promoting the rest of the country as well as the east coast.  West Cork is not promoted enough.  Count Kerry will do exceptionally well because of the proposal to include it in the region seeking qualification for Objective One status in the next round of EU Structural Funds.  Much work has gone into that and I congratulate those concerned who availed of the opportunities before them.</P>
    <P>A huge number of beds have been made available in Dublin.  While it means that more people will visit the country we do not want all the beds in the one area.  We must regionalise to ensure other areas are promoted.  Bord Fáilte is not doing enough work here.  There were reports over the summer of disharmony in the board.  This is undesirable as it creates uncertainty about future strategy.</P>
    <P>The Minister expressed the hope that seven million tourists will visit the country before 2003. We should reach that target by 2000.  While there has been an increase from 2.5 million to five million over the past ten years, the success of the economy should ensure that the rate of increase will accelerate.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a great place to visit.  Many people like it.  I have travelled to many countries, including the west coast of America, but they do not compare with Ireland.  We have the right attitude, excellent food and an atmosphere that is incomparable. We should not create an impression that <Col N="790" /> certain parts of the country should not be visited or that certain categories of tourist are not welcome. In this regard, price control and food quality are important elements of our tourism package. Not all venues can or should be like Ashford Castle, although they serve a specific market.</P>
    <P>We do not avail of the opportunity to use those who represent the country abroad, whether they are from the North or the South.  When our international sports representatives, recognised throughout the world as the best, appear on television they rarely if ever wear a symbol of the country, whether it be of Bord Fáilte or, preferably, of the island of Ireland.  Yet, they display other kinds of symbols from sporting organisations, clubs, etc.  The only national symbol I have seen was Michelle Smith's swimming hat, which displayed a shamrock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>None of them is from Cork. There is a danger in giving money of that kind to organisations because they can bury it.  I am not concerned with sporting organisations but with individuals in sport.  Nobody would suggest that staging the first leg of the <i>Tour de France</i> was not worth the cost.  It was an excellent idea, irrespective of what Minister made the decision.  It would cost very little to ask our international sports people to wear a symbol of the island of Ireland. Why are we allocating between £20 to £50 million to the promotion of Ireland when this opportunity is not being availed of?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that money will be allocated to people and organisations to develop the tourism industry without any direct control to ensure they are acting in the best interests of their regions and of the country as a whole?  I disagree with that approach.  They cannot be given enormous grants to build and develop without accountability.  If we allowed that to happen we would do an injustice to our second biggest industry, which will be our biggest industry in a few years if it continues to develop and expand.</P>
      <P>Serious questions have arisen over staffing capacity.  There is a massive shortage of staff to provide a proper service for tourists.  This has mainly arisen because of the wages paid and the profits made by operators in the industry.  The Minister must address this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I also welcome the fact that the Minister is broad minded enough to recognise the opportunities available to the island of Ireland.  We should not stop here.  We need to create more opportunities and, above all, ensure that we do not become over-centralised.  The tourism industry is very centralised at present. Dublin and the east coast are doing exceptionally well.  I do not begrudge them that and I do not say it because I am a Corkman.  My concern is with the island of Ireland.  There is a general <Col N="791" /> impression that the west and south-west are losing out and that is sad.  If money is being allocated, it should be done fairly.  There should not be any impression of over-centralisation.  That would do no one any good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister Deputy McDaid to the House and thank him for his address.</P>
      <P>This is a very important Bill which gives the Minister the opportunity to further develop the tourism industry which is so important to the country.  The need to achieve a better regional and seasonal spread of tourist business must be addressed in any future plans for tourism.  If tourism is to continue to achieve its growth targets, that is essential.  This can be brought about by increased and more targeted investment in marketing to promote the various segments.</P>
      <P>A strategy for growth study published by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation this year warned that if the country failed to address the key issues of regional and seasonal spread, high levels of growth would become unsustainable after 1999.  As a result the confederation estimates that average growth per annum could fall by 5 per cent as early as the year 2000.  I can see by what the Minister said this morning that he intends to prevent this happening.  The strategy for growth beyond 2000 is very important in strategic planning for the coming decade.  The study was jointly funded by ITIC and the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, administered through the Minister's Department.</P>
      <P>Tourism has the potential to continue to grow at a rate above the international average, given certain circumstances, such as adequate investment in marketing and product expansion.  Tourism in Ireland could achieve more than seven million visitors in 2002 compared with the current figure of five million, with revenue growing to in excess of £2.5 billion.  The strategic study sets out the industry's potential for the period until 2002 and seeks a more influential role for the industry in the management of tourism growth over the next five years.</P>
      <P>The study also calls for a commitment from the Government to a five year funding programme and a new partnership between public and private sector.  It calls for contact between the Government and industry which would commit both sides to the sustainable development of the tourism industry so that it can provide an adequate return to those who invest in it and more jobs and contribute to the economy of the State.</P>
      <P>It is accepted that tourism can continue to achieve high growth rates but the level of growth will depend on the industry's capacity to influence measures which will ensure that a more balance regional and seasonal spread of visits is achieved.  Increased and more targeted investment in marketing to the holiday market is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> The study, which forecasts the performance of the main market, envisages tourism growing from an influx in 1997 of five million overseas visitors with revenue of £1.8 million to a potential figure of 7.8 million with a revenue of £2.5 billion by 2002.  This requires an average growth rate of 9 per cent in numbers and 9.5 per cent in revenue over that period, figures which are substantially ahead of international forecasts.  A lower level of growth scenario in the study envisaged tourism numbers of more than seven million visitors and £2.2 billion in revenue during the same period.</P>
    <P>The report emphasises that there must be a new approach to managing tourism flows.  This is something which Ireland must pioneer.  I welcome what the Minister said about this.  He is certainly looking ahead.  Specifically we must avoid levels of congestion which would damage our environment and our reputation as a relaxing destination and, at the same time, spread the economic benefits over a wider area of the State. Tourism maintains in excess of 120,000 jobs in the economy.  Last year the Government received in excess of £1 billion in revenue from foreign visitors &mdash; five pence of every pound spent by tourists. The direct return to Government reinforces the industry's argument that the Government must increase its funding for overseas promotion.</P>
    <P>I compliment Bord Fáilte on its excellent presentation at the trade fair in London and all those who are working so hard to ensure the maximum benefit accrues to this country from tourism.  The Minister's contribution and support for all Irish people promoting tourism was admirable.</P>
    <P>We must look at improved tourism yields, extend the tourism season and spread tourism into regions which have not benefited to the same extent as others.  One of the points touched upon by the Minister in his London speech was co-operation between North and South in tourism. We all know that the British-Irish Agreement established a framework for developing relationships between the people on these islands.  Valuable work is being done by many organisations to develop reconciliation and mutual understanding between the traditions in the northern part of our country.  The Minister emphasised that we must look at this on an all-Ireland basis to ensure the maximum development of the island in relation to tourism.  There are many people in the North of Ireland who have never visited the Twenty-six Counties and many people from the Twenty-six Counties who have never visited the North.  There is a great opportunity to open that up and spend our money within the island.  to ensure maximum support for the creation of jobs North and South.</P>
    <P>Tourism is recognised in the British-Irish Agreement as one of the areas of co-operation which should be overseen by an implementation body.  Although the target date for determining areas of joint activity has shifted and negotiations are continuing, it is reasonable to assume that tourism will be one of the areas where there will be closer co-operation.  It is the aim of the Minister <Col N="793" /> and his Department to ensure there is real co-operation between the North and South.</P>
    <P>There are other opportunities to explore under the Co-operation Ireland programme.  We must ensure that the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will support this programme.  The question arises of how best to develop partnership and secure support in this area.  We must ensure every effort is made to develop every avenue open to us in relation to tourism.  It is important to have cross-Border co-operation, cross-Border initiatives and joint cross-Border projects.  Everyone concerned must co-operate at all levels.  There are many unexplored areas and people can now travel throughout the country North and South.  A greater number of people go on cycling tours and visit heritage centres.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned developing areas that have not been developed heretofore.  I would support a county structure for tourism.  Many small groups such as farm guesthouse owners and leisure centres try to work on their own to promote tourism.  They sometimes spend a substantial amount of money and achieve very little.  A county or regional structure would greatly benefit these groups.  There is an onus on local authorities to appoint tourism development officers to liaise with the Department and the regional boards.</P>
    <P>Many areas in the midlands do not benefit from tourism.  Clonmacnoise had only 170,000 visitors last year.  I compliment the Minister for the support he has given to leisure facilities in this region in the recent past.  People can now visit County Offaly and the midland region and stay overnight to enjoy the facilities.  The Minister made financial aid available to develop facilities in the region.  This is money well spent.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the work he is doing in the area of tourism.  People involved in this area recognise his contribution to the promotion of the industry.  In the past couple of years, particularly during the Minister's term in office, growth in tourism increased substantially. In the Border region it increased by 32 per cent; the Dublin region, 48 per cent; the midlands east, 47 per cent; my area of the midlands, a massive 54 per cent; the mid-west, 43 per cent; the south-east, 64 per cent; the south-west, 30 per cent and the west 23 per cent.  All organisations should work with the Minister to ensure maximum support in the area of tourism North and South. When the Minister put this initiative forward at the trade fair in London it was well received.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  The Bill increases the limit on the amount of money made available by the Exchequer to Bord Fáilte for capital works and tourism development.  I compliment Bord Fáilte on marketing the tourism product abroad. However, I have reservations regarding its involvement in capital development of tourism products in Ireland, particularly in recent years.  I will declare my interest straight out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="794" /> I am involved in the development of a heritage centre in Tullamore.  This will portray the industrial history of the area for visitors and school groups and will provide a tourism centre in the town.  In recent years, while we have managed to get capital support of a considerable nature for the project, it has been a most frustrating experience dealing with the various committees, subcommittees and bureaucratic levels involved in the decision making process.  This comes under the remit of Bord Fáilte and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  As a result of the extra money allocated under this legislation, projects and promoters throughout the country should get a much faster response to the proposals they put forward.  People spend considerable amounts of money developing proposals to an advanced stage.  It is most frustrating to have to go to several committees and have projects sent up and down the line before a decision is reached.  This has a debilitating effect on people's enthusiasm and energy and on the financial commitments they are prepared to make to capital developments in the area of tourism.</P>
    <P>Regarding the new heritage centre in Tullamore, we initially managed to secure a commitment of more than £600,000 from the fund administered by the Department to support the project. We succeeded in building a very strong partnership involving the local authority, the community sector, the commercial sector and the statutory agencies.  However, when the project reached the demolition stage and subsequently brick was built upon brick, the fact that we had been successful in getting a commercial company to commit money to it reduced our grant by a comparable amount.  Therefore, having persuaded the commercial company to be associated with the project was of no advantage.  In the end we decided to accept the lower amount of capital grant.  In terms of meeting the running costs of this facility, it will be beneficial to have a strong vibrant commercial company associated with the project.  I ask the Minister to consider policy in that area.  If local authorities, promoters or communities are successful in building partnerships at local level, which have worked so successfully at national level and which we are now being encouraged to consider at local level, no financial penalty should result.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan and I represent a county which is divided between two regional tourism organisations. I had hoped a few years ago when the Minister's predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, was reviewing the structures for tourism development that much more focus, authority and financial power would be given to the county tourism committees which were set up at the time.  Instead, various representations were made on behalf of regional tourism organisations and other interests and the regional tourism authorities have, more or less, retained their place within their structure, while the county tourism committees have been starved of funding and power.  I do not wish to speak against any regional tourism organisation, <Col N="795" /> many of which do a good job however, their delineations and boundaries need to be looked at.</P>
    <P>An arbitrary line drawn across the map of County Offaly leaves one half of the county in the Shannon region and the other half in the Midlands East Regional Tourism Organisation region.  That, more than anything else, compounds the difficulty we experience within the county in getting tourism promoters and activists to come together and work as a unified group. We are always dealing with side issues, rivalries and envy.  We must move beyond that in order, first, to get our tourism product to an internationally acceptable level and, second, to market it in a way which will bring a return to the promoters. We cannot do that while our county is split between two regional organisations.</P>
    <P>Senator Moylan has been a member of Offaly County Council for longer than I have and he knows the county has been seeking to have that matter resolved, which it has not been so far.  At a recent meeting with MERTO it acknowledged that the split in the county was reducing the effectiveness of the effort being made in county tourism promotion.</P>
    <P>There have been many developments in recent years in the county.  There has been development of the River Shannon and Slieve Bloom areas and major investment in the Birr Castle complex and the heritage centre in Tullamore.  We are trying to market those areas as an overall product, not just in terms of County Offaly but possibly linking up with our neighbours in north Tipperary, Laois, Westmeath and other areas.  It is extremely difficult to do that when one has to deal with two regional tourism organisations.  The organisations have different policies, which is reflected on the ground in the county.  I appeal to the Minister to review that situation and to try to resolve it for the benefit of tourism promoters in the county.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what Senator Moylan said about the development of tourism, North and South, and I fully concur with the points he made.  It was unfortunate that, shortly after putting a joint marketing programme together, we then fell out, to a certain degree, about the matter of a symbol.  Symbols and signs are very important in this country, particularly in the North.  I hope we can put that little hiccup behind us and that, in the context of the new arrangements for the North and South which we hope will be agreed very soon, we can get back to a fully agreed and fully integrated plan and marketing strategy, which can only benefit both parts of this island.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give more authority and finance to the county tourism committees.  Two years ago I spent a fortnight's holiday in Fermanagh with a number of friends.  I was very impressed to find, first, that Fermanagh's district council was the authority for the promotion and marketing of tourism in the county, under the aegis of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board; second, it had significant resources at its disposal <Col N="796" /> to develop and market products; and, third, it had open, attractive, welcoming tourist information centres in a number of the main towns in the county.</P>
    <P>We do not have that level of facilities in most of the counties in this part of Ireland.  The county tourism committees, with strong input, guidance, link and support from local authorities, should be upgraded and given more responsibility for the promotion of tourism within the county and specific responsibility for the operation of tourist offices and tourism information points.  Such committees would know the best locations for such offices, how best to staff them, how to welcome visitors to their areas and give them the information and guidance they need when they arrive. If the Minister could look at that area and strengthen county tourism committees, in association with local authorities, he would be doing a very good day's work.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and the provision of extra finance for the development of tourism products. However, I ask the Minister to keep a very close eye on how that money is dispensed, to cut the red tape, to reduce the toing and froing between committees, Departments, subcommittees and review groups and to let the people who have the courage and enthusiasm to put a proposal together get a response.  The promoter of the hotel which was recently developed in Tullamore, who is well known to the Minister, has experienced great frustration in trying to get a positive response to that development.  I urge the Minister to cut the red tape and streamline the system so that when people have the courage to put a proposal together they can get quick, responsive and effective support from the Department or the agencies under its aegis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments of my colleagues and welcome the Minister to the House.  Perhaps, basking in the glow of an excellent budget, I will be forgiven for being complimentary to the Minister.  His merits are obvious and his policies, since coming into office, stand on those merits, especially the innovative manner in which he has approached his brief.  The mixture of tourism, sport and recreation was a radical and welcome one because the three overlap to an extraordinary degree &mdash; we are a sports loving nation and we also rely to an extraordinary degree on tourism income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comments of my friend and colleague, Senator Cregan, on sport lead me to put on the record an initiative which the Minister introduced within the past 12 months &mdash; the allocation of £100,000 to a number of specific sports people, the <i>quid pro quo</i> being that they would wear the Ireland logo on their sports gear in international competitions.  When one considers the huge impact made by televised sport worldwide, the presence of the Ireland logo on the sportswear of prominent Irish international athletes across a wide variety of sports was a very welcome initiative <Col N="797" /> and one on which the Minister should be complimented.</P>
    <P>The people wearing the logo include Sarah Kavanagh, who is a Formula Two motor rallyist and one of the very few women who are successful in international motor racing; Ken Doherty, who we all know very well and is an unassuming world champion whom I have had the pleasure of meeting on more than one occasion; Morgan Fox, in cycling, and Damien Faulkner, in motor rallying and racing.  Those are just some examples of sports which might not be obvious to people but which have a huge television audience, in which the good name of Ireland is being projected.  The Minister is to be complimented on that initiative.</P>
    <P>There has been spectacular growth in tourism numbers, as outlined by Senator Cregan, Senator Moylan, my friend and colleague, and the Minister. One wonders where and when it will end. Other countries where fundamental economic growth is based on tourism revenue are already beginning to send out warning signals that they are being over-visited.  I am aware that the Minister has expressed some concern in this regard in relation to some attractions, although we should not be churlish about the fact that so many people wish to visit us.</P>
    <P>When one considers the huge numbers of people who come here on an annual basis to visit various locations, the question must be put as to whether there is a need in the Department for a radical restructuring and more balanced view of tourism. If one examines the phenomenal growth in tourism and breaks down the figures one will find that Dublin and the eastern region has received huge numbers, something which is perfectly acceptable in one regard as for a long time Dublin languished behind many other European cities and was never seen as the most obvious location to visit. However, the upsurge in hotels and tourism infrastructure in general has meant there are huge numbers of people coming to the Dublin and eastern region.</P>
    <P>Greater emphasis on all-weather facilities is important as is identification of events with tourism appeal and their location in a more balanced way as happens in other countries.  For example, rather than every sporting or tourism event being held in Dublin or Cork, they should be located in other cities and towns and the infrastructure should be in place to allow this.  It is not sensible or logical for regional tourism interests to vie for international events unless they have a proper service infrastructure in place.</P>
    <P>In the context of infrastructure it is long past time that we tackled the appalling condition of many of our county roads, particularly in areas of scenic beauty.  While local authority members are encouraging visitors to our regions the roads which tourists are expected to travel on are totally unacceptable.  This is relevant to a point made by Senator Gallagher and of which I am strongly supportive, namely, the need for greater integration of services at local level.  The introduction <Col N="798" /> of special policy committees to local authorities in the past 12 months is significant.  I hope tourism interests in each local authority area will grasp the opportunity now being presented to them by being nominated to the committees and being proactive, thereby giving them a direct link to the policy making functions of local authorities, including the provision of adequate funding for improving roads leading to scenic and tourism areas.  For too long county councillors have not been as concerned with the condition of some roads in their areas as with looking after &mdash; rightly so &mdash; the more immediate needs of those who work and live in the areas. Therefore, the emphasis has been on improving road networks which have a practical impact on the day to day lives of people.  As a result tourism considerations have fallen by the wayside somewhere along the way.</P>
    <P>In County Leitrim there is a continuous battle to get even minimal funding to patch regional and county roads which may not have a high volume density of residents but which unquestionably would have far greater appeal and great potential if they were improved.  The Acting Chairman knows the area very well.  In the Slieve AnierinLough Allen valley a bus load of tourists got stuck in a ditch because the road was not good enough.  This is no longer acceptable and has subsequently discouraged tourist traffic from using the road.  The council says it has its priorities and that it will eventually get around to it, perhaps in 2005.  This sort of bad planning which excludes tourism interests should cease.  I hope the position will improve with the involvement of tourism interests, such as county tourism committees, in the SPCs.</P>
    <P>There is a greater need for co-operation between State and local agencies in terms of tourism interests.  The Acres Lake development outside Drumshanbo, my home town, is a model for the west.  It has an open air heated swimming pool, tennis courts and a children's playground in a most idyllic setting on the shores of Lake Acres which for some years has had access to cruiser traffic from the Lough Allen Canal and, with the reopening of the remainder of the Lough Allen Canal, to Lough Allen.  Yet for years a fight has been taking place between local interests, the county council and the Office of Public Works over the provision of toilet facilities.  The Office of Public Works says it is not their function to provide such facilities and the local authority says it is.  Local tourist interests do not have the necessary funds to provide a toilet facility for visitors. The result is that people are using the environment &mdash; I will leave it to Members' imagination &mdash; as a facility.  This is unacceptable, particularly in the context of an increase of millions of pounds in the tourism, sport and recreation budget. Despite this, £10,000 or £15,000 cannot be found from local authority, departmental or Dúchas funds to provide basic toilet facilities.  This situation could be echoed right across the country in the context of small but important tourist infrastructural <Col N="799" /> facilities which would help encourage people visit an area.  People leave such areas with a bad taste in their mouths.</P>
    <P>In recent years the creation of cross-Border networks has lead and hopefully continues to lead to greater cohesion between counties North and South of the Border.  Senator Moylan raised this cross-Border element.  I am a founding member of the Irish Central Border Network which incorporates Counties Sligo, south Donegal, Fermanagh, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Armagh and south Tyrone.  The network, together with colleagues in the North West Border Network and the Eastern Border Network, have co-ordinated to such an impressive degree that a series of meetings has taken place over recent months which will culminate in a meeting tomorrow in the Killyhevlin hotel in Enniskillen, which I hope to attend, to launch an area integrated plan. Hopefully the plan will include recognition of the importance of tourism.  The climate which is conducive to cross-Border co-operation is yet another example of the benefit of the Good Friday Agreement.  I wish to acknowledge as fulsomely as I can the pro-active contribution of Unionist members of the cross-Border network. They are actively involved, as we are in the South, in lobbying the two Governments and the European Union to access more funds under the INTERREG programme.  I like to think such initiatives will be given the blessing of the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister commented upon the use of Croke Park in particular for international matches and games.  The Minister is fully entitled to raise this matter and I have great sympathy with it.  However, why is it always the GAA which is asked to open its doors when other sporting organisations, through neglect, omission or even downright irresponsibility, have been unable to finance and fund sporting facilities in their games?  There is no other country in the world, especially in Europe, where a sporting organisation is constantly asked to open its facilities to another competitive sport.  If there is to be European soccer championship finals in Ireland, let the relevant sporting authorities, with the aid and assistance of the Government, build the facilities. Please leave the GAA alone and allow it develop its own facilities as it has been doing.  There is a great deal of concern when this issue is raised and people in the GAA ask why they should be singled out.  Everybody knows the GAA has made and continues to make an important contribution at local level.  I do not want to maintain the controversy, but the need for sporting facilities is a matter for individual sporting organisations. I would welcome and support the attempt of the FAI to build their own stadium.  I am a passionate supporter of sport, especially ball games; I would watch two flies going up a wall. There should be an end to the debate about sporting facilities.  Give organisations the money or let them find the money to build those facilities, <Col N="800" /> and then we can take our place among the sporting nations of Europe.</P>

      <P>The tourism industry has contributed greatly to the success of what is now known as the Celtic tiger.  The Minister said that the industry is generally performing at a level of success unprecedented in our history.  Each year new records in visitor numbers and in the yield of overseas revenue are being achieved.  Statistics from the Central Statistics Office for the first six months of this year confirm that the growth in the number of overseas visitors to Ireland is ahead of target by 11 per cent and the available revenue figures show an increase of 13 per cent.  If there is an example of an industry getting behind the economy it is the tourist industry.  I compliment the Minister on how hard he is working for the industry and the country.  He is very committed and, coming from the beautiful tourist county of Donegal, he fully understand the needs and potential of the tourism industry.  However, this success has also brought difficulties.</P>
      <P>A recent industry job fair attended by 25 companies attracted only 50 people on the Sunday and 150 on the following Monday.  The industry, in the form of hotels and restaurants, seems unable to attract workers.  This job fair was extensively advertised in Ireland and the United Kingdom, and over 1,200 people were expected. When the job fair was held in Manchester it was swamped by applicants.  There appears to be no role model to attract young people in the industry, with the exception of Conrad Gallagher.</P>
      <P>There are very few trainee bar persons coming into the industry, and it appears that there will be very few professional bar people in the industry in the future.  Training is the lifeblood of any trade, and young people do not seem interested in training as receptionists or bar people.  A training course for receptionists was cancelled by CERT this year due to lack of interest, and the industry is scraping the bottom of the barrel for receptionists.  The trained receptionist is opting for a nine to five job without pressure or long hours.  Receptionists have a heavier workload with increased occupancy in hotels.  A receptionist course with training in front office systems is being set up, but will CERT answer the call that has been made?  There is great interest in the course, but time will tell if it is a success.</P>
      <P>Restaurants and hotels are not being sold as attractive places to work in.  Many young people with social skills are not looking at the opportunities of a possible career in this field.  The ITIC has looked for a £20 million investment in marketing; an investment of £50 million would be more appropriate.  It would ensure the future of tourism for years to come.  Marketing directed at attracting new European tourists would take capital but it would pay off, especially at off peak times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More emphasis should be placed on school children in transition year gaining real experience in the marketplace over the winter, as they can <Col N="801" /> then be fully utilised in the summer.  They can then have careers in the industry.  The Department of Education and Science will have to be involved and the Minister should consider the industry's proposals.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since any of us saw an industry with such potential for employment.  People are being wooed from workplace to workplace, but those who are committed will receive a very good salary and good working conditions.  We have always been sold as Ireland of the welcomes, and the friendly smile one receives on arrival at one's destination is vital for those who work in the front of house.  They are the first people one meets on entering these establishments.  Tourists feel better when they meet a friendly Irish person who wants to show them Irish hospitality.  We should not lose sight of this; if we do, the industry will be in serious danger.  The biggest asset family run hotels have is the personal relationship with their guests.  I would not like what happens in other countries to happen here: your money is taken, you get your key and you do not see the staff again until you check out.  That was never the case in this country, and it never should, but we have a real crisis in the industry.</P>
    <P>Something will have to be done in schools at career guidance level with 15 and 16 year old students.  They should be brought into the tourist industry during their holidays to see if they like working there.  It is terrible that they do not decide what they want to do until after the leaving certificate.  They then come into the industry and think it is glamorous because of advertising. It is a seven days a week job, involving 12 hour shifts and a person must be totally committed.  If people come into the industry when they are younger and have fewer distractions, they will get used to the long hours and they will not mind working.  Neither will they expect the glamour one sees in brochures.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State knows north Westmeath very well; it is where he and I were born.  There are no hotels in that area, which has beautiful lakes such as Lough Sheelin, Lough Lene, Lough Owel, Lough Derravarragh and White Lake, near the Minister of State's birthplace.  There are beautiful forest walks in Kanturk and Mullaghmeen. There is a lovely golf course at Delvin Castle and another is being built at Ballinalough Castle.</P>
    <P>There is a range of tourist recreational facilities and opportunities in north County Westmeath. However, we do not have a centrepiece, a hotel. A hotel is being built in Castlepollard by a young man who worked hard in England for over 25 years.  He has come home and is putting his life savings into starting the hotel.  There are tremendous opportunities but there are no grants available to him.</P>
    <P>In areas where there is tourism potential and tourist attractions but which lack hotels, grant aid should be available.  A special case should be made for what we call the hidden Ireland.  The areas that have developed over the years are <Col N="802" /> doing very well.  A good infrastructure has been put in place and the Government has given substantial support through Bord Fáilte and other mechanisms.  However, there is nothing for the hidden Ireland, which comprises not only County Westmeath, but also Counties Sligo, Leitrim, Roscommon, Longford and parts of Cavan and Meath.  These are beautiful parts of the country but they need a special category status.  I am aware that the Minister for Finance made provision for some of these areas in the upper Shannon region in last year's budget.  However, I make a case for north County Westmeath and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, to contact the Minister to see what might be done in this regard.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons so many tourists come to Ireland from the UK is the reduced air fares being offered by Ryanair.  Ryanair has made a great contribution to bringing people to Ireland. If a local hurling team is in the county semi-final local people will come home from England to see the match and may come home for a fortnight if the team reaches the final.  They can do so because air fares are now affordable allowing them to fly home on a Friday night and return to England on the first flight Monday morning.  This allows them to contribute to the economy of their home parish.  This has been made possible by the efforts of Ryanair and its chief executive, Michael O'Leary.  I congratulate the company for its contribution to Irish tourism, particularly with the golden years campaigns.</P>
    <P>There is no accommodation problem in hotels around the country in the midweek.  The lack of hotel accommodation in Dublin to which people refer really only applies at weekends.  From Sunday to Thursday there is plenty of accommodation available, not only in Dublin but around the country.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Ryanair for its efforts.  I am aware that Aer Lingus has been flying on the UK routes for many years and it has also done a good job and has been a great ambassador for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The success of the musicals &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; has transformed Ireland. There are three groups touring the world with the shows, representing our country and showing off our culture.  &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; is booked out in Las Vegas for the next four months.  What better ambassadors can there be for the country than the young people in these magnificent successful shows?  The success of the shows has been mind boggling.  One of the troupes is booked out for two years in advance.  There is one troupe in America, another in Europe and a third in Las Vegas and it is going on to Australia.</P>
    <P>The Minister should encourage more people to give financial backing to the music and entertainment industry.  It never seeks Government grants. Most musicians live on a small income but they never draw the dole.  They want to make their contribution as creative people.  They are the envy of the international music business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> I support the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to the Minister my proposals for the north County Westmeath area.  The words of Patrick Farrell &mdash;&ldquo;Where is the one who does not love the land where he was born?&rdquo;&mdash; ring true for those of us born and reared in rural areas who are fortunate to be Members of the Oireachtas and who have the opportunity to make the Government aware of the concerns of our areas. We seek to have them taken into account in future legislation and in the financial allocations being made generously by the Government.</P>
    <P>Other Members will recall how difficult it was to be a public representative in the late 1980s but hard decisions made by all parties at that time have allowed us to hand to a new generation great prosperity, magnificent opportunity and a better time to be in public life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome any Bill which proposes to invest in the country.  There is no more deserving industry than tourism.  The cities are doing well and tourism in the west and other rural areas is very important.  I agree with Senator Cassidy that there are tourism black spots, even in Counties Cork and Kerry.  Although these counties do well from tourism there are areas in west Cork and on the Iveragh Peninsula in west Kerry which need help, whether by way of grants or tax concessions.  There is a lot to be done for these areas.</P>
      <P>Tourism is our second largest industry employing, as the Minister indicated, 120,000 people.  If 120,000 people are directly employed in tourism there is even more employment in the related food, travel and other services.  I have supported Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry all my life.  However, there are elements about which I am not happy.</P>
      <P>My wife and I have been in the bed and breakfast business since 1972.  Recently, vouchers have become a feature of the business.  Visitors come to the house and they have pre-paid vouchers for their accommodation.  Until a couple of months ago the voucher was worth £12.50. We had many guests paying with vouchers and I asked some of them how much they had paid for the vouchers. I discovered that they were paying £18 for a voucher worth £12.50 to us.  At least 20 companies in the tourism business, ranging from brand names to individuals, are issuing these vouchers. I am not complaining about not getting paid but that people are getting conned at some point &mdash; the voucher is supposed to ensure accommodation but it does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Until July this year the vouchers, which were approved by Bord Fáilte and the Irish Town and Country Homes Association, were for standard accommodation but 95 per cent of accommodation in my area is <i>en suite,</i> no matter what size the house.  The charge of £17 per night is reasonable. When people present the voucher, the bed and breakfast owner has to explain that the voucher is for standard accommodation and <Col N="804" /> guests must pay another £2.50, which means they have to pay £20 for accommodation they could have got for between £15 and £17.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the voucher business because there is discontent among owners of guesthouses and bed and breakfasts.  They cause untold problems; the person buying a voucher is under the impression that because a guest house is listed by Bord Fáilte, he is automatically booked into that house, but that is not the case.</P>
    <P>The tourism offices are brilliant.  I often go to them when on holiday and the staff know every nook and corner of their town, all the pubs, etc. If a person comes in looking for accommodation, the staff can check what is available on computer and can book the guest in.  This is a good system because almost all the time the guest will honour his commitment and stay.  However, the tourism office charges 10 per cent of the price for doing that, which is wrong.  The bed and breakfasts cannot reduce their price &mdash; £17 per night is extremely reasonable &mdash; but the owner has to pay £1.70 per person.  Next year, we will have to charge £20 per person in order to cover this charge.  In other countries, like France, it is not the hotel or guesthouse who pays the fee but the person requesting the information, whereas here the guesthouse or bed and breakfast owner pays. If the cost is £34 for two people, a fee of £3.40, 10 per cent of the total, is paid by the guests in the tourism office, and that is deducted from the price, so at the end of the day it is we who pay it. That 10 per cent should still be paid but we should receive our full price.  Those are problems which should be resolved.</P>
    <P>Hotels are pricing us out of the tourism business &mdash; their fees are crazy.  It is not right to charge £60 per person in an average hotel in Dublin. In most parts of the world one can get good hotel accommodation for £25 to £30 per person, and that is enough.  People are not looking for luxury.  Many hotels charging these prices do not have proper facilities &mdash; their rooms are the same as those in any guesthouse or bed and breakfast. I do not mind those that have facilities like swimming pools, gyms, indoor tennis courts, etc., charging a few pounds extra &mdash; we need those facilities because of our climate.  I shiver when I think of people being charged £1.20 for a cup of coffee in these hotels &mdash; my wife gives her guests a pot of coffee which would fill ten cups, and she does not think of it as £1.20 per cup.</P>
    <P>I concur with other speakers that tourism is valuable to the country and to all of us.  A number of towns are in the same boat as Dingle &mdash; if they lost tourism they would be ghost towns.  We must protect and appreciate tourism, and we will facilitate Bord Fáilte and the Minister, but they should listen to our views.  The vouchers must be changed, otherwise we will get a bad name and people will not accept them.  I promised the Minister I would show him copies of the vouchers.  The value of the voucher has increased from £12.50 to £14.50 but the problem is the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> I support the Bill and wish the Minister, Bord Fáilte and everyone involved in tourism well.  It is a great asset and long may it remain so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  No one has spoken about the most important aspect of tourism for the west, which is water sports.  Little is done for sailing, surfing, etc.  For instance, there is no marina on the west coast between Clare and Lough Swilly; there is a big sailing fraternity in that area but nowhere for boats to harbour overnight or in winter.  If we are to make the most of cross-Border tourism a marina is extremely important.  The marina in Bangor does well but sailing visitors go no further.  Many expeditions and competitions go to Bangor from Spain, France and England, and while they may go to the south of Ireland they miss a large stretch of our coastline.  It is time we examined the potential of water tourism.  If a race attracts 60 competitors, those are good, upmarket customers and they bring in much money.  It is most important to provide and make the best possible use of services. It is not necessary to maintain the water because it is there all year round.  However, berthing facilities for yachts and sailing boats must be provided.</P>
      <P>More should be done in relation to water skiing. This is frowned upon in some areas because individuals ski in areas where adults and children swim and this is causing problems.  However, there is plenty of water around Ireland and good management could solve the problems.  Areas could be designated for water skiing.  Competitions could be held there and people could water ski without fear or hindrance.  This would also ensure that no difficulties are caused to families at the seaside.  They should not be disturbed because their wishes should be given priority. More should be done in this area.</P>
      <P>The rough seas around Ireland produce good waves but surfing has not been developed to its maximum potential.  Surfing is a major tourism attraction and can be done all year round, perhaps even more in winter than summer because surfers prefer higher waves.  This important business has not been developed and it should be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pony rides and trekking along the seashore is another aspect of tourism which causes problems in some areas but they could be addressed through the provision of funds.  It can be a nuisance where children are playing but there are more shoreline, foreshore and commonage areas which could be developed for pony rides and trekking if money was available.  Small riding arenas could be built near the sea and children could be given pony rides.  Such areas would be contained and the difficulties would be solved. Ponies do not usually create any hassle but there are occasional incidents.  Even the best trained horses can rear up.  Yesterday in England, a cavalry horse reared up as the Queen's car drove past.  Animals can kick but if they were in an <Col N="806" /> enclosed arena, they could not get out.  This aspect of tourism should be considered.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney mentioned toilets at seasides. They are important facilities but they are difficult to maintain in some areas.  Money should be made available to provide much needed toilets.  I spent over 20 years trying to get toilets provided in the heart of Yeats country in County Sligo, but they were eventually provided.  Toilets in rural areas are expensive to maintain because people are inclined to abuse them.  If toilets are not kept properly, they are more of a hindrance than a help.  Money should be made available to local authorities to pay full-time staff in such areas for the summer months.  Toilets do not maintain themselves and there is no point suggesting that they will be looked after voluntarily.  It is a full-time job and money should be made available in that regard.</P>
    <P>Some years ago tourism grants were available for scenic drives and roads.  It is a pity these grants were abolished.  Given the plentiful supply of money in the economy, more should be done to encourage the development of scenic drives and to improve roads in rural areas of high amenity. It is important to reintroduce these tourism grants because much good work was done as a result of them in the past.  Many good roads and beautiful scenic drives were developed by local councils when the grants were available and is important that they are reinstated.</P>
    <P>Many areas of tourism need attention.  Tourism brings in much money and I welcome the interest county councils are showing by setting up units to promote tourism in their counties.  It is most important to promote tourism and I am glad the councils are once more becoming involved.  I hope grants will be made available to local authorities for the promotion of tourism.  That would be an important step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I grew up in the tourism business.  My father had a holiday camp in Skerries called Red Island Holiday Camp.  I look back on the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and realise how dramatically the world has changed.  My father produced a document in the 1960s with the headline, &ldquo;Britain invades Ireland&rdquo;, to attract attention.  He used this headline because he believed there was a future for the tourism industry.  If he was alive today, he would be surprised at the marvellous success of our tourism business.  Every effort must be made to encourage, develop and build on that success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on some of the problems of success. We are not doing enough to foresee problems and deal with them in sufficient time.  The success is undeniable.  It is around for all to see, particularly in the Dublin area.  Who would have thought a decade ago that tourism would have grown to such an extent and at such a pace?  Who would have believed that in that short time we would have created a world class diversified tourism product, geared to the needs of modern as <Col N="807" /> well as traditional travellers?  Since nobody foresaw success on the current scale we have been tardy in addressing related problems.  I welcome the debate as an opportunity to begin to face up to those problems.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, the first problem of success is that it makes one cocky.  Success depletes one's determination to get into a competitive marketplace and hustle one's product. The more success one achieves, the more one is inclined to fool oneself into the illusion that the world owes one a living and a certain amount of business is always guaranteed in the future.  This happens in almost every business in every sphere. However, one can never afford to lower one's guard.  Few businesses are more fickle than tourism. One cannot build up a tourism business overnight, but one can lose it overnight.  This has happened in the past.</P>
    <P>At present, world tourism is set on a growth path.  This is based on the assumption that the favourable economic conditions will continue. Tourism is booming in Europe and America, but it is no longer booming in South-East Asia or Australasia.  Tourism there depends critically on Japanese and Korean business and it has dropped like a stone as the economies of those countries have run into trouble.  We must be aware that this could happen in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a discretionary expenditure and can be turned off like a tap at the first sign of trouble. History teaches us that this is exactly what happens in business, and particularly in a discretionary business such as tourism.  The economic outlook for Europe and the United States over the next few years is anything but certain.  With every week that passes, it appears more likely that the malaise affecting Asia and Russia may spread globally.</P>
    <P>If one considers recent events in Wall Street, one can see how easily confidence could be eroded.  In the event of a crash, tourism would be the first area to be hit as it is a discretionary commodity.  Ireland would have to fight much harder than other countries for a share of the tourism dollar, pound, euro or whatever.  Tourism can also be affected quickly and dramatically by the outbreak of violence and war.  Thankfully, the outlook for peace in Ireland has never been better. That should not blind us to the possibility that global events could affect us negatively.  One does not need a very long memory to remember the effects of the Gulf War when international travel dried up.  In 1972, my father's business came to a sudden halt as a result of the problems in the North.  Cancellations started to flow in the day after the British Embassy was burned.  Such events can lead to an overnight tourism recession and should prevent us from becoming complacent.</P>
    <P>One must also consider the possibility of one's country going out of fashion as a destination.  One of the most spectacular aspects of our tourism growth in recent years has been the mushrooming <Col N="808" /> of demand for Dublin as a short-term destination. We would be foolish if we did not acknowledge that there is a fad element associated with that. The tourism business starts from scratch each year.  Indeed, it becomes more competitive each year as greater numbers of people are travelling more often and spending more money.  They are also becoming fussier about the manner in which they spend their money and the value they get.  It is vital we continue to invest in marketing.</P>
    <P>It is also vital to address the underlying, niggling problems which are difficult to take seriously in boom times.  They can turn out to be crunch factors if things start to stagnate.  For instance, it will be too late to solve Dublin's taxi problem when people have been completely turned off by it and informed their friends that visiting the city is not a happy experience. Recently, I met with a group of French people who were considering bringing 1,500 people to Ireland in the year 2000.  I was very embarrassed by the fact that the executives were unable to get taxis at night and I would not be surprised if we have lost out for that very reason.  It is also too late to address the issue of crime when a country has already developed an international reputation as a dangerous place to visit.  Thankfully, that issue is being addressed, particularly in Dublin.  It is too late to win back a reputation for good value when it has already been lost through the imposition of high prices.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the boomerang principle applies in regard to tourism.  It is not sufficient to attract customers once, we must encourage them to return again and again.  We, as a nation, can do that and have an attractive product in which we must continue to invest.  However, we must be aware that our success could fall apart at any moment if we put a foot wrong, even though that may not be of our doing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact the Ryder Cup is coming to Ireland in a few years' time.  Golf is one area which has great potential for the future.  I urge the Minister to ensure that what makes us unique in this area is not lost; it would be possible to use a links course although I know there are problems associated with that.  The competition should be brought to a links course rather than an internal golf course identical to those in other parts of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their participation in this debate.  A number of issues have arisen in regard to tourism in recent weeks.  On my previous visit to this House we had statements on tourism and some issues remain to be finalised.  I will deal with those when I return to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the broad support the Bill has received.  While many of the matters raised are outside my direct responsibility, they will play an important part in tourism development into the millennium.  The national infrastructure measures referred to, particularly in regard to road signage, <Col N="809" /> regionalisation and access, will be taken on board.  I will continue to pursue the development of more competitive and regular access links with particular emphasis on exploiting the opportunities for the regions generally.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan referred to regionalisation and infrastructure.  He felt Bord Fáilte was not doing much for the regions.  That is an incorrect perception. While they are lagging behind the east coast, the regions have experienced natural growth.  Difficulties have been experienced in the bed and breakfast and self-catering sectors.  It is not possible to simply erect a bed and breakfast sign any more, one must market one's product.</P>
    <P>From last year's Supplementary Estimate of £5 million, £750,000 was given to the regions for the first time to allow them to get into the area of marketing.  At least four regions were represented in London this year at the World Trade Fair.  It is necessary to produce one's marketing plans a year or two in advance.</P>
    <P>Irish sports people were referred to.  Michelle Smith was sponsored as an ambassador for Ireland although there was a slight hiccough in that instance.  The Irish logo on her swimming cap was effective, however.  Senator Mooney mentioned Sarah Kavanagh, Ken Doherty, Morgan Fox and others who advertise the Irish logo.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte is doing a good job.  I understand we are entering a new phase with North-South development.  It is easy to criticise Bord Fáilte as it is an easy target.  However, how would the industry survive without Bord Fáilte's network and experienced staff?  Although some rationalisation may be required, I do not think the industry could do without the expertise developed in this area by successive Governments in recent years. Bord Fáilte is a necessary element of our tourism marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to North-South development.  If a bus or car is set alight somewhere in the North &mdash; I have travelled through the North every week for the past seven or eight years but have never witnessed that &mdash; it is certain to be broadcast on CNN and Sky television.  The good aspects such as the <i>Tour de France</i> and others of which we are all aware are not taken into consideration. The North-South situation, the peace initiative and the British-Irish Agreement gives huge potential which we cannot afford to lose.  I am delighted we have an advantage in that I keep a good brief of communications between myself and the industry.  There has been much communication between the industry here and in Northern Ireland.  However, because there has been no assembly and no North-South bodies have been set up, it is practically impossible for the industry to get its message across.  The sooner we establish North-South implementation bodies, the better.</P>
    <P>When I met the Northern Ireland Tourist Board in New York recently I was delighted it indicated that as a result of the Good Friday Agreement there has been an 18 per cent increase in people from the United States visiting Northern <Col N="810" /> Ireland.  Senator Quinn pointed out what happened in 1972.  There is huge potential there.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher mentioned investment in capital development and particularly the Tullamore project and the division of County Offaly.  I am afraid this problem cannot be easily overcome. It should be taken on board with the authorities involved &mdash; the regional tourism authority, the tourism committee and the Shannon Development company.  The European Regional Development Fund funding for this project is a matter for an independent board &mdash; it is all EU funding.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney talked about SPCs.  There is a correlation between them.  He mentioned the regions and I have already dealt with that.  He also mentioned rural bodies and the lack of toilet facilities and infrastructure.  That comes under my remit.  Increasing the money from £22 million to £50 million will improve those types of facilities.</P>
    <P>Others mentioned sign-posting which is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I feel strongly that the Department of the Environment and Local Government should specifically state that a small percentage of funding going to local authorities should be designated for road sign-posting.  If a county tourism authority or local authority puts forward proper plans it will receive this money for tourist attractions, but the other area of sign-posting is outside of my remit.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy mentioned a number of the above points and also that there should be more financial backing for the music industry.  I could not agree more.  We have taken on board the area of sport and tourism and how sport plays a part in bringing people into the country.  One major international sporting event comes to the country each year.  This is huge indirect marketing for the country.  Hopefully we will shortly be able to announce the next one, the 2003 Special Olympics, which will be the biggest event anywhere in the world in 2003.  That will give us an added bonus.  Some 160 countries, 7,000 athletes, 28,000 relatives and 30,000 volunteers will be involved. It will be a massive event.  If we can keep such events coming into the country on a yearly basis, it would mean huge indirect marketing.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned vouchers.  I already talked to him about this matter and we have agreed to consider it.  Senator Farrell talked about prices being too high and about people being cocky &mdash; a word I have used in the past &mdash; and complacent.  We cannot be complacent with success.  That is the reason great champions and teams fall.  We are currently at the top of the European league.  There is huge competition out there, there is no question about it.  Visitors are becoming ever more discerning, as is the Irish holiday maker.  The president of the WTGC recently informed me that he checked our percentage growth figures and he agreed the figure is 11 per cent at present, with a yearly growth target of 7 per cent.  He said that we will reach our target and will probably exceed it for a number of <Col N="811" /> years to come.  However he said competition would be great in the future and our greatest market competitor in the world will be in China.</P>
    <P>We cannot take our foot off the pedal.  The Senator is correct about complacency and our thinking that we can charge high prices.  As I already mentioned to Senator Cregan I do not have control over that.  I am delighted Senators, Deputies, councillors and others using the opportunity to tell the industry to be careful about prices because it is cutting its own throat.  We want visitors, when they return to their country, to say that they got a good deal in Ireland. Unquestionably they are discerning visitors.</P>
    <P>I always talk about Dublin versus the regions. I am committed to a regional policy to spread everything as broadly as I can.  That does not mean I am against Dublin, far from it.  We have made the decision to market this island as an island destination, North and South.  Dublin has benefited hugely from access.  To market tourism in the regions I am trying to target specific areas where I feel we have been lacking.  For example the German market was down 2 or 3 per cent last year.  Nobody can convince me that someone from Frankfurt, Berlin or Dusseldorf who is in a high pressure business wants to visit another city. Next year we will target countries such as Germany more specifically towards the regions.  Dublin will continue to grow.  Cresta Holidays which operates out of the UK, recently informed me that of ten European cities, Dublin is now third on their list behind Paris and Amsterdam.  That position will remain and long may it continue. Dublin is a cosmopolitan city.  It literally never sleeps and it has that reputation.  I am delighted because as a Government Minister I am interested, as we all are, in revenue.</P>
    <P>The Senator also asked about the Ryder Cup. This brings us back to the issue of bringing major international events to this country, such as the Ryder Cup in 2005.  I do not know who will be here or who will be in Government at that stage but I hope I will be around for the Ryder Cup. That is the greatest event.  Senators will be aware that in London recently &mdash; Senator Moylan was there at the time &mdash; Ireland won Hertz Car Hire's competition as the world's best destination for golf in 1998.  The other countries which were the most forward looking in this respect were Morocco and Scotland.  However Ireland was voted the best destination for golf.  I agree that we have wonderful links courses.  We have one third of the world's links courses so we have a huge product in golf.</P>
    <P>The Ryder Cup is a matter for the PGA.  There are those who say that our large investment in it is a good lever over the next seven years.  There is no question about that.  As regards the actual site, there is much to be discussed regarding whether it will be links, parkland or inland.  I appreciate the Senators concerns.  Deputies have expressed desires for it to be on a links course. <Col N="812" /> Nonetheless I am sure we are all agreed that we are looking forward to it.</P>
    <P>Overall the outlook is very positive.  As Senators have indicated, tourism is a net contributor to the Exchequer and, with co-operation, will continue to be so.  I will deal with various points which have been raised here and in statements, regarding other problems such as sign-posting and taxis when the statement comes in at a later stage.  I thank the Senators for their contributions and if we can proceed it would be greatly appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful to the Minister for clarifying a number of points raised on Second Stage.  With regard to the increases that are now being proposed, he referred to an aspiration he has that the Department of the Environment and Local Government should be requested to set aside a specific sum of money for other elements within their brief.  In light of this I, and other Senators, commented on the poor quality of what are identifiable tourist access roads.  As the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be aware, in rural Ireland these roads tend to be low volume county roads which are accessing into areas of scenic beauty, mountains, lakes, rivers, etc.  Because of the prioritisation by local authorities over the past number of years &mdash; and thankfully we have been getting more money to address the entire road structure problem &mdash; the priority has been to identify those roads which carry a high volume of traffic, coupled with roads that need to be improved for the people living there.  We all support that view. As a result many of these other roads which are low density by implication and which are leading into tourist areas receive no funding.  There is also no specific heading under which they can be given funds unless the local authority decides to do so as part of their overall roads programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of the Minister's comments and his sympathy to the view that the Department of the Environment and Local Government should set aside money for tourist signs, would he also consider adding county roads that lead into tourist areas?  Will he also ensure that there would be a separate heading which the local authorities would have to adhere to within their overall budget?  Unless this is done, the only funding Border counties can receive for tourist roads is through INTERREG.  As he is aware, INTERREG pays only for those roads which are <Col N="813" /> directly linked across borders.  Perhaps this is only a problem in Border counties and in regions along the western seaboard because of their mountainous terrain but this issue needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>With regard to funding, the Minister clarified the position in relation to the lack of toilet and other infrastructural facilities.  Can I take it from his remarks that, when a local authority prepares a plan and submits it, it will be considered?  This Bill provides money for Bord Fáilte.  Are these proposals sent to the Department or Bord Fáilte for approval?  If these proposals are sent to Bord Fáilte how will they be administered?</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Mooney about the Minister's aspirations with regard to signposts and contacting the Department of the Environment and Local Government and setting aside a sum of money for this scheme.  Special funds should also be provided to upgrade access roads to tourist sites, particularly roads with a low volume of traffic because they are neglected.</P>
      <P>It is confusing to see 25 signs on the one signpost. Some of these signs are for different types of accommodation, all of which are necessary.  There should be a separate signpost a few yards before the crossroads which advertise tourist facilities. These signs are confusing but they are also considered attractive by tourists, so much so that they are featured on postcards.  These signposts also cause traffic jams, etc.  Will the Minister provide a sum of money for this scheme or recommend my proposal to the Department of the Environment and Local Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no co-ordination between such organisations as Cork-Kerry Tourism, regional tourism boards, county tourism boards and Bord Fáilte, yet Bord Fáilte may receive £50 million for the development of tourism related facilities and amenities.  I am saddened to hear the Minister say he has to speak to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to see if he can get proper signs. That is not fair on the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation or on us.  There should be a co-ordinated approach adopted by both Departments which would mean that, if there is one sign relevant to tourism, it should be used in all regions.  Everyone should do that or they will not get any money.  If a local authority allocates money to Cork-Kerry Tourism, they want to promote Cork-Kerry tourism.  Now County Kerry will do better because they will receive a higher amount of EU grants than County Cork and there will be petty jealousies.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made very relevant points.  A person can become very arrogant if the business is going well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the promotion of this island.  We are very lucky to have excellent sports people.  Unfortunately when Sonia O'Sullivan, an athlete, was taking part in race meetings she did not wear any Irish emblems.  Another athlete, <Col N="814" /> Catherina McKiernan, did not wear any either when she ran in a race in Amsterdam but at the time there was conflict between her and BLE. She is the world champion in that sport.  She wore sponsorship for Adidas.  I attended a function where the golfer, John McHenry who was placed third in this year's Irish Open, was also in attendance. He spoke at the function and said that he had not received any assistance.  He took part in the tournament but he was a guest of Murphy's Brewery for two days.  He is an international golfer.  Mr. Gary Murphy is another golfer but he is not a Corkman.  These sports people can do so much for Ireland with a little assistance.</P>
    <P>The World Cup was held in New Zealand this year.  Ireland won this competition when it was held in Scotland.  Our Irish representatives in the World Cup wore no Irish emblems.  Why not? How much would it cost?  A sum of £50 million will be spent but no one will ensure that sports people publicly state that they are Irish.  Is anyone suggesting that the golfers Padraig Harrington and Paul McGinley would not have liked to wear Irish emblems?  I do not believe that.  For instance, one golfer taking part in the competition wore a jumper from his local club which had the K Club emblazoned upon it.  I am not suggesting that the K Club should not be promoted but if they are prepared to do it and it is broadcast internationally while there is nothing to represent us as an island, then we should ask Bord Fáilte the reason.  Will the Minister ask Bord Fáilte why they are not doing this?</P>
    <P>I do not object to the authorities or the PGA getting sponsorship.  For example, the Swedish Government promotes its sports people and ensures that the best get the best training to ensure they will promote their country in the future.  It does this for the Ryder Cup and other events.  The Minister should compare the attire of Irish participants in the Ryder Cup with that of participants from other countries.  This competition presents a golden opportunity for the promotion of Ireland.</P>
    <P>While the Minister mentioned other participants in other sports, such as motor racing, there are many other opportunities available to Bord Fáilte.  I have spoken to sports people who have made it clear they would be delighted to wear something that represents Ireland.  If they can wear symbols of clubs and other organisations surely we can spend money getting them to promote Ireland?  If a person appears on television for ten seconds it is enough.  We should do everything possible to get those representing us at international sporting events to carry a symbol of the country, whether they be in quarter-finals, the semi-finals or the finals.  The Swedes, Scots, Spanish and French do it, so should we.  I do not refer solely to golf.  Sky Television is world class.  It annoys me to see people like Sonia O'Sullivan and Catherina McKiernan win international competitions wearing numerous symbols but none of Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> It will not be cheap, but it will pay off in the long run in terms of promotion.  If £1 million was to be spent on our international sports people we would get value for money.  We would also be assisting them in their careers to the point where they would not have to seek assistance from others.  These people put a lot into their sports and they say the want to represent Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the voucher system. I do not like the idea of a person presenting a £15 voucher that cost £18.  I understand that local tourism offices do not take a percentage when selling vouchers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have they the right to do that? Is it suggested that because they promote Senator Fitzgerald's bed and breakfast they will get, say, 10 per cent commission while the voucher that costs £18 is only worth £14 or £15?  We should not allow that.  By all means invest £50 million in tourism, indeed we should invest £100 million to make it our biggest industry because the biggest industry in the country, farming, is in decline. However, in doing so we must ensure that the best visit the country and that they get value for money and are well treated.  This is big business.</P>
      <P>We depended on tourism when the economy was very quiet in the 1980s.  We must, therefore, invest in the industry to ensure that it is properly looked after.  We should not create situations which lead to people feeling uncomfortable.  For example, if local tourism boards give information on local accommodation or scenic areas they should be able to distribute bed and breakfast vouchers.  The local tourism board represents the people and not the vested interests in the industry. In this regard, we should be able to ascertain why prices are pitched at certain levels.  Why, for example, is car hire so expensive here by comparison with other countries?  We will rue the day when we allow those involved in the private sector to get all the benefits while the taxpayers, who invest in the industry, get no return.</P>
      <P>If I wish to stay in the Cork or Kerry region I can attend the local tourism board in the Grand Parade in Cork or in Dingle or Killarney and get vouchers for all the bed and breakfasts I will stay at for the one price.  We should have the same sign, the same price and the best service.  The Minister should co-ordinate all players in the industry to use the one symbol and every local and county tourism board and Bord Fáilte should use it.  It is necessary to simplify, to enable tourists to recognise the sign they know will help them with their visit.  We should spend another £50 million on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>We all love to see the national logo, but we must also look at the managers and the main sponsors.  They want their logo displayed in addition to the national logo.  They <Col N="816" /> should be encouraged in that regard but, unfortunately, that is not happening.</P>
      <P>The huge numbers who visit Clonmacnoise have a problem with the tourism office and with Dúchas.  The Office of Public Works will not allow the tourism office take possession of the office used by Dúchas.  An extension could be built.  While the site is of great importance, co-operation could help remove what is an unsightly tourism centre.</P>
      <P>With regard to the world trade tourism promotion in London, tourists visiting the county to fish and walk want to pursue other activities, such as golf.  More co-operation is required among regional and county structures to ensure that visitors can be kept in an area.  It is important, therefore, to develop the rural blackspots referred to by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of runners and sports people, if a community applies for a grant under the national lottery, part of the agreement is that a sign is displayed saying the activity or whatever has been funded by the lottery. I suggest to the Minister that anyone in sport who receives grant aid should display the logo of Ireland.  If they receive assistance in the form of a grant they should agree to wear the logo of an organisation such as Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid) Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>These people are funded by the European Regional Development Fund which is also responsible for tourism.  I am looking at the criterion where if a club or athlete receives a certain amount, they will have to display that they are funded by the national lottery.  I agree with Senator Cregan that Ireland is now producing sportspeople who are competing at the highest levels and representing Ireland.  We sit up all night supporting them.  I have met a number of them on different occasions, but as Senators Mooney and Moylan pointed out, they all now have managers.  It costs £30,000 for a logo the size of a pound coin on a vest and over £100,000 for the most minute detail on a racing car.  I appeal to people to wear these badges and logos out of national pride.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately there is now such huge commercial activity in sport that major sponsors have followed them into the sporting arena.  Sarah Kavanagh and Damien Faulkner have appeared on the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on a number of occasions. They have proudly worn the Bord Fáilte logo on their tracksuits.  On their racing cars they have &ldquo;Ireland &mdash; island of sport&rdquo; written across the top of the car.  I agree with Senator Cregan that Irish athletes should wear symbols which identify where they are from but it is massively expensive, particularly with major sporting figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sport is a marvellous way to promote your country.  On the Bord Fáilte video, which is excellent, Ireland at its best is depicted.  In Germany recently, however, I found that there was not enough information about Irish people.  I would <Col N="817" /> have liked the video to have been interspersed with images of Liam Neeson or Phil Coulter so it was made clear that they are Irish people.  It costs a lot of money but it is worth it.  I would like to see our sportspeople showing some pride by doing that.</P>
    <P>We introduced a £1 million scheme for our best athletes.  That scheme works on a grading system, which takes in junior and disabled levels, up through the ranks from £1,500 to £25,000.  Our best athletes are now entitled to the highest grants in Europe.  In the UK they get £24,000; in Australia Aus$15,000; in New Zealand $10,000, and in Canada $10,000.  This is a scheme whereby our elite athletes qualify for grants if they have to take time off work or travel to another country. In some instances the athletes have large sponsorship deals so there had to be a cut off point and those in receipt of a certain amount of sponsorship would only receive half of the grant. That is in place for all our athletes.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Cregan and Senator Fitzgerald mentioned the voucher system.  I have asked my officials to examine this area.  It has been used as a marketing tool by the Town and Country Homes Association among others but it seems there is some disparity in the situation.  Senator Moylan mentioned the tourist office and Dúchas. I will also make inquiries into this area.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised the issue of signs.  He said that local authorities should plan in their budgets for road signs and toilet facilities.  The regional tourism authorities, which are funded by my Department, are responsible for tourist offices.  There are normally toilet facilities at those offices for which funding is available from this year.  Previously they were co-funded by the EU.  The Department has discretion in setting up tourist offices.  With regard to local authorities erecting road signs for tourists, that could be considered, although it would have to be co-ordinated with the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>

      <P>A family relative of mine who is involved in one of the &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; productions is also involved in tourist promotion, under the aegis of Bord Fáilte, which is being funded by the Riverdance production company.  I thought this was the norm but I understand it is news to the Minister and his officials.  It led me to reflect on whether the Minister might consider, in light of the international impact of musicians such as The Corrs, Boyzone, U2 and The Cranberries, the appointment of a tourist liaison officer, under this fund, whereby an individual employed by Bord Fáilte would accompany a band on a world tour <Col N="818" /> whose remit would be to promote Ireland.  As the Minister pointed out when he was attempting to identify well known personalities with Ireland, perhaps this might be a worthwhile way of using some of the money which will be available to the Department.  The detail would need to be worked out.</P>
      <P>I had experience of this for many years when I lived in England.  Many Irish bands who toured various English clubs were sponsored by air or sea companies.  Stena Sealink has been to the forefront in this.  B&amp;I sponsored a radio programme in which I was involved.  This was directed mainly at the Irish in Britain.  Ryanair and Aer Lingus continually sponsor Irish events in England.  Usually they do this because they see it as a unique opportunity to access an English audience rather than a non-national audience. Many groups such as Foster and Allen, Daniel O'Donnell and others increasingly play to non-Irish audiences.  Brendan Shine also springs to mind.  These people do marvellous work for Ireland.  I know this because I have been at many of the shows where they make no secret of the fact that they are Irish and proud of it.  They do their bit for Ireland through their association with companies such as Stena Sealink, B&amp;I, Ryanair and Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>In light of this experience, perhaps the Minister would broaden the approach to international acts. On a practical level, these companies made available tourism literature relating to Ireland.  Brochures and vouchers were left on seats.  In some cases there was an opportunity to win a prize, the prize being two weeks in Ireland with all expenses paid.  It focused attention on Ireland because when the punter, as it were, sat down the first thing he or she picked up was information relating to Ireland.  It was a soft sell.</P>
      <P>The Minister is extremely pro-active in initiating innovative ideas on an ongoing basis.  In that spirit of innovation, I suggest this might be a useful way of harnessing many international acts.  I am aware that restrictions are placed on the Minister regarding management, production and sponsorship of sports people but national pride should enter into it.  This might be a relatively inexpensive way of accessing an untapped international audience.</P>
      <P>I am interested in what the Minister said regarding accessing of funds.  I would like to think that during negotiations on the 2000-2006 operational programme the Minister will refocus funds.  On the basis of the 1994-9 operational programme, there is a need to fine tune many programmes, specifically angling tourism.  This is of particular interest in my part of the country. Angling tourism has been the Cinderella of tourism projects and has been largely neglected. There is great emphasis on game fishing and sea angling to the detriment of inshore coarse fishing. The allocation of £18 million was welcomed at the time but I understand that practically all the money was spent on game fishing rather than on coarse fishing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> This came under the remit of the Department of the Marine and begs the question, is there a need for the Minister in the run up to the Programme 2000 negotiations to initiate his own turf war to wrest from other Departments areas that are directly tourist related?  Part of the problem is that there has been an <i>ad hoc</i> approach to the tourism industry.  There needs to be greater co-ordination. In the run-up to the Programme 2000-2006 negotiations on funding, perhaps the Minister would consider a refocusing of tourism.

      <P>A new golf course was built at the Old Head of Kinsale which caused some conflict.  This is considered to be one of the finest international golf courses in the world.  The person who was involved in developing this course invited me as a guest to play a game of golf on the course.  He informed me that as a result of this development an extra 56 private planes landed at Cork airport this year.  Others land at Shannon airport, play golf in Kerry and Killarney and then travel on to Cork.  These developments must be welcomed.  The impression must not be created that only a small number of people will use these facilities.  That person told me that approximately 165,000 rounds of golf are played each year on the golf course at Pebble Beach on the west coast of America.  He also said that he wants 120,000 rounds of golf played here.  This is an excellent way to promote this country.</P>
      <P>The Minister must not allow a situation to develop whereby local authorities charge people to visit Ireland.  People do not just visit Dublin, they visit Ireland.  People have contacted me from England and elsewhere to say that they cannot afford to visit Dublin anymore because it will cost them £3 per night extra.  This situation should not be allowed to continue.  Charges must be the same throughout the country.  The Minister and Bord Fáilte are responsible for funding in this regard.</P>
      <P>Traffic was diverted from Shannon to Dublin. I am not saying that Dublin should not be promoted. Dublin is doing exceptionally well.  There are people who wish to holiday in the Dublin region and long may it continue.  Local authorities should not be allowed to cream off the benefits of tourism.  I believe John Fitzgerald is manager in the Dublin region.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with capital spending only.  Regarding the music industry, a liaison officer and national pride, national pride comes at a cost.  I would like those involved in the music industry to do as sports people do and use that national pride.  A product management board is dealing with the issue of marketing.  I understand everyone would like to see this because the Corrs and others have made their name throughout the <Col N="820" /> world.  We could possibly look at doing that; however, I do not feel it is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>In regard to angling, as Members are aware, the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources will implement section 3 of the operational programme.  However, we have been trying to promote angling, particularly coarse fishing and fly fishing.  Next year the European championships will be held at Lough Muckno in County Monaghan, to which I have already agreed to give money, and the world junior fly fishing championships will be held in Donegal.  I agree with the Senator that, like golf, we should be promoting fishing more.  I hope that with the new North-South situation, we will get many more tourists coming across the Border.</P>
      <P>The Senator's example of the Old Head of Kinsale is a perfect example of what can be done through private initiative.  They received funding under the operational programme.  I congratulate them on having their video shown on the golf channel in the United States which, according to my information, resulted in 15,000 inquiries about playing golf in Kinsale and they had to have a meeting to decide how many they would allow to come.  There are 56 extra landings at Cork Airport and such promotions can mushroom.  It is a wonderful golf course.</P>
      <P>In regard to charging visitors to Dublin, the Senator's Government brought forward the Bill which allows local authorities to levy such charges.  This is a matter for the Ministers for Finance and Environment and Local Government. However, I have expressed my severe reservations about such a charge because I think it would be anti-tourist and unconstitutional.  It has a long way to go yet and I do not know if its implications, both for the Constitution and the EU open market, have been properly thought out.  There is a huge lack of information about this and I have expressed my severe reservations on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Is cúis athás dom bheith i láthar chun an óráid seo a thabairt, agus táim buíoch don Seanad agus do na Seanadóirí as ucht an deis seo a fháil. I am particularly pleased to be here to address the very important issue of literacy, a key ingredient in terms of the assault on educational disadvantage. During the course of my address I will outline some of the measures I outlined this <Col N="822" /> morning at a press conference pertaining to educational disadvantage and the Government's plans arising out of additional resources allocated in yesterday's budget.</P>
      <P>In modern society, in spite of the massive changes brought about by information and communication technologies, print continues to be the dominant medium of communications.  It is imperative, therefore, that all members of society are equipped with the literacy skills necessary to cope with the demands of modern living.  Low or insufficient literacy skills have profound social and economic consequences for an individual's family and community.  Inadequate literacy and numeracy skills put an individual at a great disadvantage both socially and economically.  They can engender a sense of marginalisation and a fear of being stigmatised if the problem becomes known to employers, family and friends.  Improving people's literacy skills, therefore, is a high priority for me and the Department of Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Before outlining the Department's policy interventions which are designed to improve the levels of literacy in society in general, I wish to set out some recent data which underpin these interventions and which give cause for considerable optimism in this regard.  First, the House might wish to know that retention rates at second level have increased from 20 per cent in 1965 to approximately 64 per cent in 1985 and 82 per cent in 1998.  Similarly, the rate of transfer from second level to third level has increased from 11 per cent in 1965 to 28 per cent in 1985 and 50 per cent in 1995, a figure which has been exceeded in 1998.</P>
      <P>According to the 1991 census of population, only 13 per cent of the adult population had a third level qualification while almost 37 per cent of the population had not completed second level education.  Thus, the participation rates in the education system likely to lead to high levels of literacy among the adult population are only now being reached.  This improving level of involvement in education will undoubtedly impact positively on literacy standards in future, but it will be quite some time before education levels are such that the literacy potential of the majority of the population has been maximised.</P>
      <P>Recent international comparative research would suggest that the Irish education system is currently performing well and that standards have improved considerably over the past 35 years.  I could produce substantial data to support this statement, but let me focus in particular on a small set of data which illustrate this point very well.  Trends in reading development monitored by Department of Education and Science surveys over the period 1970 to 1993 show that there was a significant improvement in reading standards in Ireland between 1970 and 1980.  Thereafter, the trend leveled off.  The results of the 1988 and 1993 surveys indicated that we maintained the 1980 level but did not significantly improve on it.  An international survey carried out in 1991 by the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="823" /> International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement showed that nine year old Irish children were performing as well as or better than all but eight of 28 countries surveyed. Irish nine year old children achieved a slightly higher score than a similar population in England and Wales surveyed using the IEA test in 1996. This is the first time that Irish children achieved a higher score than British children in a comparative survey of reading ability.</P>
    <P>The Third International Maths and Science Report &mdash; TIMMS &mdash; published in 1997 showed that Irish students are performing significantly above the international average at the fourth grade and at about the international average at the eighth grade.  Thus, the achievement trend in international comparative research has been positive in the past few decades and the most recent indications are that the trend is continuing in the right direction.</P>
    <P>An area of concern is the estimation that approximately 8 per cent of students leave primary school with low levels of literacy.  However, low levels of literacy are also found in other developed countries in about 8-10 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>In dealing with literacy problems, it is necessary to adopt a two-pronged approach to intervention and remediation.  We must direct our efforts to improving the literacy and numeracy skills of school leavers.  At the same time we must tackle existing literacy problems among adults who did not benefit from the education system the first time around.</P>
    <P>Within the primary and second level systems the Department has in place a wide range of strategies aimed at supporting children who are in danger of succumbing to low levels of literacy and/or numeracy and I would like to briefly outline some of these.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the key to solving literacy and numeracy problems is to tackle them as early as possible.  For this reason the Department of Education and Science currently supports a number of programmes targeted at children in the pre-school age range.  These programmes include the pilot Early Start Programme, which is targeted on children in schools designated as disadvantaged, special educational projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, and traveller pre-schools.</P>
    <P>I have often restated my commitment to the whole area early education.  I am persuaded by the international evidence which states, in particular, that such interventions can be of immense use in tackling issues relating to early school leaving. It is for this reason that, earlier this year, I hosted the National Forum for Early Childhood Education, the purpose of which was to bring together all those with an interest in this area so that they might exchange views and indeed advise me on future strategies in the area.  I have received the report on the forum and officials in my Department have begun work on the development <Col N="824" /> of a White Paper which will set out Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>In the interim, in the context of yesterday's budget, I announced that £1.2 million will be allocated for special initiatives on early childhood education in 1999 and 2000.  It is intended that these will, in particular, focus on early education for children with disabilities.  Schools designated as disadvantaged receive additional capitation payments and in many cases concessionary teaching resources.  It is my intention and that of the Government to continue to target resources on such schools throughout the lifetime of the Government.  In fact, in the context of yesterday's budget, I announced that an additional £2 million will be made available over the next two years to establish a schools development project.  The aim is to encourage schools to develop their approaches to planning their teaching and learning strategies to meet the needs of students with particular needs, and specifically disadvantaged students.</P>
    <P>One of the key findings of any special intervention in schools designated as disadvantaged, arising out of the breaking the cycle, youth start and other initiatives, is that giving funding and resources to school planning and in-service teaching for all teachers in disadvantaged schools can have a huge impact in terms of the strategy adopted by schools and its impact on children coping with disadvantage.  School planning and in-service teaching for all teachers in disadvantaged schools can have a huge impact on the strategy the school adopts and on disadvantaged children. This is the first time dedicated funding is being put aside for the school planning approach to primary and second level schools that are designated as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the home-school community liaison scheme at both primary and secondary levels is to encourage closer links between homes and school with a view to enhancing participation in the education system.  By any standards the scheme, which was introduced by Deputy O'Rourke when she was Minister for Education, has been an overwhelming success.  I want to build on that success.  I was not happy that the scheme was added to only intermittently.  I pay tribute to the teachers involved, as they have adapted to this new role in an exceptional manner. The feedback from all sides has been very good.  This morning I announced that I would be allocating additional posts to this service so that every designated disadvantaged school at primary and second level will have a home-school liaison service available to it.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt but that the longer a person remains in the education system the better his or her chances of success socially, economically and culturally, in later life.  One of my main objectives as Minister for Education and Science, therefore, is to bring about a situation where more and more students spend longer and longer periods in the education system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> To this end, last year I launched a pilot initiative focused on students aged between eight and 15 years, who were at risk of leaving school early. The aim is to develop a range of initiatives, starting at primary level, which will identify and assist children in danger of leaving school early.  This innovative programme is supported by the European Union, and over £3 million is being allocated to this pilot project over a two year period. My aim would be to build, in subsequent years, on the positive aspects which emerge from the pilot project.  In the context of yesterday's budget, an additional £1.5 million will be made available over the next two years for retention initiatives in second level schools.  This arises from research being carried out entirely within the Department on examination and second level data.  We know exactly where retention rates are low, so we are now in a position to intervene in those areas.  We will have specially targeted interventions where retention rates are low.  This is to complete the upper secondary completion rate.</P>
    <P>The curricula offered in Irish schools must develop in response to changing circumstances if they are to remain relevant, and if Irish students are to be able to make the choices which will enable them to lead satisfying lives in the changing economic and social circumstances which will face us all in the future.  The provision of a range of curriculum options which addresses the needs of children who would not benefit from participation in the traditionally academically focused curriculum is an important part of any plan to facilitate retention in the education sector.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment &mdash; which will be placed on a statutory basis following the enactment of the Education Bill &mdash; advises me in this vital area.  The council is currently coming to the end of a major review of the primary curriculum, which will place increased emphasis on literacy and numeracy at primary level.  Implementation of the revised curriculum, which will be a huge undertaking for all concerned, will begin during 1999.</P>
    <P>The restructuring of the curriculum at second level is also continuing.  Included in the restructuring are the revision of syllabuses and the expansion of innovative programmes, such as the junior cycle schools programme, the leaving certificate applied programme and the leaving certificate vocational programme.  A new junior certificate elementary programme has been introduced to cater for a small number of students whose learning needs are not adequately met by the current junior certificate.  The leaving certificate applied and the leaving certificate vocational programmes are similarly focused on non-traditional subject and learning areas.</P>
    <P>Early assessment is the key to early identification of difficulties which might lead to problems with numeracy and literacy later in the school career.  It is with this in mind that I have committed myself to establishing a national educational psychological service.  On taking office last year I immediately established a working <Col N="826" /> group to advise me on matters connected with the establishment of such a service.  The group reported in September last, and I and my officials are currently considering the best way of implementing the group's recommendations with a view to making an early psychological assessment a reality for all children who need such a service.  The group reported that 30 additional psychologists per annum over the next five years would be required to reach the optimum level. In yesterday's budget I announced the funding to make those additional appointments this year, in 1999 and in 2000.  We are on target to achieve the national educational psychological service with the requisite staff in the field.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science has in place an extensive system of remedial teaching to address the needs of children in primary and second level schools.  These teachers are a particularly important resource in catering for children with less serious learning difficulties, generally in literacy and numeracy, by directly teaching individuals or small groups on a withdrawal basis.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to ensuring that every primary school has access to a remedial service.  In a move towards fulfilling this commitment, in September last I allocated an additional 60 <i>ex-quota</i> remedial teaching posts to primary schools.</P>
    <P>A total of 1,302 remedial teachers are now in place in primary schools and it is estimated that 91 per cent of all primary pupils have access to a remedial service.  Meeting the needs of the remaining schools is not an easy task, given the very small size of some of the schools.  However, conscious of their needs, in the context of yesterday's budget I announced this morning that additional posts and part-time posts will be allocated to schools in 1999, to ensure that all schools with a remedial need will have this need met from next September, both at primary and second level.  The presence in the system, for the first time, of part-time posts will enable us to meet the remedial needs of very small schools flexibly.</P>
    <P>In this context also I draw to the attention of the House another important initiative &mdash; the retention of teachers in second level schools who might otherwise be redeployed to provide increased remedial services.  This will give a substantial increase in the remedial service and will be focused on pupils with particular needs.  It is vitally important that the remedial resource should be used to best effect and deployed in line with evolving needs.  To this end, a review of remedial education has recently been conducted on behalf of the Department by the Education Research Centre in Drumcondra.  The report on this review has recently been presented to my Department and is currently being considered. The review will be immensely helpful in basing future advances in the remedial service on up to date research, on knowledge of precisely how the current remedial provision operates and on knowledge of precisely what progress has been made by pupils.  It is important that we not only <Col N="827" /> appoint extra people but that we have a good evaluation of how the service works in terms of impact and output.</P>
    <P>To address more serious needs where they arise, I announced a major new initiative last month.  This initiative provides the first ever automatic supports for many children with disabilities. The measures involved are aimed at ensuring that all children with a special educational need, irrespective of their location or disability, will receive the support they require to participate fully in the education system.  The measures, which extend across the entire spectrum of special needs, will cost £8 million over the next two years, will deliver extra teaching and, most importantly, child care services to all special needs children whether in groups or in individual isolated settings.</P>
    <P>The availability of books and reading material is vital for the development of literacy, a point which was highlighted in the International Education Association Reading Literacy Survey in 1992.  In Ireland the survey found that four of the ten most important factors which differentiated between more effective and less effective schools in the teaching of reading related to the availability of books and reading materials.  Research carried out in several countries has shown that voluntary reading as a leisure time activity among schoolgoing children is on the decline.  This is not surprising given the popularity of television, videos and computer games.  If high standards of reading literacy are to be achieved and maintained, children must have easy access to a wide range of books and reading material.  It is also the case that technological advances have led to the expectation that libraries should provide other materials, such as videos, computer software and taped material, which are frequently used in teaching and learning situations in primary schools.</P>
    <P>My Department operates a scheme through which it provides a <i>per capita</i> grant to the chief librarians of local authorities, based on the number of national school pupils enrolled in each local authority area.  The local authority librarians use these grants to select, purchase and deliver books to primary schools.  The primary schools in their turn provide a lending and reference service to pupils.  Local authorities supplement, and in many cases exceed, the Department's grant in operating this scheme.  In 1998 the total allocation to this scheme was £1 million approximately.</P>
    <P>My Department also assisted in the distribution of vouchers to all primary school children earlier this year in connection with World Book Day on 23 April.  World Book Day is about helping children to explore the pleasures of books and reading and underlining the importance of reading, for both learning and pleasure.  In order to heighten awareness of the day, Irish publishers printed £1 book vouchers for each school child, and the Department of Education and Science distributed these vouchers to schools.  Within the <Col N="828" /> next ten days, I will announce details of a once-off special initiative in the area of literacy and schools which will cost £6.5 million.  I am not in a position to go into the details of that scheme because we are fine tuning it, but it will be very significant in the context of this debate.</P>
    <P>I have become increasingly aware of the scale of the problem of adult illiteracy.  Inadequate literacy and numeracy skills put individual adults at a great disadvantage, socially and economically. Of all the disadvantages faced by people, problems with literacy can have the most profound effect in excluding individuals from participation in many walks of life.</P>
    <P>In today's increasingly complex society, with the revolution in information technology and the need to constantly update one's knowledge and skills, people with poor literacy skills are in danger of being left behind, unable to take advantage of the job opportunities which their abilities otherwise merit.  Not only does the individual lose out but society is deprived of the contribution they can make to its development.</P>
    <P>Low levels of literacy will have a marked impact on competitiveness, particularly in the context of a falling young population in the years ahead, when the outflow of highly qualified young school leavers and graduates reduces in line with the falling birth rates during the 1980s.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, a report in October 1997 on the findings for Ireland of an international adult literacy survey revealed a serious problem of functional illiteracy among Irish adults.  Irish respondents performed comparatively poorly when compared to adults of other developed countries.  Approximately 25 per cent of Irish adults between 16 and 65 years of age, about 500,000 people, had low levels of functional literacy.  Many of those with low literacy skills were unaware of their deficiencies in this regard.</P>
    <P>The main conclusion for the Department of Education and Science is that there is a significant literacy problem among Irish adults which must be addressed by effective policy measures.  The Government is strongly committed to addressing and resolving the problems of adult illiteracy and promoting adult education in general.  This commitment is reinforced in Partnership 2000 which points out that policy and strategy will give priority to a number of key goals, one of which is providing a continuum of education for adult and community groups, including second chance education.</P>
    <P>Already there are links between literacy training and the vocational training opportunities scheme, the community employment schemes, FÁS and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, through its centres for the unemployed.  I support the extension of the existing links in a range of different settings.</P>
    <P>A number of particular initiatives bear testimony to the Governments commitment in this regard.  The first of these was the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, as the first <Col N="829" /> Minister of State ever with specific responsibility for adult education.  The most recent initiative was the publication last month of the Green Paper &ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo;.  The Green Paper provides a basis for the development of a policy framework for all aspects of adult education and recommends that priority be given to those who left the formal system without qualifications.</P>
    <P>The development of adult literacy services is a prominent feature of the Green Paper.  It will, therefore, be the subject of an extensive programme of consultations with a wide range of interest groups.  Following this consultation process, a White Paper will be published which will set out Government policy in this most important area.  In the interim, the Departments policy on literacy development is operated mainly through the adult literacy and community education schemes and, to a lesser extent, through Youthreach and VTOS.</P>
    <P>An increase of £2 million &mdash; a doubling of the total fund &mdash; was provided in 1998 for adult literacy initiatives.  A key objective is to use this investment to support the strategic development of a national adult literacy strategy.  Following consultation with key interests, the additional funds have been allocated for a range of pilot actions which test models and innovative approaches which will inform future practice with regard to key objectives for the service.  A key goal in this approach is to inform future practice, to identify and share the most successful strategies and systematically enhance the capacity of the system to address literacy needs.</P>
    <P>At present, an estimated 5,000 adults participate in existing adult literacy programmes every year and this number is expected to double with the additional funds.  A pilot literacy project through the medium of radio transmissions is also being funded by my Department.  This enables adults to participate in literacy classes from the privacy of their own homes.  If this pilot project is successful, the model has great potential for improving the quality and scope of the overall service, particularly for isolated rural dwellers.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental working group on literacy initiatives for the unemployed has been established to identify the strategies which are successful in targeting the unemployed, the barriers to their participation which need to be overcome and how these approaches can be incorporated systematically into the emerging literacy framework.</P>
    <P>It might be worthwhile at this stage to mention two valuable initiatives launched last year.  The first was the allocation of funding in 1998 and 1999 to enable vocational education committees to support child care for participants on Youthreach and VTOS programmes.  The intention is to bring about a greater participation of women on these programmes by facilitating access to child care services.  The second initiative is designed to enable educationally disadvantaged women to pursue lifelong learning education opportunities. <Col N="830" /> Substantial funding is also being allocated over the 1998-9 period for this project.</P>
    <P>It is clear, however, that much more needs to be done in the area of adult literacy provision and a start has been made.  Following a substantial increase in the provision for adult education in 1998 to £4 million, I announced this morning as a result of the budget that an additional £3.2 million will be made available over the next two years in addition to the £4 million already allocated for adult literacy.  The provision of this additional funding clearly indicates our commitment to place adult literacy at the centre of adult education.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me to conclude today without mentioning, albeit briefly, the area of computer literacy and, in particular, the IT2000 project.  It is important that, while focusing ourselves on improving the more traditional literacy skills of the population, we do not fail to acknowledge that computer literacy skills will be increasingly important in years to come.</P>
    <P>The aim of IT2000, which involves a State investment of £40 million over three years, is to upgrade the level of computer literacy throughout the school system.  The package is a balance between capital investment and the training and support of teachers and involves, <i>inter alia,</i> connecting every school to the Internet, ensuring that there are at least 60,000 multimedia computers in schools within the next three years and providing training to at least 20,000 teachers over the same period.</P>
    <P>We will have exceeded these targets in two years and we will go well beyond them in terms of the numbers of teachers trained and the numbers of computers in schools.  By December almost every school in the country will have been connected to the Internet, courtesy of Telecom Éireann.  We are one of the few countries in the western world that can make that boast.  It is a significant achievement and I wish to thank everyone involved, particularly the teacher unions for coming behind this national initiative for the benefit of the nation's children.</P>
    <P>This is an integrated strategy which does not concentrate on one age group or level.  It must operate from early education to third level and adult literacy programmes so that we can tackle the problem of illiteracy.  I apologise for not being able to remain in the House for the duration of the discussion but the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, will take my place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an tAire leis an díospóireacht fíor-thabhachtach seo. Molaim an éifeacht atá sé ag déanamh agus tá súil agam go mbeidh an tádh leis lena héifeachtaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy continues to boom and we rejoice in our new found wealth.  However, in our euphoria we must not forget our problems.  The Minister has acknowledged that among the greatest problems facing the nation are illiteracy and adult education services.  It is frightening to realise that one in every four adults has literacy <Col N="831" /> problems.  Ireland has one of the worst records in the developed world in providing second chance adult education.  The startling reprecussions are that 500,000 adults are denied the benefits and pleasures of full literacy and numeracy.  Many of those with literacy problems are young people who will come on the labour market where there is already a shortage of skilled labour.  Literacy and numeracy are essential in the labour market.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to devote more thought and resources to literacy.  I welcome the initiatives the Minister has outlined.  We cannot afford to allow young people to leave school illiterate and we must invest more in the education and training of the unemployed and adults who wish to re-enter the workforce.  The statistics have shattered the image we had of a well educated, newly industrialised nation but we must not put our heads in the sand &mdash; I gladly concede that the Minister is not doing that.  We must face up to illiteracy and endeavour to include all of society in the rewards that come from our growing wealth.</P>
    <P>The vocational training and opportunities scheme and Youthreach programmes already exist for people who wish to return to work.  Both have made an enormous contribution but they must be strengthened and further resourced. People going on VTOS retain their current entitlements but they should be given a further incentive.  They receive travel and meal allowances but they are not much better off by attending these schemes &mdash; some people might think themselves as well off staying in bed because they would not be well rewarded financially. I deal with these schemes on a daily basis and they would make an impact on these problems if more people took part in them.</P>
    <P>There are 107 literacy schemes providing tuition to adults on a one to one basis.  Over 85 per cent of the tuition is provided by volunteers.  An insufficient ALCES budget of £4 million has meant that adults can only access two hours tuition per week.  Adult education is gaining momentum, through the Green Paper, increased funding in the ALCES budget, and the further increase announced by the Minister today, but money should be made available for more intensive literacy programmes.</P>
    <P>Investment in literacy education will be cost effective as well as crucial to the development of a just society.  We once prided ourselves on being a nation of saints and scholars.  We must now address inadequate provision for literacy and in so doing proper and adequate funding must be made available to literacy providers.  We are relying on volunteer tutors and this is neither fair nor good enough.  These people give generously and unselfishly of their time and we should now reward them.  They must receive in-service training and be brought up to date with modern trends and techniques.</P>
    <P>I appeal for more funding in this area and for every VEC to be allowed employ at least one, and preferably two, literacy organisers because <Col N="832" /> they are an integral part of any literacy provision scheme.  This will be a measure of the Government's commitment, because it is those people who have deep knowledge of the matter.  If they were in place more would be done in this area and the initiatives announced by the Minister would be more quickly brought on stream.  The literacy providers should also have more say in decisions, as I said on the Education Bill.  Those involved in literacy and adult education should be given places on vocational education committees and adult education boards.  They have the expertise but up to now they have not been recognised.  If the problem of illiteracy is to be overcome they must be heeded.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the roots of literacy lie in primary education.  There are still 200,000 pupils in classes of 30 or more, which is unacceptable and at variance with thinking on education.  Over 500 schools do not have access to a remedial teacher, but the Minister is addressing this issue and I hope it is solved sooner rather than later.  It is also unacceptable that 42 per cent of substitute teacher hours were provided by untrained personnel in 1997.  There are 8,000 pupils with special needs attending mainstream schools on an integrated basis without minimum support services.  The pupil-teacher ratio for special classes, set out in the special education review committee report, has not yet been fully implemented.  Half the State's full-time students are at primary level but it receives only one quarter of the funding.  The main literacy problems start in the national school system.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre, and we have started, but I hope it is not too little, too late.</P>
    <P>I commend the budget initiatives announced by the Minister.  However since the coffers are flush with cash could the Government not have done more?  We are still at the bottom of the ladder and have a long way to go.  Until proper structures are put in place and the providers are given recognition, we will not break the barrier.  The torch has been passed to all of us as legislators, whether in Government or Opposition.  We have the finances, the question is whether we have the will.  The Minister said the psychological services will be improved by the year 2000, why not improve them now when we have the cash?  Why adopt a phased approach?</P>
    <P>Betting tax was reduced in the budget and I welcome this, as someone who has been known to bet on a horse.  This provision will be introduced by next summer but the Minister says his improvements in the education system will be phased in over the coming years.  Why not introduce them now?  Have we our priorities right? Although I am a strong supporter of the horse racing industry, education is more important. While I welcome the initiatives I am disappointed they are not coming on stream sooner.</P>
    <P>Literacy problems, which are first seen in national schools, are being tackled.  As a teacher and a parent, I hope the initiatives will be successful because we have a major problem on our <Col N="833" /> hands.  The major initiative which should be taken now is to give every county and city a full-time literacy organiser so that the various schemes can be co-ordinated.  The volunteers, who provide 85 per cent of literacy tuition, should be brought into the structure, given recognition, receive in-service training, and be given expenses or some form of remuneration.  They have made an enormous contribution and saved the State a vast amount of money but it is not right that literacy tuition is provided by volunteers.</P>
    <P>I hope the Green Paper, which will lead ultimately to a White Paper, will ensure that the people involved in adult education and literacy schemes are given places at the table where decisions are made because they have the expertise and the knowledge.  If the Government adopts that policy and listens to those people, the problem will be addressed.  This will ensure that in the future, our levels of literacy and numeracy will be on a par with any country in Europe.  We will revert to the proud title we once held in terms of education and learning of the island of saints and scholars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on literacy in primary and second levels and adult education is timely.  As Senator McDonagh said, tosach maith leath na hoibre.  That is a clear indication of our position today.  It is a good start and the will exists.  I am pleased to contribute to a debate on literacy, knowing that we have a future and can work through the weaknesses in the system.</P>
      <P>I was thinking earlier that I am sorry I left the education system.  I should be in my job now with all the goodies that have been given to the psychological service, the remedial service and special resource teachers.  Often in the past I did not have these resources.  It would be nice to be in the system now and to be able to avail of all the extra support that is coming on stream.  I am always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Nevertheless, I am glad to contribute to this debate.</P>
      <P>I wondered initially whether the topic related to people who cannot read or write or make simple calculations.  To me, literacy is the ability to read simple material and to cope with the normal demands of everyday life.  In the school system, a percentage of students cannot read or write. These deficiencies were not addressed in primary schools because of lack of resources.  Problems were not detected when the children first went to primary school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This always concerned me because if children missed out at primary level and slipped through the net, there was no hope that they would catch up when they reached second level.  These children left school early and were not equipped for any type of work.  Often these individuals go back into the system as adults trying to cope with simple reading, writing and numeracy.  It is wonderful that extra money will be provided for an extensive remedial programme with resource teachers <Col N="834" /> working on a one to one basis and that there will be early assessment.</P>
    <P>Children of parents who can read well, write and calculate often will have no difficulty. However, children from homes where the television is the focal point, where there is no printed material of any type and nobody suggests that books should be read, are caught in the web of the inability to read and write when they reach school going age.</P>
    <P>The issue is how to improve intervention and remediation services.  I welcome the breaking the cycle scheme and the early start centres.  I hope there will be community involvement in these centres because parents and grandparents should be involved.  This issue must be brought into the community because often fault does not lie with the schools.  Resources will be available in schools now but I hope when classes are finished in the evening that parents will take over and become involved in their children's education.  Parents must be involved at an early stage to break the cycle.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comment that there will be a White Paper on early childhood education. Breaking the cycle at that level would provide a gateway.  It would prevent the problems facing children of moving from class to class or getting through examinations.  It would be also the gateway to work.  There should be assessments in first class and the introduction of remediation if necessary.  I do not suggest every child will have the same chronological and reading age. Some children are behind, but they must be brought to a level where they can read and write and deal with modern day chores.  That is all we hope for because not every student can achieve the optimum.</P>
    <P>Curricular reforms are good.  The introduction of new courses and the variation in the leaving certificate programmes will help students to make choices.  These cater for weak students who did not get a foundation.  An opportunity will now be provided to students aged 13 years who come to second level with reading ages of between six and seven and who cannot cope with the ordinary curricula. It is wonderful that the curricula will be reformed to deal with students who are not academically oriented.  Tasks should be provided for them which will give them a sense of achievement and self-esteem.</P>
    <P>The free books scheme and the extensive remedial programme are useful.  Students should be motivated to become involved in other activities, such as sport and leisure, chores in areas about which they feel good; it does not necessarily have to be subject oriented.  Many students would gain from certain activities which do not require books.  They should be comfortable with what they are doing, such as reading simple material.</P>
    <P>We became unstuck over the years because there was a fixed type of curriculum and subject oriented programmes.  It was not detected that since many students came from environments <Col N="835" /> which did not have printed material, they were at a loss.  It was not important to them to read or write as long as they could watch television and communicate verbally.  It was only in later life that it became a huge issue.</P>
    <P>Students aged 15 and 16 years often came to me because they did not want to go on work experience programmes.  They felt they would not be able to read simple instructions.  I hope the new measures will end this problem.  It is a new beginning.  Success cannot be achieved overnight but the will to solve the problem exists.  These measures will be phased in.  I received many telephone calls this morning from people congratulating the Government on the new measures which are a start in terms of literacy intervention and remedial programmes at primary and second levels.  It is a breakthrough.</P>
    <P>I read the research but I am not convinced that it is absolute.  One of the criteria used related to students who could not read instructions on medicine bottles.  I often read such instructions and I do not always understand them.  This should not be used as a criterion for determining literacy. Occasionally, such instructions are so vague that one must read them 100 times before one is happy that one understands them.  This type of research is not good enough.  It is scaremongering to suggest one is illiterate if one cannot read the instructions on a medicine bottle.</P>
    <P>I hope we will have another opportunity to discuss adult literacy in the context of the Green Paper.  Adult literacy must be approached in a different way to child literacy.  Some of the people involved in one to one remedial tuition with adults are often not the right people for the job. It is very important that tutors make adult students feel comfortable.  If that is not the case, students will only attend tuition on one or two occasions.  Not every teacher will be good at resource or remedial teaching and it is important we select teachers properly.  Teachers who are good in a group setting may not necessarily be good on a one to one basis or in a small group.  It can be disturbing for an illiterate person to find himself or herself in a situation where the teacher does not encourage or motivate them.  We must select the proper personnel and ensure we get value for money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed establishment of a national psychological service.  I did not see any reference in the Minister's speech to career guidance counsellors.  Coming from a career guidance background, I would like to think that the quota of 500 students per guidance counsellor would be reduced in light of the introduction of the extensive remedial programme.  As well as offering career guidance and counselling and assisting students in their transition from primary to secondary schools, career guidance counsellors also teach.  They should be allowed to spend more time on the things they do well.  That would assist the provision of remedial and intervention programmes. I did not want to leave this House without <Col N="836" /> making a plug for the Career Guidance Institute.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures announced here today. We have an extensive remedial teaching programme backed by the necessary resources and one to one tuition where required.  With the assistance of our excellent teachers, Ireland's education system could be one of the best in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ormonde should not get too carried away with enthusiasm; we still have a long way to go in the education area.  It would be churlish of me not to welcome the Minister's announcements on remediation and disadvantage today.  The INTO certainly views this as a move in the right direction.  The fact schools now know they will have access to remedial teachers over the next two years has huge implications and will allow them to plan ahead.  At an INTO conference earlier this year, I told the Minister that if he delivered on his promise to allow every primary school in the State access to a remedial teacher within two years, I would personally seek his canonisation.  If he comes through on this measure, he can hold me to that.  I will be happy to eat humble pie.</P>
      <P>This is a very creative move, particularly in the sense of allowing part-time remedial hours for smaller schools which have always found it difficult to offer a service.  I would like to see the part-time hours concept being extended to give support to teaching principals in primary schools to allow them carry out their administrative functions and duties.  The INTO has been in discussion with the Department on that issue for a number of years.  Part-time hours might offer a formula through which a number of problems could be resolved.</P>
      <P>It is important that Members understand the current position in regard to the funding of primary schools but we still have a long way to go. The level of grant per pupil at post-primary level will be approximately £180 per pupil; comparisons cannot easily be made with primary school funding.  The current grant of £50 at primary level is set to increase to £60 next year.  We must attempt to bridge the gap in funding between primary and post-primary level.  The measures outlined in the budget represent a step in the right direction.  I would like to see the grant per pupil at primary level being increased to £130, £140 or £150.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unacceptable that primary education &mdash; the one element of our education system which has a constitutional base &mdash; is the only sector in which a local contribution is required.  The Department's rules require that before a board of management receives funding, it must demonstrate that a local contribution has been paid into the account.  I concede that the amounts are diminishing. Previously, schools had to provide 25 per cent of the cost per pupil but the amount has been frozen at £10 per pupil in recent years.  The £50 grant per pupil is set to increase to £60 per <Col N="837" /> pupil from next year and the £10 contribution will represent a contribution of 16.5 per cent.  We should aim to wipe out the local contribution completely.</P>
    <P>We have spoken about the recognition and identification of pupils with learning problems. The INTO has been arguing that children with reading and learning difficulties should be able to obtain remedial support from the earliest age. The Department has resisted that for many years and there have been constant rows between the Department and school staffs and principals who have assigned infant pupils to remedial classes where they have found that to be useful.  It is only in recent years that the Department of Education and Science has come around to that point of view.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say today these problems need to be identified at an even earlier stage, at pre-primary if necessary.  I presume by that he means that intervention should also take place.  For years a ridiculous rule existed in the Department that infants did not get access to remedial classes, but that was changed some years ago.  I am glad the Minister reinforced his position on that today because it is very important.</P>
    <P>If classes have 35 or 40 students &mdash; a few days ago I talked to a teacher with 44 pupils in a class &mdash; it is impossible to cope.  There is no teaching, learning or discipline, it is simply crowd control and it does not work.  The needs of principals in those situations also become hugely important.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem in primary schools after funding, class size, remedial education, which we dealt with and will return to, is teacher supply.  In the past few weeks Members have talked about schools in their constituencies which have advertised for teachers and cannot even get applications for the jobs.  There is a huge problem.  The Minister has taken a firm and important initiative in increasing intake into colleges, so much so that the current intake is approximately double the 1996 intake.  That is very welcome.  I regret he did not take immediate action last year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should have particular interest in what I am about to suggest as it is relevant to Limerick.  In every other European country, there are so-called conversion courses at third level in colleges of education to allow post-primary teachers to convert to primary teachers and vice versa.  It is my view, as general secretary of the INTO, that there is too much inflexibility in the way teachers are prepared.  There has been a long discussion for years in colleges of education about whether primary teachers should be trained concurrently, in other words whether they should study professional subjects as well as educational subjects.  They would learn about teaching, methodology, content and curriculum while at the same time learning Irish, English, maths and European languages.  They would learn them concurrently.</P>
    <P>That is the traditional model of primary teaching preparation.  In the Minister of State's city, <Col N="838" /> Mary Immaculate College has been doing that for 100 years.  That college celebrates its centenary this year.  There is also a postgraduate course in that college whereby students first do a university degree and then do a top-up or further course in the college of education to become qualified primary teachers.  That is the consecutive model. There has been too much debate about which course is good and which is bad.  They are both very good courses.  It is a matter of determining quality and standards and having variety and flexibility of approach in the training, education and development of teachers.</P>
    <P>One of the issues raised earlier by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, was that we are now approaching another aspect of primary education, that is the area of specialisation which is not uncommon in most professions. This is also a huge debate.  The colleges of education can consider this and ensure that if we need people who are specialised in particular areas, whether it be in curricular development, teaching in disadvantaged areas, remedial education or counselling, teachers should be able to do a top-up qualification in the subject in which they specialise.  They could be generalist teachers who are specialised in an area.  We must examine this approach.  There will be massive resistance from traditional forces in education, including many of my own members, to these suggestions, but that is not the issue.  These matters need to be dealt with and approached in a challenging way.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated earlier that he will discuss the conversion course with the University of Limerick, as a college which may provide it.  That is an important course and it should be set up quickly.</P>
    <P>There should also be a greater opening here for teachers trained in the UK and Northern Ireland. It is currently open to teachers from Northern Ireland who have a qualification in Irish to teach here, but we can go further than that.  At a conference on education held in Limerick two weeks ago, Bord na Gaeilge was the first Irish language group to agree with the INTO that there are many teachers working in the system &mdash; for instance in remedial and special education and home-school teachers &mdash; who never use Irish in their teaching.  Some of those jobs could be open to teachers trained in colleges of education in Northern Ireland or the UK who do not have a qualification or degree in Irish.  This should be examined.</P>
    <P>On the issue of literacy, I am very pleased that we have included literacy with the general topic of primary education.  Literacy was almost a taboo subject for many years.  At primary level we did not like to talk about the matter of illiteracy because in some way it seemed to reflect on us as professionals as though we had created the problem, but we are long past that.  We are able to stand back and take a professional, self-confident look at it and say if there are flaws in the system let us repair them or respond to them and if there is a problem with resources let us deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="839" /> Illiteracy is far more than an educational problem. It is an economic and social problem.  It relates to issues such as employment, participation and the foundations of democracy.  People with literacy problems cannot participate in society to the fullest extent.  We need to recognise the well-known link between education and qualification and employment.  Every study in developed countries has proven this.  When we know that and accept it, let us go back to the foundation of education.  Part of the foundation of education must be literacy.  The child who cannot read will have great difficulty in being educated. Literacy is the key, so how do we address it?</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Ormonde's view about the OECD survey's finding of 25 per cent of people with reading difficulties.  I rubbish it, and I am not saying that in a defensive way as general secretary of a teachers' union.  From my experience as a teacher, my knowledge from other teachers and my day-to-day work, I do not believe the findings of the survey.  I have not found anybody who would agree with that figure.  No commentator would.  The Minister has been slow to say that but I am sure I will not embarrass him by saying I know it is his private view that the 25 per cent figure is a nonsense figure.  It makes it difficult to deal with.</P>
    <P>Having said that 25 per cent cannot be right, there is a problem and we need to consider it. The Minister stated that in his estimation, 8 per cent of children leaving primary education have low literacy skills.  I do not know whether that figure is right or wrong any more than the Minister does, but it is probably between 6 and 12 per cent.  In order to jointly attack this issue of literacy, teachers must agree.  We do not need to spend huge amounts of money identifying the problem.  We can do that easily.  Every teacher in the system can say there are two or three pupils in his or her class who are experiencing learning difficulties with reading.  That is the problem identified.  Now what do we do about it?  We must use the psychological or remedial support services. We can do that locally, we do not need to get involved in national assessment.  Every year or two, the class teacher can assess whether the child has made progress and when the child comes to the end of primary level we know where he or she stands.  I would like teachers to do that. I know the INTO would support that kind of initiative.  Some teachers may feel a little threatened and we would have to encourage people to see it as the way forward.</P>
    <P>One way to deal with the OECD survey is to carry out our own survey.  I would like the Minster to agree to a national literacy survey being carried out which would include the partners in education.  We can agree the kind of questionnaire, the form of the survey, how it will be carried out and funded and where it will be put together.  It can be done independently and then we will know the size of the problem outside of <Col N="840" /> school.  That way we will have attacked literacy at school level as well as at community level.</P>
    <P>The Minister's contribution was of huge importance.  He put a lot of things on the record. He covered a lot of areas that showed the way forward.  For that reason alone this debate has been very worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably, I missed the Minister's contribution.  It was very heartening to listen to contributions made by Senators O'Toole, Ormonde and McDonagh because they endorsed the Minister's statement.  They found that the many new initiatives he outlined are very much in keeping with the challenge of dealing with illiteracy.</P>
      <P>This debate is taking place in the context of two recently published reports on literacy.  The OECD international report was published last year and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science published a report in May of this year.  This debate is also taking place against the background of the massive injection of investment in science and technology by the Minister for Education and Science in the Scientific Technology Bill of last year.  The first of the two reports has already been commented upon at great length.  There is considerable dispute as to the veracity or accuracy of the reports given the terms of reference.  Comment has been made reading prescriptions and what is on medication bottles but to base a finding on this type of strategy would not be scientific or what we believe to be literacy problems for adults.  That report emphasises this problem and we must take it on board even if many educationalists think it is not in accordance with how we would want to identify and solve the problem of adult literacy.  However, adults have problems with literacy and these problems must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Where problems do exist they extend into an adult's social and working life.  There is a definite correlation between the level of literacy attained by an adult and their employment prospects.  We have also established a correlation between the level of literacy and the level of income that can be attained by an adult.  These correlations are so well established that the problem of adult literacy must be addressed.  In that context it is heartening to discover that Deputy O'Dea is the first Minister of State at the Department of Education of Science with special responsibility for adult education. The Government has to be commended on taking this initiative because it acknowledges the problem of adult literacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of the Minister of State has brought about the publication of the Green Paper on adult education &mdash;&ldquo;Adult Education in an Era of Lifelong Learning&rdquo;.  The decision to set out a strategy for the development of a policy framework for all aspects of adult education giving priority to those who left the formal education system without qualifications is an extremely important initiative.  Until now adult education <Col N="841" /> lacked a coherent policy framework but that has been addressed by this initiative.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State for the expeditious manner in which he went about identifying problems.  He worked on the basis of all the information available to him in the public domain and then he published the Green Paper within the time limit he had set himself.  We look forward to a more detailed debate on the Green Paper.  He has incorporated features in the document which will be discussed by the public and Oireachtas Members alike.  These features challenge us, they are visionary and they are the hallmark of his initiative and the collation and aggregation of information that he has had available to him.  Again, I congratulate him on its publication and look forward to subsequent debates.</P>
    <P>The illiteracy problem has been traced back to primary education.  Pupils left primary education with illiteracy problems and either entered second level education or opted out altogether. In May 1998, the Oireachtas Joint Committee published its report and it established that 8 per cent of pupils leaving primary school had literacy problems.  Given the huge revolution in the areas of primary education with the transition to the concept of child centred curriculum and classrooms, it is challenging and disappointing to some extent that, despite huge advances being made in tackling the problems of illiteracy, almost 5,000 pupils who leave primary education each year and enter post-primary education experience problems in reading or numeracy.</P>
    <P>The most challenging areas of literacy development in primary education has been referred to. One of our biggest challenges is class sizes.  The modern curriculum is geared towards a child centred classroom and in keeping with that there is a lot of freedom of movement.  In this type of classroom situation a child who needs special attention or remediation cannot get adequate attention.  Therefore, the pupil-teacher ratio is very relevant when addressing the problem of illiteracy or inadequate levels of literacy within the primary school system.</P>
    <P>As Senators Ormonde, McDonagh and O'Toole and the Minister mentioned, remediation has the greatest contribution to make to the solution of this problem.  The Minister gave a commitment today, as part of what he referred to yesterday in the Dáil Chamber as the strategic approach to the whole area of remediation, that a remedial resource will be available to all pupils in primary schools within two years.  That is a most heartening and welcoming announcement which will be welcomed by teachers and parents all over the country, particularly the parents of pupils who needed a remedial service and have not been able to avail of one until now.</P>
    <P>I have heard teachers down through the years, even since I left teaching but particularly in the past few years, talk about the effectiveness of early intervention.  Teachers of infants have informed me that it is possible for them to identify a need for remediation as early as the end of <Col N="842" /> junior infants.  There have been pupils who, at the end of junior infants, have been discovered to have problems with reading, writing and numeracy and have been able to avail of remediation in senior infants and subsequent classes.  There is a very significant body of evidence available among primary teachers who tells us that where pupils in need of remediation availed of it immediately, or at the earliest opportunity, very significant progress was made by the middle primary school classes.  Again, I commend the Minister for adopting a strategic policy framework for the area of remediation.</P>
    <P>In this information age, when information is doubling every five years, access to information will be one of the most required skills.  In that context I commend again, as I did earlier this year, the decision by the Minister and the Government to make a £250 million investment in the area of technology and education.  This innovative approach is visionary.  It recognises, identifies and acts upon the awareness that access to information is the way forward in substantially enhancing the literacy of all students in the system.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Cassidy for arranging this debate.  He promised to ask the Minister to attend the House before Christmas.  I welcome the Minister's statement which is heartening. While great advances have been made in education there is still much work to be done and we still have a long way to go.  While the Minister said he would like to phase in many of the initiatives he referred to, it would be more appropriate if he could introduce them more quickly.  Many of them could be introduced immediately.</P>
      <P>With regard to primary schools, great concern has been expressed by teachers, parents and boards of management about a number of issues. Small, one-teacher schools are at a disadvantage, and not only with regard to the capitation grant. The Fianna Fáil general election manifesto suggested that the grant would be increased significantly and that the gap between £50 for primary school students and £177 for secondary school students would be closed.  I hope the Minister makes a significant move in that regard.</P>
      <P>More than 200,000 children still attend school with classes of more than 30.  That is unacceptable.  The national average is 24.5. The Minister must look at one-teacher schools and those schools with classes which have pupil-teacher ratios of more than 30.  It is not good enough to rely on substitute teacher panels with people who are not trained.  Improvements cannot be phased in here.  Radical change is required.</P>
      <P>Teachers will have to attend courses to learn computer skills.  It is unfair that they must learn these skills at their own expense and in their own time.  Teachers have been making great strides in this area and there is an onus on the Department to provide extra funding and courses to train them and to make time available to enable them to learn the necessary computer skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> On the question of special schools, teachers must leave the classroom to help take students from the school bus.  An extra effort must be made to provide care for children with special needs who travel to school by bus.  Perhaps FÁS courses could be extended to address short-term needs in this area.  It would not cost too much extra money.</P>
    <P>Pupil-teacher ratios must be looked at in the short-term, especially in one-teacher schools in rural and isolated areas.  With regard to capitation grants, the one-teacher schools are also at a disadvantage because the grants do not cover all of the costs of running the schools.  I welcome the Minister's comments on and commitment to remedial teachers.  Other areas also need urgent attention.  Measures to deal with some of them would not be costly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He has spent much time here recently.  I am glad that, at last, education is being seriously addressed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. There has been a shortage of legislation in this area and I hope this will change in the future.</P>
      <P>I was disturbed to hear Senator O'Toole effectively rubbish the OECD report which indicated that 25 per cent of Irish adults between the ages of 25 and 64 have serious literacy and numeracy difficulties.  It is unfair to rubbish a report without indicating why.  The OECD report was comparative, and the standards and criteria used to compile the Irish section were also used in the other countries surveyed.  Apart from Poland, we ended at the bottom of the list.  That is a serious matter, regardless of what one's views might be as a practitioner in education.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science has always taken the view, without any figures or surveys to back it up, that approximately 10 per cent of the population had literacy problems.  That is a grossly inadequate indication of the true number. We have no reason to suspect that the OECD figure of 25 per cent is high and we should not rubbish it until we know if there is a basis for questioning it.  Another international survey indicated that 23 per cent of the population had literacy difficulties, which was the highest level in terms of comparison with other EU countries.</P>
      <P>The report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Science indicated that 8 per cent of those leaving primary level had serious numeracy and reading difficulties.  The Minister's announcement that he was putting 225 remedial teachers into primary schools and a similar number into post-primary schools is an admission of the very serious literacy problem, not just in the 25 to 64 year age group, but also at the lowest learning level, which has not been adequately recognised.  Remediation was and is necessary.  If we are now appointing this number of teachers, many students must have previously slipped through the net without receiving the necessary remedial attention which they needed at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="844" /> The Minister for Education and Science does not take an integrated approach to education.  I was disappointed with his approach to the Education (No. 2) Bill where he rubbished educational structures but put nothing in their place. He is an exponent of the stand alone school. Everything in this document reflects that ethos, with schools doing their own thing, with a small amount of extra money here and an extra teacher there.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was full of <i>ad hoc</i> initiatives &mdash; more money to home-school liaison and a few million into pre-school programmes, special needs, the library service, world book day, vouchers for primary schools and computer literacy.  We do not have a system to deliver that.  Stand alone schools do well in some areas but ineffectively in others.  It is a strange belief for a Minister for Education that a building, to which a certain number of teachers commute to five days a week from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., can solve the problems of an indigenous community, such as housing, unemployment, dysfunction, motivation and drugs.  Stand alone schools will not solve those problems.  We could pour money into that system from now until kingdom come and there will not be an adequate response because the structure is inadequate.  That is no reflection on the quality of our teachers, which is second to none.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State recognised that in the Green Paper.  He is the first person in this Government to propose a local adult education board which would provide adult education.  That is what is needed.  I look forward to progress in that area in the months to come.  I am also delighted the Minister of State is coming forward with proposals to introduce adult education into the mainstream so that it can claim its rightful place in the budget.  Adult education will receive a total budget of £2 million in 1998, double what was given in 1997.  That shows that adult education operated on a shoestring, run by volunteers trained by the vocational education committees who give of their own time.  Adult education is not delivered as a professional service.  Again this is not a reflection on the people involved but on a system which is not fit to deliver.  I hope the Minister of State will establish a system which will be effective in its delivery.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figures demonstrate that we need considerable movement towards providing literacy skills and training.  A high percentage of those unemployed for over a year &mdash; 56 per cent of the 210,000 on the live register and 63 per cent of the unemployed &mdash; have not completed secondary education.  We compare poorly with the country at the top of the list &mdash; Sweden.  It has only 5 per cent adult illiteracy whereas our rate is five times that.  We are third from the bottom in terms of participation in adult educational training courses in OECD countries.  Why is that the case?  It is because we do not have an adequate mechanism for the delivery of services. There are a great many people doing their best <Col N="845" /> but they are doing it on a hand-to-mouth basis in terms of funding and resources.</P>
    <P>Primary education must begin with pre-school, not at an artificial age of four to six years.  That is not primary education even though that is what the Department of Education and Science provides. We should provide primary education from age two.  It must be provided from the earliest point of learning, otherwise children lose out. Those who can afford it, provide education for children of two years but those who cannot are disadvantaged for the rest of their lives.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, gave no indication that he has an interest in providing a national system of pre-school education.</P>
    <P>The budget gave no incentive to the business sector to provide créche facilities.  Nothing was given to the working parent or the parent on social welfare to assist with child care.  That is a disgrace.  Child benefit was increased by a miserly £3.  This was the budget of the Minister for Finance who had more money in his coffers than he could spend.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that he has provided £1.2 million for early childhood education.  Now we find that will be directed to children with disabilities. That is a drop in the ocean for early childhood education.  What will be done with that?  Much more money should go into the whole area of special needs and disabilities.  The Minister has not implemented the O'Donoghue judgment in relation to the severely disabled and mentally handicapped.  Another constitutional case will undoubtedly be taken.  The Department will once again be taken to court and will lose once again because it has not provided the services. The Minister was not even interested in addressing educational disadvantage.  He set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee which is no substitute for an adequate structure.</P>
    <P>I do not know what Senator O'Toole said about capitation but the INTO suggested an increase from £50 to three times that amount, the level available in secondary schools.  That has not taken place.  How will primary schools function when the general view is that they need three to four times that amount of capitation grant per pupil to be able to function effectively?  Parents cannot go on forever holding cake sales, flower sales and various functions to keep schools running.</P>
    <P>I welcome the allocation of 450 remedial teachers.  That is the only good thing provided in the budget.  We need more remedial teachers but I welcome this as a starting point.  I would like to have seen the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, go down the road proposed by the Labour Party of allocating medical cards to all children under eight years of age.  That would have released funds to less well off parents.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the thrust of the Minister's thinking.  There is lack of vision.  He will certainly keep the ship steady as she goes, but we know that as she goes she is not carrying all the passengers on board in the same manner <Col N="846" />&mdash; there are too many passengers down at steerage who are not getting the full attention of the crew.  The Minister should have better vision in terms of education.  I welcome the direction the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, is taking in relation to the Green Paper.  I look forward to development in this area in the next couple of years in terms of providing a well-funded and well-structured base for adult and continuing education and literacy education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  There are two aspects to the problem of literacy.  We must ensure that as many students as possible leave the school system with adequate literacy and numeracy skills.  In relation to those who unfortunately slip through the net, there must be an adequate system in place to pick them up afterwards.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, announced a range of targeted interventions.  These include developing successful interventions that have existed for some time, albeit on a pilot basis &mdash; for example, the Hunt school liaison scheme, the remediation and pre-school education initiative, the disadvantaged schools initiative, the various retention initiatives, curricula reforms and so on.  These will be designed to ensure that as many children as possible leave the school adequately equipped to function properly in the information age.</P>
      <P>In relation to those who unfortunately slip through the net, there is some dispute about the figure of 25 per cent.  Senator O'Toole suggested that my private view is that the figure is not 25 per cent.  My private view on the matter is exactly the same as my public view which I will restate. A respected OECD survey has concluded that 25 per cent of adults in this country have insufficient literacy and-or numeracy skills to function properly in the information society.  It does not say that 25 per cent of adults are illiterate in the commonly understood sense of the word.  I respect the findings of that survey.  I am not saying they are absolutely accurate but the anecdotal evidence suggests that they are more accurate than some of us would like to believe.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the question of remedial teachers.  I have no doubt that following the initiatives announced by the Minister today and the initiatives contained in yesterday's budget, within two years or less all pupils will have access to remedial teaching.</P>
      <P>On capitation grants, these grants were frozen by the last Government.  In the past 17 months they were increased by approximately 30 per cent.  We said in our election manifesto that we would close the gap between the primary sector and second level, but we did not say we would do it in 17 months.  We said we would do it over the lifetime of the Government and we have made an excellent start.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="847" /> Senator O'Toole raised concerns about local contributions.  I understand where he is coming from.  The figure has been frozen at £10, therefore, it is becoming a smaller percentage of the total contribution.  This is a welcome development. Many schools have difficulty collecting these contributions, particularly from parents of children who have moved on.  If parents do not have children at a school, they resent making this local contribution.  This has undoubtedly created difficulties.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole in relation to inflexibility in teacher training.  There is too much inflexibility in the education system generally at third level.  I am hopeful that this problem will be ironed out in the forthcoming qualification legislation which will be introduced in the next session of the Dáil as a result of the Teastas report.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke referred to a problem in Castlebar where teachers had to assist to bring disabled children into the school.  Funding has been allocated in the budget to provide an escort for every bus in the country carrying special needs children. When the Minister and I took over in the Department of Education and Science there were 430 such buses in the country.  Funding was allocated to provide an escort on 38 buses and the rate of pay was £3 per hour.  That left 392 buses unprovided for, which was very dangerous.  I heard heartrending tales from parents in the past 17 months in this regard.  Parents in my part of the country and elsewhere have had to make round trips of 100 miles a day to escort special needs children to school.  They felt it would not be safe to allow their children on the school bus in view of the fact that there was no escort available.  I am pleased to reiterate that funding has been made available to provide escorts on every bus throughout the country carrying special needs children. Escorts' pay has been increased to a more realistic level of £4 per hour.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello said that the amount of money being spent on adult education is derisory. I would like to see more money invested in adult education.  My objective is to mainstream adult education during my term in office.  It is incorrect to say that the adult literacy budget represents the total expenditure in adult education.  It is only a small fraction of the allocation.  Senator Costello knows that there are many players in the field of adult education.  Money is being contributed by the Department of Social, Community <Col N="848" /> and Family Affairs and various other Departments. Expenditure in this area last year amounted to approximately £85 million.</P>
    <P>In relation to the specific literacy budget, when I took office 17 months ago, there was a budget of £2 million per annum to cater for the needs of people who wished to go back to school and acquire literacy skills.  That was absolutely derisory and incomprehensible in a Christian society which must focus on upskilling more people to meet the skill shortages in the economy.  The increase allotted by the previous Government in its last budget was £60,000, to be divided among 38 vocational education committees.  That is a grand total of £1,400 per VEC, which was inexplicable. My party committed itself in our manifesto to doubling that figure over the lifetime of the Government.  We more than doubled it in year one to £4.1 million.  We have increased it by another £1.6 million this year to £5.75 million. The reality is that this year I will spend 280 per cent of the budget that was available when I came into office on adult literacy.  That is a significant advance.  We need to drive that figure up to about £10 million a year, which is what the experts estimate we will need to have a proper literacy strategy.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Green Paper.  I thank Senators Costello, O'Toole, Fitzgerald, Ormonde and others for their kind remarks.  I am looking forward to a comprehensive debate in the Seanad on the Green Paper.  It has been repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> that we are moving on to publish a White Paper which, to continue the colour analogy, will be our blueprint for action.  However, that does not mean we are going to stand still. There are various initiatives mentioned in the Green Paper which we will be developing during the consultation process.  Some matters, such as the delivery structures, will have to await the outcome of the consultation process.  However, Members can rest assured the Government will not be standing still in regard to most initiatives mentioned in the Green Paper but will be developing them as best we can, so that no time will be in lost in this vital area.</P>
