      <P>As this is the last day before the summer recess, I thank the leaders and Whips of the various groups and Members on all sides of the House for their co-operation and assistance during my first year as Cathaoirleach.  We have had a very busy year with a record number of sitting days.  We did a great deal of work and processed much important legislation.  I thank the Clerk, Clerk Assistant and the staff in the Seanad Office for their help and guidance during the year.  I also thank the other people and staff members who helped to ensure the smooth running of the House.  We are very grateful to the representatives of the media who cover Seanad proceedings.  I express my gratitude to the Leas-Chathaoirleach and to all Senators who acted as temporary chairpersons during the year.  I wish you all a pleasant and relaxed break and hope you return refreshed for what looks like being a busy autumn session.</P>
      <P>I have notice from Senator Avril Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the prohibition of equine medicines by the EU.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Bonner of the following matter:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Public Enterprise how many and which MMDS licences a company (details supplied) applied for before the closing date for applications on 31 August 1989, the licences granted on foot of these applications and, as there were no applications for licences in the County Donegal area at the closing date for applications, the circumstances in which a company (details supplied) was granted three MMDS licences for that area in 1990.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Item 1 is to be taken without debate; item 2, Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998, Committee and Remaining Stages; item 3, Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill, 1998 [Seanad Bill amended by Dáil], Report and Final Stages; item 4, Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill, 1998, all Stages with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes; and item 5, Criminal Justice (Release of Prisoners) Bill, 1998, all Stages with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed eight minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Cathaoirleach in the customary expression of thanks at the end of session.  The Leader pre-empted us yesterday.  So fulsome were his tributes, they could almost have been put to backing music.  I join in the thanks expressed to all people who made the House work so smoothly &mdash; the officials of the House, the media and the ushers.  I particularly thank the Leader of the House for his courtesy and co-operation during the last session.</P>
      <P>Regarding today's Order of Business, I will agree to item 1 being taken without debate but it is an important motion and we should know what it is.  It would be of great help to us all if we knew the Government's thinking at this stage on the proposed standards in public office to which this motion refers.  It was a part of the Programme for Government and it is now over a year since the Government took office.  I know the issues are difficult but it would be of help to us all if we had interim information on its view.</P>
      <P>There should be the widest possible consultation on this proposal because it affects every Member of each House and the views of Members must be taken into account while the legislation is being devised.  It is particularly appropriate that the proposals will be referred to the Seanad and Dáil Select Committees on Members' Interests.  Members should be aware of that and feel free to inform the Seanad Committee of their views on this matter.  We will only do this once and we should get it right.  We must also take every care to realise that the problems we are grappling with are common to every jurisdiction and we should learn from the experiences of parliaments elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Item 6 on the Order Paper is a Private Members' Bill, introduced by Deputy Shatter, which has passed the Lower House.  Will the Leader give early consideration to this Bill when the House resumes in the autumn?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent Members I join in thanking the staff of the House for the extraordinarily good work they have done during the session.  This is, I think, the first time in the history of the State that the Seanad has sat <Col N="747" /> on an equal number of days as the Dáil.  This has been done with no increase in personnel or in the support structure available to the staff of the House.  This situation should be noted and perhaps examined by the Committee on Procedures and Privileges.  We must ensure that the staff are properly resourced to deal with this additional work load.  I thank all the staff for their efficiency and effectiveness which is tempered with good humour and directness where necessary.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for the work he has done and for his openness in ordering the business of the House.  We have learned his little ways.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>When he cannot be found &mdash; as he could not be this morning &mdash; it is usually because there is something he is not telling us. This morning's difficulty was that we had not given him specific times.  He knows we have a strict rule that times should be given for all items of business.  I understand his difficulty today and it will not be a major issue.  He has maintained the tradition of openness to discussion, established by previous Leaders of the House.</P>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the good humour and calmness with which you have dealt with difficult situations and which you have allowed permeate to the Members of the House.  I thank the reporting staff and representatives of the media.</P>
      <P>The work of the reporting staff is rarely mentioned. There is nothing more humbling than to read a verbatim account of what one has said.  I admire the ingenuity and creativity of reporters and transcribers who manage to turn our spur of the moment outbursts into complete sentences with perfect syntax.  They create for the historical record a sense of our proceedings which is vastly superior to the reality.  I thank them for that.</P>
      <P>I support Mr. Manning's point concerning item 1.  There is a tradition in the Houses of the Oireachtas that Members attend necessary meetings, come to the Houses for Votes and when they intend to speak and see to their constituency business.  We often forget our responsibility for what is happening in the Houses.  I spoke yesterday on the terms of reference for the Flood Tribunal and I do not intend reopening that debate. Senator Manning's point is a crucial one and I regret I did not think of making it yesterday. Everyone who has a view on how we should do our job should communicate that within their own groups and parties.  It is important that we understand what our work is about whether we have been in the House for one year or 20.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that sufficient time may not have been given for initial speakers on the Firearms (Temporary Provisions) Bill.  I hope some latitude will be granted and speakers permitted to speak for 15 instead of ten minutes.  Many Members have strong views on this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks made by the previous two speakers.  I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for your courtesy, understanding and flexibility, as you have just demonstrated with Senator O'Toole.  I thank the Clerk and Assistant Clerk of the Seanad, the staff of the Clerk's office, the reporting staff and all the staff of the House.  Our sittings have been extended in terms of days and hours.  We must ensure that the staff are adequately resourced to cope with this extra work which is often done under pressure.  We appreciate their hard work and good humour.  I thank the Leader for his co-operation and helpfulness.</P>
      <P>I wonder why item 1 comes before us at this time.  Surely, when the proposals for a Standards in Public Office Bill are actually laid before the Seanad we can decide what to do with them? When they are presented it will not be appropriate that this be done without debate and simply referred to the Select Committees on Members' Interests of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  Every Member has an interest in this subject and it is important that we have the opportunity to present our views at the outset.  I suggest to the Leader that this matter be dealt with in a more comprehensive fashion.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on the good Exchequer returns for the first half of the year and on their handling of the ship of state. However, I refer to a letter in today's <i>Irish Times</i> signed on behalf of Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community of Ireland and the Sonas Housing Association. It refers to the crisis in social housing and points out that 40,000 households in receipt of social welfare allowances are in the lower end of the private rented sector and 30,000 households are on local authority housing lists.  There is a serious shortage of adequate housing.  On one hand the Exchequer has a large surplus and on the other people are living in inadequate accommodation.</P>
      <P>Finally, I attended a pauper's funeral during the week.  I had not realised such a thing still existed.  The church service and the burial were not held at the normal times, the coffin was different from the normal and the burial took place in a separate part of the cemetary.  Someone who had suffered humiliation in life continued to be demeaned in death.  Given our current enormous prosperity there should be no such thing as a pauper's funeral.  We should ensure that this method of dealing with dead people is abolished; we certainly have enough money to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I extend my thanks to everybody involved in running the Houses.  In particular, I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for handling an exhausting session with your usual equanimity and fairness.  I also thank the Clerk, the Clerk Assistant and the staff of the Seanad office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said a few times this year, the burden of work on that office is constantly increasing, not <Col N="749" /> just in terms of servicing the House but also in terms of the additional functions allocated to the Cathaoirleach and the Clerk.  One need only consider the Boundary Commission and work associated with tribunals and so forth.  That has imposed an extra burden on them and somebody, somewhere will have to examine the resourcing of that office.  It is not right to allocate so many extra tasks without providing the resources to service them properly.  I also thank the ushers and members of the press who report the proceedings of the House fairly and accurately.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the manner in which the House will deal with item 1.  The committees of both Houses will continue to sit when the Houses have risen and it is appropriate that they should consider the proposals.  The obvious intention is that they will be discussed fully in both Houses but even if that does not happen in advance of the publication of the Government's proposals, it will happen following the introduction of the required legislation.</P>
    <P>My other point relates to the building work that is scheduled to start on the College of Art. This matter has been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges with the Office of Public Works.  Obviously, we are anxious to minimise the impact on future sittings of the House. Senators are privileged to sit in one of the finest public rooms in the country and everything possible must be done to ensure that nothing happens to the plaster work or the artefacts in the Seanad during construction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, a third level student with a sports injury was returning from a university in England and required a wheelchair at Luton Airport.  Ryanair charged the student £15 for the use of a wheelchair even though she was in the company of her mother.  On her arrival in Dublin Airport she was charged a further £8 for the use of a wheelchair in that airport.  Surely this must warrant the title &ldquo;Scrooge Airline of the Year&rdquo; for Ryanair.  Has this airline, under the terms of its licence, the authority to do this?  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise.  I cannot put down a motion on the matter since the House is rising today.  Can the Leader ascertain if the airline is in breach of its licence in this regard?  The action by Ryanair was totally inappropriate and I am not aware of any airline which would charge anybody for the use of a wheelchair, let alone a third level student returning from hospital with a sports injury.  The airline charged the student a total of IR£27.  That is most inappropriate and warrants investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the end of session, the Leader will have difficulty reporting back to Members on matters which are raised today. However, the Meteorological Office has confirmed that the month of June was one of the wettest on record with rainfall levels about 300 per cent above average in the midlands and the <Col N="750" /> west.  This has had a serious effect on farming incomes although that probably is not immediately apparent.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Leader to speak to the Minister for Agriculture and Food about income supports payable to farmers.  Thousands of such supports which were due to be paid in 1997 have not yet been paid while payments for early 1998 have also not been paid.  We are now approaching the period when major income support in the form of area aid payments is due, especially to low income farmers such as grassland farmers who have been worst affected by the recent bad weather.  I hope the Leader will ensure that these payments are made as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry agreed a charter of rights with the farming organisations under which the Minister undertook to pay income supports and premia by certain dates.  That has not been honoured.  The current Minister has not yet officially torn up that agreement so, in a sense, he is bound by it.  I hope the Leader will convey my plea to the Minister.</P>
      <P>A subject which is dear to the hearts of many Senators and is probably the subject of much discussion in the midlands today is the report of the Boundary Commission on the revision of constituency boundaries for next year's local government elections.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government received the report a week ago and I cannot understand why it is taking him so long to publish it.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to publish the report immediately rather than allow it to be released in dribs and drabs through leaks?  The commission was appointed to report independently to the Minister on the boundary changes, if any.  No doubt there will be many changes.  It is difficult to understand why the report should be sat on for this length of time.  It should be published immediately.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Leader to use his good offices with the Minister for Agriculture and Food to do something for small farmers who are suffering hardship as a result of the recent inclement weather.  Most of my constituents who have small farms on black land are finding it impossible to get in fodder for the winter.  There will be a serious fodder crisis next autumn.  Will the Leader ask for a fund to be set up to help these people buy this fodder?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the good wishes expressed to you, a Chathaoirligh, the Leader of the House and the staff of the Seanad.  I thank you for the manner in which business was carried out and for ensuring that the House completed an excellent schedule of work. While I might not go as far as Senator Dardis in describing the schedule as exhausting for Members&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I meant for the Cathaoirleach.</P>

    <Col N="751" />
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;there was certainly a huge increase in productivity on previous sessions.  I commend all involved, particularly the staff and the Cathaoirleach.  Those who hold posts of responsibility for ensuring such productivity had a considerably increased workload and we appreciate their work.</P>
      <P>Despite having sat for many extra days, Senators will still call on the Order of Business for more issues to be discussed and I am no exception.  I hope the Leader, when considering the programme for the autumn session, will put aside time to commemorate the 1798 Rebellion in a dignified manner.  That might be done through an interactive debate in the Seanad. Were it not for 1798 and the United Irishmen, we probably would not be in this House.  I might have been sitting in a Wexford Senate or history might have taken a different direction.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago the Cathaoirleach graced the reconvention of the Wexford Senate with his presence.  That is quite unique and in its own way it is a nice commemoration of those tragic but very interesting and exciting times.  The concept of self-determination was once the preserve of the extremes and middle ground Ireland did not talk about it because it was not considered respectable to do so.  I remember being chided by a Leader of the Fine Gael Party during the past ten years for using the concept of self-determination.</P>
      <P>With regard to public health and the environment, self-determination must be at the top of the agenda for any country.  It is the right to determine, protect and organise&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It sounds like a European issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  This issue has been around a lot longer.  Senator O'Toole is keen to get rid of me but I will be glad of any support if the occasion should arise.  There will be benefits for all if I get support.</P>
      <P>With health and the environment top of our agenda we need an urgent debate on matters involving British Nuclear Fuels and how it impacts on our self-determination as a nation.  In the broadest sense of the concept, self-determination is about these important issues as well as its normal interpretation.  I called for a debate on this issue as far back as last October and many other Senators have raised this issue as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Can the Cathaoirleach over the next few days ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, to inform us what is happening in relation to coastal zone management? He promised to come back here by the end of June to present a report on it.  It is now July and, to the best of my knowledge, I have not seen it published anywhere.  This is a very important matter for representatives from coastal areas. Coastal zone management has been bandied around by several Governments and we need to make progress on it.  I would appreciate up to date information on it. <Col N="752" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with comments thanking the Cathaoirleach, the Leader, the Whips and staff for the smooth running of Seanad Éireann during the year and for the amount of legislation that has been dealt with. I pay particular reference to the Leader and the Whip.  They caused my blood pressure to hit the roof on many occasions during the year, so much so that I did not think I would last until the end of the year.  Having said that, I am delighted we have got through so much legislation and that I am associated with it.</P>
      <P>During the year I raised some issues which have not been dealt with yet.  I called for a debate on the role of FÁS as regards the transition of young people from school to FÁS or work with FÁS playing a role, particularly apprenticeship courses.  The Education Bill will be dealt with in this House next October and, coupled with that, it is time for a debate or statements on FÁS.  We cannot deal with the Education Bill without mentioning the co-ordinated effort involved.  At the moment FÁS is a law unto itself in relation to a conflict of interest when it comes to the education of young people aged 16 years and over.  There is a conflict instead of a complementary role for both Departments.  They seem to be working from different ends of the spectrum.  Now is the time to ensure this matter will be on our agenda for next November.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Doyle referred to 1798 but I would like to discuss 1998.  I ask the Leader to convey our congratulations and continued support to the Taoiseach in his efforts to resolve a very difficult weekend that faces us here, especially in the North and in particular Portadown. I hope the decision of the Parades Commission will be adhered to.  Unfortunately, as in the past, the decision will be made that what will cause the least violence throughout the Province of Ulster will be taken into consideration rather than the feelings and efforts of the residents of the Garvaghy Road.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I attended the fish exhibition in Killybegs and as I travelled back last night I came upon an Orange parade in a town in South Fermanagh. A parade is intimidating when you come across it.  In the middle of that town is an archway and one of the difficulties that arose in Portadown last night was that there was a similar arch being erected.  I hope a resolution will be found. There has been a problem in Portadown for the past four years and it is disturbing that, until late last night, the Taoiseach was the only person to come to the assistance of the residents of Garvaghy Road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I expressed my thanks to everyone who has worked so hard this session. I forgot to include in my thanks the Deputy Leader, Senator Dardis, who has been a tower of strength.  I thank the Government Chief Whip, Senator Fitzgerald, whose experience, hard work <Col N="753" /> and energy helped this House to run smoothly.  I also thank the assistant Whip, Senator Farrell.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello and Dardis referred to item 1.  I will facilitate a debate on it at a later date.  As Senator Dardis pointed out, it is important these Oireachtas Committees continue to work during the months of July and September.  I am grateful for the co-operation of the House in relation to item 1.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning queried item 6.  I can look at it very early in the next session.  Senator O'Toole mentioned that the Seanad had the same number of sitting days as the Dáil in 1998.  This is mainly due to the new Dáil committee system and the tight voting position the Government finds itself in.  This results in 40 per cent of legislation being initiated in the Seanad.  In the past all Stages of some Bills would be dealt with in one day in the Seanad.  Now the Second Stage of a Bill is dealt with in one day and the remaining Stages are taken the following week.  This arrangement will continue under this Government.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senators O'Toole, Dardis and Manning's views on staffing levels and the pressures on the staff which result from these extra sitting days which will continue through the lifetime of this Government.  Three and four day sittings mean that the role of a Senator is a full-time position and, for Members who have to attend special committees on Mondays, it is a five day week.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello called for an urgent debate on the social housing needs and requirements over the coming years.  I will facilitate a debate during the early part of the next session.  I agree with him and thank him for his vote of congratulations to the Government on the Exchequer returns for the first six months.  Income tax returns are up 10 per cent, VAT 5.7 per cent, excise duty 12.8 per cent, corporation tax 24 per cent and stamp duty 36.6 per cent.</P>

I congratulate everyone who is making this possible through their hard work and contributions to one of the best countries in the world.</P>
      <P>I agree with the comments of Senator Connor and Senator Dan Kiely who called for the early payment of income support to farmers for the 1997 and 1998 periods.  I will pass on their remarks to the Minister after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>We are all eagerly awaiting the local constituency boundaries report.  I understand it will be published within the next 14 days.</P>

      <P>I am sure it will be sad reading for many people in rural Ireland where the population has declined.  The urban renewal scheme has been a magnificent success in larger towns and cities.  I look forward to the day when the scheme is extended to rural areas.  I am pleased the Minister included Roscommom, Cavan, Sligo, Longford and parts of Leitrim in the budget. They are hard pressed areas as the Cathaoirleach, Senator Connor and I are aware from our daily work in our constituencies.  I am sure Senator Connor welcomes the inclusion of Roscommon and looks forward to bringing the same benefits to the area the urban renewal scheme brought to larger towns over the last 15 years.  Senator Connor is consistent; he will agree with my sentiments.</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle raised the commemoration of 1798.  I have discussed this matter with the Senators from Wexford and I have agreed to make the time available; it is a pleasure to do so.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle has a keen interest in environmental matters and the problem of Sellafield. This is a major issue for all Members and I agree there should be another debate on it.  My colleague in Europe, Mr. Jim Fitzsimons, MEP, has repeatedly raised this matter over the last 15 years.  I will arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity after the summer recess.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle also mentioned the report on coastal zone management promised by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources and said it should be published as soon as possible.  I have been Leader of the House for a year and I have found the Minister most helpful and co-operative in terms of coming to the House and bringing Members up to date on his ideas and plans for future legislation.  I will ask him to come to the House for a debate which will include a question and answer session with which Senator Doyle is familiar.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde called for an urgent debate on FÁS.  I promised such a debate but an enormous amount of business will be taken today and it will be impossible to arrange it, unless the House wishes to sit until 12 midnight to discuss this important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate to what extent he can plan for as efficient a transition period as possible?  Much concern has been expressed, particularly by the smaller commercial sector, about the need for a dual pricing system for up to six months, if that arises, and the costs involved.  Will the Minister outline his thoughts on this matter and whether his advice is that there should be a tendency towards a short and efficient period to complete the changeover from IR£ to the euro?  What is the thinking among his ECOFIN colleagues on this matter which concerns many people who have considered it? <Col N="756" /> However, the real issue in the context of the changeover to the euro is that too many people, particularly in small and medium sized enterprises, are not yet thinking sufficiently about it.  If they put their heads together, the volume of concern would be much more audible.  I am interested in the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle's comments. The transition period will be the crux of the matter in terms of how it affects retailers and consumers.  Everybody remembers the problems in 1970 with the onset of decimalisation and the allegations at the time that there was widespread abuse.  People profited from the confusion over the value of the new coins in comparison to the old money.  If there is a long transitional period, there is a greater opportunity for abuse.  Another aspect is the staffing of small businesses and how they will be resourced.</P>
      <P>In the context of consumers, Senator Quinn raised the point yesterday about the operation of buses for the six month period.  Confusion will result with, for example, people paying in punts and receiving change in euros.  That will create a great deal of trouble for a considerable time. Protecting retailers and consumers in this regard will be the key to a successful transition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I hear what Senators have said.  This matter has been raised on a number of occasions during the passage of this and a previous Bill.  It has also been raised by the retail trade and customers.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to decimalisation. There is a perception that retailers availed of the opportunity at that time to hike up prices which led to an inflationary spiral.  Everyone, including myself, believes that to be the case.  I was very firm in that view until I read a recent article by the eminent former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, in which he said that might not have been the case.  He produced some compelling evidence for his view that what we had all believed happened in 1971 did not in fact happen.  He provided chapter and verse and a considerable amount of back up documentation, and more or less concluded that the facts did not seem to back up our belief about what happened with decimalisation. We examined the matter in the Department of Finance and, to be blunt, we are not too sure if Dr. Fitzgerald is right or wrong.  The question has not yet been disposed of by historians. However, people, including myself, strongly believe that decimalisation did have that result.</P>
      <P>There has been a big change in consumer attitudes since that time.  People are far more aware of competition and act accordingly.  Dual pricing is primarily a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs.  The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Director of Consumer Affairs are working on a national code of practice on dual pricing and will be consulting fully with consumer and other interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> In answer to Senator Doyle's question as to what will happen from 1 January next, we believe the ordinary Irish pound notes and coins will still be in circulation and euro notes and coins will not be in circulation until 1 January 2002.  However, we believe many of the big retail outlets will operate dual pricing from that date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>From next January?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Most big shops will operate dual pricing from next January in order to have a competitive advantage and show they are first off the mark.  That should feed down the line to smaller shops, etc.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle and others made the point yesterday that the Bill gives the Minister power to set a date between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2002 from which Irish pound notes and coins will no longer be in circulation.  Irish pound notes and coins will be hoovered up during that period and euro notes and coins will be put into the system. The point was made very strongly by Senators that we should opt for a quick sharp shock if at all possible; this will be borne in mind.  We are almost four years away from 30 June 2002, which gives us a long period to plan and during which matters will evolve.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle also made a point about the state of preparedness of small and medium sized enterprises for this changeover.  I quoted yesterday from a recent survey conducted by Forfás which used a benchmark survey conducted in June 1997.  While the awareness of small and medium sized enterprises has increased they are far behind the bigger operations.  We published a national changeover plan last year, with a second edition published in January, and we will publish a third edition later this year.  The euro changeover group, which is now the changeover board, has brought all these interests and groups together and a mountain of information is available.</P>
      <P>Over the past year I have opened a number of seminars on the subject of the changeover, primarily run by financial institutions.  While only specialists turned up to these seminars in 1997, any conferences I attended this year have been packed.  I even went as far afield as a seminar in Belmullet, County Mayo &mdash; the next stop is New York &mdash; which was attended by ordinary retailers and members of the public.  Small business people are becoming more aware and are being brought up to speed on the changeover; this awareness will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday Senator O'Toole compared this changeover to the changeover to decimalisation in 1971.  He made the point that that was a far more dramatic change and that we are far better prepared for this change.  He said we handled the change to decimalisation fairly well and he was certain we would handle the change to the euro equally well.  I am inclined to agree with him, on balance.  However, as I said yesterday, people should start preparing for the change from today. <Col N="758" /> Regardless of the size of their operation, business people should put someone in charge of handling the changeover; in most cases this will be themselves.</P>

      <P>Senator Finneran raised this issue yesterday.  It is quirky but it could arise.  What will be the legal status of our present notes and coins post June-2002? For example, what will be the status of notes and coins found one, five or ten years later in a shoe box under an elderly person's bed or under the mattress or in the attic?

      <P>That is an awkward question to answer.  I want all Irish notes and coins to be hoovered up before 30 June 2002 at the latest. The strict legal position is that Irish notes and coins will no longer be legal tender after that date.  Post 30 June 2002 the Central Bank will honour and redeem Irish pound notes and coins. However, we want to encourage people to bring in all Irish pound notes and coins, regardless of where they are kept, before that date.</P>

      <P>Since becoming Minister for Finance, I have made a virtue of saying nothing about currency.  I was asked about this yesterday and referred people to what was said in the <i>communiqué</i> after the revaluation meeting of 14 March last, when the monitoring committee said that the central rates were for all the currencies and would apply from now on.  That remains the position.  Some commentators have commented on this, perhaps with a view to encouraging speculation in the markets, but I have steadfastly refused to speculate about the markets, which have generally taken the view since 14 March that nothing further will be done in this matter.  I am not considering anything to dissuade them from that viewpoint.  People can read clearly what I have said.  It is almost 6 months until 31 December, not a very long period.</P>

      <P>One of the advantages of the new single currency is the elimination of all such problems.  The notes will be common throughout the 11 participating countries and may be produced under licence from the European Central Bank.  For example, notes used in a shop in County Roscommon will be similar to those in use in France.  Coins are somewhat different but there will be exchangeability throughout the 11 participating countries.  One side of the coins, which will have a map of Europe, will be common throughout Europe while the obverse, in the case of Ireland, will contain the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;, the year, the harp and the 12 stars of Europe.  The coins will be similar throughout the participating states in terms of minting.  It will not be necessary to <Col N="762" /> change them in a <i>bureau de change</i> as they will be totally interchangeable in the 11 states.  Only if one is travelling outside the 11 states, for example, to the UK or Denmark, will it be necessary to change currency, in these cases to sterling or kroner, respectively.  In the other 11 states the problem of changing currency will no longer exist whether one is in Bonn or Ballydehob.</P>

      <P>No. The section deals with the redenomination of the outstanding debt into euros.  Subsection (1) provides that the Minister for Finance may by order on such date or dates and under such terms and conditions as he or she determines, redenominate into euros all or part of the outstanding debt issued by or on behalf of the State under Irish law and denominated in punts.  Subsection 2(a)(i) provides that the Minister for Finance may redenominate into the euro unit any debt he or she has issued in a currency to be replaced by the euro, provided the member state in the currency of which the debt is denominated has redenominated all or part of its national currency sovereign debt into euros.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsection 2(a)(ii) provides that the method of redenomination used by the Minister for redenomination under subsection 2(a)(i) must be that laid down in the law of the member state under which the debt was issued.  Subsection (2)(a)(iii) requires the Minister to give at least one month's <Col N="763" /> notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of his or her intention to effect a redenomination into euros under subsection (2)(a)(i) of any debts issued in a currency to be replaced by the euro.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3)(a) relates to facility agreements in respect of borrowings which State bodies have with financial institutions.  It provides that subject to certain conditions, where amendments to facility agreements consequent on the introduction of the euro are agreed between the parties to them, there will be no need for the parties to obtain ministerial consent to change the terms of the contract to these ends.  Subsection (3)(b) provides for the same waiver as subsection (3)(a) in relation to State guarantees given in respect of borrowings of State bodies.  In other words, the section gives power for debt to be redenominated into euros.  The NTMA will continue in existence as it deals with all matters relating to the national debt.</P>

      <P>My question was facetious.  I understand that much of the currency juggling to save interest by the NTMA has been done by very successfully playing the European currency market.  This possibility will not be available to the NTMA when we are tied into the euro.  What impact will monetary union have on the ability of the NTMA to continue being successful?  It may look to other global currencies, but will Union impact on its manoeuvrability and ability to do the job for which it was established?</P>

      <P>My questions relate to redenomination in the context of share capital and companies. In the context of the national debt or a company, does a ministerial order simply involve a stroke of the pen or will it involve a commission? Will any charge accrue to the Government or in terms of share capital?</P>
      <P>Sterling will not be part of monetary union at the beginning.  Up to 40 per cent of our business is with the UK and many companies will have no choice but to maintain part of their operations in sterling.  If sterling joins monetary union in the not too distant future, as intended, will the same rules apply in terms of redenomination?  Will those who hold on to sterling receive its face value at that time?  Can the market be played in the context of how sterling will perform <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro?</P>

      <P>I assume that section 23(2)(a)(i) will come into operation when sterling, as expected, joins the single currency and that it will be possible to denominate the sterling part of a debt, if such exists, into euros.  In other words, I presume a new section or Bill will not be necessary.</P>

      <P>Senator Doyle raised the work of the NTMA <i>vis-à-vis</i> different currencies.  One of the great advantages of the single currency will <Col N="764" /> be that it will reduce the vulnerability of exchange rate risk for the NTMA in dealing with those currencies.  A very successful operation can be run and very good rates of interests obtained through borrowing in deutsche marks or French francs, etc.  Currently, if the rate of exchange goes against us, the overall situation will be worsened. For example, on 31 December each year a figure is given for the total national debt.  The end of year total national debt account is shown in various currencies but the final figure is given in punts.  A conversion is done on the basis of the conversion rate applying on 31 December.  At the end of 1996 the conversion rates were very favourable with the punt being dramatically lower than the previous year.  In 1997 it was a bit higher.  A spot rate has to be taken on the date of conversion.  In dealing with bonds issued in other currencies the NTMA will not run an exchange rate risk which will be an advantage.</P>
      <P>At the end of May 1998 the national debt was £30.23 billion.  Of this, £3 billion was in currencies to be replaced by the euro while £4.8 billion was in non-euro currencies, namely, sterling and US dollars.  By the beginning of next year the composition of the national debt will be somewhat different as some foreign debt will be maturing and refinanced in punts.  However, it is unlikely to significantly affect the broad order of magnitudes to which I referred.</P>
      <P>On our succession to monetary union the £3 billion of our debt which is in currencies being substituted by the euro will effectively become domestic debt and thus not be exposed to foreign exchange risk.  For example, if the Irish debt is in French francs and deutsche marks, it will be converted into euros so it will become part of the domestic debt.  The debt will be expressed in euros on the balance sheet.</P>
      <P>Deputy Costello asked what the financial institutions will do because costs will have to be borne.  Senator Dardis made a point about sterling when it joins.  The amount of national debt which will be non-domestic after 1 January will be expressed in sterling.  If sterling joins EMU in years to come, the same will apply as with the other currencies.  At present, interest rates in the UK are considerably higher than in Germany. Two weeks ago the Bank of England raised interest rates again.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister to get into the area of exchange rate because he handled it well in the past and I would not like him to say anything today which would prejudice our actions in the future.  Given the exposure on sterling when the euro comes into being and that stability will operate by denominating debt in the euro, it would seem attractive to take the best spot rate before sterling joins and convert to the euro at that point.</P>

      <P>This section refers to the transfer of Central Bank functions.  On Second Stage I raised the question of the interests of small countries. The European Central Bank will be responsible for decisions made with some guidelines from the Commission.  What type of protective measures are in place for our Central Bank? What is the position between our Central Bank and the European Central Bank in relation to decisions made?  Will there be a consultative process? We do not have anybody in the managerial section.  Will a person or unit from each country be consulted by the European Central Bank on decisions made on interest rates and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A carefully worked out structure has been put in place in relation to the European Central Bank.  The executive board of the bank will comprise the six people whose names were announced on the first weekend in May.  Mr. Duisenberg has been appointed president and there will be a vice-president and four other members.  They will comprise the executive board of the European Central Bank.  The governing body will be the governing council of the European Central Bank which will made up of the six executive board members plus the governors of the Central Banks of the participating member states totalling 17 persons.  They will make the policy decisions which will be carried out by the executive board of the European Central Bank.</P>
      <P>The governor of the Irish Central Bank, Mr. Maurice O'Connell, will sit on the governing council of the European Central Bank.  The governing council will make the decisions on the policy of the European Central Bank which will be carried out by the executive board of which Mr. Duisenberg is president.  The European Central Bank formally came into operation on 1 July, in accordance with the Treaty, but it has been operational for the past month.  The European Central Bank makes decisions on interest rates and other matters relating to its area of jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, all participating member states have handed over two tools from their financial armoury.  The ability of each country to set its own exchange rate has been subsumed into the European Central Bank as has ability to set interest rates.  That applies to this country and the other participating member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>How does that tally with the statement made by Mr. Duisenberg?  He was reported to have said at the launch of the European <Col N="766" /> Central Bank that Germany and France, the larger countries, would determine interest rates and that they would definitely fall.  That does not suggest much consultation.  Decisions will be made by the European Central Bank.  What will be the status of the governors of each Central Bank in terms of taking on board advice on their economies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be clear about this issue.  The European Central Bank sets interest and exchange rates of the euro against other currencies. The Irish Central Bank no more than the Belgian, French or German Central Banks no longer has these powers.  The Central Banks will continue to exist because of their prudential role in relation to financial institutions and the wide variety of activity which they undertake.  Interest rates will be set by the European Central Bank and neither the Bundesbank nor the Irish Central Bank will have powers in that regard.  The powers of the Irish Central Bank and the other banks will be subsumed by the European Central Bank.</P>
      <P>There was nothing too startling about what President Duisenberg said in Frankfurt on Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was nothing surprising about it because he had said it before.  When the Irish Central Bank sets the short-term interest rates it does so for the entire country.  If there is a problem in the south-west, it does not set a lower interest rate for Cork and Kerry, a higher one for Dublin and Kildare and another for Donegal and Cavan.  The Irish Central Bank does not operate in that way nor will the European Central Bank, which will set interest rates and make decisions on policy on the basis of what is in the best economic interests of Europe as a whole.  The Governor of the Irish Central Bank and the governors of the other banks and the executive board, which will make up the governing council, will be involved in that decision making process.</P>
      <P>Some people have tried to read into what Mr. Duisenberg said the other day something new which should not have been said.  It would have been surprising if he has said anything else.  The Irish Central Bank sets interest rates in the best economic interests of the entire country and does not differentiate and apply different interest rates to particular regions.</P>
      <P>It is amazing the way some economists like to have a number of bites of the cherry.  They blame politicians for trying to have it both ways but no group is better at that than economists and financial analysts. If the records are checked it will be found that all over the world, and not just in Ireland, they have been wrong in their predictions over the past 30 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several years ago a big selling point in Ireland joining a single currency was the prospect of <Col N="767" /> lower transaction costs and, more importantly, lower interest rates.  Senator Doyle and I are of the same vintage.  We attended UCD at the same time and lived through our political and business careers with interest rates three times what they are today.  Many of my friends were put out of business because of colossal interest rates.  One of the great recent successes of the economy has been lower interest rates, which have enabled it to sustain its present high economic growth rates.</P>
    <P>The economists and analysts who, 15 years ago, called for lower interest rates as a spur to business are now saying that low interest rates will be very bad for the economy and will engender inflationary tendencies.  They did not want us to join the single currency for other reasons, primarily because they thought it would not work.  They should be consistent in their argument.  Nevertheless, they have successfully persuaded people that lower interest rates are bad because they will cause a spiral in inflation.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to debate with economists whether lowering interest rates at present will have much of an effect on inflation.  It is an open question.  No economist predicted that the economy would grow at a rate of 7 to 8 per cent on average over the last number of years with inflation at 1 or 2 per cent.  Indeed, had people made such a prediction they would have been laughed at, yet it happened.  This is not an exact science.</P>
    <P>France and Germany are the largest economies in Europe.  According to a recent survey France, Germany and Italy make up approximately 75 per cent of the GDP of the 11 member states joining the single currency.  I was not, therefore, surprised at President Duisenberg's remarks.  He had made them previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>President Duisenberg baldly expressed what we had been thinking and saying for some time.  He said interest rate policy in the euro zone will be set to meet the requirements of the bigger member states, such as Germany and France.  The Minister's analogy about not setting different interest rates for Counties Cork and Kerry as opposed to Counties Dublin and Meath is irrelevant here.  The President's remark sticks in my craw, not because it is not what would probably happen but because, if it is to be top of the agenda of the ECB and policy driven by the President, one wonders where the interests of the smaller member states will get a hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The differing economic cycles in the different euro countries means that, because of the success of the economic management in this country for some years, the policies set by the ECB will not, or may not, be in our best interests.  We do not know.  The Minster said 95 per cent of our economic analysts have been proved wrong in their forecasts over the past 20 years.  To whom do the Government and the Department of Finance listen?  Who is expert in this area?  How does one define a professional economist or economic consultant? <Col N="768" /> The bigger the name the more often they have been proved wrong.</P>

      <P>Not enough sun.  The seasonal effect of disorder.  There is something wrong and it affects all sections of the community.  There seems to be something wrong if the people we look to to comment and guide those of us with no expertise in this area have been proved wrong 99 per cent of the time over the past 20 years. That is a frightening scenario.  I hope the minority of those who point to the US and other economies, with their high growth and low inflation, will be proven right and that the bigger names who do not allude to this phenomenon will analyse this and see if, with an even greater reduction in interest rates here, growth will continue without overheating and without price inflation.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister is right.  I gather from more economic commentators this morning that the proposed reduction in interest rates may not be the full 2 per cent.  We are now being prepared for a reduction of just over 1 per cent, which is probably nearer the reality, perhaps to dampen expectations and stop the money being spent in the prospect of greater reductions.  In view of this, I hope there are enough serious commentators who can urge caution on those who would continue to be prophets of doom and gloom.  Perhaps they are hedging their bets and are into worst case scenarios and want to be sure they have covered every option.  It is depressing to listen to the views of the Minister and of the economic commentators and financial analysts.  It is Hobson's choice.  They are contradictory in the direction of their views.  One picks a commentator and one has a future.  I hope the Minister's natural optimism is justified.  We support him on that.</P>
      <P>I am at a disadvantage in that I do not have a copy of the Central Bank Act, 1989, before me. Do I interpret the insertion of this new subsection (4A) in section 134(4) of that Act to mean that there should be no political interference in the Central Bank?  The subsection states:</P>
      <P>No direction under this section shall be made by the Minister in respect of the performance of any function or duty of the Bank, .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister assure the House that this will not preclude a healthy financial services authority being brought into play to ensure that those functions in the interest of consumer protection, <Col N="769" /> which the Central Bank has failed to carry out, can have direction and that changes can be made in that area?</P>

      <P>As Minister for Finance I take advice from everyone and then do my own thing; that pleases the officials in the Department of Finance greatly.</P>
      <P>The independence of the European Central Bank is guaranteed by the statute which established it.  The Central Bank Act which I introduced removed any possibility of interference and made our Central Bank legislation compatible with the ECB.  The European Monetary Institute, however, noted two imperfections in the underlying Central Bank legislation regarding the guarantee that there could be no interference at all.  I read the background note on this and in its report in March 1998 on the compatibility of Irish Central Bank legislation with the provisions of the EU Treaty and the statute of the European system of central banks, the European Monetary Institute advised that, with the commencement of certain provisions of the Central Bank Act, 1998, there will be no remaining incompatibilities in Irish law with the Treaty and statute requirements for stage 3 of EMU.  Every member state had to change its central bank legislation to ensure it was compatible with the ECB structure. The European Monetary Institute examined the legislation and agreed it.  Some countries are not totally in line yet but Ireland was one of the first to implement its recommendations.</P>
      <P>According to the EMI, however, two imperfections still existed.  The first imperfection is in section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989.  This is addressed in section 12 (27) of the Bill before us.  The second imperfection related to the provision in the Central Bank Act, 1997, for the establishment and supervision of Payment Systems Ireland.  That is dealt with in section 28 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, empowered the Minister for Finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, to <Col N="770" /> direct that certain business transactions be suspended if he or she considered it necessary in the national interest or for the purpose of safeguarding the currency of the State.  The Central Bank would not immediately suspend operations if there was a run on the Irish currency.  Central Bank legislation allowed the Minister for Finance to direct the Central Bank to suspend operations.</P>
    <P>Section 19 of the Central Bank Act, 1998, amended this provision in order to recognise the competence of the ESCB in the field of monetary policy and the transfer to Community level of all monetary powers of member states participating in EMU.  It did so by direct reference to the Minister exercising this power with regard to the safe-guarding of the currency of the State.  In its convergence report, however, the European Monetary Institute said that this new provision needs to be clarified to avoid any possibility of Government interference in the Central Bank's ESCB related operations.  Such interference was never envisaged in the preparation of the 1998 legislation and would not be permissible under the Treaty.  Nevertheless section 27 clears up the imperfection by providing that in exercising the power conferred by section 134 of the 1989 Act, the Minister for Finance cannot make a directive in respect of the performance by the Central Bank of any function or duty, or the exercise by it of any power required by the Treaty or under the statute of the ESCB.</P>

There is much work that the Central Bank will no longer have to do. What does that mean for the staff?  Will there be cutbacks at the Central Bank?</P>
      <P>What about the transferral of powers?  The Governor of the Central Bank stated when the abuses in national banks first arose that it was not the role of the Central Bank to deal with these matters, it had broader areas to deal with and daily monitoring of what was happening in domestic banks was outside its domain.  It is time to tighten up the procedures and regulatory responsibilities of the Central Bank.  It should now be given a hands-on role in monitoring the day to day operations of the various banks within the State.</P>

The number of people working in the monetary policy area who will find their activities subsumed by the European Central Bank is very small.

I am disappointed the expertise in the Central Bank which has so successfully guided our financial affairs for so long has not been better recognised in the ECB.</P>
      <P>As we cede control of our affairs and the role of the Central Bank changes dramatically, we should thank successive Governors for the safe management of our finances.  Secure managment by the Central Bank has contributed in no small way to the economic success we are enjoying.  We have not yet existed for eight decades as a sovereign State and we have had a particularly successful record.  The integrity and expertise of those involved has been second to none.  This is all the more reason for disappointment that this was not recognised at a higher level in the pecking order of the ECB.  What are the Minister's views on this?</P>
      <P>This is historic legislation.  There is great fondness and affection for the pound in our pocket and our legal tender in general.</P>

      <P>It will take a good PR machine in the Department of Finance to ensure that people feel comfortable about the change to a new currency.  This changeover jars with some people.  Their fears are exacerbated because they are not sure about what is happening and how it will work.  I hope these fears are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>It is a major move for any sovereign state to relinquish its legal tender and adopt a common currency.  We may be getting older than we would like to admit but my children do not know about the half crown or the sixpence.  They look puzzled when one talks about 12 pence in the shilling. How quickly we forgot the system with which we were reared.  Young people look upon a threepenny bit as if it was a currency from the Far East. How quickly we will forget the punt and become familiar with the euro.  The next generation will be reared with it and will not know what a punt coin is or appreciate the beautiful coinage we have had.  I express my thanks and appreciation to the designers of our coinage which has been aesthetically beautiful.  We have lost control of design as the euro is designed centrally, but we should record our appreciation of the designers of our coinage and of the safe pairs of hands which has been in the Central Bank that we have taken for granted.  The bank was so safe and had such integrity that it never hit the headlines and we could afford the luxury of taking it for granted.</P>

      <Col N="773" /> This important legislation will mean the pound coin and punt notes will be phased out as we transfer to a common European currency &mdash; the euro.</P>

      <P>I am touched by Senator Doyle's fond nostalgia for past coinage and currency &mdash; I will throw in the tanner, the farthing and the bob. This is a dramatic and far reaching development. It is by far the biggest step we have taken on European union.  It is a huge step to go past any suggestions of federation or subsidiarity and straight to unity of coinage and currency.  Both sides of the House have supported this in the belief that it will work.  It is not being taken with an absolute conviction that it will be successful but in the belief that pooling our sovereignty is the best way to go forward collectively.</P>
      <P>The new currency may be a success or a failure. I believe and hope it will be a success.  However, what if it fails?  I raised this matter on Second Stage but did not hear the Minister's reply.  Are there any contingency plans for such an appalling vista?</P>

Other countries will experience great difficulties, particularly with their economic situations, unemployment rates and so on.  We are in a fortunate position.  Had we wanted to enter ten years ago there would have been a greater questioning of conscience. However, despite the possibility of higher inflation, this is a good time to enter because of the strength of the economy, .</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Central Bank for its good work.  It will not go out of existence so this is not its demise.  It has been effective and successful in keeping the ship of state afloat and in a strong fiscal position.  I also pay tribute to the Minister and his officials and thank him for the generous and courteous way he has dealt with this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the comprehensive way he has dealt with the Committee Stage debate which at times strayed well beyond the scope of the sections under discussion. However, it is right that these important issues were discussed.  We have already rehearsed the arguments for and against the single currency. The overwhelming argument in favour is that it will bring a degree of stability and lower interest <Col N="774" /> rates and conversion costs in terms of trade and travel within the EU will be eliminated.  The banks have gained enough from these margins over the years and I am sure they will find other ways of making money in the future.</P>
      <P>The negative side of the debate is that we will be vesting part of our sovereignty in the European Central Bank.  There is also the question of sterling and our vulnerability in that area. However, we will be part of a large pool and in that circumstance our ability to resist movements in sterling will be much greater than in the past when we had to defend our currency by large increases in interest rates.  On the philosophical argument about economists, the Minister and I are more accustomed to putting our money on the nag in the 3 o'clock in the Curragh or Punchestown and perhaps that influences our thinking; the dismal science has frequently been in error. This science differs from other areas of life.  If one is an agricultural consultant and recommends a certain course of action for a crop, if the crop does not grow the consequences are pretty immediate and devastating.  Economists do not have to confront these types of realities.  In terms of our influence over the European Central Bank for a small country our influence will be quite substantial because we are one of the governors represented on the board of the bank.  This will give us a particular influence which is greater than it might have been for a small country.  On balance, I believe joining the single currency will be beneficial.  I wish the legislation well and I know the Minister will do everything in his power to ensure any negatives that might occur during this development in our economic history will be minimised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  Senator Dardis raised a point about our voice within the European Central Bank.  This breaks down into two areas.  I have dealt with the question of the Governor of the Irish Central Bank being on the 17 member board of the European Central Bank. This will be the governing council of the European Central Bank.  The executive board consisting of the president, vice president and four executive members will carry out operations.  The governing council will make the policy and Ireland has the same voice there as the other participating 11 states.  We have as big a voice on that board as France and Germany and matters will be decided by a simple majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question was also raised about top management positions which were filled recently.  The filling of these positions is a matter for the new European Central Bank.  Of the 59 positions filled, 49 were transfers from the existing European <Col N="775" /> Monetary Institute, so six positions were filled.  Of the 49 positions being transferred, Ireland has three people appointed.  This is a far greater number than we should have on the executive board.  No one from the Department of Finance applied for one of these top positions.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned the failure of the single currency.  It is like Irish marriage pre the divorce referendum &mdash; there is no opt out mechanism. This must work because failure has not been contemplated.  The architects of the single currency went singlehandedly about their job and left no doubt in people's minds that it would work.  This is Irish marriage pre the divorce referendum &mdash; you are in it, you must stay in it and it must work.  There are no side rules if it is a failure. This will not be a failure.  I am an expert in both these areas as people inside and outside the House know.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis pointed out that being part of this large pool will have big advantages for a small country like Ireland.  There has been much emphasis by economists on giving away our sovereignty and so on but there has not been enough emphasis on the fact that we will benefit from being part of a larger pool and that we will have no need to worry about currency fluctuations against the French franc or the deutsche mark. Hopefully, if the United Kingdom joins the single currency in the next few years, we will have eliminated all our exchange rate risks except that of the dollar.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions over the past two days.  Obviously much of the Bill is technical.  Nevertheless, it marks a historic moment by declaring that from 1 January 1999 the euro is the currency of the State.  The adoption of the euro will represent a significant further step in the process of European unification.  At a national level it will mark the closing of the chapter in our affairs when the monetary unit of the State was the Irish pound.  From both a European and national viewpoint, we are witnessing an important moment as this Bill passes into law.</P>
    <P>The Bill had a speedy passage through the Oireachtas, and I would like to thank the Members of both Houses for their work in examining and debating it.</P>
    <P>I also thank the personnel in the various bodies we consulted, including those represented on the EMU Changeover Board of Ireland, for their valuable contribution to the drafting of the Bill. Finally, the officials of both Houses, as always, co-operated fully with us in the processing of the Bill and I thank them also for their help.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance <Col N="776" /> with Standing Order 85, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question, &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil.  This is looked upon as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. Therefore, the only matters which may be discussed are the amendments made by the Dáil. For the convenience of Senators, I have arranged for the amendments to be printed and circulated. Members may speak only once.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will outline the purpose of the various amendments made in the Dáil since 16 June when the Seanad passed the Bill.  A number of the amendments are of a technical nature and they have been introduced to improve the text of the Bill, address omissions and correct some minor drafting errors.  However, some significant amendments have been made both in response to issues raised by Senators, which I undertook to consider, and to issues and concerns raised by Deputies in the Dáil.  Sections 1, 17, 40, 41, 44, 47, 49 and 51 have all been amended for technical reasons and encompass amendments Nos. 1 to 4, 8, 13, 15 to 17, 20 to 22, 23 to 26 and No. 27.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that there was considerable discussion about the membership of the board of the agency and the term of office of board members.  The issues raised related specifically to the term of office of members and it was suggested that board members should not serve for more than ten consecutive years.  I undertook to consider these matters before reporting back to the Seanad.  I was also anxious, having heard the debate, to ensure that no member of the board would serve more than five years after initial appointment by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 has been amended accordingly by amendments Nos. 5 and 6.  Section 9(8) now provides for a simple rotation of board members whereby, on every anniversary of the establishment day, two members of the board retire.  This new formula will ensure no member of the board will serve more than five years after initial appointment by the Minister, no board member will serve more than ten consecutive years as required by the new section 9(10), and the new rotational formula should avoid a situation where all members of the board retire on a common date thus ensuring continuity of experience on the board.  I acknowledge the contributions of Senator Quinn and others on this issue.  The principle of imposing a limitation on periods of service has also been applied to the chief executive officer of Enterprise Ireland whose term of appointment will be limited to a maximum of ten <Col N="777" /> years.  This is provided for by amendment No. 7 in Section 13.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 to section 33 provides for a new statutory, aggregate grant limit for Forfás, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland of £1.5 billion.  The Bill as passed by the Seanad set the aggregate limit at £2 billion.  Concern was expressed at the select committee that the £2 billion threshold was too high and that a lower threshold, which would allow for earlier Oireachtas consideration of this and related industrial policy issues, would be more appropriate. Having considered the concerns raised in the Dáil I agreed to set the new threshold at a lower level of £1.5 billion.  The aggregate at the moment is £750,000 and will be reached at the beginning of this month.  Even if this Bill had not been introduced, it would have been necessary to introduce amending legislation to amend the aggregate sum.  I estimate that this should be sufficient to provide for aggregate expenditure by the relevant agencies for about a three year period at current expenditure levels.</P>
    <P>A number of concerns were raised by members of both Houses about the role of science and innovation.  I fully share the views expressed about the importance of science technology and innovation.  Product life cycles are constantly shortening and, more than ever, companies need to introduce new products and processes to survive. Technology and innovation in all its forms are major drivers of business success.  Without innovation there is stagnation and, in business, those who stagnate rarely survive.</P>
    <P>I have made a number of amendments to provide an increased emphasis on science and innovation. Section 22 deals with the annual report of the agency.  I have introduced amendments Nos. 9 and 10 which provide that the annual report must now specifically comment on innovation and on research and development performance. In section 24 I have accepted amendments Nos. 11 and 12 from Deputy Broughan to include a reference to laboratories in this section which deals with the premises of the agency.  While laboratories would be included in the overall term &ldquo;premises&rdquo;, I was happy to accept this amendment as a further indication that Enterprise Ireland will have a strong technology function.</P>
    <P>In section 45 I introduced amendments Nos. 18 and 19 which explicitly include science and innovation within the functions of Forfás.  Forfás has a continuing significant role to play in the co-ordination of science and innovation policy.  It provides the secretariat to the recently established Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation. It also plays a key role in co-ordinating Ireland's participation in international science and technology activities with particular reference to the EU framework programmes which provide one of the major sources of funding for Irish researchers &mdash; some 150 million ECU over the past four years.  The Bill now fully acknowledges the role of Forfás in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> In both Houses a number of concerns were raised, especially by Senator Costello in this House and Deputies Owen, Broughan and Rabbitte in the other House, regarding the staff of the agency.  In response I have given assurances that the terms and conditions of the staff involved will not be made less favourable due to the creation of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    <P>In speaking about my amendments in the area of science, technology and innovation, I spoke about the pace of change and the need to be responsive to it.  Change is everywhere and the public service is not immune to it.  The strategic management initiative is having a major impact in breaking down the barriers between the public and private sector.  Increasingly there is a realisation that the public service must provide the same levels of excellence in customer service, innovation, flexibility and responsiveness as the best private sector organisations.  Many public servants have welcomed the SMI and are using it as a vehicle to promote change and make their organisations a better place in which to work.</P>
    <P>Customer service will be at the heart of Enterprise Ireland in line with the move from an agency supply driven approach to genuine response to the needs of client firms as outlined in my Second Stage speech.  In the Bill I provided for flexibility in staffing structures, with the possibility of having Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland become employers of their own staff.  I am aware that some Members expressed concern that this could have negative implications for staff, particularly in regard to the possibility that the opportunities for mobility of staff among the agencies, which currently exists in the single employer structure, could be lost if each agency was to employ its own staff.  I have given assurances that this will not be the case.  However, to place the matter beyond all doubt, I have specifically provided for mobility in a new Part IX &mdash; section 52.  Amendment No. 28 provides that staff of Forfás, NSAI, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will have the right to apply for and be considered for vacancies in those organisations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the initiative of the Minister in responding favourably to the concerns expressed by Members in both Houses. That she has accepted a number of the amendments is an indication of her openness to good and constructive proposals and her response today is a strong and firm indication of this.</P>
      <P>Her acceptance of an amendment that the chief executive should not spend more than ten years in office is welcome.  People who remain for too long in such positions can go stale whereas, if they move on with that experience behind them, they will be prime candidates for fine positions in other organisations.  It is not an inhibition on nor should it restrict potential candidates for the position of chief executive of Enterprise Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a good idea not to allow board members remain members for more than ten consecutive years.  That is a long time and change is so rapid, <Col N="779" /> especially in the area of technology and industry, there is a need to appoint people with more recent and modern expertise and experience.  This measure which has been introduced will enable future Ministers to respond to that.  It is a wise and welcome amendment.</P>
    <P>There was an extensive debate in the select committee on the aggregate grant limit of £2 billion as against £1.5 billion.  I cannot argue with what was said but it is important the workings of the organisations should not be restricted.  If there is an urgent need to introduce amending legislation that should be done quickly without major bureaucratic discussions within Departments which would inhibit development.  If the current economic buoyancy continues, extra investment will be needed.  The amendment will not be opposed on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recognised the need for innovation, research and development.  If Ireland is to attract investment we must pay close attention to research and development, particularly in the areas of science and technology.  We have a skilled and highly educated workforce and it is important that we maintain this high standard.  I am delighted that the Minister has decided that the annual report of Enterprise Ireland will include a section on innovation, research and development.</P>
    <P>When semi-State bodies reorganise there is always a concern about staffing.  The Minister has assured the House that the terms and conditions of staff will not be adversely affected by the changeover. It is important that the terms of the strategic management initiative are adhered to and that the public sector can compete with the private sector.</P>
    <P>Semi-State organisations must focus on customer service.  Leadership from organisations such as Enterprise Ireland is important if our current economic success is to continue.  The combined skills of the public and private sectors can be a strong force.</P>
    <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs can play a role in promoting the Irish economy.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs might not agree, but the diplomatic work of our Embassies &mdash; in the EU, for example &mdash; is diminishing and the commercial role of our missions abroad could be expanded. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment might discuss this matter with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  All our representatives abroad, whether in the Diplomatic Service or semi-State companies, should work together for the betterment of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>Without reiterating what Senator Taylor-Quinn has said, I compliment the Minister on her openness in accepting amendments on all Stages of the Bill.  It has been strengthened by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the aggregate grant limit of £1.5 billion represents a compromise.  I am sure the concerns expressed by Deputy Rabbitte in the <Col N="780" /> Dáil are unfounded.  When an organisation is given responsibility it is important that it is given ownership of its task and that a miserable limit is not placed on its budget.  I do not suggest that a limit of £1.5 billion is miserable but a limit of £2 billion would have better reflected the current situation. I welcome the increased emphasis on research and development.</P>
    <P>It is important that all staff feel that their needs are accommodated and that the reorganisation will not affect their career paths.  An organisation which is concerned with initiative and innovation must encourage these qualities in its staff and allow them to move through agencies, to cross-train and to experience different parts of the organisation.  The Minister has referred to a customer service focus, a bottom up approach and a client focused attitude.  These are important.  I compliment the Minister and her officials on the management of this legislation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister accepted the proposals for the structure of the board and the length of time each member would serve.  A cap of ten years on the period in office of the chairman and chief executive and five years in the case of other members is worthwhile.</P>

      <P>I merely mention the matter in passing.  Had I not been interrupted the matter would hardly have been noticed.  That is peanuts in the international context, in terms of the amount of money required to put a country in a pole position with regard to science and technology.  In a previous Seanad debate &mdash; I am not sure if it was on this legislation &mdash; I referred to the Eureka programme in which member states pool their resources to enable projects to be carried out for small business.  Ireland contributes about £2 million to the fund and that contribution should be increased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="781" /> A great deal more must also be done about research in Irish universities.  The holder of a primary degree cannot benefit from any State grants to study for a masters degree or a doctorate. These are basic areas which must be examined again.  There has been investment in certain areas of technology but unless it can be applied to higher degrees of research we cannot benefit properly from the resources currently in place. We must assist research at all levels.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the inclusion of section 52 which will go a long way towards assuaging our concerns about the staffing arrangements.  It states:</P>
    <P>Where a vacancy arises for a position in the staff of Forfás, the Agency, IDA or the NSAI, a member of the staff of any of those bodies may make an application to fill the vacancy and his or her application shall be considered by the body in which the vacancy occurs.</P>
    <P>That is extremely important.  Applicants will be selected on the basis of what is required by the relevant agency.  Staffing conditions have also been strengthened considerably.  I was concerned there might be inadequate provision and that the manner in which the staffing arrangements were outlined was open to abuse or at least to perceived abuse.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation.  The aim of streamlining development and marketing is a good one which will contribute to the development and resourcing of indigenous industry.  It will make us competitive in markets both at home and abroad. These are necessary developments and the Minister has gone about her business in the right way.</P>
    <P>I hope the agency is a success and the end result is, for the first time, productive and successful indigenous industry.  Most of our industry is bolstered by the multinational sector and while that is wonderful, it is vulnerable to the first wind of depression that might blow in other parts of the world.  It is, therefore, extremely important that we have a firm and healthy foundation for industry and research at all levels.  I am not unhappy with the reduction to £1.5 billion.  It covers a three year period and there is an opportunity to review it.  The sum can be changed if required as the occasion arises.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and I hope the legislation works effectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the staff in the office of the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsmen for fast tracking this legislation.  It is always difficult to get legislation drafted because of the high level of demand on the limited resources of that office, but the staff there worked extremely hard to <Col N="782" /> produce the Bill and to assist us with the amendments.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to gender balance. Northern Ireland has a system in which one can declare oneself male, female or other.  Two members of the board have been appointed, the chief executive designate, who will be an <i>ex officio</i> member, and the chairman designate, Mr. Pat Molloy.  I have not made any other appointments so it is not true that there have been four appointments.  Ten more appointments must be made by the Government in the next few weeks and we will take account of the comments made in these debates.  We want to appoint people with relevant experience and an amendment to that effect has been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox expressed concern about the aggregate sum.  It was decided to reduce it following the comments made in the Dáil.  The comments were reasonable in the circumstances.  The individual estimates for the different agencies form part of the Estimates process and the Oireachtas has an opportunity to discuss them each year.  However, after a three year period it might be no harm for the Oireachtas to have the opportunity to discuss industrial policy and that is why I agreed to reduce the sum.  When this Government is negotiating its programme for government for its next term, it will have to review industrial policy into the early part of the next century.  I look forward to coming before the House again in some capacity during the term of office of that next Government, of which I intend to be a member.</P>
    <P>This legislation is not just about setting up a new agency but about a new approach to industrial policy.  I thank the Senators for the spirit in which they dealt with the Bill.  They took it seriously and looked at the issues in depth.  The Bill is the better of the consequent improvements that were made.</P>
    <P>Officials do not like to be named so I will not name mine.  I have had the privilege of working with a small but dynamic group of officials for the past year.  Three of them are in the Chamber while the Assistant-Secretary could not be here. They have worked extremely hard to bring forward this legislation and I am deeply impressed by their commitment and the manner in which they went about this task.  They have been negotiating with the unions involved once every three weeks for the past six months so they have left no stone unturned.  I want them to know how much the Government and I appreciate the enormous efforts they have made to bring us to this point and I look forward to the continuation of our work when the agency is established.</P>
    <P>It is intended to establish the agency within the next two weeks, assuming the President signs the legislation into law.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and the Clerk of the Seanad for facilitating this debate today as I am aware the Seanad has a large agenda.  I am also grateful for the opportunity to initiate the Bill in the Seanad.  It was <Col N="783" /> good that the Seanad had the first opportunity to review it.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn made an important point about our diplomats with which I agree. The Government recently decided to upgrade the consulate offices in the United States.  In doing that we have also given a commitment that all new staff at the level of consulate general who are sent to such offices will become involved with the industrial development agencies before taking up their positions.  They will be very much involved in industrial development, trade and promotion.</P>
    <P>In the context of the political problems in Northern Ireland hopefully being resolved, there will be a greater role for our consulate offices in the trade, promotion and industrial development areas.  That decision was made recently and it was probably announced by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope I am not gazumping his announcement. It is a significant development and the Senator's point was valid.  We have very few people working for Ireland internationally.  Our entire diplomatic service is smaller than the British Embassy in Washington in terms of its budget. We get great value from that service and the issue is to focus it in a way that will deliver the best possible result and give the best value for the tax-payer's money.</P>
    <P>I look forward to returning to the House very soon with more legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe it would be useful, for the information of the House, if I gave some background at this time concerning the need for the Bill, and the reasons urgent, but temporary, measures are necessary to respond to a critical situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The High Court found on 12 June this year that the procedures adopted to enable the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to discharge adequately the obligations imposed by the Firearms Act, 1925, in granting firearm certificates to non-resident hunters are ineffective and insufficient. The judgment followed a judicial review sought in March 1996 by the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  The High Court found also that the procedures followed by the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands in granting hunting licences to non-residents &mdash; which they must first obtain in order to be granted firearm certificates &mdash; are also ineffective and insufficient.  The effect of the <Col N="784" /> judgment is that both Ministers are precluded from issuing hunting licences, and the consequential firearm certificates to non-residents, and the granting of licences and firearm certificates ceased with effect from the date of the judgment.</P>
    <P>In arriving at his judgment, the learned judge made a number of important points which I believe are worth repeating here.  The statutory obligations in the Firearms Act, 1925, relevant to the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, impose certain requirements on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Firearms Act, 1925, requires that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform be satisfied that a non-resident seeking a firearm certificate is not a danger to the public safety or to the peace, and is not a person declared to be disentitled.  The following are declared to be disentitled: a person under the age of 16; a person of intemperate habits; a person of unsound mind; a person sentenced by the Irish courts in certain circumstances and a person subject to the supervision of the police or bound to the peace in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>While the court found that the obligations could be described as onerous and, in certain instances, difficult to comply with, if not impossible, the fact is that they are statutory, couched in unambiguous terms and, accordingly, there is a legal requirement to comply with them.  While evidence was offered of the existing procedures followed to comply with these onerous and rigid obligations, the court found that, having regard to the rigid but unambiguous nature of the statutory obligations, the procedures did not so comply.  I should add that the procedures referred in evidence to the High Court included requiring confirmation from an applicant of a European firearms pass, for example, or of a firearm certificate or permit issued in an applicant's country of residence. They also included checks with the Garda authorities in relation to non-residents convicted of crimes and, in addition, evidence of permission to shoot on land within the State.</P>
    <P>There are broad and significant implications arising from the judgment, not only for overseas shooting visitors but also for the issue of firearm certificates generally.  The advice available to me is that the case for new legislation in this area is compelling.  Ideally, any new legislation would address the broad implications of the judgment and effect significant amendments to the Firearms Act, 1925, and to the relevant provisions of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  There are also, of course, key public policy considerations to be addressed in any proposals for change to ensure that firearms, and their use, remain under strict control.</P>
    <P>I propose to establish immediately a review group comprising representatives of the key agencies in this area with a view to a comprehensive analysis of what is required.  The group is to be tasked, as a matter of urgency, with bringing forward proposals in this sensitive but complicated area following a full review, having taken account of the views of the major sectional interests including, I would emphasise, those of <Col N="785" /> the National Association of Regional Game Councils.</P>
    <P>In responding to the difficulties which have arisen since the High Court judgment was delivered, I have met representatives of various groups affected, or concerned, by the judgment including representatives of the National Association of Regional Game Councils.  There is an appreciation on both sides of the difficulties which each of us face and an acceptance that what is required is a fair and balanced approach which achieves a solution which recognises the interests of all.</P>
    <P>However, any detailed consideration of an area as complex and as sensitive as that of firearms controls will obviously require some time before that consideration bears fruit.  In the meantime, the Government is acutely aware that an administrative paralysis during which hunting licences and firearm certificates are not issued to non-residents has profound implications for the overseas shooting tourism business.</P>
    <P>Overseas shooting visitors are significant contributors to the tourist sector.  The sector, I am informed, is exceptionally high yield, attracting visitors in the off-season.  A number of prestigious tourism establishments have made substantial investments in building up their businesses, spending money on such matters as game farming and up-grading.  While it is difficult to put an exact figure on the numbers employed directly, there is no doubt but that employees in the hotels and shooting estates, as well as &ldquo;beaters&rdquo;, farmers and animal feed manufacturers, for example, would be affected by any serious downturn in business.  Allied to that is the fact that this potential growth area is competing with other countries for this developing business and I am aware that, if the business were to be lost for this year in the months ahead, it is almost certainly lost for years to come, if not forever.</P>
    <P>In the light of those important considerations, it was decided that a two stage response is essential to deal with the matters raised by the High Court judgment.  First, the establishment of a review group as I have just outlined and, second, the introduction of temporary legislative measures to deal, in the short term, with the urgent and critical issues which arise not only for the tourism sector but also for the whole economy. The non-issue of hunting licences and accompanying firearm certificates is having an immediate effect on the tourist shooting industry, and on persons who make their livelihoods in that area of the economy and, because of that, the Government agreed that urgent temporary measures were necessary.</P>
    <P>Turning to the Bill itself, there are some points I wish to emphasise.  First, as I have indicated, this is an interim measure to allow hunting licences and firearm certificates to issue to non-residents pending the consideration of more comprehensive proposals from the review group mentioned earlier.  The Bill specifically provides that the Act shall expire 12 months after the date of its passing, subject to the possibility of one, and one only, <Col N="786" /> further extension if considered absolutely necessary.</P>
    <P>In addition, it should be noted that, in practical terms, the provisions of the Bill do not change the procedures which have been followed for some years, under different Governments, in issuing firearm certificates to non-residents.  While the Bill proposes to amend, on an interim basis, the statutory provisions governing the limitations and restrictions for the granting of firearm certificates, in real terms it gives effect to the existing procedures in recognition of the fact that the statutory obligations are, effectively, difficult to meet and, in some instances, impossible.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that the Bill will effectively mean that non-residents will be able to bring firearms into this country with virtually no checks being made.  I want to refute that suggestion.  The provisions of this Bill do not in any way dilute the existing procedures.  In the granting of firearm certificates to non-residents, regard has always been had to the preservation of the public safety and the peace.</P>
    <P>It has been said the Bill will effectively mean that non-residents will be able to bring firearms into this country with virtually no checks being made.  I refute that suggestion.  Its provisions do not dilute the existing procedures.  In granting firearm certificates to non-residents, regard has always been had to the preservation of public safety.  This was always the overriding consideration. The measures proposed will not change this.  In fact, two additional restrictive measures are introduced.  These are in section 1(5) which allows the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to attach conditions to a firearm certificate, and in subsection 6 where provision is made to allow the Minister to revoke a firearm certificate where he is of the opinion that the holder of the certificate cannot, without danger to the public safety or to the peace, be permitted to have a firearm in his or her possession.</P>
    <P>I also emphasise that the policy, which in the main has been in existence since 1972, of restricting the issuing of firearm certificates to certain categories of firearms is not changed by the Bill.  The policy, which is among the most restrictive in Europe, will continue as before and provides that firearm certificates will only be granted for shotguns and rifles in certain limited categories.</P>
    <P>Apart from what might be described as new restrictions, the Bill provides in section 1 that, before granting a firearm certificate, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall be of the opinion that the application is bona fide and that there is no good reason to refuse to grant the certificate.  For the purpose of establishing that there is no good reason for refusing a firearm certificate, the Minister may seek evidence of a European Firearms Pass where the applicant is resident in an EU member state, or any other documents relevant to firearms issued by an appropriate body outside the State.  The Minister may make such inquiries as he considers appropriate, <Col N="787" /> such as inquiries from the Garda Síochána or other police services, if it is considered necessary and possible to do so, to determine suitability in any particular case.  I emphasise these aspects of the Bill to illustrate that there is no question of non-residents being allowed to bring firearms into this country without proper checks being made on their suitability.</P>
    <P>In the wildlife context, the provisions of the Bill which relate to the issue of hunting licences to hunters from outside the State will be reassessed in the light of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, which is due to be published in the autumn.  That draft Bill already contains proposed amendments to the regime which has been operating in the area of hunting licences and I understand the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will carry out a further review of the area in light of the High Court judgment and of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill maintains our control over the use and possession of firearms by non-residents, while safeguarding the jobs and incomes of those engaged in our tourism industry and rural economy generally.  The Bill does not lessen the measures taken to safeguard the public safety and the peace.  All checks previously undertaken will continue in force.  In addition, two additional safeguards have been introduced &mdash; the power to add conditions to certificates and the power to revoke them.</P>
    <P>I emphasis again the temporary nature of the Bill, which will expire 12 months after its passing, and that the broad implications which arise for granting firearm certificates generally from the recent High Court judgment will be addressed as a matter of urgency by an expert review group. This group will consult widely and seek submissions on what needs to be done.  There is a technical provision which allows the Government to extend the Bill for a further period not exceeding 12 months which, in light of the implementation of the conclusions and recommendations of the review group, I am optimistic it will not be necessary to invoke.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a rushed and botched attempt by the Minister to get even with the National Association of Regional Game Councils which, as he views it, had the temerity to take a case in the High Court and win it.  The effect of that was to severely rebuke the Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for the way they have maladministered the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is arrant nonsense for the Minister to state this so-called emergency measure is necessary to protect what is termed a significant section of the tourism industry.  I support anything which promotes tourism, such as this sector which brings in visitors from abroad on shooting holidays, as long as it is done within the law and there is proper <Col N="788" /> protection for wildlife.  Visitors should only be able to bring in certain types of weapons and there should be a restriction on the amount of ammunition they are allowed to carry on expeditions.  They should abide by all the laws in this area, such as the distance from the creature being shot at whether it is flying or walking.</P>
    <P>However, there is plenty of evidence of widespread abuse and gross breaches of the wildlife protection legislation.  This is often done by native sports people, but more often by so-called visitors. They shoot indiscriminately at game in season but also at all types of game for the sheer pleasure of shooting.  This includes game that is protected or threatened with extinction.  They draw no distinction between flying birds and land bound animals.</P>
    <P>The wanton slaughter of creatures which have no game value, such as song birds and other small animals, is particularly objectionable and horrible. These species have a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance.  There is no accounting for the damage to the balance of nature which some of these people have inflicted for wanton reasons and often in ignorance.  They are often doing what they wish they could do in their own countries.  However, they know they would end up in jail if they tried it at home.  Due to the laxity of our laws and their poor and often non-existent enforcement, anything is fair game for many people on shooting expeditions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has the impossible job of trying to police infringements of the wildlife and firearms legislation as it applies to visitors.  Gardaí feel they are wasting their time because the law is weak and easily circumvented by foreigners. Wildlife rangers attached to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands say that their task in dealing with foreign and native miscreants is impossible because they are so thin on the ground.  There is only a few dozen of them to cover the entire country.  This makes their position in terms of policing and observing impossible.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to get convictions against overseas visitors regardless of how horrendous are the breaches of the existing law.  Against this background, the Bill will make it easier for people to break the law.  They cannot be convicted under the current law and this measure will make it easier for them.  It is incomprehensible that the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, are supporting this imbecile Bill which will confer on visitors from abroad special privileges that we would not contemplate giving our citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill should comprehensively update the Firearms Act, 1925, and strengthen the law on holding and using sporting guns and other weapons. The law should be uniform for Irish nationals and foreign visitors.  This is the minimum this and the other House should request. The long promised new Wildlife Bill should be before the House.  When I was a Member of the <Col N="789" /> other House in 1993, I asked the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, on the Order of Business when the promised Wildlife Bill would be introduced.  He replied that it would be introduced in a few months, during the next session. Yet, five years later, there is still no sign of that Bill.  I do not believe the Minister's promise that a new Wildlife Bill will be introduced in the next session.  It has been gestating in various Departments and in the Office of Public Works since 1990.  Other parties have been in Government since then but the Minister's party has been in Government for most of that period.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, without a new wildlife protection Bill, untold damage has been done to our wildlife stocks over the past decade.  An increasing number of native species have become rare, threatened or extinct.  Much of this is due to the excessive and indiscriminate killing of wildlife and the destruction of wildlife habitats.  That indiscriminate killing was licensed under our laws.  The agents of the Government had to turn a blind eye to the appalling wanton destruction of wildlife stock which was taking place.  We need a better Wildlife Act to combat that.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands engaged this year in a totally unnecessary war with the few hundred people who cut turf for domestic fuel and who want to maintain this timeless and generally environmentally friendly practice, yet we have not seen the much needed Wildlife Bill.</P>
      <P>Speculators are allowed buy great tracts of sensitive landscapes all around the country, which are usually crucial wildlife habitats.  There is nothing in the law to stop them ploughing these areas and planting them with inappropriate tree species.  If the Minister were here she would respond by saying we no longer pay grants for such practices.  However, that is not the answer because financial institutions, such as insurance companies, who engage in this practice do not want State grants.  It is very profitable for them to buy vast tracts of mountainside, raised bogs, blanket bogs and so on and plant them as a forward investment.  That must not necessarily be stopped in every case but it must be controlled because it is doing a great deal of damage to landscapes and is contributing to endangering and making extinct many wildlife species.</P>
      <P>This Bill is before us because the Minister was panicked into it by a small pressure group which gave him totally inaccurate figures about the value of this shoulder tourism.  It is nonsense to say it is worth £21 million in tourism revenue &mdash; it is hardly worth £2 million.  It is unforgivable for the Minister to come to this House, and for his colleague to go into the other House, and mouth the figures given to him by the special interests promoting this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is a pathetic response to the problem being created by the action, which I applaud, of the National Association of Regional Game Councils and the decision of Mr. Justice Quirke.  I compliment the councils and Mr. Justice Quirke on handing down that decision.  The Minister failed utterly to enforce the existing law and he decided to ignore the need to update the law.</P>
      <P>The new comprehensive Wildlife Bill was first proposed as long ago as 1990.  The Government has done nothing to progress it, despite the ever increasing reasons for having it on the Statute Book, such as the disappearance of many species of wildlife, the mass destruction of habitats, EU pressures in regard to the habitats directive and the need to define and protect our laws on special areas of conservation and national heritage areas. These matters are all to be addressed in a Wildlife Bill, which is what we should have in front of us today instead of these&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is necessary due to the recent High Court decision.  I read the report of the debate in the other House, where there was a great deal of criticism by the Opposition of shooting tourism and the revenue accruing from it.  However, they gave only one narrow point of view.  Several Deputies told the story of the tourist who, when asked why he did not shoot a pheasant running across the road, said he was waiting for it to stand still.  However, that story is as old as Methuselah and it was not said by a foreign tourist but by a native.</P>
      <P>Neither this or the other House mentioned the amount of money put into the industry by private individuals who run shooting estates.  These estates are very successful and bring people from all over the world to Ireland.  Listening to some contributions, one would think such people go out shooting morning, noon and night.  However, they shoot for one day, play golf for a couple of days, fish for one day and then do some sightseeing. They definitely spend money here.  Tourists come here annually for that sport.</P>
      <P>I admit some damage was done to certain wildlife species a few years ago but that no longer happens.  Gun clubs and ghillies are concerned about preventing this and there are many new restrictions, which is right.</P>
      <P>We are very fortunate that the woodcock and snipe come to Ireland annually.  Europeans come here to shoot those birds.  If they shoot one or two birds their day is made.  Some form of bag restriction should be introduced for tourists on the shooting of snipe and woodcock.  I am a member of several gun clubs in Kerry and have been responsible for setting up numerous gun clubs. Those were not founded with the intention of taking wildlife, but for the introduction of clay pigeon shooting and to teach young people how to use firearms.  I am proud that Kerry has some of the best shooting grounds in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clay pigeon shooters have not been mentioned, and they are included in the High Court judgment.  Clay pigeon shooting teams have been prevented from competing in Ireland.  This year there is an international clay pigeon shooting contest in Castleisland, County Kerry, of which I am very proud, but nobody has mentioned that.  Our clay pigeon shooting teams have competed all over the world, and I promoted one team which competed in a world competition in Australia: our senior team came second, our ladies' team came third and our juniors came fourth.  There will be 400 shooters in Castleisland next month for the international competition; they will spend a week there, which will benefit the area's tourist industry, and then they will travel around the rest <Col N="792" /> of Kerry.  This has not been mentioned: speakers seem to be concentrating on someone coming in with a machine gun and mowing down everything in front of him.</P>
    <P>The only weapon people can use is the shotgun, and even use of the shotgun is restricted.  I remember when a shotgun could contain five shots, but that has been lowered to three shots and one can have only 500 rounds of ammunition. Someone who shoots gets used to a certain type of cartridge, but that cartridge may not be available in the country one is going to and 500 rounds is therefore not a large amount.  Anyone who says it is is talking rubbish.</P>
    <P>The most responsible people in this sector are those in the gun clubs.  Those clubs are to be commended for making their own laws.  Legally they are entitled to shoot pheasant, duck, woodcock and snipe from 1 November to 31 January, but most gun clubs organise shooting restrictions among themselves, agreeing to shoot perhaps two days a week.  In that way the bag can be restricted to, perhaps, two birds.  That is how the gun clubs practice conservation.  Talk of indiscriminate shooting is rubbish.  There was a famous story of a traveller being caught at an airport with a swan, but that was a long time ago.  That was wrong, but I do not blame that person; I blame the ghillie or whoever brought him to Ireland.  More emphasis should be put on the responsibilities of ghillies and others who bring in these groups.  They should be licensed, and if rules are broken then those licenses could be revoked and they would not be able to bring shooters to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the Dáil debate on this Bill the age restriction on shooting was criticised.  The last international shoot in Ireland was held in Ashbourne, County Meath, and drew worldwide publicity. Two of the English shooters were 15 years old and could not compete in the junior competitions. In the United Kingdom one can hold a firearms licence at the age of 14.  If one is under proper supervision I see nothing wrong with that.  Those two English shooters could not compete although they were international shooters: that was regrettable.</P>
    <P>The National Regional Games Council has done much for shooters in Ireland, particularly when legislation was introduced to stop people trespassing on farmers' lands on insurance grounds.  The council then put up an insurance policy for their shooters; for this it is to be complimented. I would like the National Regional Games Council to put its resources into the restocking of birds such as grouse.  Bogs have been burnt off, and there should be organised breeding facilities for grouse, a famous bird. Many people, myself included, have gone to Scotland to shoot grouse, and I have also been on shooting expeditions in England.  Much could be done to bring the grouse back to our moors, and I call on the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make funds available to the National Regional Games Council to reintroduce grouse rearing to Ireland.</P>

      <Col N="793" /> The tourists I meet do not come for grouse; they come for woodcock and snipe, and sometimes duck.  Those who come to shoot pheasant are brought to estates where pheasant are reared: I have been on some of those shoots.  Participants pay up to £10,000 per shoot, and I know of estates that rear up to 15,000 to 20,000 pheasants annually. Such shoots are of immense benefit to tourism in those areas.</P>
    <P>We must bring back our native birds.  There is massive potential in the boglands where the grouse could be reintroduced.  Birds are not becoming extinct because tourists are shooting them; they are becoming extinct due to lack of management and to the burning of moors.  Something will also have to be done about the partridge, which is almost extinct in Ireland due to the introduction of silage.  There is enormous tourism potential in shooting; we are very fortunate that one of the best birds &mdash; the woodcock &mdash; comes to Ireland annually.  We should be proud of that.</P>

      <P>I am pleased that the High Court judgment has allowed us to debate this issue.  If Mr. Justice Quirke had not made his judgment and if the National Association of Regional Game Councils had not been involved, we would not have had this debate, which is the first in many years to deal with firearms certificates, hunting licences for non residents and the game industry.</P>
      <P>Senator Kiely raised the issues of breeding, management and properly developing the industry if we are to go down that road.  This debate is welcome and has been facilitated by the decision of the High Court judge.  Otherwise the issue of certificates and licences would have developed as in previous years with no attention being paid to what is happening in this area.</P>
      <P>The legislation will enable the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to grant hunting licences and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to grant firearm certificates. It will stand for a period of 12 months with a maximum addition of a further 12 months before expiring, although I am not sure whether this is clear in the provisions of the Bill.  I support Senator Connor's amendment providing for an expiry of the provisions after six months.  The hunting season will be over in six months and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has promised to bring legislation before the House in the autumn concerning the granting of hunting licences for subsequent seasons.  We should accept the Minister's good intentions in this regard and take on board Senator Connor's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information being presented to us is contradictory. The Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, said 3,000 persons, normally resident outside the State, are expected to apply for hunting licences while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="794" /> Reform spoke of 4,000 overseas firearm certificates being issued annually.  I do not know if both Ministers have failed to get their act together or if there is a simple statistical inaccuracy.  However, there is a 25 per cent variation in the figures and I would like to know why this is so.  It seems to suggest that accurate information is not being compiled in relation to the number of licences and firearm certificates granted.</P>
    <P>A similar issue arises in relation to the value of the industry.  The figure given is £21 million; I would like to know how this was compiled.  Is it an estimate of possible downstream spending by tourists or does it relate to the cost of holidays? If the figure relates to the latter &mdash; I am not sure it does &mdash; an accurate computation can be made.  I would like the Minister to state the actual figures.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the serious implications for 25 Irish based businesses involved in the provision of hunting holidays.  What type of businesses is being referred to?  Are they similar to those described by Senator Kiely, namely, hunting estates with breeding control management and supervision of the bag taken on any day? Alternatively, does it refer to ordinary, provisional, <i>ad hoc</i> operators with no standards or particular criteria?  I suspect it is the latter.  While reference is made to a niche market in the shoulder of the season, it seems a very disorganised business which lacks standards of operation.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that pests are being controlled by non-residents who hunt here stretches the imagination.  Approximately 250,000 firearm certificates are issued to our farmers and landowners who know how to control pests.  By and large those who hold firearm licences are responsible and use their firearms for the control of pests and not to hunt song birds or rare birds to any great extent.  There are many rare birds in Ireland, including partridge, grouse and snipe.  A few decades ago these birds were widespread in uplands and boglands, but they have become rare, although not as rare as the corncrake and the cuckoo.  It is important that we take cognisance of the fact that such birds are rare.</P>
    <P>There are allegations that non-resident hunters are involved in indiscriminate slaughter, that they have no consideration or sensitivity towards wildlife and that the source of their pleasure is shooting at anything on sight.  I do not know how widespread this practice is, but there seems to be no system of monitoring and patrolling hunters who visit Ireland.  Has a survey been conducted of the specific birds they shoot?  It has been widely stated that they are particularly partial to song birds, something not current among Irish holders of certificates.  We should examine the lack of information regarding the type of regulations in place, the adequacy of patrolling or ranger services and the types of birds being hunted.</P>
    <P>I was particularly taken by Senator Kiely's suggestion that we examine the Scottish approach of managed estates and a proper professional structure for the industry.  If the industry is to be <Col N="795" /> developed here &mdash; I am sure there are many who would have reservations about an industry which involves shooting game &mdash; a structure must be developed.  I hope the Minister's wildlife protection Bill, which she promised to introduce in the autumn, will seriously examine the issue of habitats, including gorse, bog and heather, and that the industry will be included in submissions made regarding the manner in which it operates.  This will ensure we know exactly what is being discussed and the ramifications of the Bill.  Similarly, I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will do his homework in reviewing the issuing of firearms certificates so that we have available to us factual information.</P>
    <P>I understand the Bill is being introduced as commitments have been made and people have made financial outlays for holidays in Ireland.  However, I am anxious not to have any slide in relation to this matter and that the legislation is purely of a temporary nature.  I will support Senator Connor's amendment to limit the legislation to a maximum six month period.  We expect both Ministers to do their homework and return to the House with amending legislation.</P>

      <P>In his contribution in the Dáil yesterday, Deputy Stagg said the second fiction is that foreign shooters are essential to control pigeons which attack crops and that he knew of no crops attacked during the hunting season because crops are not grown at that time of the year. Amazingly, a spokesman for the IFA gave credence to this nonsense.  I believe I am correct in stating that at one point in his career Deputy Stagg was his party's spokesperson on agriculture. If he was the spokesperson on agriculture, it surprises me that he would state that he knows of no crops attacked during the hunting season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> As someone who has grown oilseed rape on my farm for several years, I would have had serious difficulty growing the crop in question but for the fact there were hunting tourists in the area.  I tried to control pigeons over the winter period as did the Gun Club and an Olympic shot, but we failed. Somebody somewhere derived revenue from the tourists who shot the pigeons.  I did not get a reward other than the protection of the crop but somebody in the economy benefited.</P>
    <P>Let us get rid of some of this nonsense.  Are we suggesting people who spend several thousand pounds to shoot at Ashford Castle or who come to shoot woodcock in Kerry over the winter months when hotels are closed and would not otherwise have tourists should be excluded?  It is absolute nonsense to suggest that should be the case because it is anti-tourism.</P>
    <P>The value of this activity to the economy is subject to debate and is based on the number of people who get licences.  Let us assume 4,000 people get licences, spend £1,500 each and bring another family member with them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In all the debates on tourism we have argued about the benefits of attracting big spenders to this country rather than the high volume low spenders who have polluted some continental countries.  These are the people about whom we are talking.  We are continuing a practice which has been in place and has not caused much controversy until this legislation came before the Houses.</P>
      <P>On the question of habitat, there has been a far greater effect on habitat and wildlife arising from the agricultural practices adopted by successive generations of Irish farmers in terms of pesticides and the way silage-making is done.  That is what has affected the habitat and not the burning of a grouse moor.  It is good management to burn a grouse moor provided it is done at the right time of the year.  It also good management from an environmental point of view to burn hillsides.  Let us get rid of some of these canards which have been promoted.</P>
      <P>Visiting anglers leaving nylon line on lakeshores are probably doing more damage to habitat than those shooting in a controlled way.  I do not defend those who come here, act illegally and who shoot at everything.  They should be dealt with and there should be penalties under the law. There are provisions in this legislation under which the Minister can refuse to grant firearm licences and can withdraw them.  I would go further by saying there should be penalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> We have high quality pheasant and woodcock shoots.  There are farmers here and on the neighbouring island who would not be able to survive but for the fact they have commercial shoots on large properties which bring in substantial amounts of money into this economy.  That must be recognised.</P>
    <P>I grew corn crops on land I rented on a large estate in County Westmeath which was surrounded by woodland.  Pigeons were a serious pest coming up to harvest time.  Italian people came under controlled circumstances with a guide, stayed in guest houses in the area and shot over the crops.  They did me a service which I am happy to acknowledge.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely made a point on the age limit.  I started shooting when I was 11 or 12 years of age.  I agree with him that the 16 year age limit is too high and could be lowered, particularly in the context of people coming into international shooting which is another aspect of the tourism industry.  Clay pigeon shooting is well organised. Like Members on both sides of each House, I fully acknowledge the contribution the gun clubs have made.  They are conservationist and have ensured the survival of many species.  I do not see an inconsistency between their activity and allowing visitors who are regulated and controlled to shoot over land.</P>
    <P>On the Wildlife Bill, I recall when the National Heritage Council Bill and another Bill was passing through the House when Deputy Michael D. Higgins was Minister.  I asked him when would the third plank of that raft of legislation, the Wildlife Bill, be introduced.  I was told it would be introduced at an early stage.  It is not only this Government but a succession of Governments which have not brought forward that legislation. In any event, I question the relevance of the Wildlife Bill to the legal control of the use of firearms for sporting purposes.  The two issues are not necessarily related.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>Deputy Stagg referred to that in his contribution in the Dáil and I am glad Senator Connor asked me about it because I had almost forgotten about it.  Deputy Stagg said game birds are shot at even when out of range.  That strikes me as being the ultimate in conservation.  We need more tourists like that.  Let us have many tourists who come and shoot at game birds which are out of range because that would make an excellent contribution to the maintenance of the stock of rare and wild birds.</P>

      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman for his protection.  Senator Connor is shooting across the House and I may be out of range like the wildlife in question.</P>
      <P>I have experienced the benefits of people who come to shoot over my property as it helps to protect crops and I welcome their arrival.  During the more detailed consideration of the Bill we might return to the question of the working group which has been set up.  As with salmon licences, we might consider a 21 day licence or a short term licence for a specified period in a specified district, if necessary.  I know that applies differently in the case of angling where there are different regional boards.  That issue and the age limit should be looked at.</P>
      <P>Given the single market, the freedom to travel and the free movement of capital, goods and services, it is reasonable for somebody in another EU country to want to visit Ireland to shoot and they should be able to do so.  The Minister referred to section 1(3), which entitles the holding of a European firearms pass to be used as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I agree with that.  It is reasonable in the EU context.  The legislation is reasonable. It is the result of a court case and continues an existing practice.  It should be adopted without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his efficiency in introducing this legislation following the High Court case last month.  The granting of <Col N="799" /> licences and firearms certificates ceased with effect from the date of the court judgment.  In making his judgment the High Court judge made a number of important points, especially his finding that the statutory obligation under the Firearms Act, 1925, relevant to the granting of a firearms certificate to non-residents, imposed certain requirements on the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Firearms Act, 1925, requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be satisfied that non-residents seeking firearms certificates do not constitute a danger to public safety or the peace and that such persons are not persons to be declared disentitled.  Those capable of being disentitled include people under the age of 16 years, a person of intemperate habits, a person of unsound mind, a person sentenced by the Irish courts in certain circumstances and a person subject to the supervision of the police or bound to the peace in certain circumstances.  The court found that these obligations could be described as onerous and, in certain instances, difficult if not impossible to comply with.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Garda authorities undertake checks of non-residents convicted of crimes.  It also provides that evidence of permission to shoot on land within the State be produced. Broad and significant implications arise from the judgment, not only for overseas visitors but also with regard to the issue of firearms certificates generally.</P>
      <P>Key policy considerations need to be addressed in any proposal for change to ensure that firearms and their use remain under strict control.  Given this, the Minister proposes the immediate establishment of a review group comprising representatives of key agencies in this area with a view to a comprehensive analysis of what is required and how it is to be achieved.  The group is to be asked, as a matter of urgency, to produce proposals having taken account of the sectoral interests involved.  The Minister is correct to allow for the inclusions of all such interests.  As a member of the National Association of Regional Game Councils, I believe it is very important that it be part of the review.  Detailed consideration of an area as complex and sensitive as firearms control will take much time before it bears fruit.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the tourism business.  If this aspect of it were lost to the country in the immediate future, which would happen if the Minister had not moved so swiftly, it would be lost for a long time.  Given that we have spent so long trying to get tourists to visit the country, every effort must be made to facilitate those who booked shooting holidays.  Not all of them shoot wild birds.  Senator Dan Kiely mentioned the significant numbers who travel here for clay pigeon shooting.  The money they bring in must be recognised. They constitute a very important part of the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted the comments made by Deputies in the other House.  It is clear they do not live in areas <Col N="800" /> that need tourists who shoot.  By contrast, my area suffers greatly from flooding by the River Shannon.  There are significant numbers of game birds in the winter and the farmers and clubs welcome those tourists who shoot the game and wild birds.  It is a very important activity for areas such as mine which may be described as disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this is an interim measure to allow hunting licences and firearm certificates to be issued to non-residents pending the consideration of a more comprehensive proposal from the review group.  The Bill provides that the legislation shall expire after 12 months, although it could be reviewed again.  However, it is important that an expiry date is provided because, even if it is extended, it will concentrate minds on the development of more comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the legislation will effectively allow non-residents to bring firearms into the country with virtually no checks.  That is not the case because check and balances are in place to prevent it.  However, we may have to ensure that those who bring people on shoots have a training in wildlife, including a knowledge of the different species.  For example, it could be provided that they must be approved locally or vetted by the local gardaí.  It is important to ensure that those accompanying shooters are trained, are aware of the legislation and of the areas in which shooting can take place.  I welcome the fact that this legislation will only last for 12 months.  I hope every effort will be made to ensure the new legislation will be in place by then.</P>
    <P>The views of the National Regional Game Council must be taken into consideration here.  It is does excellent work.  When I started shooting in the 1960s there was a grant for the releasing of pheasant polls, partridge and grouse.  We should make funding available to gun clubs to ensure they can increase the numbers of pheasant, partridge and mallard.</P>
    <P>I thoroughly disagree with the statement that there are people who wait for birds to stand or alight before they shoot them.  I have shot all my life and I have never seen anyone fire at a bird when it pitched on the water.  Some people will come with two or three guns &mdash; that is the difference. Much has been made of the Minister saying that he granted firearms licences and another Minister granted hunting licences.  I can see the discrepancy when some people bring more than one gun when coming on a clay pigeon shoot.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  If we can work together and get funding for gun clubs we can increase the number of tourists going to areas where their money is needed.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that this is a temporary measure in response to a critical situation in a growing area <Col N="801" /> of our economy.  Hunting licences and firearms certificates have not been issued to out of date shooters since 12 June 1997.  If that situation was to continue indefinitely, pending consideration of the comprehensive measures needed, companies and individuals who have invested heavily in this area would suffer to an extent that their livelihood and those of their employees would be under threat.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this business more important than in the west and I am astounded that Deputies and one Senator from the west should object to this legislation being passed.  It is an extraordinary state of affairs and it shows that some people are out of touch with how their constituents make their livelihood.</P>

      <P>Allied to this measure which I have brought forward, I have made it clear that I will be establishing a review group to begin work immediately to examine the broad implications of the High Court judgment for the granting of firearms certificates.  The review group will consult widely.  My intention is to ensure that a balanced approach is developed with regard to what needs to be done in the area of firearms and to take account of all interests, including domestic shooters, tourists and sporting concerns.</P>
      <P>In the wildlife context, the provisions of this Bill which relate to the issuing of hunting licences from outside the State will be reassessed in the light of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which is due to be published in the autumn. That draft Bill already contains amendments to the regime which has been operating in the area of hunting licences.</P>
      <P>I have made it clear that the temporary provisions contained in this important legislation can in no way be construed as liberalising our controls on firearms.  To say otherwise is to scaremonger for purposes of political opportunism.  Procedures followed under different Governments will continue to operate.  This is important because there has been a suggestion that the law in this area is being changed.  The reality is that the law had to be changed following the High Court judgment. The procedures which operated under the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, are the same procedures which are in place now with the exception that there are two additional restrictions.  One empowers the Minister to revoke licences and the other empowers the Minister to impose conditions.  How can it be said that the law is being liberalised when precisely the same procedures will be used with additional restriction?  That baffles me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable play has been made of the fact that the High Court held that the statutory obligations contained in the Firearms Act, 1925, and the Wildlife Act, 1976, were not being adhered to by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="802" /> Reform and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The High Court held that in respect of successive Ministers.  It is instructive to note that the High Court proceedings were initiated on 3 March 1996 when the same people who are critical of this legislation were in office.  It was possible at that time for the previous Government to amend the legislation in question but it never bothered.  It is extraordinary to hear members of that Government criticising the situation as it now obtains when they had the opportunity to amend the legislation when it was brought to their notice.  One would have thought that, if they were that concerned, they would have taken action once the High Court proceedings were initiated but they did not.  It is difficult to say that their protests today are genuine.  They smack of crocodile tears and have no basis in reality.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity to impose additional restrictions in this legislation and there is no question but that the same procedures will be operated now.  The temporary provisions in this legislation will maintain our controls over the use and possession of firearms while protecting jobs.  This Bill does not reduce the existing measures in any way and will expire when more comprehensive measures are introduced following the report of the expert review group.</P>
    <P>Many Senators concentrated on the wildlife and conservation aspects of the legislation.  In this context the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is introducing a wildlife Bill in the autumn.  This legislation is a temporary measure designed to meet a given situation.  It is necessitated by urgent demands and I have taken a second major step by announcing the immediate establishment of a second review group to look at this matter.  All interested parties will be carefully listened to, including the National Association of Regional Game Councils.</P>
    <P>Following the High Court judgment it is of considerable importance that there be a comprehensive review of the law governing firearms certificates and hunting licences.  The judgment has implications for all aspects of the granting of firearm certificates.</P>

I have also indicated proposals to introduce the most comprehensive legislation to address the entire firearm certificates and hunting licences issue.  It is difficult to understand the criticism when one considers these facts.</P>
      <P>It is also unrealistic for Senators or Deputies to say that comprehensive legislation should have been prepared and brought before the Houses since the judgment on 12 June.  Such complex and comprehensive legislation requires consultation and a considerable amount of deliberation before being brought before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello referred to 25 shoot operators; these are involved full-time in bringing tourists to Ireland.  Overall, licences are issued to about 70 operators each year, some of whom are part-time operators.  The licensing of tour shoot operators is under consideration in the context of the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill which will be introduced in the autumn.</P>

      <P>Some Senators commented on the number of licences issued and the perceived difference between my figures and those of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera.  Approximately 3,200 hunting licences were issued in the 1997-8 season.  The number of firearms certificates issued is normally greater than the number of hunting licences.  Senator Moylan correctly pointed out that each gun requires a firearms certificate and this is the reason for the discrepancy.  It is extraordinary that spokespersons on this important and sensitive subject would not know such basic information.  This says much for the premise on <Col N="804" /> which they are basing their criticisms of the legislation. The forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill will include consideration of the powers of search, forfeiture and seizure and offences and penalties.  These matters will also come before this House for consideration.</P>
      <P>There have been many allegations concerning tourist shooters and the alleged indiscriminate killing of protected species.  If there is evidence of such behaviour, it should be brought to the attention of the authorities who will respond swiftly.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Non-game birds are protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976.  This Bill does not affect that position. It has nothing to say about delisting protected species as it only concerns the consequences of the High Court judgment.  If people feel that tourists are shooting protected species, the National Parks and Wildlife Service would be more than interested to hear of it.</P>

      <P>I would have thought that this illustrates the Government's commitment to the enhancement of wildlife and underlines the futility of Opposition attempts to carp and criticise legislation which is necessary to assist the economy.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor mentioned the delay in introducing the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  I am reliably informed that the Bill is very close to its final draft; it is with the parliamentary draftsman as I speak.  In its legislative programme the Government is committed to the publication of the Bill in the autumn.  Senator Connor will be aware from recent reports regarding the Government's performance in its first year that all the objectives it set itself will be achieved.</P>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely requested assistance for the development of native species of grouse and partridge. The Senator knows precisely what he is talking about, not just because he is a Kerryman &mdash; though it helps &mdash; but because he is involved in the sport and understands precisely what is the position.  I wish many of the commentators on this legislation were as informed.  I will bring the Senator's views to the attention of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Culture, Gaeltacht and the Islands to see if she can assist in this regard.  I have no doubt whatsoever that if she can, she will do so.  She has shown tremendous commitment to her portfolio and will be glad to assist in every way.</P>
      <P>Regarding the regulation of tourist shoot promoters and gillies, this issue has been under consideration in the context of the forthcoming Wildlife (Amendment) Bill and is likely to be included in the Bill when published.  This is part of the Government's commitment to wildlife.  The vetting of gillies will be considered in the context of the possible licensing of tourist shoot operators and the forthcoming wildlife Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello referred to the question of checking what tourists shoot.  Many contributors to the debate in this House, and people elsewhere, tried to convey the impression that there are no checks and that it was a free for all. Nothing could be further from the truth.  A notice is sent to hunters informing them that they must co-operate with bag checks and make bag returns. In this respect, spot-checks are made by rangers and this is as it should be.  Bag returns are made to the Wildlife Service by the tourist shoot operators. In addition, a detailed form must be completed by those applying for certificates and the Department will not grant a certificate unless the individual has been granted a hunting licence.  In addition, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been known to refuse firearm <Col N="806" /> certificates and to regulate this matter in so far as it can.</P>
    <P>On the question of visitors holding 500 rounds of ammunition while residents are confined to 100 rounds, it is a long standing practice to allow visitors to have 500 rounds in their possession at any given time.  They would need 500 rounds if they were shooting at game which was out of range all the time, as Deputy Stagg outlined to the Dáil yesterday evening.  Another reason visitors are allowed 500 rounds of ammunition in their possession is that they may not be known to firearms dealers and may have difficulty replenishing their supplies.  Firearms dealers are extremely careful about giving out ammunition.  I am sure that if the firearms dealers were to receive the names of the visitors who constantly shoot out of range they would be happy to meet them and accommodate them.  If Deputy Stagg or any other informed commentator could forward these names it would be of considerable benefit to the industry.</P>
    <P>In short, this legislation is about ensuring businesses under threat are saved.  It is about saving jobs and ensuring that the contribution this sector makes to the economy is maintained. It is not about liberalising the laws in relation to firearms, undermining our wildlife or bringing about a situation whereby people can come into the country and easily obtain a firearms certificate or a hunting licence.  The legislation is balanced and the Government is committed to the working group and to a new wildlife Act.  In this respect, it is important that the High Court action should prove the catalyst for comprehensive changes to our firearms legislation and considerable improvements in the future.  In the meantime this temporary measure, which is designed only to last until May 1999 when it may be renewed for a further period of 12 months, is intended to cover a temporary situation which has arisen.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and ask that the legislation be presented to the public for what it is and not as something Members of the Opposition might wish it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Dardis)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 5 and consequential amendments Nos. 2, 3 and 6 are out of order as they are in conflict with the principle of the Bill as read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, not moved.</P>

    <Col N="807" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) The Minister shall put in place appropriate procedures to ensure that a firearm in respect of which he has issued a certificate or licence to a person ordinarily resident outside the State is inspected against the details on the certificate or licence which has issued in respect of the said firearm, on the arrival of the licence at any port, airport or point of entry in the State and the same procedure shall apply on the licencee's departure at any port, airport or point of exit in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is reasonable.  As things stand at the moment there is no requirement on a person with a firearm certificate to have the type of firearm recorded on entry into the country or for a similar check when the person is leaving the country.</P>
      <P>The amendment is similar to one which was tabled in the Dáil.  The Minister's reply that it could not be accepted because of the administrative difficulties involved was amazing.  He said the implementation of the amendment would require the imposition of entry and exit checks at all ports and airports for firearms brought into and out of the country by tourists and that would cause considerable administrative resource difficulties.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Minister gave that response.  We are dealing with lethal weapons and the strictest control should be maintained on them when they are imported into and exported from the country.  I sincerely hope the Minister's reply will not be a repeat of his answer last night. The number of tourists with arms entering the country is relatively small, although the Minister and his colleague could not agree on it yesterday. One said 4,000 and the other said 3,000.  Would the Minister give a response similar to the one he gave last night if the issue was about drugs?  It is not just wildlife which is involved.  Such weapons are used in crime and the incidence of this is increasing in Ireland, the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries.  With the exception of the USA, all countries are moving to impose laws restricting the use of guns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was much mirth about Deputy Stagg's remark about shooting game which was out of range.  Weapons for shooting game are restricted to a certain range.  However, modern technology has now developed guns with a range so huge they are almost like military weapons.  The type of ammunition used is also restricted.  The distance shot can travel and its power of penetration should be controlled.  Deputy Stagg made the point that certain weapons are brought into the country which exceed our standards and are being used.  Wildlife normally shot at from 100 metres does not have a chance at 1,000 metres if some of these weapons and ammunition is used. <Col N="808" /> That is the point Deputy Stagg made and that we make here.  This amendment is to try to protect against that happening.  We want the types of weapon used to be known and to have them properly checked at the ports of entry and exit. Given the relatively small number of tourists who engage in this activity, we are not against this kind of tourism so long as it is properly controlled. I sincerely hope the Minister sees the reason in the amendment and accedes to it.</P>

      <P>The Senator must live in a different country.  From his description of the weapons used, one would think military aircraft were used in hunting birds.  Shotguns are used and their range is approximately 35 to 40 yards, regardless of the cartridge used.</P>

      <P>I am amazed the Senator's party did not legislate on this issue when the case was brought in 1996 which was when his party was in Government.  That was the time to have done it, rather than waiting for this Government to do it, a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the Senator about the checking of guns brought into the country.  A tourist bringing in a gun will have to go through the red channel in customs and declare his firearm.  The number is then checked against the licence issued to him by the State.  Furthermore, when he is out hunting fowl in the areas prescribed to him, a wildlife ranger can ask him to produce his licence. I have been in the company of people who have had to produce not only their licences but also their game bag and its contents.  I have also encountered situations where people were in guest houses and the wildlife ranger came and asked for the freezer to be opened so he could check no illegal birds were inside.  The Senator's argument is nonsensical.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor on this issue because the amendment seems reasonable. When a person arrives in the State with a firearm, there should be some mechanism to check the details supplied on the certificate against the firearm in the person's possession.  I am not sure how such licences and certificates are issued.  I thought they would have been issued in advance on the understanding that, when they were produced, on <Col N="809" /> the owner entering the country, certificates would only be granted after the weapons were inspected and the inspector was satisfied that it conformed with the details supplied.  If there is no such mechanism, there should be one to ensure unauthorised firearms are not brought into the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>If I went to France and bore with me a weapon, I would be required to give specific details to an inspecting officer as to the calibre of the weapon.  I would also have to give similar details as to the strength and force of any ammunition I had with me.  Such regulations do not apply in this State.  There should be cross-checking between what is declared and what is produced. Any tourist from any EU country can walk through the blue channel with their weapon and apply for his shooting licence when he reaches his destination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been involved in game shooting for many years and none of the many tourists I have met have ever carried anything other than 12 bore guns.  This legislation is important because there are thousands of Irish people living abroad who take their holidays here during the shooting season.  Are we going to deprive them of a permit or licence to bring their guns into the country?  There is a huge number of such people as well as foreigners.  One such example is a man I met in Paris recently, whom I first met in my town a few years ago.  I discovered at the time that he was a member of the French Senate.  He told me he was looking forward to coming back to Ireland with a group of people.</P>
      <P>The Opposition has misread this legislation. There are problems and they must be addressed but this is a short-term measure which should be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not come as a surprise that I do not propose to accept this amendment. The principal focus of the Bill is deliberately narrow and is concerned with the limitations and restrictions which apply to the consideration of an application for a firearm certificate.  It is, as I have outlined again and again, also a temporary measure designed to expire within a period of 12 months.  The essence of the Senator's proposal is more permanent and is therefore not suitable for an emergency interim measure such as this.  That is not to say that I do not see some sense and substance in the proposal.  However, it is a substantive one and needs full consideration.  It is something the review group should consider.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The full implementation of the procedures suggested by the Senator would require the imposition of checks on firearms brought into and out of the country by tourist shooters at all ports and airports.  There would be considerable administrative and resource difficulties in that alone.  It <Col N="810" /> must be remembered also that such persons will have been the subject of consideration when their firearms certificate applications were being processed. At the same time it may be that spot checks of some sort could be of value.  This is an idea with some merit but I would want the expert group to give it full consideration.  I would particularly want the Garda authorities, who would have to implement such procedures, to examine the proposal.  There are implications for manpower arrangements and so on.  I am not convinced that it would be necessary and appropriate to establish a statutory basis for the implementation of such procedures, particularly by temporary measures such as this Bill.  Even if they are considered to be worthwhile following full consideration, an administrative basis could be sufficient.</P>
    <P>Detailed information is submitted at the time of application for a hunting licence and a firearms certificate by a non-resident.  Checks are, of course, made at this stage including verification of age, firearm calibre, evidence of firearm authorisation, clearance with the Garda Síochána to ensure that there are no convictions recorded in the State, confirmation of permission to shoot on lands and details of Irish address.  In addition, hunting licences or firearms certificates must be shown on request to, among others, a member of the Garda Síochána, a wildlife ranger and the owner of the land.  The same procedures which were in place prior to the enactment of this legislation will be in place following its enactment.  Details are required on a very detailed form which must be sent to the Department.  The Garda Síochána are notified of the details of all firearms certificates issued to non-nationals.  They have full details of the location in Ireland of all visitors to the country and of their firearms.</P>
    <P>In addition the types of firearms for which certificates are issued are severely restricted.  There were times during the debates in both Houses when I felt I was on the film set of the &ldquo;Guns of Navarone&rdquo;.  Wild exaggerations were made. Members were beginning to make absolutely no sense.  We must retain a sense of proportion and common sense.  Certificates are issued only for shotguns and rifles of a certain calibre.  Speakers were beginning to give the impression that one could come into Ireland with a machine gun.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That is scaremongering.  If a visitor to the country uses an uncertified firearm he or she commits an offence and the firearm can be seized.  When applications are being processed checks are made.  To give the impression that they are not is nonsensical.  These checks have been made under successive Governments and continue to be made.  The notion that a foreigner can come to an Irish port with all sorts of weapons and be allowed in is shown to be nonsensical <Col N="811" /> when one considers that the same thing could happen to an Irish national.  It is true that one cannot legislate for everything.  We will protect the public and wildlife from the use of firearms in so far as we can but it is not humanly possible to legislate for every situation.  Firearms legislation in Ireland is probably the most restrictive in Europe.  People involved in the business and sport of shooting will readily testify to this fact.</P>
      <P>I very much regret that this debate was used in both Houses to scaremonger.  There was a deviation from the facts and some Members displayed a wanderlust to fantasyland.  I prefer to deal with the facts which I have outlined to the best of my ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's attitude is disappointing. By his own admission, anyone coming into the country and seeking a firearms certificate and a hunting licence simply fills out the form which he has shown us.  That is passed to the Department and the Garda Síochána.  No official need ever see the weapon.  Spot checks may be carried out but I have spoken to gardaí and I know that these spot checks are ineffective.  I saw an attempt to convict a foreign tourist in my own constituency.  He was charged with a serious offence but he had, of course, absconded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry the Minister became so angry and emotional.  The amendment merely seeks a check of weapons being brought into and out of the country.  The Minister say that approximately 3,000 tourist shooters enter the country throughout the year.  It should not present an enormous administrative or manpower difficulty to put the suggested procedure in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could write to the Senators giving them a detailed explanation of the problem.  He might give them the figures for firearms prosecutions involving tourists in the last year.  When gardaí or wildlife rangers charge someone with an offence they confiscate his guns.  A tourist can go home after his holiday but without his guns.  We have very strict guidelines for the issue of gun licences and these apply to visitors also.  Anyone who applies for a gun licence must state the lands over which he shoots and the gun club of which he is a member. The National Association of Regional Game Councils insists that holders of hunting licences join a registered gun club and are properly insured.  I am aware of many tourists who have been prosecuted in the past.  Their guns were confiscated and some lost their gun licences for many years.</P>

      <P>Any person would be lucky to own one shotgun in his lifetime.  A hunter's gun is his pride and joy.  He takes care of it and probably leaves it to someone in his will.  It is an expensive <Col N="812" /> possession and a person usually buys one that will suit his purposes.  If somebody brought his gun into this country he would make sure to bring it home.  He would also ensure the gun carried the proper numbers and so forth.  The tourists only bring weapons that are suitable for shooting game.  Listening to the Senator one would think they were hunting young birds with machine guns.</P>

      <P>I am not saying the proposal has no merit or that it should not be considered. However, it has wide ranging implications.  It is a substantive amendment which would have long-term effects in that it would require a permanent change in our procedures.  It is not appropriate to the termporary measure before the House to deal with a situation which arose following a High Court decision.</P>
      <P>The amendment will be examined by the review group which will be set up immediately.  It is extraordinary that Senator Connor continues to say there is a disparity in the number of licences issued when I have explained that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands deals with hunting licences whereas the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform deals with firearm certificates.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 11 to 17, to delete subsections (4) and (5) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) This Act shall expire after a period of six months after the passing of the Act by the Oireachtas.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister should not need 12 months before the review group reports.  He should set a limit of three months for the review group and towards the end of the next session introduce the new, more comprehensive legislation which he has mentioned.  Something must replace this imbecilic measure.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Act will expire 12 months after the date of its passing, subject to the possibility of one further extension if considered necessary.  Clearly, the Minister is saying he wants two years.  That is unacceptable.  He has a year from the date of the passing of the Bill to draft new legislation but he will probably inform the Oireachtas next year that it is necessary to extend the remit of this Bill for a further period.  He has not said how long a further extension would be but he appears to be seeking two years, which is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>The Minister should tell the review group to get to work and produce a report within the next three months.  He can then introduce a Bill late in the next session or early in the following session.</P>

      <P>I am also anxious to deal with this matter properly. The Minister has promised a review and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands has promised to introduce legislation in the autumn.  She will, therefore, have her house in order by then.  However, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has not indicated when the review will be set up, what are its terms of reference, when it is likely to report and what length of time he will require before producing legislation on the issuing of certificates.</P>
      <P>The more I think about this matter, the more I am appalled at the situation outlined during our discussion on the last amendment.  There is no inspection process for firearms on arrival at airports and ferry ports&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am.  The Minister said he sees merit in that amendment but he cannot do anything about it until he introduces permanent legislation.  He says it is not appropriate to temporary legislation.  It is important that the permanent legislation is introduced.  In that past 30 <Col N="814" /> years up to 4,000 firearm certificates were issued. This system could have been abused since there was no inspection of weapons at ports by an authorised officer.  I hope that will not be the case in the future.  It is unacceptable that we have been issuing firearm certificates to people from abroad without having put in place a stringent structure to ensure inspection of those weapons.  We are aware of the weapons which are being brought into this country by non-residents.  They have caused mayhem.</P>

When the permanent legislation is introduced, I hope Members of the Oireachtas will be given proper information about what is happening in this sector of the tourism industry.  There should be a proper audit of the people who come here, where they go, what they do there and what type of guns they use.  That information should be available to Members of the Oireachtas before they vote on such legislation.  The legislation should also be examined in the context of putting in place proper structures with regard to breeding grounds, estates and organisation so the industry can be expanded.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position to accept this amendment.  I mentioned during the Second Stage debate that I intend to establish, as a matter of urgency, an expert review group with a view to bringing forward proposals as a result of the High Court judgment.  The group will comprise representatives of the key agencies and will take account of the views of all of the major sectional interests.  I cannot anticipate what the group will recommend and how extensive and complex the resulting legislation will be.  I hope <Col N="815" /> the group's report will have to be submitted to me and analysed and legislative proposals will have been drawn up and passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas within 12 months.  However, that cannot be guaranteed.  It is a very tight timeframe for the completion of such a task.  Therefore, I have allowed for one extension which cannot be for longer than 12 further months.  If at that time the legislation is not in place I will have to introduce a new temporary provisions Bill. That is not a prospect which any of us would look forward to.  It would not be possible for this legislation to run indefinitely.</P>
      <P>The time limits in the Bill are those which would allow for proper consideration of the issues by the expert group and for legislation to be properly debated in the Oireachtas.  The timescale in the amendment is unrealistic and is, therefore, unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello wondered about the hunting licences and the firearms certificates.  Hunting licences are issued for the period until 31 July following the date of issue and that is pursuant to section 29(4) of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The Firearms Act, 1964 provides that firearm certificates are for 12 months duration.</P>
      <P>The review group will conduct a root and branch review of all aspects of our firearms legislation. It will consider the broad implications of the High Court judgment on both the legislation and procedures for the granting of firearm certificates to residents and non-residents alike.  It will consult a wide range of interested parties, including the National Association of Regional Game Councils as well as tourist, wildlife and conservation interests.  It will receive and consider submissions dealing with the legislative and administrative requirements in the area of wildlife shooting and firearms regulations generally.  Naturally, it will carefully consider the security and safety implications of any proposed changes in this very sensitive area.  The conclusions and recommendations of the review group will form the basis for further legislative developments.</P>
      <P>I want those legislative developments to be balanced and to take account of the experts in this area who will, no doubt, bring forward their submissions. No one group can expect to have an advantage over any other group.  The best legislation that we can put in place will be put in place following a comprehensive review, great deliberation and indepth consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for agreeing to take this important measure today.  This is a practical indication of the willingness of every Member of the House to play his or her part in supporting the British-Irish Agreement. Members of this House may be aware there were briefings of party leaders about this issue.  As part of that process the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Ruairi Quinn, very helpfully let the Taoiseach have a copy of a draft Bill dealing with this matter.  I appreciate that and, while the Bill before the House goes beyond the approach in the Labour Party draft, it is fair to say this Bill reflects the central approach proposed in that draft.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that one of the most contentious aspects of the British-Irish Agreement has been the part of it which deals with the accelerated release of prisoners.  It is easy to understand why.  On one level many people find it difficult to reconcile the early release of prisoners with their basic concept of justice.  They remember truly terrible events which have taken place and instinctively react against the idea that some of the people involved in those events should be released from prison early.</P>
      <P>The issue of prisoners was one of the most difficult issues which all the participants to the negotiations had to address.  The Agreement would not have provided the basis for a fresh settlement of the Northern Ireland conflict and a fresh start unless the issue of prisoners was addressed in the manner in which it was.</P>
      <P>I know from my contacts with people who have suffered as a result of the violence &mdash; particularly relatives of members of the Garda Síochána who were killed in the course of duty &mdash; the difficulties which many of them have with what is being proposed. Sadly, there is nothing any of us could say which could be expected to ameliorate the sense of hurt and loss of the families involved. However, the reality is that a very difficult judgment had to be made about what set of circumstances would bring about the best chance of ensuring that peace would prevail on this island; that might prevent future needless death and destruction; that could mean those families grieving at present would not inevitably be replaced by generations of newly bereaved.  In short, we were trying to ensure that in future people would not be imprisoned by history in a hopeless cycle of violence.</P>
      <P>For all the understandable concerns many people have about the prisoner issue, the situation now is that the Agreement has been accepted by the vast majority of the people of the island and it falls on all of us to give full effect to all the terms of that Agreement.  The Bill before the House today is part of that process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> I am sure all Members of the House will agree it is vital that we do not overlook the concerns of victims of violence.  It was precisely in that context that the first initiative I was able to take on foot of the Agreement was directed to the concerns of victims.  This involved obtaining Government approval for the appointment of former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of those in this jurisdiction who had suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am very grateful &mdash; as I am sure we all are &mdash; to the former Tánaiste for agreeing to undertake this task.  Those of us who have the honour of knowing him on a personal level will be well aware of the special characteristics which he will bring to this important and difficult task.  It is important that the message goes out clearly from this House that we are fully aware of the plight of victims and will continue to address their concerns as best we can.</P>
    <P>The central requirement of the part of the Agreement dealing with prisoner issues is for both Governments to put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of certain categories of prisoners.  The Governments also indicated, in paragraph 4 of the relevant part of the Agreement, that they would seek to enact the appropriate legislation to give effect to these arrangements by the end of June 1998.  The position at the time of the negotiations was that it was already clear that legislation would be required in Northern Ireland and it also appeared possible that legislation might be required in this jurisdiction to deal with certain categories of prisoners who might be affected by the proposed arrangements.</P>
    <P>This commitment has been addressed by the introduction in Westminster of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Bill.  In addition, as part of the normal legislative process, a detailed examination was carried out by my Department, in conjunction with the Attorney General's Office, with a view to analysing and, if necessary, preparing any further legislative measures which might be necessary in this jurisdiction to give effect to the commitments contained in the Agreement in relation to prisoners.</P>
    <P>That examination concluded that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government had already appropriate and sufficient legislative powers, in particular, the Offences against the State Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, available to them to allow full effect to be given to the commitments contained in the Agreement in relation to the release of prisoners without the need for specific additional legislation to be introduced.</P>
    <P>It is also worth bearing in mind in the current context that the primary legislation necessary to give effect to the British-lrish Agreement was passed by the Oireachtas in the form of the Bill to make the necessary constitutional changes, which <Col N="818" /> was subsequently passed by the people in the referendum. That measure will allow the State to consent to be bound by that Agreement in which, in turn, the Government reaffirms its commitment, <i>inter alia,</i> to implement the provisions of the Agreement reached in the multi-party negotiations. This will, therefore, give a particular legal status to the terms of that Agreement including those relating to prisoners, although there will be some lapse of time before the State will be in a position to indicate its consent to be bound by the Agreement.</P>
    <P>While specific legislation is not necessary to allow effect to be given to the releases envisaged in the Agreement, there is a broader political issue at stake.  I believe there is agreement on all sides of the House that we should not do anything which might be open to the perception that we are not complying fully with all the terms of the Agreement.  In those circumstances, I believe that there will be general support for the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the detail of the Bill, it is worth reminding ourselves of the main features of the relevant part of the British-Irish Agreement. It provides that both Governments will put in place mechanisms to provide for an accelerated programme for the release of prisoners, including transferred prisoners, convicted of scheduled offences in Northern Ireland or, in the case of those sentenced outside Northern Ireland, similar offences.  Prisoners affiliated to organisations which have not established or are not maintaining a complete and unequivocal ceasefire will not benefit from the arrangements.  Both Governments will complete a review process within a fixed timeframe and set prospective release dates of qualifying prisoners while allowing account to be taken of the seriousness of the offences for which the person was convicted and the need to protect the community.  In addition, the intention is that, should the circumstances allow it, any qualifying prisoners who remained in custody two years after the commencement of the scheme would be released at that point.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be aware that the British Government has introduced legislation to give effect in its jurisdiction to this part of the Agreement.  Any comparison between the approach in that Bill and the measure before the House should take into account the fact that we are operating in different legal environments which make it inevitable that different approaches have to be taken.  In particular, the Bill does not contain any new powers of release in relation to prisoners.  The intention is that prisoners released under the Agreement in this jurisdiction will be released under existing legislative provisions.  I wish to make it clear that these are the same provisions that successive Governments have used in releasing prisoners in the context of trying to bring about a settlement.  We do not in our law have a system of release under what is called &ldquo;on licence&rdquo;, but we have a parallel power <Col N="819" /> to impose conditions on releases.  That has been done in relation to the release of the relevant category of prisoner in recent years and that is what will be done when releases fall to be authorised under the Agreement.  The central condition of such releases is that the person concerned will keep the peace, that is, the person will not become involved in any criminal activity while on release.</P>
    <P>There has been some public comment to the effect that the criteria in the Bill in relation to releases are not specific enough.  I reject that.  It seems that there is no more straightforward and appropriate approach that could be taken to this matter than to provide, as the Bill does, that such releases will be considered by reference to the relevant part of the Agreement.  That, in turn, sets out the criteria to be taken into account.  This was also the broad approach adopted in the Labour Party Bill.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Bill will establish a commission to advise the Minister, by reference to the relevant part of the British-Irish Agreement, in relation to the exercise of powers of release in the cases of prisoners whom the Minister deems to be &ldquo;qualifying prisoners&rdquo; for the purpose of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>Section 1 is standard providing for certain necessary definitions.  Section 2 provides that on a day to be appointed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a Release of Prisoners Commission will be established.  The commission will be independent in the performance of its function.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the function of the commission. Under subsection (1) its function will be to advise the Minister, when so requested by him or her, regarding</P>
    <P>the exercise of any power of release &mdash; as defined in subsection (1) &mdash; in relation to those whom the Minister specifies as qualifying prisoners for the purposes of the terms of that part of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks which relates to prisoners.  Subsection (2) provides that the Minister will request the commission to give advice on the exercise, by reference to the relevant provisions of the Agreement, of any power of release in relation to such prisoners. The subsection further provides that the commission will comply with such a request.  Subsection (3) states that the reference to &ldquo;relevant provisions&rdquo; is a reference to the provisions of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks under the heading &ldquo;Prisoners&rdquo;.  These are set out in the Schedule to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the Minister or the Government in considering whether to exercise, by reference to the relevant provisions of the Agreement, any power of release in relation to a qualifying prisoner will have regard to the relevant provisions of the Agreement and the commission's advice.  The membership and procedure of the commission are set out in section 5.  Subsection <Col N="820" /> (1) provides that the commission will consist of a chairman and two ordinary members appointed by the Minister to be members of the commission.  The person appointed to be chairman will be a solicitor or barrister who has practised for at least seven years prior to appointment. The other members of the commission will be a member of the Probation and Welfare Service and an officer of the Minister other than a member of the Probation and Welfare Service. The section also contains standard provisions in relation to the membership and functioning of the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 6(1) requires the commission to make a report in writing to the Minister of its activities since its establishment.  The report is to be made not later than two years after its establishment.  A copy of the report will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas by the Minister.  Under subsection (3) there is provision for the Minister to make an order at any time after the expiry of two years from its establishment for the dissolution of the commission where he or she is of the opinion that it is no longer necessary that it should remain in existence.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 are standard providing for the payment of expenses arising under the Act and the short title.  The Schedule reproduces that part of the Agreement reached in the multi-party talks which deals with the issue of prisoners.</P>
    <P>When speaking in the other House on the motion approving the Agreement on 21 April last, I stated my belief that it could prove to be a turning point in the history of this island.  I also indicated my belief that it offered a unique opportunity for all sides to put our past differences behind us and to work for the future development of the island as a whole.  Events since then, including the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement in referenda North and South on 22 May and the outcome of last week's Assembly elections, have served to confirm me in that view.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to pretend that everything will go smoothly on the long and difficult journey on which we have set out.  However, what is important now is that the Agreement continues to be implemented in the spirit of partnership, equality and mutual respect in which it was negotiated. This Bill is another step on that journey, which is why I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty in agreeing with this Bill.  As the Minister stated, it arises from the British-Irish Agreement.  There is no doubt, as he stated also, that the prisoner issue was probably the most difficult question faced by negotiators on all sides.  For Sinn Féin and parties with links to loyalist paramilitaries, the issue of prisoner release would have been paramount in any settlement.  The attitude of the prisoners was crucial to those parties which spoke for them during the long negotiating process.  We must acknowledge the responsibility of prisoners and <Col N="821" /> their leaders in prisons on both islands.  Their helpfulness played no small part in creating the environment which facilitated the Agreement.</P>
      <P>However, there is another aspect of the prisoner issue with which I have the greatest sympathy, which is the attitude of victims of the truly awful and often unspeakable crimes and atrocities committed by many prisoners who, as members of paramilitary organisations, carried out deeds in which depravity often seemed to know no boundary, I know the families of two gardaí who were gunned down in Ballaghdereen in 1980 after a paramilitary bank raid.  They died about five miles from where I live.  Both were murdered in a most cold-blooded, callous manner when they ran into the path of people who would claim political justification for their abominable deeds.</P>
      <P>Such deeds have happened many times since then on this side of the Border, and on countless occasions in the past 30 years of conflict on the other side of the Border and on the other island. The heartbreak and grief visited on the victims and their surviving loved ones was unimaginable. One can easily imagine and fully understand the feelings of victims who lost husbands or those whose lives were blighted by the loss of limbs or other faculties when they see those who committed those deeds walk free with their sins forgiven and their slates wiped clean.  In deference to the understandable difficulties this will cause for victims, the Minister must attach some conditions, such as release under licence, to many of the releases.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be more forthcoming on the exact role of the independent prisoner release commission.  What method of evaluation will be used in assessing each prisoner's case for release? What criteria, if any, will be used?  What contact, if any, will there be with victims and their relatives? For example, will they get a full explanation if they seek one of the release of someone who caused them such heartbreak and bereavement? It is very important to make contact with such people and to make information fully available to them if they seek it.  The Minister must be very sensitive to the feelings and problems which will be experienced by victims and their relations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, having said that, I add my voice to those asking victims and their relations in all parts of this island and on our sister island to understand the need for prisoner release, as something which goes to the heart of the Agreement and achieving a settlement.  The settlement can only succeed if all parts of the bargain are kept.  The prize of an enduring peace is worth paying a very high price for.  Victims and relatives have already paid a high price, often the supreme price.  Nevertheless, we ask them to be generous and to abide with those of us who support this Agreement and want to see it succeed.  I say with no arrogance that 95 per cent of the people want this Agreement to succeed.  All we can do is work with generosity <Col N="822" /> and a mutual understanding so that peace will be delivered.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Government's decision to appoint an eminent person to conduct the review of the services and arrangements to meet the needs of people in this jurisdiction who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland, as the Minister put it.  The choice of the former Tánaiste, Minister and long time Member of the Oireachtas is an excellent one.  He is a great person of great experience and intellectual integrity.  He was a Deputy for two Border constituencies, Cavan and Monaghan, for at least 20 years.  He has an insight into the conflict in Northern Ireland which few others have.  However, what resources will be at his disposal in conducting his review?  What actions will he be entitled to take if he sees action is necessary?  There is no use in having someone like Mr. John Wilson conducting a review of the services available to victims unless the Minister assures us the inadequacies to which he draws attention will be addressed and his requests will not be ignored.  I do not know if his terms of reference have been fully drawn up yet.  However, they should state that the onus will be on the Government to accept any recommendations he might make within all reasonable limits.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Dáil debate on the Bill yesterday. I was particularly interested in the contribution of the Sinn Féin Member, Deputy Caoimhghin Ó Caoláin.  I hoped he might say something about the pleas of the dozens of people whose relatives or loved ones were abducted and murdered by the IRA and buried or disposed of in unknown places.  It is the dear wish of these relatives to know the whereabouts of the graves of their husbands, sons and grandsons who were abducted and murdered ten or 30 years ago, or much more recently in some cases. These grieving relatives want to recover the bodies of their loved ones and afford them the dignity of a decent or Christian burial.  I am not saying Deputy Ó Caoláin knows the location of these graves but he has influence with those who do.  It would be a wonderful gesture towards reconciliation and confidence building if he would use his privileged position as a Member of the Dáil to say he would seek help in identifying these graves.  Alas, he could not say that as his party &mdash; or, at least, the party it seems he belongs to &mdash; would not allow him to.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the IRA should offer an apology for some of the terrible deeds they were associated with during the conflict.  Members will remember Mr. Gusty Spence, leader of the Combined Loyalist Command, offering what he described as an abject apology to all who lost their lives through the actions of his organisation; he made this apology when announcing their ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Sinn Féin and the IRA in particular to offer an apology.  That would be a wonderful gesture at this stage of the process, and gestures <Col N="823" /> are very important.  The prisoner issue has been an essential element of all conflict resolutions in recent years.  It was central to the end of apart-heid in South Africa, and to the ending of civil wars in Mozambique, Angola and Cambodia.  It is crucial to the solution of many complex national emergencies such as those in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan, and it was addressed courageously in this Agreement.</P>
    <P>I congratulate everyone who was involved in the Agreement.  However, much as I hate to end on a discordant note, I do not think the balance in the Bill between the necessity for legislation and the sensitivity of victims and relatives is quite right.</P>

      <P>Any Bill that accelerates the promotion of the British-Irish Agreement is to be welcomed, and that is what this Bill does.  The support in the Oireachtas for the Agreement is reflected in the debate on this Bill, and the Minister has referred to the support from the other party leaders, particularly the leader of the Labour Party.  The Schedule contains the provisions relating to prisoners included under the British-Irish Agreement, which was overwhelmingly endorsed North and South.  The Bill adheres faithfully to the terms of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Speakers have referred to the prisoners issue arising wherever peoples in conflict try to settle their differences.  It is at the core of such efforts, and the prisoners issue has been at the core of the problems in Northern Ireland over the past 25 years.  I recall visiting Belfast in the mid 1980s, particularly during the Harry Kirkpatrick trial, and seeing approximately 40 prisoners were forced to stand in a corral in the corner of a courtroom. The Diplock court system did nothing to advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland. It is heartening to see how far we have come since the supergrass system was used to bribe political activists and militarists to &ldquo;grass&rdquo; on their fellow militarists.  We have made huge advances since then and the British-Irish Agreement is a vital part of that advance.  It is important that we reflect on that to appreciate the role this Bill is playing in the overall settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another sad side to the release of prisoners. I refer to the victims of crimes perpetrated by those criminals.  We have all heard stories of horrible violence and murder perpetrated by some of the prisoners under consideration for release.  As the Minister said, it is very difficult to address the sense of bereavement and injustice felt by relatives of the dead.  It is difficult to console them and to address their needs in a holistic way while also addressing the terms of the Agreement, <Col N="824" /> as we are bound to do as signatories to the Agreement.  We must strike a balance that is sensitive to those relatives and that ensures the hopeless cycle of violence that has bedevilled Northern Ireland is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The Minister has got the balance right, and I heartily welcome his decision to establish a commission under the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, to meet the needs of those in this jurisdiction who have suffered as a result of violent actions in Northern Ireland.  I commend the Minister on his excellent choice.  Mr. Wilson is a man of long experience both inside and outside politics, and he has a great capacity for empathy.  He is also a man of calibre, both in public and private.  These characteristics enable him to bring the insight, experience and professionalism that will be necessary in dealing with this very sensitive area.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor was concerned that the Minister did not address these needs sufficiently in dealing with the categories of prisoners to be released.  The Minister should spell out in further detail the way in which he intends dealing with the concerns and needs of the bereaved and the victims of violence. The terms of reference given to Mr. Wilson oblige him to conduct a review of the services and arrangements in place to meet the needs of those who have suffered as a result of violent action associated with the conflict in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years.  Mr. Wilson is also charged with identifying further measures which need to be taken to acknowledge and address the suffering and concerns of those people.  This is an all embracing approach in the context of those who were hurt, injured or bereaved.</P>
    <P>Mr. Wilson is also charged with addressing the needs and concerns of those who sustained serious injuries and members of the immediate families of those who died or sustained serious injuries in the service of the State as a consequence of violent action ensuing from the conflict. He will advise how support can be given to victims and families and how their coping with the immediate aftermath and continuing consequences of violence can be acknowledged and sustained.  This is extremely important and central to what must be addressed by the State in reaching out to these people.  It is very important that a clear and unambiguous message go from the House that legislators, through Bills such as this and in promoting the British-Irish Agreement, are fully aware of their plight as victims and will address their concerns on an ongoing basis to ensure they are adequately dealt with.</P>
    <P>Prisoner releases is a central requirement of the British-Irish Agreement and it is heartening and reassuring to hear the Minister say there are definite categories of prisoners who will quality under the Bill and that reviews of its operation will take place.  These are necessary safeguards required to ensure a correct balance.  I commend the Bill and believe the Minister has achieved the correct balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I know the Minister paid tribute to the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Quinn, for providing the initial draft of a Bill.  I thought the Bill was essential from the outset because the British-Irish Agreement formed a package, a central issue of which was the release of prisoners over a two year period. A specific requirement of the Agreement was that both Governments introduce legislation to bring this about.  The British Government has done this through its Northern Ireland Sentences Bill, the debate on which was lively, particularly in relation to the qualifying categories of prisoners. The first breach of the Agreement took place on this issue.  Here, despite people's reservations, we seem to be at one in relation to the necessity of providing for the spirit and letter of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>The Official Secrets Act, 1939, and the Criminal Justice Act, 1960, set out the Minister's role on prisoners in our jurisdiction, including those transferred from elsewhere, in terms of release. Nevertheless here we are talking about a separate dispensation and a new imperative.  We adopted the Agreement through constitutional amendment and it is appropriate that we specify separate legislation to ensure this is reflected in domestic law and as it is different from anything which has gone before.  I am glad the Bill is before us.  I would have wished it to be more comprehensive in terms of reflecting the values, wishes and spirit of the changes.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement was accepted by a very substantial percentage of the people throughout the island who voted for the total package.  In general terms we are providing for an amnesty over a two year period.  Such arrangements, whereby prisoners are given concessions in terms of release which look particularly attractive if taken in the context of deeds committed, have always existed in the termination of conflicts. It happened here down through the centuries and there have been examples of it throughout the world, including in recent conflicts referred to by previous speakers.  The other side of the coin is that terrible things have been done and there are victims, many of whom were innocent, including those not involved in the security forces, who endured a huge amount of suffering in tragic circumstances, something we should take on board.</P>
      <P>I am glad that Mr. John Wilson, a previous Tánaiste and much respected figure, has been appointed by the Government to review the services available to those who have suffered and that the British Government has made a similar arrangement in the context of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisoners have played an extremely important role right through the process in bringing the conflict to a conclusion.  Their thinking has been important in Nationalist and loyalist contexts from the beginning.  Prisoners were crucial in bringing about the initial 1994 ceasefire.  At the same time loyalist and Nationalist prisoners argued the case and by and large initiated the <Col N="826" /> process both North and South.  This was reflected in the transfer of sentenced persons legislation introduced in 1995.  It formed part of the ongoing process of facilitating debate while ensuring prisoners and their families were treated fairly in terms of serving sentences within a reasonable distance of their homes.  Prisoners were the stalwarts in maintaining the renewed ceasefire and were central to the decisions taken at the Sinn Féin delegate conference before the party decided overwhelmingly to support the Agreement. Similarly, the release of prominent loyalist prisoners had the same effect in Northern Ireland.  Therefore, the role of prisoners has been beneficial.  It could be said their role was negative and detrimental in previous decades, but their role has been extremely beneficial in recent years.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor mentioned the prisoners serving sentences for the murder of two gardaí in Ballaghaderreen. Are prisoners in that category covered by the deal?  Will the Minister clarify the category of qualifying prisoners in that regard? A number of organisations whose members were involved in scheduled offences do not support the British-Irish Agreement.  If those prisoners come on board, will they benefit from that element of the package?  Will non-aligned prisoners or INLA prisoners, who have disassociated themselves from their central organisations, be considered part and parcel of the Agreement in terms of early release?  The Minister said he will keep the situation under review.  We know the organisations which have accepted the Agreement but what is the situation in relation to others?</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister about the part of the Agreement which stated the Governments would take measures to facilitate the reintegration of prisoners into the community providing various supports, employment opportunities, re-training, re-skilling and further education.  This an area to which the legislation should have been extended. If large numbers of prisoners are released at the same time, there will be a need for support mechanisms to ensure they do not go astray or return to evil ways.  We must ensure they become integrated into the community and that there is a career option available to them.  One of the weakness of the legislation is that no attempt, good, bad or indifferent, is made to ensure those who will be released from prison will be supported and helped reintegrate into the community.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor raised the question of those on both sides of the divide who disappeared during the conflict and whose burial places are unknown. There is a need to disclose those locations so these people can get a decent Christian burial.  I would like the Minister to raise this issue at whatever level in this jurisdiction and with his British counterparts as regards Northern Ireland.  If nothing is done, it will remain one of the traumatic scars of this period.  I urge the Minister to take steps to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward the legislation which will make a substantial contribution <Col N="827" /> to ensuring the peace process moves ahead more smoothly.  With these initial steps, I hope we will have peace on our island from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this debate.  There was, understandably, a general welcome for the Bill.  It might be helpful at this stage to repeat that the Bill does not give any new powers of release to either the Minister or the Government.  The existing powers of release have proved adequate in the past to allow successive Governments deal with releases of this nature.  It is difficult to see any valid reason to call them into question now.</P>
      <P>One possible approach would have been to list a set of detailed criteria on release but that would involve, in terms of our law, needlessly seeking to define what is meant by particular provisions of the Agreement.  In our view, that is neither necessary nor desirable.  As I said in my introduction to this debate, we have taken the straightforward approach by specifying that the releases in question should be made by reference to the terms of the Agreement or account should be taken of the seriousness of the offence and the need to protect the community.  Many of these specific factors which were mentioned might be taken into account are in reality subsumed by those concepts.</P>
      <P>We deliberately took the approach in the Bill that we would not seek to further define the terms used in the Agreement because to do so would be unnecessary and undesirable.  Cases which fall to be dealt with under the Agreement will be considered on an individual basis, including the conditions that would be appropriate to particular releases.  It was understandable and right that during the course of this debate there was considerable emphasis on the plight of victims. I mentioned at the outset the work which the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, is undertaking in this regard.</P>
      <P>It might be useful to mention that this Bill represents one element of my Department's continuing involvement with the peace process.  The British-Irish Agreement has significant implications for my Department across a wide range of policy areas for which it has primary responsibility within our public service.  These derive from those provisions of the Agreement dealing with rights, safeguards, equality of opportunity, decommissioning, security and the constitutional changes presaged by the 19th amendment of the Constitution in addition to the provisions on prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of the commitments made by the Government in these areas will, therefore, fall to my Department to take forward.  It is appropriate in the context of this debate to detail some of these briefly.  Progress has been made in giving effect to a number of commitments made in the <Col N="828" /> Agreement.  The Employment Equality Bill has been enacted and regulations were made on Monday of last week under the Decommissioning Act, 1997, which provide for the decommissioning schemes recommended by the independent International Commission on Decommissioning and endorsed by the participants to the multi-party negotiations.</P>
    <P>Other issues relating to the Agreement currently being addressed by my Department include the issue of the establishment of a human rights commission, which is intended to be a statutory body underpinned by legislation, and the review of the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1985, on which I intend to bring proposals to Government in the near future for the purpose of establishing a review mechanism. There will obviously be other occasions during which we may debate these matters in detail. Meanwhile, I again thank Senators for their co-operation in this matter.  Incidentally, I should have said the decommissioning regulations were signed this week.</P>

      <P>Given this is the last day of the session, it is worth mentioning that by my reckoning, this is the 17th Bill I have had before the Seanad since my appointment as Minister a little over a year ago.  I have received a very high level of co-operation from the Seanad in dealing with what, by any standards, is a substantial body of law reform and I recognise the heavy burden placed on Senators, especially on the spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>I look forward to resuming our major law reform initiatives later in the year.  In the meantime I express my best wishes to all Senators. They will be sitting in committees during July and September, but I wish them a pleasant August.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which he has dealt with legislation before the House.  He produces most of the legislation here. A total of 17 Bills introduced by him were passed in the last session.  This represents a colossal amount of work and time for any Minister.  His work load is astounding.

I am continually impressed by the manner in which he is able to deal with a wide range of amendments and is able to respond to the concerns raised by Senators.  Seventeen Bills is a hugely impressive record.  I wish him a restful break, however long or short.  He will have to attend to his departmental duties in the period when the House has risen, although committees are still meeting.  If ever a Minister deserved a break this one does. Although this debate was short it was very important and positive.  It is heartening that the House is rising on such a good note on all sides and with a Bill of such significance and importance for the future of the island.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to put on record the concerns of the equine industry, both the thoroughbred and non-thoroughbred, regarding the proposed prohibition of equine medicines by the EU in January 2000 and also with regard to the number of widely used preparations that are, in theory at least, banned at present.  The Minister of State has a personal knowledge of the equine industry.</P>
      <P>There is great concern about proposals in this area emanating from recent directives.  The problem seems to be because the EU classifies the horse as a food producing animal.  It is not widely accepted in this country that it is such, but up to 50 per cent of horses, having been humanely slaughtered, are exported and reach the food chain on the Continent and elsewhere.  It is not part of the culture of this or our neighbouring island to eat horsemeat.  No distinction is made between recreational horses and those bred for food production by the EU as a large number of recreational horses enter the food chain at the end of their lives.  EEC Council Regulation 2377/90 stipulates that maximum residue limits must be established for any substance intended for use in food producing animals prior to its use. The MRL for any substance must be established before it is used.  This applies to medicines for us and to veterinary medicines and pharmaceuticals which enter the food chain.  Hence the problem we now face.</P>
      <P>For the establishment of these MRLs pharmaceutical companies must submit applications supported by specific data relating to the pharmacological and toxicological profile of the substance as well as the results of residue depletion studies in the species for which the substance is intended. Substances are classified in four different annexes.  More than 300 pharmacological substances of which the Minister will be aware, some as simple as vitamins, honey and glycerol, are commonly used as feed additives in routine husbandry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Besides the establishment of MRLs, community legislation requires that no veterinary medicinal product may be placed on the market of a member state unless a marketing authorisation has been issued under Council Directive 81/851.  The number of substances for which MRLs have been established for horses is very limited and the number of products which have been granted a marketing authorisation for use on horses is even more limited.  The cost of producing <Col N="832" /> such a data package is such that pharmaceutical companies do not consider it a fair return on their investment due to the market being too small.  This is the major difficulty faced by the horse industry.  This also has the effect of the companies being unwilling to develop new products for the use in minor species such as the horse.</P>
    <P>Some life threatening conditions in horses, such as shock and colic, can hardly be treated as the most essential products to treat such conditions &mdash; analgesics, gaseous anaesthetics, intravenous fluids, cardiac antidotes and medicines affecting the gastrointestinal tract &mdash; are not always available because they cannot be used legally if the letter of the law is adhered to.  This situation is growing worse daily as the products with only temporary licences disappear as a result of MRL regulation.</P>
    <P>In the United States where 100,000 horses are slaughtered exclusively for export to the EU, the Food and Drug Administration randomly takes spot samples from horses at slaughterhouses to monitor residues.  When residues are present above permitted levels the owner of the animal is held responsible except when the veterinarian fails to provide information about the waiting period to be observed.  The situation in Canada and South America is comparable to the US.</P>
    <P>To simply exclude recreational horses from the food chain is not a solution since there are no reliable or enforceable safeguards to ensure protection of public health.  If consumer protection is the objective two procedures must be put in place &mdash; first, residue testing of horsemeat in the slaughterhouses, and, second, a reliable foolproof identification and traceability scheme.  This would mean microchip identification and the use of a medication passport which would be presented at the slaughterhouse.</P>
    <P>If this problem is not effectively addressed by the EU legislators it will result in our horse population not receiving the therapy to which it is entitled and we will compromise our horse welfare with legislation which is not applicable to 73 per cent of horsemeat sourced outside the EU. This is an important point for those who eat horsemeat.  The hardship we are causing the horse industry in the EU is being created without regard to where most of the meat is sourced. There is no logic to the manner in which the EU handles the system.</P>
    <P>New therapies will not be developed in Europe for the treatment of equine diseases because the pharmaceutical companies do not want the associated expense and research.  Long-term scientific research into horse welfare is in jeopardy because of current directives.</P>
    <P>We will create a black market in which drugs will be sourced from outside the EU to treat the more valuable horses in the State or those owned by the wealthy.  One of the great passions in urban and rural Ireland is the horse, not just for those who own horses but for the betting and racing industries and children who grow up with <Col N="833" /> ponies and horses in the country.  Horses are one of the great addictions of Irish people at all levels of society.  We only have to look at the debate about horses around Dublin to know how sensitive we must be when handling these issues.  We insist on strict welfare conditions for horses tethered at the side of the road, but we hamper those who insist on exemplary well being for their horses and we are pushing them into the black market.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent upon us for the sake of our horses to take a proper look at the problem and agree a solution which will achieve two objectives &mdash; protect the consumer and offer our horses the best possible treatments.  This can be achieved by testing for residues in slaughterhouses while implementing a foolproof identification scheme for all horses.  There have been discussions about this matter in the Department during the past month.  I was approached by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and I commend them for their interest and concern.  I am also speaking as a member of the Equestrian Federation of Ireland, the umbrella body for the non-thorough-bred industry.  There is major concern for a major industry which is a huge contributor to GNP and employment and gives wonderful pleasure throughout the State.</P>
    <P>The meeting which took place in the Department was attended by some eminent veterinarians. I understand that a group has been set up to clearly identify where problems may arise. They will then report through the Irish Medicines Board to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicines, the central group in Europe based in the UK, which makes these decisions. The Minister should ensure there is broad representation on this group.  It should not be unwieldy, but it must ensure that all equine interests in the State are represented and heard on this issue.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give this problem the urgent attention it requires.  There are serious concerns about the protection of our horse population. It is inconceivable that large racing and breeding communities, the properly organised non-thoroughbred community &mdash; including showjumpers, eventers, dressage owners &mdash; and the huge range of people involved in horse production and breeding have no legal access to such commonly used drugs as phenylbutizone, antibiotics, analgesics, anaesthetics, intravenous fluids, vitamins and minerals, which will shortly be removed from the market when the temporary licences expire and driven underground.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Irish Farmers Association horse committee which raised this topic at a meeting in Brussels last month.  I compliment Peter Gibbons MRCVS from whom I have quoted liberally.  He is a member of the ITBA veterinary committee.  I also thank Des Leydon of the Irish Equine Centre who presented an excellent paper at the COPA meeting in Brussels.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> We have excellent people in this country who are prepared to give their time to come to a resolution of the problem which would meet the needs of the industry and ensure that public health is protected.  We need a balanced approach but we need to move urgently.</P>

Council Regulation 2377/90 lays down the principle that medicines may not be administered to food producing animals unless a maximum residue limit &mdash; MRL &mdash; is fixed for the active substance.  The deadline for setting such MRLs expires generally on 1 January 2000 while the deadline for four specific substances expired on 1 January 1998.  The other element of EU legislation which is of relevance is Council Directive 64/432 under which the horse is defined as a food producing animal.  It is almost sacrilege to consider such a thing in this country.  While horsemeat is not consumed in Ireland, we slaughter horses for export for human food at the rate of around 50 per week.  Based on the estimated horse population this would indicate that roughly 50 per cent of our horse population is disposed of in this manner.</P>
      <P>The difficulties arising from lack of availability of suitable medicines across a range of animal species, including the horse sector, was the subject of discussions between the European Commission and member states earlier this year.  At that meeting, Irish representatives outlined the difficulties arising in certain sectors, including the horse sector, and stressed the need to find a solution. The Commission acknowledged the difficulties in this area and has undertaken to examine a range of potential solutions in terms of legislative and supportive actions.  My Department has been following up the matter with the Commission and I understand that the inter-service consultations involving the relevant Directorates General are ongoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a meeting was held recently involving my Department and representatives of the various bodies associated with the horse industry to examine further the potential options.  At this meeting it was agreed that a group comprising representation from the industry, the veterinary bodies, the Irish Medicines Board and my Department would be established to develop viable solutions which would have a reasonable possibility of satisfying the Commission.  This group will meet as soon as each has had the opportunity to consider the matter further.  In the interim, my Department asked the industry to identify precisely the list of affected products for which no viable alternative exists.  The situation is unsatisfactory and I have been concerned about it for some time.  I accept that solutions need to be found and as I have already outlined, my <Col N="835" /> Department in its discussions with the Commission has emphasised the urgency of finding solutions for horses.</P>
    <P>This also applies to the artificial insemination scheme.  Vets must now issue certificates which can cost £25 and vets will not always be as readily available as the AI man.  This also puts extra costs on the suckler scheme which is a low profit scheme.  This is ridiculous and we are doing our best to address it.  If the ground changes people will have to use phenylbutizone to save horses. We are urgently looking for a solution.  The Senator has the support of the Department on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked the Department of Public Enterprise is in three parts: how many licences Cable Management Ireland applied for before the closing date for receipt of applications on 31 August 1989; what licences it was allocated on foot of those applications and under what circumstances it was granted the three licences for County Donegal in 1990, as the closing date for receipt of applications on 31 August 1989 passed without any applicants for the three licences in Donegal.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about this issue in view of what has happened in the past and the many doubts concerning the validity of existing licences due to the large number of issues which have arisen in the past few months, especially those which arose within the past month.  Certain tactics are being used in Donegal by this company to put community deflector groups and their systems off the air.  Digital television will be introduced in the next 18 months and there is a need for the broadcasting policy of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to be established as quickly as possible in view of the fact that MMDS franchise licence holders have every intention of applying for the licence to provide digital reception through MMDS and cable television.</P>
      <P>I have taken part in debates on the future provision of digital television at the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language. I also attended joint Oireachtas committee meetings which discussed the problems of mobile telephone communication masts in rural communities. The knowledge and information I have acquired from the work of both committees has caused me to question the granting of the original MMDS licences in Donegal and the possibility of the same difficulties we have experienced over the past nine years continuing with the introduction of digital television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of Donegal felt that the introduction of digital television would be their saviour and bring an end to years of confrontation and disruption.  A number of facts which have arisen <Col N="836" /> in the past few months have disturbed me and many of my constituents: the ongoing question of the Rennicks political contributions at the time of the granting of the MMDS licences; the absence of applications for the three Donegal MMDS licences before the closing date on 31 August 1989 and how was Cable Management Ireland granted the licences in 1990.</P>
    <P>At the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language, I asked the representatives of another MMDS franchise company why they had not applied for the Donegal licences.  They replied by quoting a Department official who stated that companies wishing to get oranges would also have to take some lemons. That company's lemon was the south of the country. No one wanted the lemons in the north-west. The north-west lemon was not only commercially non-viable but, due to the number of local community deflector groups which had developed from the mid 1970s to the late 1980s, there was going to be a lot of aggravation and disputes.</P>
    <P>One must wonder how between August 1989 and late 1990 it was made more enticing for CMI Ireland to take up the Donegal licences?  No great effort has been made by this company to introduce MMDS services to west Donegal.  Initially there was opposition to its gaining access to the site on which the Telecom Éireann mast is situated at Ardragh.  However, it gained access following legal proceedings.</P>
    <P>In the past year the company has made no great marketing effort to sell its services to the people of south-west Donegal other than the threat of legal proceedings against landowners on whose land the deflector groups have situated their equipment.  It has tried to bully the people of Ardragh and Glenties into taking its service by taking both community groups to the High Court. It has succeeded in silencing the community service in Glenties.  The legal action against the Ardragh community group has been postponed to enable the company to examine the group's claim that it does not need a licence under existing legislation.</P>
    <P>CMI Ireland examined the local system in Ardragh in the last week and has to decide within the next two weeks whether to proceed with its legal action.  The company has tried to bully the populated areas of Ardragh and Glenties which are adjacent to the mast on which it has erected its antenna.  No effort has been made by the company to provide or market the service north of these towns and other areas from Dungloe to Creeslough.  Is this because it has difficulties providing the service due to the mountainous terrain and the need to invest further in benders and additional communication masts?</P>
    <P>I am asking the regulator and the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation to examine whether the company has fulfilled the conditions under which it was given the original licences.  Why has the Department or the regulator not made any effort to stop the deflectors in <Col N="837" /> the last nine years?  Why must the regulator delay further dealing with the applications of local community groups under the Dukes Scheme?  She advised me at a previous Oireachtas Joint Committee meeting that she had the applications in her office.  I am asking the regulator to grant licences to the local deflector groups who were in existence in 1989 and who should have been allowed to apply in law for licences to operate their self-help systems which they set up in the mid-1970s to provide both British stations and, in some cases, the RTÉ channels when no one else wished to help the communities.</P>
    <P>Digital television will be in existence within the next 18 months and the British television digital service will be available by the autumn.  Sky Digital will be available at a much lower cost than the present analogue MMDS system which is being offered to the communities by Cable Management. After nine years of confrontation I am asking the regulator to allow the community groups to remain on the air for the short period between now and when the digital service comes into being.</P>
    <P>The recent actions of CMI Ireland are merely to divert attention from their failure to provide the service under the conditions of their original licence and also for their desire to claim compensation. The people of Donegal south-west do not want MMDS.  They hope that when the Government decides on their policy in relation to digital the preferred option will be digital terrestrial television. If RTÉ is successful in getting a partner and is awarded the digital franchise, they will provide a first class service to the majority of the citizens of Donegal.</P>
    <P>We cannot trust the MMDS companies to provide a service to all the people at an affordable cost.  They say they have the infrastructure already in place and all that is needed is additional equipment.  This is not the case in Donegal where they have invested in very little equipment.  Many people will not be serviced by the MMDS system.  For example, Cable Management took over a cable system in Donegal town. I understand they are charging up to £100 per household whereas they were trying to charge in the region of £300 to £500 in country areas for the MMDS system.  I understand from RTÉ that they would hope to provide the digital service for less than £100 per household.  We in Donegal do not trust Cable Management or any of the multichannel MMDS companies to provide the necessary service.  We believe we will continue to be a lemon in the system.</P>
    <P>When this legislation was introduced in 1989 it is possible that Members of the Oireachtas were not fully aware that Donegal was already being provided with a service by the people helping themselves.  I appreciate that in the midlands and south, where it was not easy to pick up the British signals, there was a need for MMDS but we did not have that problem in Donegal.  Because of this I believe the 1989 legislation is flawed and I <Col N="838" /> hope the Minister will abdicate the decision to the regulator.  However, the regulator will only provide the regulations but both Houses of the Oireachtas will provide the legislation.  I am asking my colleagues in both Houses, that when digital television comes up for examination that all the marginalised people &mdash; the people on the periphery whom I represent in Donegal south-west &mdash; who were able to provide their own service, will be taken into consideration.</P>

      <P>I apologise for the Minister who cannot be here and I am taking the matter for her.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the legal responsibility for the licensing of MMDS and cable TV operators now lies with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation under powers transferred to her pursuant to the Telecommunications (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>As the Minister indicated in a reply to a written question in the Dáil recently, the competition for the award of 30 MMDS licences was advertised in the national newspapers on 6 May 1988.  Completed detailed applications were required to be submitted to the Department of Communications by 31 August 1988.  It was the Department's intention at the time of launching the licensing process that cells would be grouped together for the purpose of the issue of licences.  This was to ensure that cells which covered unattractive markets, that is, areas of low population density, would be able to gain access to an adequate service by being coupled with the more densely populated areas.</P>
      <P>In this regard it was intended that cells 1 to 6 &mdash; Donegal, Sligo and Mayo &mdash; would be awarded as a single franchise.  At the closing date for the competition, 31 August 1988, applications were received from 16 different companies or individuals. These covered 24 of the total 30 cell franchises which had been advertised.  Cable Management Ireland (CMI) was not an applicant.  No applications were received for six cells, that is, cells 1, 2 and 3 &mdash; Donegal, cell 4 &mdash; West Mayo and cells 7 and 8 &mdash; Cavan-Monaghan.  Of the cells for which applications were received in advance of the deadline, 24 were awarded to companies who had made applications for those cells before the deadline.  One cell, cell 6 &mdash; Sligo &mdash; was not awarded to the organisation which had applied for it before the deadline, because the organisation's application was not considered to be of sufficient quality.  Cablelink Limited which had successfully applied for cell 5 was obliged to take cell 4.  Cells 7 and 8 were awarded to Drogheda Independent Limited, a subsidiary of Independent Newspapers, which had successfully applied for cells 9 and 12, indicating a willingness to take these cells.  These decisions were announced on 30 September 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly before the announcement of the award of the main body of franchises, and after the <Col N="839" /> deadline for receipt of applications, Cable Management Ireland approached the Department and expressed a strong interest in obtaining MMDS franchises.  As there were no other expressions of interest in cells 1, 2, 3 and 6 as a group at that stage and as CMI was regarded as a viable operator for these cells, they were invited to apply for the franchise.  Around that time CMI had become very active in the cable television sector and acquired systems in a number of towns including Sligo, Buncrana and Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="840" /> CMI subsequently applied for cells 1, 2, 3 and 6.  From information obtained from the files relating to this matter, it appears that CMI's application was acceptable from a technical point of view and that the company was regarded as being acceptable from a financial and business perspective. CMI was subsequently awarded the franchise for cells 1, 2, 3 and 6.</P>
