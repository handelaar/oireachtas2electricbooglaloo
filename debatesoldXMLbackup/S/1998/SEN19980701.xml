      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the growing concern among construction companies and industry bodies about the problem of &ldquo;embedded&rdquo; chips in computer systems essential to modern buildings and the possible damage to micro-processors in building systems if computers crash on 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to express concern at the increasing level of persecution embarked upon against the gay citizens of Zimbabwe by the dictator Mugabe.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.  Item 1, Motion re.  Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1983, to be taken without debate; item 2, Parental Leave Bill, 1998 [Seanad Bill amended by Dáil] Report and Final Stages; item 3, Food Safety Authority of Ireland Bill, 1998, Committee and Remaining Stages; item 4, Turf Development Bill, 1997, Committee and Remaining Stages, to be taken at 3 p.m.; item 5, Statements on tax free and duty free shopping post 1999, to be taken from 6-8 p.m., each statement not to exceed ten minutes and item 6, Statements on the Report of the Independent Inquiry into matters relating to Child Sexual Abuse in Swimming, to be taken at the conclusion of item 5.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Leader says the Turf Development Bill will be taken at 3 p.m., I presume if the other business has not concluded by then it will be taken at the end of other business this evening and that there is no question of truncating business.  Could the Leader confirm that on item 5 &mdash; Fianna Fáil Private Members' time &mdash; the format has been changed?  Finally, could the Leader indicate if any further business not indicated by the Whip is proposed to be taken between now and the end of session?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on yesterday's Order of Business, there will be many outstanding items of business at the end of this session.  At this afternoon's meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges the Leader of the House should outline whether committee work on this business should take place during the recess.</P>
      <P>The Government's tax revenue has increased beyond all expectation and there will be a huge amount of money in the Central Bank reserves when we join the euro next year.  At a time when there are cutbacks in many areas, particularly in education, the Government should indicate its plans for spending that money.  It should take a good look at its Programme for Government before making decisions and avoid being sucked into the Minister for Finance's proposals to eliminate this mythical national debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Leader on his juggling act in including so many items on the Order of Business.  However, one must be critical of the amount of business which has been put through the House in the last week.  We are certainly cramming the agenda.</P>
      <P>Item 5 is statements on duty free shopping post 1999.  Is this being taken in the context of the Labour Party motion, item 19, motion 4?  The Education Bill is currently with the Dáil.  It is an important Bill which was initiated by the last Government.  That Government spent a considerable amount of time preparing it but it has now been with the Dáil for 12 months.  I hope it will be dealt with quickly.  There are outstanding issues in education which must be dealt with, for example, Breaking the Cycle and the loss of teachers in both rural and urban areas.  These are serious matters which require a response from the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>While I am reluctant to seek a debate on this matter given the crowded agenda, will the Leader seek clarification from the Minister for Education and Science about this legislation and whether teachers will have jobs to return to in the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Leader of the House on managing to fit so much into the Order of Business.  However, it is unlikely that amendments by this House will be accepted since the Dáil is unlikely to sit after tomorrow.  In that context, I wish to congratulate my colleague, <Col N="527" /> Senator Henry.  An amendment she put down to the Parental Leave Bill was accepted in principle by the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who put down a similar amendment in the Dáil which was accepted.  I do not necessarily agree with the amendment but I congratulate Senator Henry on the manner in which she secured it.</P>
      <P>Last Monday the Singapore Government passed three laws which enabled the legal acceptance of electronic commerce.  The concept of this legislation is to enable Singapore to become the south-east Asian hub of developments in electronic commerce.  This is an issue to which we should give serious attention because a contract conducted through electronic means is not regarded as legal in this State.  Such a contract is now legal in Singapore.  I am not sure whether this issue is within the remit of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform or the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  It is probably the responsibility of the latter to seek this type of legislation while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform is responsible for putting it in place.  I ask the Leader of the House to draw the attention of these Ministers to the action taken by Singapore.  Singapore is now one of our commercial competitors and, if Ireland is to create jobs in the future, this is the type of legislation it must consider in the short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate on the taxi problem in Dublin city for the next session?  There is not enough time in this session but perhaps he would contact the Minister and urge her to do something about the problem during the recess.  A debate could be held in the Seanad early in the next session with a view to rectifying it.  The public deserves better than it is getting in this regard at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reluctant to raise this issue as it appears to be a criticism of the Chair.  However, Senator Norris's matter for debate on the Adjournment uses a term to describe the leader of a government, with which this country has diplomatic relations, which appears to set a precedent. If I described the leader of Israel as &ldquo;the fascist Netanyahu&rdquo;, Senator Norris would take great exception to it.  I do not have much sympathy for the government of Zimbabwe but to use the term used by Senator Norris invites all Members to increase the colour of their language in formal parliamentary statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Otherwise I, too, might take liberties. God knows what I might say about the Cathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>I enthusiastically endorse Senator O'Toole's comments about the extraordinary attitude of the Minister for Finance to the Government's increasing riches.  The most idiotic thing we could do at present is reduce the national debt.  There are crying needs in this country for infrastructural investment, particularly for housing.  There will be a cardboard city in Dublin of European proportions within the next two years if nothing is done.  The idea of paying off the national debt to keep somebody in Brussels or Frankfurt happy is insane.  It is time a debate began on what we should do with our riches.</P>
      <P>I hope the Leader will explain why item 1 will be taken without debate.  I have strong views about motions being taken without debate by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to two items on the Order Paper, item 16 and item 19 motion 7, which relate to MMDS and telephone masts.  In recent weeks there has been a great deal of controversy about these matters in local communities, particularly in County Donegal.  The Glenties local deflector system was forced off the air as a result of a High Court action while further action is anticipated against the Ardara local deflector group.  There was also controversy about a telephone mast on Achill Island during the week. When does the Leader expect to have the report of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport on the Director of Telecommunications Regulation before the House?</P>
      <P>I spoke to the director at a recent meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language.  After nearly a year of such discussions she appears to be hiding or holding back due to pending legal cases.  While it is the regulator's function to deal with regulation, it is the function of the Department of Public Enterprise to deal with legislation.  These problems have arisen due to poor legislation in the past.  When the Seanad last debated this matter, the Minister of State attended.  However, the Minister for Public Enterprise should come before the House to explain what legislative proposals she has in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the environment at the earliest opportunity? There is little evidence to suggest that environmental protection is being given the priority it needs and deserves.  It has taken two years to put the national litter plan in place, even though the last Dáil passed up-to-date legislation <Col N="529" /> on litter pollution.  That does not suggest a sense of urgency.  I will not list all the areas about which I am extremely concerned but there is no evidence of new ideas emanating from the Government to deal with the rapid deterioration in the quality of our water.  Last night there was another horrific fish kill.  The time has come &mdash; in fact it is overdue &mdash; to debate the green environment with a view to getting some impetus into measures to confront the rapid deterioration of our water quality and other elements of our environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to two types of regulations on today's Order Paper.  The first one deals with the licensing of road vehicles.  Can the Leader seek urgent action from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to deal with the backlog of licence applications from drivers which is resulting in people being unable to avail of work and holding up business?  Second, I welcome the introduction of the regulations and commencement order under the Decommissioning Act which was passed last year.  I urge all those who will have to co-operate with the international body to do so in the interest of progressing the implementation of the British-Irish Agreement.  This co-operation in accordance with the Agreement could help to place its current position on a firmer footing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Quill's call for a debate on our environment and on the policies the Government, particularly the Department of the Environment and Local Government, has to improve the quality and structure of our environment in the future.  A recent survey organised by the Fisheries Board indicated that the Munster waterways are the most polluted at the moment.  With all the development in this area this subject merits serious debate in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Bonner's call for a debate on telecommunications.  I wrote to the director of telecommunications, the regulator and to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, on this subject and on the poor quality of television transmission, particularly in the Mayo area.  I was not happy with the response I received.  It is up to the Minister with responsibility for telecommunications to resolve this problem and I call on her to do so urgently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support Senator Quill's call for a debate on the environment.  Members will recall that on two occasions I recently requested a debate on litter.  We are trying to promote tourism as a major industry and, to some extent, we have been successful, but the manner in which we are littering our countryside and public places is a matter of great concern.  I ask the Leader to arrange an early debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> Mobile telephone masts are causing concern in my county.  Recently almost 500 people attended a meeting on this matter in the Delvin area and another meeting was held in another part of County Westmeath.  This matter is causing widespread concern and I ask that it be addressed as a matter of urgency with a view to clearing up the real or imagined dangers.  There is a perception that these masts pose a danger to public health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support a call to reduce the backlog of driving tests for lorry drivers.  For the first time haulage companies had to keep some of their fleet off the road because they could not employ drivers.  Some employers have to employ English drivers.  Only recently extra inspectors and testers were appointed.  No more than any other services, the more we appoint the slower the service becomes.  An emergency system should be in place because industry will come to a halt without road hauliers.  These people transport our products to the continent and bring raw materials back.  If haulage companies cannot find drivers and their trucks are not in use, then our industrial life will come to a standstill.</P>

      <P>We have two extra pieces of legislation for tomorrow &mdash; it is proposed to take this legislation without debate, as happened in the Dáil &mdash; they are the Compatibility, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses Act, 1997&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will meet the Chief Whips immediately after the Order of Business this morning to discuss this to see if it is convenient for them to debate these issues tomorrow.  I only found out about them after 10 a.m.</P>
      <P>In relation to item 5, I assure Senator Manning that if this afternoon's business is not completed, it is proposed to resume business at the conclusion of item 6.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Toole's comments, I can confirm that there will be committees sitting throughout July.  It is envisaged committees will not sit in August so that Members will be able to take holidays.  I ask the press to take note that while the Houses are not sitting for July and part of September the committee system will be in action for all of July and almost all of September.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello referred to item 5.  Most of his motion 14 is being dealt with under this item. Senators Costello, O'Toole and others expressed concern about education.  I will pass on their comments, particularly those relating to the Government proposed Estimates for the forthcoming budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="531" /> Senator Quinn expressed concern about new technology.  We should have a debate on this issue and I will facilitate it early in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely voiced concern about extra taxi licences for the city of Dublin.  I will pass on his concerns to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I am sure he will welcome a Kerry Senator intervening in Dublin taxi matters.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan referred to item 1.  This was already debated in this House.  I know the Senator may not have been in attendance.  It is with the full agreement of the main Opposition parties that this proposal is before us this morning. Senator Doyle expressed his concerns about this yesterday morning.</P>
    <P>Senators Bonner and Burke referred to item 16.  I will facilitate a debate on this early in the next session.  Senators Quill, Chambers and Glynn requested a debate on the environment and related matters.  We can also have a debate on this matter in the early part of the next session.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senators Gallagher and Farrell on the licensing and test driving licences for truck or lorry drivers. There should be no excuse for this backlog and the system should be improved to meet demand.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 85, it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the meaning of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked upon as the report of the Dáil <Col N="532" /> amendments to the Seanad.  The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach mentioned, I intend to outline the purpose of the various amendments made in the other House since 16 June 1998 when the Seanad took Committee Stage of the Bill.  While some of the amendments are of a technical nature, others involve alterations to the operation of the scheme in response to comments made in the Oireachtas and other fora.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 1, although judged by the parliamentary draftsman not to be strictly necessary, was an Opposition amendment which I accepted. While this type of provision is more usually found where an EU directive is transposed under the European Communities Act, 1972, I consider its inclusion in the Bill would not cause a difficulty.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 2, Senators will note that I have amended section 6 to delete the phrase &ldquo;without pay&rdquo;.  In making this amendment, I emphatically state that I am not imposing any obligation on employers to provide paid parental leave.  I draw attention to section 14(1) which provides that an employee's employment rights, other than his or her right to remuneration or superannuation benefits or any obligation to pay contributions in or in respect of the employment, are protected during parental leave.  Lest there be any doubt, I am not making any commitment to or signalling any form of State benefit for persons on parental leave.</P>
      <P>The reason I made this change is that some concerns were voiced about whether the Bill might prevent an employer from paying for parental leave if he or she wished.  I do not wish to preclude this possibility or to pre-empt any negotiations on this issue in the future.  I am also conscious of the need to avoid compromising any future negotiations under Partnership 2000 and of the concerns which ICTU voiced in this regard.  I would not wish the outcome of such negotiations to be frustrated by any provision of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 clarifies the position about information to be furnished to the employer by the employee when an application for parental leave is submitted.  The previous text gave rise to privacy concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4, to 7, inclusive, to section 11 were introduced to define the scope of an employer's power to postpone parental leave. Where parental leave is postponed, the employer and employee must agree on a new start date for <Col N="533" /> the leave.  The amendments also ensure that an employer cannot repeatedly avail of the postponement clause.  A period of parental leave can only be postponed once or twice where the postponement is because of seasonal variations in volume of work.  Technical amendments were also made to section 11 in relation to postponed parental leave.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 to 10, inclusive, relate to section 12.  These amendments ensure that where parental leave is being terminated owing to its abuse, the procedures to be followed by the employer are consistent with the requirements of natural justice and fair procedures.  The amendments also address concerns about the status of an employee whose parental leave is terminated. Under the section as amended, the termination of the leave will not take effect until the date on which the employee is required to return to work. The employee will be either on parental leave or back at work, but not in any intermediate situation. The employee must be afforded one week in which to make representations about the termination of the leave and a further week's notice before he or she is required to return to work.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 11 to 13, inclusive, revise the procedures to be followed when an employee has taken <i>force majeure</i> leave.  The changes follow from further discussions I had with ICTU and IBEC.  Senator Henry may wish to note that the deletion of section 13(6) in amendment No. 13 means that the procedures do not now embody a need to obtain a medical certificate in respect of the family member who was ill or injured when <i>force majeure</i> leave was availed of by the employee.  Instead there will be a prescribed form on which the employee must make a statement of facts entitling him or her to <i>force majeure</i> leave.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 ensures that the Parental Leave Bill is consistent with other employment and equality legislation as regards the timescale for referral of a dispute to a rights commissioner.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 15 to 17, inclusive, are largely technical amendments to section 19. Amendment No. 15, made on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, was necessary because £150 is the existing amount of fine which this Bill proposes to increase to £1,500.  An earlier change from £20 to £150 took place in 1979.  Amendment No. 16 makes clear that the provision of this subsection deals with the situation of a person giving false evidence before the Employment Appeals Tribunal or in respect of any such proceedings before the tribunal relating to this section of the Parental Leave Bill.  Amendment No. 17, which was accepted on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman, makes clear that the penalty for giving false evidence before the Employment Appeals Tribunal shall, on conviction, be the penalty applicable to perjury.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 18 to 21, inclusive, are also technical amendments.  Their purpose is to confer <Col N="534" /> on the Employment Appeals Tribunal the same options that are available to a rights commissioner. Thus, when either the rights commissioner or the tribunal adjudicate on a dispute, each may direct the postponement, curtailment or variation of the parental leave under the terms of section 21(6) and (7).</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 22 enables the Employment Equality Agency to exercise the function of publicising parental leave by means of information leaflets, publicity campaigns, having information on the agency's Internet web site, etc.  Pending formal commencement of the Employment Equality Act, 1998, which became law on 18 June last, the agency will exercise this function in relation to parental leave on a non-statutory basis.</P>

      <P>Regarding amendment No. 2, which deletes the phrase &ldquo;without pay&rdquo;, I regret the suggestion by the Fine Gael Party of a doubling of child benefit was not included.  While the Bill is welcome, it will benefit the wealthy rather than the deserving.  Most of the amendments are sensible and welcome, but I regret that the Government could not find some way of including parents and families who do not have high incomes.  The purpose of the Bill is to allow parents spend time with their children at the most crucial period of their lives.  The doubling of child benefit was a very good suggestion and I regret the Minister did not take it up.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing amendment No. 13, which makes it unnecessary for those who take <i>force majeure</i> leave to get a doctor's certificate.  The medical profession is not enthusiastic about policing the social welfare system. It might also have led to difficulties with confidentiality because one would have had to get a certificate for a person other than the person taking the leave.</P>

      <P>I am not sure if Senator Ridge meant doubling child benefit for parents or for children whose parents take parental leave.  It would be discriminatory to use child benefit in that manner. Child benefit is provided for every child in the State whether the parent works or not and I would not be happy if it were doubled for children whose parents happen to work and have taken parental leave.  I am surprised Fine Gael is proposing we go in that direction.</P>
      <P>I have discussed unpaid parental leave in great detail with a number of people over the past number of weeks.  Parents will be very happy to be in a position to take parental leave without pay, particularly given the flexibility we have included in the Bill where parents can take this leave one day at a time, one day a week, two days a month and so on.  It is very easy to say such leave should be paid when one is in Opposition but it is not possible in the real world for the State or employers to finance such leave.</P>

I am disappointed the Minister has not seen fit to delete section 1, which states &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation on the 3rd day of December, 1998&rdquo;.

      <P>Everybody seemed to be making a slightly general statement before discussing the amendments.</P>
      <P>I am happy enough with the amendment which was made to section 8(6)(b).  However, the Bill is the second piece of legislation which places a statutory obligation on adoptive parents to disclose to a third party that their child is adopted, as required under section 8(6)(a).  There is no such statutory obligation on any person or body to inform the child that he or she is adopted.  Why is it necessary to draw attention to it and state in the Bill that the date of birth of the child and the date of the making of the adoption order must be disclosed?  Such situations can lead to a great deal of trouble and hardship.  It is unnecessary because it refers specifically to the adopted child.  Numerous people find out late in life that they were adopted and this could cause further embarrassment to such people.  I ask the Minister to refer to that in his remarks.</P>

      <P>I am delighted with amendment No. 2 to section 6, where the Minister has decided to delete the words &ldquo;without pay&rdquo;.  Many speakers in this and the other House, including the Government spokesperson, Senator Cox, made the criticism that there is no incentive for low income families, which might have the greatest need for parental leave, to avail of such leave. There was a clear tone and implication in the responses of the Minister and the Minister of State that they were lining up with that sector which would only agree to this Bill if no pay requirement was placed on employers.</P>
      <P>I appreciate there is no pay requirement in relation to the State, which is why my party proposed an amendment whereby the Government might introduce an incentive by doubling child benefit during the period of parental leave.  It would be a very small incentive because the present rates of child benefit would not make anyone rich, even if they were doubled.</P>
      <P>It would not break the State to double child benefit for the period of parental leave.  There is great boasting nowadays about how much we will overshoot our revenue targets in the current year's budget.  We all believe in rectitude and so on, but spending all that surplus on wiping out the national debt is not good enough.  There are many social areas which need attention.

      <P>I thank Senators for their co-operation in processing this legislation.  I was happy to accept some amendments proposed by Senators when the Bill was initiated in this House, as well as taking on board suggestions from several Senators for other amendments.  When the Bill was considered by the other House last week some further refinements were teased out.  The final result is the Bill before us today.</P>
      <P>The viewpoints put forward by Senators during debates on the passage of the Bill did not focus on its bare contents.  Instead, it ranged widely over the challenges and problems faced by Irish parents today in seeking to reconcile their home and work responsibilities.  I found Senators' contributions interesting and informative.</P>
      <P>This is pioneering legislation and represents a significant evolution in Irish working conditions; to that extent it is a historic Bill in that it recognises the changes that have taken place in the Irish workforce and that nothing will be the same again.  It also reflects the Government's policy of providing equal opportunities for men and women.  Accordingly, this is an equal opportunities Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great interest has been expressed in the Bill throughout the country, not just in the Oireachtas.  I know that its commencement on 3 December is being looked forward to eagerly by men and women in the workforce, and employers and employees have several months to prepare <Col N="538" /> themselves for the Act to come into operation. Parts of the Bill necessitate the making of Ministerial regulations in relation to several procedural aspects of the legislation.  The Bill contains provisions for employer and employee interests to be consulted on the preparation of statutory instruments. I am confident that there will be a continuation of the helpful discussions that have taken place between my Department and the representatives of IBEC and ICTU in developing the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say now where this legislation will lead us to, but we can be absolutely sure that there will be further progression in Irish labour law following the introduction of this measure. Few people could have envisaged this Bill even ten years ago, therefore it would be a foolish man or woman who would predict how this legislation will evolve over the next decade.  As society evolves, so will legislation such as this.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have had the opportunity of putting this significant legislation in place.  I thank Senators for their valuable contributions and I thank my officials, who worked so hard on this legislation.</P>

However, section 8 is still grievously flawed in that it makes a distinction regarding the adoptive child and the information to be revealed without confidentiality being assured.  The same is not required of a birth parent, and this is a serious matter.  It further compounds attitudes towards adoptive children.  I am glad the Minister has taken the final section of the Employment Equality Act on board, but he has changed the intention of our original amendment.  We wanted to provide the public with knowledge and awareness of their entitlements under the Act; there is now a provision to give information on the workings of the Act, which is not the same thing. However, I am happy to see this Bill enacted and hope it is taken up so that we do not have a situation whereby parents cannot avail of it through lack of funding.  I hope this will be a boon to Irish parents everywhere.</P>

I agree with the Minister that this is one of the most significant steps taken since the removal of the barrier to women's equal access to working life.  It also promotes the equality agenda for men, and the recognition that men have as much of a role as women in bringing up children which is vitally important.  I commend the Minister and his officials.  Being involved with this legislation is one of my proudest moments since becoming a Senator.  I look forward to reviewing this Bill in the future and I also look forward to more legislation that recognises children as our most vital asset.

It is enriching to hear such diverse opinions; while one is convinced one is always right, one must dilute one's aspirations on occasion.  This Bill is a great step forward, but it has a long way to go.  I accept we live in an imperfect world, but it is a step in the right direction. I look forward to its being further amended as attitudes to family and parenthood progress.  I compliment the Minister on his work in this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank colleagues for their contributions. However, regarding Senator Costello's point, I have experience of the adoption situation, and currently attitudes appear to be very open. Adopted children are informed at the earliest possible age in order to prevent people being shocked at 19 or 20 to find out that they are adopted.  That is very important.  I had the experience of going to Romania where one of my sisters adopted children.  Parents are open about adoption and children are aware of being adopted from a very early age.  This is the proper approach.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (2), line 32, after &ldquo;representative&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and shall in particular include at least 8 persons representative of consumers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment is self explanatory.  It relates to the section on the consultative council and seeks to include on the council at least eight persons representative of consumers.  It makes a very important point in the context of the legislation and establishes a principle which, I am sure the Minister agrees, should be taken on board, particularly in relation to the Food Safety Authority. The views of consumers should be heard and represented in its structures.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the authority is a very welcome and positive landmark and our amendments are designed to ensure greater public confidence in its operation.  I know the Minister agrees that total confidence on the part of the public in the authority is extremely important.  The importance of confidence in the quality of our food cannot be overestimated in terms of marketing our food at home and abroad.  A large section of our economy relies on the quality of Irish produce sold here and exported.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the amendment, to agree to the importance of including consumers in the legislation in a way that not just pays lip service to the notion of taking their views on board and to include consumers on the consultative council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's comments. The Bill must be seen to be about consumers. The fact they are not mentioned in the subsection in the context of membership of the council is very serious.  The Bill should be given the importance it deserves.  I am delighted it has been brought forward and it should provide for a sizeable body of consumers on the council.  The Minister has stressed that consumers will be put on the council, but it would be wise to include such provision in the legislation.  Too frequently producers take over such bodies as they have enormous interests and are very well organised. In other countries we have seen what can happen where food safety legislation is too easily influenced by producers.</P>
      <P>It is essential that consumers are seen to have a strong voice in the legislation, something Senator O'Meara's amendment would allow for.  Nobody is asking for consumers to have a majority voice on the council.  However, giving them one third of the seats would make a big difference.</P>

      <P>I am not prepared to accept the amendment.  A number of amendments were put forward on the composition of the consultative council during discussion of the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil.  The Government undertook to again examine the issue and, having done so, agreed to increase the number of ministerial appointments from six to 12 and provide for one nominee of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and one of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  These are in addition to two nominees of the Minister for Agriculture and Food and one nominee of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources provided for in the original draft Bill.  Apart from these nominees, the Minister for Health and Children will make seven appointments while the board will nominate the remaining 12.</P>
      <P>As the consultative council will provide the authority with a consultative forum, it is essential it be as representative as possible.  Having looked at the board's appointees and the nominations of other Ministers, the Minister will use his seven appointments to ensure a proper balance in representation. For this reason the section should not be prescriptive as to the groups covered by ministerial appointments.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara that this is a landmark Bill and that the safety of food is of utmost important to the country.  The issue is central to our economy as we export up to 90 per cent of our produce.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry said it would be wise to include such provision in the legislation.  However, section 12(4) states &ldquo;for the purpose of promoting higher standards, the Authority shall endeavour to consult representatives of consumers, producers, retailers, distributors, caterers and manufacturers and, where appropriate, official agencies about the activities or other measures to be undertaken.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="542" /> As Senator Fitzpatrick pointed out, we are all consumers and it is in our own interest to have the highest standards.  The 24 members of the consultative council, regardless of who they are, will be consumers in one way or another.  Senator Burke also mentioned that fact and agreed with Senator O'Meara.  As I pointed out, we went through this during Committee Stage in the Dáil and this was the type of scenario with which we came up.  The board will be representative of the consumer.  The consumer will be king or queen as regards the Food Safety Authority Bill, 1998.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State outlined the appointments which will be made to the consultative council and the additional appointments agreed when the Bill passed through the Dáil.  I am sure he will agree Members of this House are entitled to express their views on the Bill and the amendments.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not refer to the interests of the consumer.  The Minister of State said the appointees would be consumers, but that does not go far enough.  As Senator Henry said, this issue is about the consumer.  Unfortunately, for too long and for obvious reasons, such as our agriculturally based economy, the interests of the producers and those selling food have been to the fore.  Those interests have been the first to be heard and responded to.  Unless we state in legislation that the voice of the consumer shall be heard, it will not be.  It is not sufficient to say we are all consumers because that does not mean we will be heard, although I hope we, as legislators, are heard.</P>
      <P>When I go into a supermarket I am a consumer and unless I am represented on this representative council by people who are appointed purely to represent me and other consumers, there is no guarantee the voice and concerns of the consumer will be heard.  The voice of the consumer must be paramount and to the fore.  I am disappointed with the Minister of State's response.  He said appointments will be made by Ministers and the Minister will have total discretion in terms of who to appoint.  However, the legislation does not state that the Minister, in making those appointments, must take the consumers' point of view into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We may be consumers, but I wish the Minister of State was in the House yesterday for the motion on Bovine Diseases (Levies) Regulations to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, a farmer, talk about the need to police the producers more rigorously when discussing the level of tuberculosis and brucellosis, of which this Minister of State would be well aware.  There has been little reduction in these diseases in some counties for a long time.  The producers, retailers, distributors, caterers and manufacturers are better organised than consumers, <Col N="543" /> who are much more disparate and are represented by one organisation only.  It would be worthwhile trying to ensure seats are kept for them.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Ministers who will be in a position to nominate to the council. Apart from the Minister for Health and Children, I have grave doubts that any will nominate consumers as all seem to be from the producers side of the fence.</P>

      <P>A problem I have is how does one define a consumer.  Should these eight people come from the Consumers' Association of Ireland?  Should it be the nominating body? Another problem I have, which is more fundamental, is that we live in a democracy and whatever Government is elected represents the feelings of the people at that point.  The Government should be given as free a hand as possible to nominate the people it believes are best suited to whatever board to which it has nominating powers. That is a fundamental principle of democracy. If we try to tie a Minister's or a Government's hand, we are creating a democratic deficit.</P>

Producers know we need the correct standards and it is in their interests to achieve the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultative council will provide the authority with a consultative forum.  It is essential that it is as representative as possible because that is only fair.  There will be 12 nominees to the board. Naturally, it will be in the board's interest to ensure good representation from those concerned with the consumers' interests.  That is the reason this Bill was introduced.  The consumer was clamouring for such legislation.  When discussing the issue previously we said Senator Quinn was the first person to recognise this need.  He is a retailer but recognised the direction in which the food <Col N="544" /> area was going.  He set about ensuring that the consumer knew about quality, traceability and safety.  This legislation deals primarily with safety; but, as one can see, the consumer is coming more to the fore all the time.  There are sufficient safeguards to ensure the consumer will be consulted.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (7), line 7, to delete &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  The Bill states the authority may publish the opinions of the council and the amendment proposes to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  This is an important amendment because there is an enormous difference between the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  One could say the Minister of State may be in the House tomorrow rather than he shall be; there is a huge difference in emphasis.  We are trying to ensure the views of the council are made available to the public and are published.</P>
      <P>We discussed the representative nature of the consultative council.  The Minister of State is of the view that it is broad based.  I hope consumers are well represented, especially with regard to the appointments to be made by the Minister for Health and Children and by the board.  It is very important that the opinions of the council be published and that the legislation sends a strong signal in that regard.</P>
      <P>Section 14(7) states: &ldquo;The Authority may publish the opinions of the Council&rdquo;.  This provision is too weak.  If we are of the opinion that the council is an important body and that the views of the council are important, especially to the wider authority, it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for this legislation to represent that view.  In doing so, it should provide that the authority shall publish the opinions of the council.</P>

      <P>This amendment was proposed and rejected in the Dáil.  I accept Senator O'Meara's point that the Seanad does not necessarily have to accept what happens there.  However, I <Col N="545" /> am unable to accept this amendment.  It seeks to substitute the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for &ldquo;may&rdquo; with regard to the publication of reports and opinions.  Such an amendment, if accepted, would serve only to undermine the independence of the authority.  It is envisaged that the consultative council will provide opinions on a broad range of issues.  It is also expected the authority will act in a sufficiently responsible and transparent way to ensure that all opinions of the council important from a food safety and public health point of view are published. The authority must be free to give appropriate responses to the opinions it receives and it is essential that the ultimate message it delivers to the public is not clouded by a multiplicity of mandatory reports.</P>
      <P>I do not agree the provision in the Bill weakens the position.  We do not wish to be too prescriptive. It is important that sufficient room be left for the authority to take on board what is important. Many matters may be discussed.  Some may not be as important as others.  We do not wish to undermine the authority, but wish to leave it with a certain latitude and freedom to recognise what is and what may not be important.  Not every discussion or proposal may be worthy of circulation.</P>

      <P>I accept that point.  However, the provision encourages secrecy, which is endemic in the culture of our State institutions.  This will only change under specific direction.  It may emerge in the public domain that the consultative council expressed an opinion on a matter of major public concern.  The media would then demand the publication of this opinion, which may be acceded to under protest.  However, if everything is in the public domain as a matter of course that would not arise, nor would the question of leaks.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the Food Safety Authority and in food safety is a huge matter of public interest and concern for many reasons, including health and economic.  If food safety issues arise in beef, chicken, eggs and so on and it transpires that the council had given an opinion which was not published, there would be an immediate demand for its publication.  The failure to publish at the outset would also make it appear that attempts were made to conceal information.  This would send the wrong signals and would undermine the basic principles the legislation seeks to establish, including public confidence and a relationship of confidence between the Food Safety Authority and all the bodies that relate to it.</P>

      <P>It is not feasible to publicise all information on these issues at once.  The scientific committee is one of the most important committees to be associated with the authority.  Many issues may be discussed by the consultative council which may not be important and may not be scientific but which provide the opportunity for people to express their views.  For example, hear-say could be considered.  The most important <Col N="546" /> thing regarding food safety is the science aspect. The authority will be wise enough to take on board what is important and not to publish reports that would not stand up to critical analysis.</P>

      <P>This section, which sets out the composition and appointment procedures for the proposed board of the authority, was debated at length in the Dáil.

What is the thinking behind this?</P>
      <P>Previous legislation setting up various bodies has been passed in this House and various categories, interest groups and areas of expertise have been set out in general terms.

I followed the debate in the Dáil and I am aware of the answers given there in regard to having a wide pool of talent available and ensuring various groups are represented.  What criteria will be used for selecting people for appointment to the board?  Will any provision be made, as exists in semi-State companies, for the election of members of staff to the board of the authority?

Members of the board must be cognisant of the consumer's importance.  That forms the background to the Bill.  The consumer will be consulted.  We are talking primarily about food safety.  Consumers may have other interests in food quality in regard to taste, appearance and so on, but the issue of safety is of paramount importance as far as the Bill is concerned.  The people appointed to the board will be under no illusions whatsoever as to their remit and will be selected sensitively.</P>

It is possible to obtain a range of opinion in the science area; indeed, it is possible to get experts and scientists to say almost anything nowadays.

      <P>In page 19, subsection (4), line 27, to delete &ldquo;Minister following consultations with the&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated earlier that the scientific committee is one of the most important elements of the Bill.  The fact the scientific committee is appointed by the Minister diminishes its independence. It would be wiser to allow the authority appoint the committee.  It does not show much confidence in the authority not to allow it appoint its own scientific committee.  The committee must be seen to be independent.  If there was any question that its members were the Minister's pet poodles, it would spell the end for the committee. The Bill does not provide any scope for the Minister to consult with the Science Council, the food economics unit in UCC or any other relevant body.  The Minister will have complete responsibility for the committee.</P>
      <P>Sadly, we have experienced problems in the past where Ministers made appointments to boards, some of which were tainted with suspicion. The first item on today's Order Paper is the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, which will increase the number of members of An Bord Pleanála.  Senator Ryan pointed out that, given the problems experienced in regard to appointments to the board, it might have been wiser to debate the issue.  We are now sanctioning another board to which ministerial appointments will be made.  I would have thought it would have been wiser for members of the scientific committee to be appointed by the authority, given the responsibility it will have.</P>
      <P>If you are going to give the authority real power and independence, let them make the nominations to the scientific committee.  This committee will not only be looked upon from a national point of view, it will be important on the international stage.  One of the valuable aspects of this legislation is that it will cover national and international food suppliers, unlike in the past when there was one set of regulations for supply on the home market and another for produce which was sent abroad.</P>

We saw that during the debacle with the Blood Transfusion Service <Col N="550" /> Board; it was the Minister for Health of the day who was answerable.  The same would happen here regardless of the way appointments to the committee were arranged.  In the eyes of the public the responsibility would lie with the Department and the Minister of the day.

      <P>I am not prepared to accept this amendment regardless of the cogent arguments which have been put forward.  It is envisaged that the principles of openness and transparency will be key factors in the operation of the Food Safety Authority.  It is not appropriate that the board of the authority should have sole responsibility for the appointment of the body from whom it will receive scientific advice.</P>
      <P>This does not mean the Minister does not trust the board, as was suggested here last week, but rather that he wishes to guarantee the independence of the scientific committee.  The consultative process provided for in the Bill ensures that the board will have an input on appointments but will not be in a position to exert undue influence. This provision ensures that the independence of the scientific committee is not compromised.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the role of the scientific committee in ensuring the credibility of the authority.  The question of consumers' perception is fundamental to the issue of food safety.  It is important, therefore, that the board of the authority is seen not to exert undue influence over those from whom it receives its scientific advice.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Health and Children will be responsible to the Oireachtas for the activities of the Food Safety Authority, it is only fair and reasonable that he should have the final say in the make up of these bodies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is designed to ensure that the advice which is furnished by the scientific committee to the board would also go to the consultative committee and that the legislation reflects our desire that there be communication between the scientific and consultative committees.  This would be important because the scientific committee, as set out in the legislation, has a central role.  The consultative committee would be dependent on the opinions of the scientific committee <Col N="551" /> before it would make decisions on many issues.  It is important that the legislation reflects that and ensure that all elements of the wider authority &mdash; the board of the authority, the consultative committee and the scientific committee &mdash; work together and communicate with each other.  The legislation should reflect that we consider it important that that happens.</P>
    <P>When we finish here the Bill, as amended, is all that is left.  It is the legislation which will determine how this agency works.  We have all said how important it is that the authority works as well as possible.  The object of the amendment is to ensure that happens.  I ask the Minister to note the language in the amendment &mdash;&ldquo;may&rdquo; and not &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  It is our desire that this happens and we are not making it compulsory.  It is our wish that the culture of this organisation would be one where communication is good.  That is the best way to ensure the authority works well and has the full confidence of the public.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that the chief executive officer will be excluded from the main board and the boards of the scientific committee and any sub-committees. The Department of Health and Children has a lack of confidence in the chief executive officers appointed.  It is the only Department <Col N="552" /> which does not appoint chief executive officers to boards.  The chief executive officer was not appointed to the Medicines Board.  Last week we debated the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill and it made provision to appoint the chief executive officer to the board.  Senator Quinn tells me the chief executive officer is on the board of virtually every semi-State body.  It is the modern practice to appoint chief executive officers to boards and it would be wise to show confidence in the chief executive officer.</P>
    <P>The gentleman appointed is doing an excellent job and we can only hope that his successors will be as good.  It is essential that the chief executive officer is on the board.  I cannot understand why it has been decided to keep the chief executive officer off the board.  This is a downgrading of his position and apparently is contrary to best management practice.  This happens in the private and public sectors and I would like to know why the Minister of State considers it best to keep the chief executive officer off the board?  Arguments that this will make him seem more independent or less under the wing of the authority are not convincing as they do not rely on whether or not he is on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry is correct.  I know of no health board which has a chief executive officer as a member.  The chief executive officer attends board meetings but is not a voting member.  I have an open mind as to whether this is a good idea.  However, all boards which deal with the public interest or consumer affairs, such as health boards, are highly political.  It may be a good idea that there is a clear separation between the political responsibility of the board to fulfil its public function, the chief executive officer's responsibilities to carry out the board's instructions and the Department.  Senator Henry will remember that the then proposed chief executive officer of the board said at a subcommittee meeting that we are not dealing with rocket science but public health.</P>

I have been a member of a health board for many years and it would be ludicrous to have a chief executive officer who has an administrative-executive position taking policy decisions.  There should be a clear separation of roles.  It would not be correct if a county manager had the power to elect the chairman of a county council.  I subscribe to the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>I cannot accept this amendment. The role of the chief executive within the authority is, as the title suggests, an executive role with certain defined statutory functions, such as the serving of closure orders, section 53, and prohibition orders, section 54.  The Bill provides that the chief executive may attend meetings of the <Col N="553" /> board, the scientific committee and its subcommittee and may speak at and offer advice at such meetings.  The right to attend meetings of the board and the scientific committee ensures that the chief executive is central to the decision making process of the authority yet enables him or her to retain autonomy so that his or her statutory functions can be independently discharged.</P>
      <P>In order to create and maintain his or her independence within the authority, it is essential that the chief executive is seen to be at one remove from the board and the scientific committee, particularly in the area of scientific advice, where the two bodies concerned may not always be in agreement.  This is a situation which pertains and works to the satisfaction of all concerned in the Irish Medicines Board.</P>

      <P>I hope not.  I am disappointed that the Minister of State is not accepting this amendment, as Senator Quinn had hoped.  I hope that Senators Fitzpatrick and Glynn are not right when they say that this board will be the same as a health board.  That would be terrible and quite different to what one imagines as an independent board giving advice on one of the most serious issues, both nationally and internationally and from a health and economic point of view.  It is essential that the board is seen to be independent. It would be terrible if it was seen to be a political institution.  I am very worried by the remarks made in the House.  I am sorry that the amendment is not being accepted and Senator Quinn will be very disappointed.  In view of the work he has put into the food industry, semi-State and educational bodies, this is particularly disappointing as he has vast experience in these areas which other Senators do not have.  Senator Quinn's words must be looked at carefully.</P>

      <P>I make no apology for saying that every board appointed by every Minister has been a political board and long may that continue. I believe in the supremacy of the democratic right of Governments to make appointments. This board will be no different to any other board in that respect.</P>
      <P>I can understand the motivation behind Senator Quinn's amendment.  However, without being in any way derogatory, he is approaching this issue from a commercial stance.  His track record is second to none in that area.  From a commercial viewpoint there are good reasons as to why the chief executive officer should be a member of the board of whatever company he or she runs.  However, in public bodies such as health boards and safety authorities, there has to be a clear division between the political and administrative functions.  Making a chief executive officer a voting member of a board would be wrong.  There is nothing to recommend that approach in public life.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">

      <P>I too make no apologies for my comments.  I have been a member of a local authority for almost 20 years and of a health board for the past 18 years.  Senator Fitzpatrick is correct in stating that there is a clear difference between the private and public sectors.  Appointing a chief executive officer to a board may be advisable in the private sector; however, a line must be drawn in the public sector where there is the issue of accountability.  It would be ludicrous if the chief executive officer of a health board or the Food Safety Authority was in a position to elect the chairman or take decisions other than administrative decisions.  It is an administrative position and should remain so.  Administrative matters are the reserve of the chief executive officer and he or she has the final say in the context of that role. However, policy matters are the reserve of board members.  Someone must be accountable and who better than someone elected by the public &mdash; the Minister.  That is common sense in action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be the judge of this.  This issue will certainly generate a great deal of controversy.  It can be argued either way. Senator Henry pointed out that the practice in the private sector is that the chief executive officer is a member of the board.  However, the Irish Medicines Board is working well.  Any problem people have had with governmental boards has been that the chief executive officer did not act quickly enough in making decisions.  Sometimes people cannot wait for boards to make decisions before they take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the chief executive is seen to be at a remove from the board and the scientific committee in this area.  Advice will come from both the scientific committee and the board and this may differ slightly.  A judgment must be <Col N="555" /> made so it is important to have someone who can act in an independent fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the arguments of Senators Glynn and Fitzpatrick about why the chief executive officer should not be on the board are followed up, we should recall the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill and remove the chief executive officer from that board.  That legislation stated that the chief executive officer should be on the board.  We argued in favour of it last week and against it this week.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed to hear that appointments will be made on a political rather than a merit basis.  It will be a serious deficit in the appointment of the board and the scientific committee if that is how it will be done.  Appointments to boards such as these should be not be political.  The best people in the country should be appointed to them.</P>

      <P>I wish to turn the argument slightly.  If Senator Henry were Minister for Health and Children, I do not believe she would accept this amendment.  She would also be extremely upset by the argument which implies that Ministers act from ulterior motives, behind closed doors and with no public interest in mind. To make that insinuation about any Minister, regardless of the party to which they belong, lowers political debate.  If we allow such arguments to go unchallenged, it is not surprising such a poor view is taken of the political process.</P>

      <P>I wish to correct Senator Henry when she said appointments would not be made on merit.  They will be and it would be foolish for any Minister not to appoint the proper people to any board.  As my two colleagues have said, we must have faith in the political process.  We are elected.  Many people appointed to boards are not as accountable as elected representatives, especially Ministers, with whom the buck stops. We have seen this full well in many other situations. I do not accept the argument that they will not be appointed on merit.  Regarding the board and the scientific committee, the Senator may rest assured that merit will be the first criterion in any appointment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is that the Department of Health and Children appears to be the only one which does not display confidence in its chief executive officers by putting them on boards.  I do not believe I have been given a good argument as to why it is the only Department which does not do so.  Other Departments do it and it seems that, for them, these people are suitable for appointment <Col N="556" /> to boards.  The Department of Health and Children is the one with which I would be most involved.  There are excellent people in the position of chief executive officer so I find it difficult to understand why, if chief executive officers are suitable for appointment to boards in other Departments, the Department of Health and Children has decided they are not.  I will not press the amendment because it will not be accepted. Were it pressed to a vote, we would lose.</P>

      <b>Mr. Gallagher:</b> This section deals with the appointment of staff by the board and the transfer of existing staff covered by other relevant sections.

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <P>It is difficult to say because some are employed on a contractual basis and it may differ from sector to sector, such as agriculture, marine, etc.  I could not say all staff, but in the final analysis the contract basis should be phased out and the staff would be transferred to the new authority.  I cannot give a timescale for that but it is what is envisaged in the long term.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to delete section 40(1)(d) and (e) in which members of a health board or of a local authority, be it an urban district, corporation or county council, are precluded from being on the board or, if they become members, are obliged to resign from the board. This is a terrible decision.  Other legislation has provided that members of local authorities cannot be appointed to certain boards but this legislation provides that members of the authority cannot be a member of a health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of health boards come from all sections of society and include doctors, nurses and lawyers.  It would be a miscarriage of justice to include subparagraphs (d) and (e) of section 40(1).  They should be deleted.  The Minister does <Col N="558" /> not have to appoint them as members of the authority and he can omit anybody who becomes a member of a local authority or health board, but a member of the Food Safety Authority should not have to resign on being elected by the people. Under this section, if the people decide to elect a person who happens to be a member of this board to a local authority, he or she must automatically resign from the board.</P>
    <P>There are about 4,000 members of health boards and local authorities.  They are precluded from membership of this board and if they are members of the board they must resign on being elected to a local authority.  The Minister nominates people to health boards and by so nominating them he precludes them from membership of the board of the Food Safety Authority.  The Minister of State should seriously reconsider these provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>All nominees to these boards are political nominations.  However, the impression is being given that anybody who is involved in politics, regardless of whether it is at local or national level, should not be involved in any other areas.</P>
      <P>Like other Senators, I have been in public life for many years and I have been a member of many boards.  However, political recognition for public representatives is now not being given in areas outside politics.  The experience politicians have gained over many years in public life is also not being recognised.  One gains a great deal of experience from membership of various boards and authorities.  We are prepared to give recognition to chief executive officers at national level in the case of health boards where chief executive officers have been appointed to the board of the National Health Authority.</P>
      <P>However, this section provides that any person who is a member of the Food Safety Authority and who becomes a member of a health authority can no longer be a member of this authority.  That is a serious development.  It begs the question as to whether one should become a member of this board or give one's services to a health authority as one cannot do both.</P>
      <P>I accept there is political bias in local authorities and in the Houses of the Oireachtas. However, there is a different situation in the health boards.  Will we get the best from people if we tell them that if they are nominated by a relevant authority or association to a health authority, they cannot be members of the Food Safety Authority board?  That is not fair to the person who secures such a nomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two most famous words in politics are &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, the Minister may or shall. The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be used in this section. It is important not only for the reasons I have mentioned but also for the Minister.  The Minister should have that authority and should not lose the benefit of a person because the person has <Col N="559" /> been nominated to another body.  That is particularly relevant in the case of a health board.  If a person becomes a member of a health board, he or she should not lose his or her membership of the Food Safety Authority board.  That is not the way to get the best from people.  In addition, people get experience from participation on health boards.  Health and healthy food are extremely important and a board member should not have to choose one or the other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>A good argument has been made on this issue.  The section does not cast a slur on elected representatives to either body.  The provisions are included on legal advice probably because health boards and local authorities might be contracting agencies.  I would not object to the Senators' arguments in other situations but that is the basis for the inclusion of these provisions in this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take on board the point made by the Minister about the conflict of interest regarding contractual business with the health and local authorities.  It is possible however we could have a farcical situation where a county manager or a chief executive of a health board appointed by the Minister could sit on this board where all those contracts are made, but a publicly elected person, a local authority member or a member of the health board cannot be appointed.  I cannot accept the Minister's viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last Government accepted an amendment here which referred to local authority members being appointed to the board of the Dublin Port Authority.  The point has been made that the Minister does not have to appoint a member of <Col N="560" /> the local authority or health board to any of those authorities.  But the previous Government did accept an amendment whereby a local authority member could be accepted.  Again, I ask the Minister to delete section 40(c) and (d) because of their reference to elected members of a local authority or health board.  I cannot see a conflict of interest if they are appointed by the Minister or elected to the health board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, a general impression has been created by several Governments that public representatives at either national or local level should only be involved with one authority.  The previous Government reversed this position because we made a very strong argument with regard local authority members in particular.  The board of Bord Gáis now consists of local authority members, something which was not possible in the past.  The board are answerable to people at levels relevant to authority members, particularly in the Cork region.  For example, a former Lord Mayor of Cork is now a member of its board.  That broke the mould as regards public representatives being appointed to the boards of national authorities. The late Councillor John Carroll was a member of the board of the national Health Authority which was as a result of arguments made by public representatives on behalf of local authority members.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke mentioned section 34 in regard to who can be nominated by Ministers.  The Minister can make 12 appointments under this Bill. There is a danger that you can give the impression that you are biased against public representatives. I do not want to be seen in such light.  But because a person is appointed a member of a health board, we should not lose the benefit of their experience and ability.  There are some organisations which insist on dismissing people when they become members of a health board.  Consideration should be given to this by the Minister.  If a person becomes an employee of a health board or involved directly or indirectly in regard to contract work, that can lead to a very dangerous situation.  Senator O'Meara raised this point about using the words &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo;. This can be a compromising situation.</P>
      <P>There will also be a contradiction in terms between one Minister and another because, under section 34, relevant Ministers can make nominations.  Will we be able to get the best people to stand for office at local government level if they cannot get recognition elsewhere? Will we be able to entice professional people to stand for public office?  These people will not be asked to represent local authorities at national board levels.  This situation has gone on for far too long and we should not allow it to continue.</P>

      <P>I support most of the sentiments expressed by Senator Burke and Senator Cregan. People who wish to enter public life in a voluntary capacity should be encouraged and not punished as proposed in the legislation.  The Minister, the Government and particularly the civil servants should take note that such provisions will not be considered lightly in the future.</P>
      <P>Local authority representatives do not appear to be popular with anybody.  The Government and all political parties appreciate the effort made by local public representatives on behalf of the people.  County councillors are the salt of the earth in terms of the voluntary contribution of their time, effort and expertise to making Ireland a better place for the underprivileged and all those they represent.  It is a disgraceful suggestion that people should be debarred from membership of the board of the authority because of their membership of a local authority.</P>
      <P>We have the Leader programme, the enterprise boards and other splinter groups organised and appointed by various Governments but only the local representatives are answerable to the people.  Senators and Deputies must ask the public to re-elect us on our record in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is the strength of appointing public representatives to many bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A conscious decision was taken many years ago to debar Senators and Deputies from membership of various boards.  Since time is of the essence and our job is legislating.  I agree with that decision.  However, if a person serves on a local authority and has made a major contribution in their field, there is no reason he or she should be debarred from membership of a board. Why should a doctor or a nurse be debarred from membership of this board?  They are experts in this field.  Will people who are not experts and <Col N="562" /> who have no experience making decisions on expenditure of taxpayers' money be appointed? That is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>We must take account of the advice of the Attorney General regarding a conflict of interest. That aspect must be sacrosanct when it comes to decisions on the expenditure of taxpayers' money.  The Minister's comments must be accepted in that regard.  However, Ministers and their officials should think carefully before introducing legislation in the Seanad in the future which debars local authority representatives from membership of boards.  I speak for all Members in that regard.</P>
    <P>Many Senators are elected directly by local authority members.  They are wise men and women elected by the people in their areas.  They make a voluntary contribution in the majority of cases and this is not recognised by the public or the media.  Local authority members are extremely generous with their time in contributing towards better communities.  The extent of their voluntary commitment to the people and their communities is unimaginable.</P>
    <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Senator Burke and Senator Cregan but I ask them to withdraw their objections.  They will receive full support from me as Leader of the House and the Government side in the future for their views.</P>

      <P>I can claim some credit for the amendment to which Senator Cassidy referred. At that time I made the point that people should not be excluded by virtue of their membership of a local authority or other local body.  This has become a standard provision in legislation.  It was contained in three Bills in recent weeks, including the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill which was introduced by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I made the point then that, as a general principle, people should not be excluded from boards by virtue of their membership of a local authority, a health board or the European Parliament.  In the context of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Bill, I accepted that members of local authorities should not be on the board of that body because there is a potential fundamental conflict of interest.  The body will deal with the allocation of industry and jobs to particular areas and there is potential for difficulty. However, I do not understand the difficulty in this Bill.  It is retrograde that it has become a standard provision in legislation.</P>

      <P>Much expertise, knowledge and wisdom are available on a voluntary basis from people who are members of local authorities. Section 41 contains a provision regarding declarations of interest.  If people are nominated to the board, there is an obligation on them to declare <Col N="563" /> any interest which might be associated with their membership.  This is a safeguard.</P>
      <P>We have reached a point where political correctness is excluding people who have a contribution to make.  One wonders why people would bother to put themselves forward for election to local authorities or other local bodies&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if, by virtue of that public service, they are excluded.  Interest groups have been given statutory positions on boards &mdash; for example, in the Bord Bia Bill.  I accept farmers and consumers should have a role in that board, but if interest groups are allowed under law to have places on boards, members of local authorities should also be allowed to be members of boards.  This principle should be taken on board at some level by the people who draft Bills.</P>

      <P>I support the comments of the previous speakers.  When the county enterprise boards were first set up, members of local authorities were excluded.  A change was then introduced which allowed a certain number to become members of boards.  As a member of an enterprise board I find that when a difficulty arises which requires local knowledge, the members of the enterprise board from the business, community and trade union sectors always look to the local authority members for advice and guidance because they are in touch with the situation on the ground.</P>
      <P>I agree thoroughly with the points made by other speakers.  This provision has crept in under various Governments in recent years and appears now to be standard.  I welcome the comments of Senator Burke and Senator Cregan and I particularly welcome the marker put down by the Leader on this matter.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for almost 20 years and I was nominated to the Seanad by a local authority organisation &mdash; the Association of Municipal Authorities of Ireland which I am proud to represent.  The approach of successive Governments and particularly Departments appears to be that local authority members have nothing to offer.  The media never miss an opportunity to bash local authority members.  They must consider them as some type of alien life form.</P>
      <P>I have been a member of a local authority for almost 20 years.  The authority includes farmers, butchers, solicitors, teachers, nurses and businessmen. This is the type of collective expertise available in local government.  I subscribe to the views expressed on this matter.  I would love to meet any member of society who can contribute more than local authority members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the county enterprise boards.  I made it quite clear to my group on <Col N="564" /> Westmeath County Council that I would not be considered for membership because the county manager had, in essence, the power to appoint members.  In deference to our then county manager, he said the groups should pick their own members but the fact is that he had the power to appoint them.  So much for the belief in the powers of local authority members.</P>
    <P>I have met many people in my county and around the country who had to leave local government because they could not afford to continue as members.  They were giving so much time to this unpaid job that their businesses suffered. Those people are lost to the local government system and to democracy.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by the Minister of State in regard to legal difficulties.  However, as the Leader said, let it be noted by all and sundry that this House will not stand for local authority members being kicked around.  They have a great deal to offer in every walk of life and should not be precluded from membership of any board.  It is time we put down a marker for the future in regard to sections of Bills which preclude local authority members from membership of public boards.</P>

      <P>I agree with the sentiments which have been expressed.  I supported the Minister earlier in regard to the section which allows the Minister to make appointments to the scientific committee and the general board.  I am now supporting him in excluding certain categories of people from the board, that is, elected public representatives, mostly local authority members.  I find it difficult to do that but we are subject to time constraints and the Bill must be passed.</P>
      <P>However, we should send a copy of the debate on section 40 to the Attorney General and the parliamentary draftsman.  They should pin it up in their offices so that it is in the forefront of their thoughts when they draw up future Bills.  We are not here to undermine the political process or to exclude publicly elected representatives from the exercise of their duties as long as there is no conflict of interest between their public duties and their board membership.</P>

      <P>In general, I agree entirely with what Senators are saying and their principle is correct.  I thank Senator Burke for raising this issue.  However, this is not a universal situation; as Senator Dardis pointed out, this is particular instance.  Our legal advice on this issue is that there might be a conflict of interest.  Senators can readily see where that might arise in this situation. However, I agree entirely with their stance on other issues in regard to members of health boards and county councils.  I thank Senator Cassidy for his remarks on how we might resolve the issue on this occasion.  This points up the value of this House in scrutinising certain aspects of Bills and shows there is value in having a Seanad.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the points made by the Minister of State and the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy.  I hope there will be no further instances of this.  Local authority members have been debarred from boards in several Bills. However, there is an added provision in this Bill in regard to the health boards, which is why I raised the issue and have spoken so often on it.  I hope we will not see a recurrence of this in the House.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this back to his colleagues so that we will have no further cases of elected members of local authorities or health boards being debarred from board membership.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is in a very serious dilemma.  We are not here to delay the Bill but to make a point very strongly.  Provisions such as this in regard to public representatives are becoming the norm in Bills, which I greatly resent.  Members on both sides of the House should make it known that it will not be accepted in all Bills.  There is now a section in almost every Bill which provides that public representatives should not receive recognition for various matters.</P>
      <P>I am a member of an enterprise board.  The best tactical politicians of all are the city and county managers.  The manager leaves it to the local authority members to nominate the members of the enterprise board, who the manager then puts in writing as his nominees. Enterprise boards must deal with FÁS representatives, business people and so on.  However, it is left to the public representatives on the board to make the serious decisions.  Why are we not allowed to chair any of these authorities?  Are we really saying that people who have been in public life for 20 or 30 years are not fit to chair a local enterprise board?  There is no one better than a person who has been elected and has to knock on doors every five years.</P>
      <P>I understand the excluding of Oireachtas Members.  However, we should not knock ourselves. I am delighted three Government Senators are saying that civil servants responsible for these Bills should be told the views of this House and of public representatives.</P>
      <P>It is not fair that a person appointed to the board by a Minister must resign if he is asked to represent his group at health board level.  He should only have to resign from the authority if the Minister says he should.  The words &ldquo;shall resign&rdquo; should be replaced by the words &ldquo;may resign&rdquo;.  The Minister should look very seriously at that, particularly in regard to health boards. Farming groups, educational authorities, environmental groups and community groups are represented on boards, but there are no representatives elected by the people.  Public representatives have been knocked for too long.</P>

      <P>Legislation of this nature would not be required if the industry was doing its job properly.  It is evident, unfortunately, that some of the lessons of the BSE crisis and other incidents in the food industry have not been learnt fully.  That is why it is essential to regulate the industry under the aegis of the Department of Health.  My party was very anxious that that Department, not the Department of Agriculture, should be responsible.  It appeared at the time of the BSE crisis that we had learnt that the consumer, and the consumer's safety, dictates everything, but it now seems that we did not.  Ireland needs to produce food of the highest quality that can be traded internationally with confidence. There must be full traceability from inside the farm gate to the supermarket shelf.</P>
      <P>The Schedule refers to the Abattoirs Act. There have been references recently to the fact that small country butchers were almost put out of business by the cost of upgrading their slaughtering premises.  Many of them must now purchase meat from outside agencies.  I believe that that was correct, because there were instances of cattle being slaughtered and of meat being handled in circumstances that would not have been allowed had consumer interests been taken to heart.  It should also be noted that many country butchers upgraded their premises at enormous cost to meet regulations they knew they had to implement.  It is not easy, but there is no choice because the reputation of our food industry is at stake.  This is of critical national importance.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Dardis that this Bill should not be necessary, but it shows us that the industry has not responded as it should have to growing public concerns about food.  It is clear that the Government has not taken on board the fundamental issue of the role of consumers. The word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; does not appear in the Bill, which does not go far enough in this regard.  I hope the Bill is implemented successfully <Col N="568" /> and has the full confidence of the consumer. We will monitor this closely and I hope we do not have another incident like the BSE outbreak. Public confidence in the food we eat and we export should not be undermined.  Somebody will now tell me that the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; is mentioned in the Bill, but it is not central to the legislation, which is disappointing given the debate on the memberships of the board and representative council.  The Government should have enshrined the importance of the consumer in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Meara must have missed the word &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; in section 12.  Senator Dardis is right in that this legislation should not be necessary, but environmental health officers would say that never was a Bill more needed.  We have lax standards of food production, and Senator Dardis is right to say that we should have learnt our lessons from BSE.  I will not mention E-coli &mdash; the fact that people must be told not to drink unpasteurised milk on their own farms because of the health dangers &mdash; or the food poisoning in Croke Park.  I know I am speaking to a discreet audience and that is why I say these things <i>sotto voce.</i> There is so much that this Bill covers that I congratulate the Minister; whatever deficiencies are in it, its provisions are badly needed.</P>
      <P>An extraordinary aspect of this were the different standards for food to be eaten here and that which was sent abroad.  I felt it was interesting that if oysters were not good enough for the Cork market they could be shipped to Paris.  It was an interesting way to look at food exports.  I hope this Bill ensures improvements in all aspects of the food industry, although I wish the consumer was more to the fore despite being mentioned in section 12.</P>

We can never guarantee that another outbreak of salmonella, E-coli, etc., will not occur, but if it does we will have mechanisms in place to respond to it.  We will always try to aspire to the highest standards.  We are fortunate to be starting from a very high base in terms of food safety, having one of the best records in the world.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this section because I received briefings on the environmental and, particularly, the archaeological aspects of the Bill. There is a concern about the large area of bogland under the control of Bord na Móna.  It has about 85,000 hectares, which is about the size of County Carlow, and less than 25 per cent has been examined.  It is estimated that a total of over 10,000 sites of significance may be identified under the areas fully surveyed.  Because it is reducing the surface of a bog by ten to 20 centimetres, new archaeological areas can be lost. These archaeological sites are important and the majority are wooden constructions intended to provide access to or a passage across a bog.  They vary in size and range from early Neolithic through to the later medieval period to the present.  Enigmatic sites deserve particular inquiry.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to make a Second Stage speech nor would it be possible, but the special nature of the bogs and their preservative qualities is something we share with Denmark, for example, and Séamus Heaney has written a series of poems about the bog people.  We have learned a great deal about our human and archaeological history and it is important they are preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I received a briefing message from Professor Raftery of the Department of Archaeology in UCD.  He said the Turf Development Bill, if passed, will allow for a series of mitigating <Col N="570" /> measures to be established by the National Monuments Service and Bord na Móna and that it is only in this way we can then hope to gain an understanding of this significant part of our landscape and heritage before it is destroyed.  For that reason it is important we recognise there has been movement in this area under the Bill, as understood by Professor Raftery.  On that basis, I particularly welcome this section because the bog is a diminishing resource in Europe.  As I understand it &mdash; I must bow to the expert opinion of somebody such as Professor Raftery &mdash; the inclusion of this section is valuable and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>

      <P>I welcome Senator Norris's and Senator McDonagh's remarks.  I have spoken to my colleagues here on the matter as well.  It is heartening for a Minister to hear what has been said.  The section was inserted at the request of the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  There were ongoing talks between officials from my Department and those from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>Peatlands by their nature are particularly rich in archaeological sites and artefacts dating back to prehistoric times due to the preservation qualities of bogs.  Artefacts found in bogs, although thousands of years old, are in perfect condition because they have been preserved in a natural environment.  Skeletons, perfect in every respect, have been found and people have been able to ascertain their height, weight and the condition of their teeth at the time of death.  Think of all the bog oak that has been found.  We learn much about social history from such finds.  Butter churns, which were buried in bogs for coolness, have been found hundreds and thousands of years later.  As time goes on more will be found due to the insertion of this section.  More will be learned about our past.  When we learn about our past we also learn about our present and future because we are shaped by what happened in the past, particularly in terms of our social history. EU members states, particularly Holland, have recognised this and have come here to learn about what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator McDonagh said he was on the national monuments advisory committee of Galway <Col N="571" /> County Council.  Each council has a subcommittee and they do great work.  Bord na Móna must agree with its colleagues through the National Monuments Act and the habitat regulations.  It is interesting that there could have been conflict when I brought this Bill to Cabinet, but the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands rightly said her Department had concerns and that it wanted to work with me in that regard. These were worked through, rather than people banging heads together.  An agreeable mechanism has been found whereby they will, when occasion demands, meet and consult.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that a resource as old as the peatlands of Ireland continues to be a modern thriving force today, giving employment to 2,000 people and generating new ideas while at the same time they can yield up so much treasure from the past.  This section is important and necessary.</P>

Thanks to the Minister and this legislation, it will be able to take on the exciting and formidable challenges ahead.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister.  I also compliment Bord na Móna.  It has been the life and soul of the midlands, especially my county.  I also compliment the Minister's officials.  I met them on many occasions while a member of the committee of the regions.  I know some of them from my county.  They worked hard to ensure the passage of this legislation.  It is a wonderful day for Bord na Móna and the midland region.  It is a new era for the company.</P>
      <P>I hope every effort will be made to quickly resolve the burning of peat at Ferbane.  The Minister referred to this yesterday.  I appeal to those involved to forget their small local vested interests and listen to the people of the midland region who are asking them to get out of the way so that Bord na Móna can progress and become a leading company in the future in the midlands and in Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid) Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members of Seanad Éireann for this opportunity to address the House on the outcome of the independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>As Members will be aware, the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation discussed the report of the inquiry on 17 June 1998 and decided its full contents would be annexed to the committee's interim report on the subject of child protection in sport for submission to each House of the Oireachtas in order to facilitate immediate discussions on the implementation of the interim report's recommendations with the responsible Ministers and Ministers of State and to enable Members of each House and interested parties to submit their observations to the committee for consideration in the context of its final report.  I understand observations are being sought by 29 July 1998.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware the Government decided on 10 February 1998 that the independent inquiry would be carried out by Dr. Roderick Murphy, Chairman of the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators.  The Government's decision to set up the inquiry arose directly out of concern, particularly among the swimming community, following criminal proceedings in relation to abuse by two swimming coaches.  Members will be familiar with the terms of reference given to Dr. Murphy.</P>
      <P>The inquiry heard evidence for almost three months from more than 70 witnesses, of whom 20 were swimmers, 12 were parents, seven were coaches, ten were officers of the IASA, nine were officers of the Leinster branch, 12 were officers and committee members of the named clubs and nine were professionals in the area, namely, psychologists, social workers, lawyers and academics. Some witnesses attended in dual capacity as parents and members of club committees or of the branch or association.  Some swimmers gave evidence of their experience both as swimmers and as coaches.  In addition, the inquiry undertook investigative work and the examination of a large number of documents, papers and correspondence from the IASA and the clubs and school most directly concerned covering, in particular, the period from 1985 to 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Murphy was assisted in this work by Ms Fidelma Macken, SC, who acted as counsel to the inquiry and Ms Mary Cooney, Chief State Solicitor's Office, who acted as solicitor to the inquiry. The report was presented to me on 27 May 1998 by Dr. Murphy.  The inquiry's report is broad ranging, thorough and forward looking.  It is especially detailed in relation to the way in which complaints were dealt with in the swimming <Col N="574" /> organisation and the procedures in place at different levels.  The report provides a comprehensive list of recommendations, the majority of which relate to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association of the sport in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The IASA was given a copy of the inquiry report on 17 June 1998 and was requested to give it urgent and immediate consideration.  On Monday, 22 June, I received the executive council's initial response.  This response includes the association's proposed strategy for implementation of the report's recommendations.  I have indicated to the association that I am anxious they complete their proposed consultations with their wider membership who, I believe, must be satisfied as to the adequacy of procedures and arrangements in place in their organisation to secure a safe environment for its younger members.</P>
    <P>On 27 June 1998 the president of the IASA announced the association has appointed a &ldquo;Change Management&rdquo; team and expert advice has been sought.  The association has engaged a team of professionals who will look at the sport of swimming from top to bottom and, drawing on the recommendations of the Murphy report, prepare a new structure for the sport in Ireland. The president went on to say that over the coming months, consultations will be held with all the branches of the association to gather opinions and ideas as to how this proposed change can be best achieved.</P>
    <P>I welcome this commitment to wider consultation and am convinced that only by involving all members at every level can confidence be restored in the sport of swimming in Ireland. Although the report makes no specific reference to the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland, I have requested Dr. Breda McLeavey, chairperson of the expert committee which drew up the code in 1996, to reconvene the committee to review its contents in the light of the report of the inquiry.  I am pleased to say that the reconvened committee held its first meeting last Friday.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Irish Sports Council, in conjunction with the National Coaching and Training Centre, has begun planning a seminar for later this year for national governing bodies of sport. The purpose is to ensure the widest dissemination among sports organisations of the inquiry's recommendations, the outcome of the review of the code of ethics, the findings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee and, most of all, to underline once again the importance of ensuring the protection of its younger members.</P>
    <P>A number of recommendations in the report relate to the areas of responsibility of other Departments.  In particular, Dr. Murphy makes recommendations regarding the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, mandatory reporting of child abuse and education and training programmes <Col N="575" /> for the establishment and verification of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>Ultimately and most importantly, the recommendations of the Murphy report are a matter for the IASA and all its members, each of whom must now engage in the process of addressing the issues raised in the report.  It is now also timely for all governing bodies of sport to reflect upon the lessons learnt from this most unhappy episode and to ensure our children may participate in a safe, secure and positive sporting environment in the future.  I thank Senators for their attention and look forward to hearing their views on this most important issue for sport in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the victims of sexual abuse in swimming, their parents and families.  The terrible pain suffered by so many young children as they partook in the great sport of swimming will last long after this discussion and others on this subject subside.  The hurt caused and its repercussions are frightening in the extreme.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to Dr. Murphy for researching this issue and producing a report on it.  The report is hugely disturbing outlining, as it does, the most appalling litany of physical and psychological abuse in swimming over the past 25 years.  One of the saddest things is that children did not come forward to complain as they felt the abuse was part of a normal training routine.  The children, their parents and families have been betrayed by people who stood in <i>loco parentis.</i> The role of someone acting in <i>loco parentis</i> is very special and vitally important and the crucial ingredients in it are loyalty and sincerity.  Nobody is entitled to abuse that privilege.  I have spent all my working life as a teacher acting in <i>loco parentis</i> both inside and outside the classroom.  In the heat of the current debate, it would be remiss of me not to pay tribute to the many people, teachers, coaches, voluntary helpers and so on who have stood in <i>loco parentis</i> and displayed the utmost professionalism and care.  This should not be forgotten when we speak of the minority of people who have abused their positions of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My fear is that the terrible revelations of the Murphy report will lead to great difficulty in finding volunteers to coach young people in sport.  All of us who are involved in education and sport realise the huge importance of the voluntary worker.  As a result of these terrible revelations people may be inclined to cast an eye at the genuine people working in the voluntary sector. That would be a great shame as team coaches and leaders have given great service over the years. Many will now be worried that their work with young people may be misconstrued.  That would be tragic.  The vast majority of volunteers have given their time generously and unselfishly.  They have contributed enormously to the development <Col N="576" /> of thousands of young people in various sports.  I salute those people and their efforts.</P>
    <P>As a teacher and as a club and county administrator for the GAA, I am disappointed at the lack of interest shown by parents in the extra curricular activities undertaken by their children.  Again and again parents let other people look after their children.  Often volunteers call at houses where there are two or three cars yet they have to bring children to matches and training sessions at their own expense.  The parents do not even bother to turn up to support their children.  Parents have an important role to play in extra curricular activities for their children.  If parents had been more involved some of these terrible problems which are surfacing now would have been noticed and would have been stopped much earlier and a great deal of trauma and tragedy for young children would have been prevented.  People involved in coaching and training young people need support.  I hope parents will now come forward and become involved in the extra curricular activities of their own children.  They will experience a great deal of joy in participating with their children.</P>
    <P>This report suggests there is something rotten in swimming.  There is a serious lack in our system of child protection.  Strict criteria must be laid down for those involved in training.  It is a difficult time for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation but the onus is on him to see that this never occurs again in any sport.  Parents have a role to play &mdash; they must continue to monitor their children's involvement in various out-of-school activities.  There must be a system of mandatory reporting and stipulations as laid down within the context of the Health and Safety Act must be brought into force and adhered to.</P>
    <P>Rumours were widespread over the last number of years.  Complaints were made to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association but they all fell on deaf ears for some time.  Is the Murphy report too little too late?  The truth about this scandal is that nobody wanted to know because many of these coaches were good at their jobs.  It appears structures were weak, confused and undemocratic. Trust is not enough anymore.  We must react to any hint that something might be wrong. The consequences are so terrible that rumours must be given serious consideration.  There is no smoke without fire.</P>
    <P>The compulsion of the people who commit these crimes is seemingly based on low self esteem and to alleviate this, they find a way to dominate others.  The easiest target is young children. This raises questions about the society in which we live.  Is there a link between pornography and sex crimes?  Are we as parents, teachers, guardians and instructors informing our children correctly about relationships and sexuality? Where are we going wrong?  Are we going wrong?  What can be done?  Owing to a change in <Col N="577" /> social attitudes, are we now witnessing a clean out of a backlog of sexual criminality?</P>
    <P>There is no structure in place in the present system to rehabilitate sex offenders.  They are becoming a major problem for society.  Sex crime is an issue which we must deal with in a special way.  As the truth seeps out, reactions to changing trends are not enough.  Something concrete must be done about these atrocities.  I hope the Minister will establish structures which will bring credibility back to the great sport of swimming in this State.  My sympathy is with the Minister.  He has worked hard and this is a difficult time for him.  He has the support of everyone in the State. I am confident he will respond in a positive manner and the type of revelations which have come to the fore in recent times will be consigned to history and will never again surface in a country which prides itself on being a nation of saints and scholars.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to give us an opportunity to put our feelings on the record.</P>
      <P>I wish to express deep sympathy for all the unfortunate victims of this desperate crime.  I compliment Dr. Murphy and his team for their thorough report.  Of all the reports I have read, it is the most frightening.</P>
      <P>However, before we condemn people we must compliment the many volunteers who have given their time over many years to the coaching and promotion of sport.  Credit is due to them and they must feel sad when they read about what happened in one organisation.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with the GAA for many years and one wonders how this could have gone on in any organisation.  It saddens me that any organisation would have allowed a system to exist such as that which was in place in the IASA. Some parents have looked on sporting organisations almost as childminding services and were happy that their children were being cared for without getting involved themselves.  Other parents saw fit not to accept assurances and got involved themselves to see what was going on in the organisation.  Had more parents done that they would have taken corrective steps even if the relevant organisation was not moving in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be complimented for the stand he took.  I have heard many people trying to do him down.  He withdrew funding from the IASA before he had the Murphy report and took action to ensure that the taxpayer would not fund the organisation to carry on as it had been doing. We have a Minister who will ensure that any organisation which is not abiding by the rules will suffer the consequences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that children have a safe environment.  It is frightening and sickening to read in the report of how young children between the ages of 8 and 12 were molested.  It should not <Col N="578" /> happen and I hope the Minister and all concerned will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the perpetrators stand trial and serve time for injustices they have done to many children. The memories of these crimes will never leave the children, their parents and families.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Sport and Recreation heard submissions from many organisations. Listening to those submissions one would have thought that safety precautions were in place. However, the Murphy report highlights the fact that if rules were written they were not implemented and there was no proper supervision.</P>
    <P>The Murphy report is an excellent and sad report which pinpoints the problems in the IASA. I hope that the report and its recommendations will not gather dust.  I appeal to all sporting organisations, even those who have not experienced problems, to take the necessary steps to ensure that a situation like this can never arise again.  Organisations which are dealing with young and vulnerable children should ensure that at no time is one person left with the responsibility for coaching and training young people.</P>
    <P>In the past parents trusted so many people with their children and thank God there are many excellent coaches in different sporting organisations. However, it is sad and sickening to read of what went on.  I appeal to the Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that those responsible face justice, even if they have left the organisations and the country.  We often talk of serious crimes but nothing could compare with the crime of molesting and abusing innocent young children.</P>
    <P>I compliment those parents who had the courage to take on the management and hierarchy in the IASA.  I also compliment those coaches and former athletes who are prepared to speak out about what should happen in that organisation.  I compliment and thank the Minister for the way he dealt with this report once he became aware of the problems in the IASA and I trust that other sporting organisations will not face the same problems in the future.  Rules appear to be in place.  However, I hope they are not confined to headquarters but are followed in each branch of these organisations.  They must ensure that codes of conduct and practice are properly adhered to right down to the junior ranks of each organisation. The Murphy report is an emotive and sad report and the Minister has outlined the steps he intends to take.  I hope we have seen the last of these practices and that they will never be repeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Roderick Murphy, Fidelma Macken and Mary Cooney for producing this report which must have been emotionally draining, painful and sickening.  I have not read the report nor do I intend to do so as I cannot read this kind of report anymore.  However, I <Col N="579" /> read the recommendations and the newspaper coverage.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with this debate nor the overall commentary and I am sickened that this is being confined to the IASA.  In this report, we are reaping the whirlwind of decades of neglect.  Since 1987 I have raised the need for sex education programmes such as stay safe and for mandatory reporting.  I received pledges from this Government and the previous one on the latter issue. The report states that a child went to a priest indicating what was happening to her and the priest sent her back to the official.  That is a classic example of why there should be a properly structured mandatory reporting mechanism so that it would be known what was to be reported and to whom and how it would be dealt with.  Section 10 of the IASA's code of practice states that a parent with a problem should approach an official. That is a mistake and should not be allowed. There should be proper structures and functions in place.</P>
      <P>This is not the eleventh hour but the first on this issue.  We are dealing with paedophilia and with people who are predatory, manipulative, who gain trust and confidence and who are clever.  We should remember that children sought help and did not receive it and that they thought the abuse was part of their training.  The Minister has been criticised for taking a stand on issues such as sex education and the stay safe programme. There seems to be a vested interest to stop children finding out what should not be done to them.  There are people in both Houses of the Oireachtas who have blocked progress towards helping children through safety programmes. While the issue is not just about putting structures in place, they are important and certain recommendations in the report should become rules, such as a coach not being on his or her own with a child in a place where the child is in a state of semi-undress.</P>
      <P>I started teaching in 1967 and, on my first day teaching, an enlightened principal gave me the advice that I should never be on my own with one of the children.  People were aware at that time of the need for safety, so what has been done in the meantime?  Why is it that every time I raise the issue of mandatory reporting, people give a million reasons it cannot be done.  People in this Government, the previous one and their colleagues expressed grave reservations.  When are we going to protect children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every argument I have heard against mandatory reporting has been an argument about professionalism. There is nothing in this area which cannot be adequately dealt with.  When I mention mandatory reporting I do not mean an open conduit for every bit of tittle tattle, gossip and mischievous chat.  Instead, I have in mind a properly structured reporting system where it is decided what should be reported and to whom.  It does <Col N="580" /> not necessarily have to be to the director of community care or the Garda; it could be a brand new structure.  We need systems of investigation which we trust and upon which we can depend.</P>
    <P>Professionals need to be protected.  Medical doctors have raised problems about client confidentiality regarding adults.  Every one of their problems can be dealt with.  For example, it is not necessary that reporting should be mandatory in the case of disclosure by an adult of something which happened to them many years earlier. Every objection I have heard from professionals in the area of mandatory reporting can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Members of the House should grasp the nettle on issues such as mandatory reporting, sex education and the stay safe programme.  When local &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo; stop children from learning about themselves, their bodies, how they should be careful and how to stay safe, we should tell them to get wise and to let our children come first.  We in the INTO have been dealing with the issue for many years.  We put together a code of practice to guide teachers and we circulated it to parents and sporting organisations, many of which have drawn from it.</P>
    <P>It is a mistake to believe that the discussion should be confined to the IASA.  This is a discussion about any situation in which children are cared for, coached or taught by adults.  One thing is certain: there are thousands of well meaning and decent people involved in sporting organisations who do superb and fantastic work for children and parents.  Many of them now feel they are under a cloud because paedophiles find their way into the narrowest area of trust and confidence and abuse it.</P>
    <P>We must be clear about what happened.  Children were taken out of their beds at 4.30 in the morning to go for swimming practice at 5 a.m. These were unreal and unearthly hours during which they were vulnerable and they arrived at school hours later still shell shocked having been up all those hours.  It was an unnatural life.  One of the reasons for it is that we did not and do not have enough swimming pools to develop the sport.  The issue of a 50 metre pool is also part of this.</P>
    <P>Regarding thanking parents for being brave enough to take on the issue of the child abuse, we should remember that parents have a responsibility to do so.  It is those who came through the system, such as Gary O'Toole and others, and who, as young, raw, inexperienced and immature people, tried to take them on and failed who are the heroes as far as I am concerned. I am delighted parents took action and they deserve our support.  The bad treatment they received was extraordinary.  I remember during a discussion on this issue on the radio hearing one parent saying that one of the paedophiles in question had such charisma, influence and authority, that he could change everyone's mood by a few <Col N="581" /> sentences or comments, they could give them a lift or leave them feeling down.  These are smart people and they must be closely observed.</P>
    <P>Parents must remember that education is a holistic process and that it is about the development of all aspects of children.  It happens repeatedly that, when a child is seen to have an extraordinary talent, the parental interest can focus solely on that to the point of mania.  While parents should try to develop the talent, they should not lose sight of the protection of their children and the fact that all situations must be safe.  To this end, measures such as mandatory reporting must be introduced.</P>
    <P>The report of the group working with the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, should be published and its recommendations implemented.  If someone tries to talk us out of it, we should remember that sex education should be a right for children, not an add-on.  All children have a constitutional right to education in all its aspects and sex education is not excluded.  Programmes such as stay safe should be available to all children.  While it almost is, it has been a hard struggle for the INTO, the parents' groups and the Catholic school managers who supported it to get it implemented.  We received great support from the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, who cleared obstacles to get it up and running.</P>
    <P>This is not the eleventh hour of this issue nor is it just about the swimming association.  It is about children being cared for in a safe environment, whether it be schools, hospitals, swimming pools, changing rooms or showers.  Wherever it is, it is important there are codes of practice by which people abide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad we have the opportunity to make statements on the Murphy report because it is important its contents be brought out into the open.  What Senator O'Toole said is correct; we are not just focusing on the IASA.  The report also brings into the public arena the trouble which can befall people who become involved in amateur sports and the abuse of the trust placed in such people by parents and children.</P>
      <P>I have been involved in many sporting organisations and I do not think anyone could spend his youth or early adulthood in sport and not have a sexual approach made to him or her.  This is true for all sports.  There have always been people who try to use children in a sexual way.  They become involved in sport because of their sexual obsession with young people and use sporting activity as a cover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major scandal occurred in British swimming which was featured in a programme on Channel 4 some weeks ago.  Young girls on the brink of being picked for the British Olympic swimming team were abused by coaches.  The stories told by these young girls match the stories of our young <Col N="582" /> swimmers.  Young swimmers are more vulnerable than other children because they spend so much time in a state of partial undress.  They are dedicated athletes who often get up at 4 a.m.  to train for four or five hours.  A 50 metre pool would solve none of the problems associated with swimming. A niece of mine was an outstanding swimmer who was a state champion and was placed fifth in the US Olympic trials.  She used to get up a 3.30 a.m.  from the age of seven until she won a swimming scholarship to university.  When I stayed in my brother's house in the US I would meet her coming back from a four hour training session before school when I was getting up.  That is crazy.  These young swimmers suffer physical damage and are old before their time.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Murphy report has been published. It shows us what can happen to vulnerable young people.  Abuse of this sort has happened in every sport and in other areas of Irish life.  We read every day of the abuse of children and it is good that this issue is now being debated openly. Abuse will not be eliminated but people must be aware of the danger.  There is possibly less abuse in sport than in other areas of life.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole spoke of his difficulty in reading the report.  I know of people who became physically sick when they had to take dictation of accounts of sexual abuse of children.  Victims of paedophilia have been left incapable of reaching a healthy and normal adulthood.  It is horrific to realise what people have suffered in the name of sport, religion and education.  This problem must be addressed and the publication of the Murphy report will help to do that.  The report should be sent to every house and school in Ireland.  It is unfortunate that Members of the Oireachtas had to apply for copies of the report.  It should have been circulated to Members immediately and automatically.  Everyone involved with children should be obliged to read it.</P>
    <P>The IASA stands utterly condemned but we must remember that thousands of excellent people provide instruction in swimming.  When I was younger I was involved in teaching water safety.  The Irish Red Cross and the National Safety Council have done tremendous work teaching and promoting water safety.  There has never been any suggestion that these organisations have been involved in anything improper. Not all volunteers involved in youth sporting activity should be tarred with the same brush.</P>
    <P>I cannot overstate the amount of good work done by voluntary workers who help our children grow to adulthood in a proper and healthy manner. There are some who abuse their role.  Some coaches have behaved in a manipulative and plausible way.  They have been able to present their version of events in a way which children who have suffered abuse cannot.  When children reported abuse to the IASA they were ignored. Officials of the IASA resorted to legal language in dismissing the children's claims.  The victims <Col N="583" /> were made to believe that the coaches themselves were being victimised.  Children came to believe they were abusing the perpetrators of the abuse.</P>
    <P>I heard these reports at a certain stage and I now wish I had spoken about what I heard.  I thought this happened all the time and was part of growing up but many children were badly affected by what happened.  I am not convinced that mandatory reporting of sexual abuse will help.  However, I am sure that we must publicise the fact that there are evil people who abuse young children.  The more we do that the better. We will never be rid of this problem because paedophiles exist and are waiting to pounce.  We must be ever more vigilant in monitoring them to ensure they are kept away from the vulnerable children whom we hope will grow into reasonable, balanced adults.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire chuig an díospóireacht tábhachtach atá ar siúl sa Seanad inniú.  Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh rudaí an-mhaith as an díospóireacht.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important debate.  I congratulate Dr. Murphy and his team who compiled the report and who spent so much time examining the issues involved.  I also wish to sympathise with the victims of this abuse and with their parents and families.  What happened to these young people was a tragedy.  It is a tragedy that also happens in other sports, as other Members have said, and we must do something about it now.</P>
      <P>I am a former president of Drogheda swimming club.  The parents who run that club are exceptionally dedicated to and involved with young people.  They have a proactive attitude to the sport.  Both children and parents must attend the club's sessions every Wednesday and Friday night.  Parents who are not members of the club are involved in all aspects of running it.  There is a rota for parents to supervise the dressing rooms when the children are using them.</P>
      <P>It is most important that parents are involved in all sporting organisations which cater for young people.  The parents need not necessarily be members of the clubs involved.  If parents are involved and assist in training, I am happy.  I would not be happy with any other arrangement. As parents, we cannot abdicate our responsibilities and leave it to others to rear our children and to train them in sports.  We cannot afford that risk.  It has been shown time and again that good coaches in various sports &mdash; obviously a small number of them &mdash; abuse children.  As Senator Lanigan said, the child believes he or she is wrong, not the person who is abusing them.  That is the core of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a proper system of training for coaches in all sports.  That might be a useful role for the vocational education committees since they already have a role in youth and sports funding. They should have a more dynamic involvement <Col N="584" /> with sport.  There should be basic essential courses which must be completed by anybody who wishes to coach a child and the vocational education committees could run them.</P>
    <P>Coaches should also be psychologically assessed before they are given access to children. A small number of these highly committed people will abuse children and we cannot afford that risk.  If I wished to become the best coach in children's soccer, football or swimming, I would have no problem attending such courses or undergoing such assessment.  I would understand why they were necessary.  Obviously, the Oireachtas cannot legislate for this but it could be more active in setting down criteria for coaches in all sports.  The 99 per cent of coaches who are fantastically dedicated to helping young people in sport would be happy with such an arrangement, as would parents.  The coaches and children would be fulfilled and the community would be healthier for it.  I join my colleague, Senator McDonagh, in praising the role of voluntary workers in the community.</P>
    <P>We must legislate for tougher prison sentences for people who are guilty of these heinous crimes. The age of innocence is gone.  Children are no longer brought up in a happy and healthy environment, as was the case when most Members of this House were children.  Now we must warn our children about sexual abuse as soon as they can speak.  We must tell them to be careful who they talk to and who they go home with when they are outside the home.  Childhood now is dangerous and much abused and I regret that.  However, it is necessary to teach our children these things as soon as they can speak.  We must educate them about this abuse.</P>
    <P>Some Members referred to pornography, sex lines and so forth.  There are sick people in the community but one does not need to access a sex line to get involved in pornography, particularly over the Internet.  The new technology facilitates what is called a &ldquo;net meeting&rdquo; where one can dial, for the price of a local call, many hundreds of people throughout the world.  One can see and talk to these people by using video technology.  It is a fantastic technology but it is being abused.</P>
    <P>Any young person who can use the keyboard of a computer can get into a net meeting and encounter all types of perversion and weird people.  These people state clearly what they want.  One ends up seeking callers who are seeking &ldquo;clean chat only&rdquo;.  Only then is one sure that one can have a healthy, normal conversation. There is a great deal of abnormality on the Internet but one cannot legislate against it.  One can only educate one's children to use the technology wisely.  It is sad that this wonderful technology can be so easily and readily abused.</P>
    <P>Tougher prison sentences for sex abuse crimes are essential.  Taking the innocence of a child or young person in this way is a heinous crime. There should be mandatory tough sentences for <Col N="585" /> such crimes.  I have no problem with the imposition of 20 years imprisonment on such offenders. We must be harsh on them and not give them an inch.  If they have abused our children, they should not get out of prison until they are extremely old.  We must show them that we mean business and that if they cross the line, they will pay a heavy price.  There must be no doubt about our seriousness in this regard.</P>
    <P>I listened to a radio discussion about a parent who was extremely concerned about what was happening in the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.  I was aghast at the self-doubt and worry she had to endure.  However, she persisted in telling other parents what was happening.  That parent did a fantastic job for the children of this country and for the sports in which they are involved.  She is the type of person who should be running these organisations, although she would probably be reluctant to take on the job.</P>
    <P>The Irish Amateur Swimming Association failed the children who were members of the association.  It did not protect them for a variety of reasons.  The association should disband.  As a parent I no longer have confidence in it, no matter what plans or ideas it has for the future.  Its members should go and somebody such as Gary O'Toole and the parent I mentioned earlier should be asked to set up a new association to generate a new start for swimming and for young people.  There must be a clean break with the past.  If I were a member of the association's executive, I would be happy with such a solution. I would prefer to be finished with the old scene. It is time for change and for people such as Gary O'Toole to assume leadership positions.  That would be the happiest outcome.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have legal powers over the association although he has financial power. The bottom line, however, is that it is time for the association to go and for the establishment of a new association with new members, particularly those who have been through the mill and who stood up and made sacrifices for all children involved in swimming.  It is thanks to them that this report was compiled and gave rise to this important and timely debate.</P>

      <P>I am glad Senator O'Toole and Senator Lanigan spoke as they did because I will not be part of any uisce faoin talamh in this debate.  This is an extremely serious matter which extends far beyond the Irish Amateur Swimming Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was involved in establishing the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital about 15 years ago. When it was established we expected adult rape victims to be brought to the unit.  However, within six weeks it was flooded with children.  Teachers and social workers were bringing them to this unit because there was nowhere else to bring them.  The Minister will be well aware that within a few years the situation was so serious that we had to open units <Col N="586" /> in Crumlin and Temple Street Children's Hospital.  We now have special clinics in other parts of the country as well.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is a terrible problem here. Senator O'Dowd was more gently reared than I. I was reared gently but I have had to work in a rougher medium.  The home can be one of the most dreadful places for some children.  Is anyone reading the media reports of incest cases?  God bless Senator Moylan's innocent Irish heart when he hoped we would not have another case like this.  Five years ago we debated the Kilkenny incest case.  At the time I said I wished we had taken a little more notice of the Kilkenny incest case dating back about 25 years where a 14 year old girl who had borne her father a child was murdered a year later when she refused to have sexual intercourse with him.  If we took a little more notice of all these reports we might get somewhere.  But we will not get anywhere because we will not take any notice of what is going on and we will not take any notice of this report.</P>
    <P>Dr. Murphy has produced an excellent report and he is to be commended.  So are all those who have been courageous enough to testify at the committee because reliving these experiences must have been dreadful for them.  I accept Senator Lanigan's point that for those who have to work on such cases it is a very harrowing experience because you see people reliving the trauma they experienced when they were 11 or 12 years old.</P>
    <P>A very important part of this report is the fact that the children did not know whether the abuse was right or wrong.  Senator O'Toole correctly mentioned that there should not be any objections to the stay safe programmes.  When these programmes were introduced people said there would be children reporting their fathers; imagine saying that would be wrong.  They should have said that it would have been shocking that fathers, uncles or any other person were abusing children.  Unfortunately, this abuse dates back to biblical times and it is forbidden in the Book of Leviticus.  Why do we think this is extraordinary now?  We have to do something about it so that lives will not be totally destroyed.  These cases are reported in the media now but in the past they were not taken.</P>
    <P>After I spoke about the first Kilkenny incest case a reporter from <i>The Irish Times</i> informed me that he remembered debating whether they would report the case; thankfully they did.  Such cases were not reported at that time but they happened. Society has not changed very much but now we know a great deal more and knowledge obliges us to do something.</P>
    <P>The IASA aspect of this scandal is very serious. I know there were many people involved on a voluntary basis at committee level in both the IASA and Leinster branch who, whatever about their legal responsibilities, did not feel they had any moral obligation to do anything.  In chapter <Col N="587" /> 11, summary of findings, recommendation 2.12, page 122, it states:</P>
    <P>The President of the IASA in 1992 had been told at the end of 1991 by a senior swimmer of complaints that the first coach was in serious trouble for molesting young children.  The senior swimmer requested that the President organise a meeting at which the gardaí would be present.  The President took legal advice.  No meeting took place.</P>
    <P>No one denies this happened.  This man was told that a coach was molesting young children and nothing happened.  What kind of moral responsibility did he have?  I presume the term &ldquo;senior swimmer&rdquo; refers to the very courageous Gary O'Toole.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 2.13 states:</P>
    <P>The honorary treasurer of the IASA, in his evidence to the Inquiry said that he was aware of rumours before the Barcelona Olympics in the summer of 1992 that a senior swimmer was going to expose a coach, but was not aware of the identity of the coach or the nature of the allegations and did not receive any complaint or hear of one.</P>
    <P>Did this man not feel he had any need to investigate these complaints?  These young people &mdash; children virtually, minors definitely &mdash; were travelling abroad with this person.</P>
    <P>On page 123, recommendation 2.14 states:</P>
    <P>In October 1992 the complainant attended a psychologist in relation to the abuse.  The psychologist reported the matter to the Garda who commenced an investigation.</P>
    <P>Of course the Garda started an investigation, these were terrible allegations.  Worse still, some of these individuals were semi-promoted.</P>
    <P>On page 124 of the report recommendation 3.8 states:</P>
    <P>On 10 November 1992 a complaint was made by the parents of a swimmer who alleged sexual assault by the second named coach.  The committee of the club convened a complaints committee meeting on 16 November 1992.  The parents of the swimmer were given assurances that both informal and formal procedures would be reviewed and put in place.</P>
    <P>The coach involved in this case worked in a school and club.</P>
    <P>Recommendation 3.11 states:</P>
    <P>On 10 September 1993 the coach was suspended by the school on full pay until further notice and prohibited from entering the school premises as coach, lifeguard or parent.  This suspension arose because of the awareness of the headmaster of the school of certain complaints about the coach's behaviour in the pool/changing area in the past.  A written statement to that effect was made to the coach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="588" /> Recommendation 3.12 states:</P>
    <P>According to documents provided by the club, on 11 September 1993, the President of the club wrote to the headmaster stating that the coach had been shown the written statement of the school relating to complaints being investigated by the school into the coach's behaviour in the pool area.  In his evidence to the Inquiry the President said that he believed, at the time, that the reason for the suspension was financial or personal.  He said he was not informed of the specific complaints.</P>
    <P>Could he not have asked?  Did he feel he was not morally obliged to find out what was going on? We go on to discover that a coach who had been suspended in Leinster was asked to coach in Ulster.  Why did the children in Ulster deserve to be treated in a worse manner than the children in Leinster?  This is an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>The onus is on us to deal with mandatory reporting.  Senator O'Toole and others have emphasised over and over again that children who make complaints feel something will happen. One child reported to a priest but he advised her to go back to the assailant who slapped her face and called her a whore.  Another child reported to a teacher she trusted who she thought would do something about the matter.  There is no evidence that the teacher passed on any of the information and the teacher could not be traced to see what happened.  Another reported to a doctor but the doctor felt that the complainant did not want it to go any further.  On the basis of doctor/patient confidentiality the doctor decided not to pursue the matter.  All professions who deal with children or minors will have to make a decision about mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will be aware, the medical profession is ambivalent about this.  Most of their concerns relate to an interference in doctor/patient confidentiality and the relationship with the child's parents and the family in general but we are all aware of incest and sexual abuse within the home and family.  We must make an immediate decision on it.  It is no good telling children in a stay safe programme what is not allowed, what is improper, what is private to them and must not be exploited by other people.  It is no good having sexual relationship programmes if, at the same time, we do not make a decision on what children can do and how they will be treated when they complain about abuse.  This is the most important aspect we should take from the report.  I hope the Department of Health and Children will not put this matter out on the long finger as it has done for decades.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disappointing that a discussion on sport which can be enjoyed by everyone should focus on this horrific tale of neglect, oversight and of children being let down.  This happened in a sport in which many adults and children engage and which should be enjoyable. I have much sympathy for the Minister and the <Col N="589" /> Minister of State.  They head up a new Department which hopes to make a major impact on tourism, sport and recreation.  These should be happy areas but one of the first things to confront them is this major scandal involving sexual abuse in swimming.</P>
      <P>The production of the report, its consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee, of which some Senators are members, and this debate in addition to the expert advice being sought by the Minister will hopefully ensure that a system is put in place which will protect children and benefit all those involved in sport &mdash; adults, children, coaches, helpers and officials.  It is terrible that such action must be taken but the evidence proves it is necessary.</P>
      <P>As in other areas involving education and the religious, our eyes are being opened to the type of incidents investigated and reported on by the Murphy inquiry.  We have a duty to put in place measures to ensure that children are supported and protected, that they can trust adults put in charge of them and, if things go wrong, that there are mechanisms to ensure they are listened to, believed and that action will be taken.</P>
      <P>One of my concerns is how guidelines, obligations, reporting mechanisms and investigatory procedures can be put in place while, at the same time, people are encouraged to volunteer to help sporting and youth organisations.  In all sporting and youth organisations there is a strong feeling that within a short time it will be almost impossible to get volunteers to do the work they did in the past because of the risks involved and the impositions on them.  People will decide not to volunteer because they are worried what might happen in terms of an investigation or a court case.  This is an unfortunate dilemma which must be faced.</P>
      <P>It can only be faced if, in addition to guidelines and the introduction of legal strictures and strong reporting structures, sport and youth organisations are provided with the type of back-up support, advice, finance and resources to ensure they can implement the recommendations.  The 1996 guidelines were produced by the youth and sport section of the Department of Education and communicated to youth and sport bodies who passed them down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that in many different sports clubs at local level they arrived as correspondence. They were read out by the organisations' secretaries who said they were available if anybody wanted them.  This is not good enough for the youth and sport organisations concerned or the young people in their care.  It is also not good enough for the people who act as volunteers in hurling, football, soccer and swimming clubs.  I appeal to the Minister and the Department to ensure that any guidelines put in place are not only published, printed and circulated, but that clubs are supported from ground level up in understanding their responsibilities in that regard and putting procedures in place to ensure children are protected.  At the same time adults who <Col N="590" /> volunteer must be reassured that action is being taken in a supportive fashion and it is not intended to discourage them.  Professionalism by way of payment has entered many areas of sport and it would be unfortunate if the voluntary members of local clubs were put off because of lack of proper advice, back up support and training to help them deal with the area of child protection in their organisations.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations were discussed in detail during the debate.  However, I am disappointed one recommendation was not made.  For the sake of swimming, the IASA should disband. I do not make that suggestion lightly.  It would be easy to change the name of the association, but in view of the range of organisational changes recommended by Dr. Murphy and the opinion of people such as Gary O'Toole who have attempted to bring this matter into the public domain for many years, public confidence in amateur swimming can only be restored if a new organisation is set up.</P>
    <P>I participated in competitive swimming when I was young and the report has highlighted an aspect of which I was aware at that time.  It is not a team sport and, therefore, it is different from many other activities.  At a certain level, when people were identified as being good swimmers, parents and coaches were so anxious to make them better that the needs of the child were often forgotten.  We must realise that children have social lives and personalities to develop.  They should have friends and they have schoolwork to do.  We must question any sporting activity which interferes in the normal social and educational development of children.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation is reviewing the code of ethics and good practice for sport.  I also welcome the measures outlined by the Minister in that regard.  I hope a further debate on this subject will be held in the House because many Senators with expertise in youth and sport organisations and voluntary activities would wish to contribute to such a discussion.</P>
    <P>I hope the recommendations about the availability of counselling and therapy to the victims are implemented.  Child protection officers should be designated in all sporting organisations.  There is a need for the strongest possible reporting mechanisms for child abuse.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, is preparing proposals, but we must bring our deliberations on this area to a speedy conclusion and put measures in place.  We can argue about what mandatory reporting should involve, but the strongest possible measures should be implemented to ensure that children are protected.</P>
    <P>I was most surprised by recommendation 4.12 that coaches should be professionally qualified before undertaking hypnosis therapy.  There is no place for hypnosis therapy in sport.  Why should one be hypnotised to take part in something which one is supposed to enjoy and that is good for one?  Hypnosis therapy should be banned in <Col N="591" /> sport and it is the only recommendation in the report with which I am disappointed.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that no sporting organisation engages in hypnosis to improve the performance of any participants.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senators who referred to the need to ensure that the stay safe and the relationships and sexuality education programmes in schools are implemented.  We sometimes expect schools to do everything but these are two areas in which schools have demonstrated that they can do a great deal.  The stay safe programme is effective. It is established in most schools now and parents have told me that children find it useful and supportive.</P>
    <P>I am not as heartened about the relationships and sexuality education programme.  Organised groups and lobbies are travelling around the country, disrupting meetings organised by the Department of Education and Science and other school meetings.  The last thing the disrupters can claim to be doing is protecting children.  The Government must take action to ensure that the programmes it has put in place after much consultation are delivered in schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Following a successful lobby campaign by the duty and tax free industry, ECOFIN, which is the Economic and Finance Ministers Council, decided in November 1991 that rather than ending as planned by the Commission intra-EU duty and tax free sales on 31 December 1992, these sales would continue until 30 June 1999.  In December 1992 the necessary directives were passed and unanimously agreed by the ECOFIN Council of the then 12 member states.  As there would be no Customs barriers from 1 January 1993, the directives also required the industry to ensure passengers could only purchase up to the level of the allowances through the operation of the so-called vendor control system.</P>
      <P>Changing the current legislation will require a unanimous decision of the 15 member states in the ECOFIN Council based on a proposal from the EU Commission, a simple majority within the Commission and a favourable opinion from the European Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority.  It should be noted that unanimity in EU language means no country voting against and a majority in favour; member states can choose to remain silent, which is taken as assent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> In its opposition to intra-EU duty and tax free sales, the Commission often cites unfair competition with downtown retailers, discrimination against other forms of transport &mdash; rail and road &mdash; and a lack of transparency in duty and tax free pricing.  However, non-compatibility with the Single Market is the Commission's core argument. This is based on a view of the intranal market as being the same as a national market and the expectation that rapid progress towards completion will provide intra-EU duty and tax free sales.  The reality has proved to be very different, with excise and VAT rates remaining widely divergent.  Agreement on a definite VAT regime and acceptance of origin/destination seems as far apart as ever.  Many anomalies continue to exist. Equally, intra-EU duty and tax free sales have coexisted with the Single Market since 1993 without any apparent ill effects on either.</P>
    <P>The industry, through the European Travel and Research Federation, has funded a wide ranging and comprehensive programme of independent research into the social and economic impacts arising from the proposed abolition of duty free sales.  Major findings included between 3,500 and 7,500 job losses in Ireland in transport, retailing, manufacturing and tourism; increases between £10 and £14 in the cost of travel to and from Ireland; many ferry routes facing closure, including direct Irish routes to Europe; the Irish Exchequer will lose twice as much as it might gain; there will be no gain from abolition to the UK, Dutch, Belgian and French public exchequers; replacement duty paid airport retail sales will be no more than one-third of the current levels, with profitability reduced by 70 per cent; and possible job losses in Europe of between 127,000 and 147,000 jobs.  The Irish Government's study on the direct impact of abolition confirms many of these findings and predicts in excess of 1,500 job losses in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Progress to date indicates a clear demand by the people of Europe, expressed through their democratically elected representatives in the European Parliament.  A great deal of political pressure has been brought to bear over the past number of months in this regard; I will return to this later.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a recommendation to the House and the Government.  Some Ministers at the recent ECOFIN discussions may have believed that by agreeing to a study or any change they would be overturning the original 1991 decision completely.  This would have been a step too far for many and could be seen as trying to roll back the Single Market.  It is not necessary to change the 1991 decision &mdash; only to change the date of its implementation.  Accepting the principle that there should be no duty free sales in a completed Single Market but that now is not the right time to abolish it would allow other member states to accept a further extension of the time.  Equally, if those involved in the campaign were persuaded to accept that this was the final extension of the <Col N="593" /> time limit, the dissenting member states and the Commission might be more flexible.</P>
    <P>It is very necessary for a political dialogue to get under way among supportive Governments on a possible solution.  The acceptance of the principle of no duty free sales in a Single Market, with any solution being understood as final, might offer a key to the making of progress.  The Irish Government can act as a facilitator in this process and, through bilateral contacts, create the necessary alliances for success.  Full use could be made of our embassy network to build the necessary support.</P>
    <P>There are precedents for a possible solution to the duty free issue in the agreement by Commissioner Monti and the Council to Sweden, Finland and Denmark restricting travellers' duty paid allowances to a 24 hour absence under Council Directive 96/99/EEC.  These directives involve the following rationale and language: first, a further extension to an extension because circumstances have changed since the original decision was taken; second, acceptance that the time is not right because introducing abolition on the originally extended date would cause greater problems than had been envisaged; and, third, recognition that these provisions represent a derogation from a fundamental principle of the internal market.</P>
    <P>This rationale can be fully applied to the duty free issue and may offer a model for a political solution.  It appears that Commissioner Monti is being inconsistent by accepting further extensions to these derogations for such a fundamental freedom of the Single Market for the Nordic countries and yet being totally intransigent on the duty free issue.  A further extension, similar to that granted to the Nordic countries, is surely not only reasonable and equitable but a pragmatic and honourable solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the case made by the Government on the retention of duty free sales and against the present proposals in this regard. Since Ireland began duty free shopping approximately 50 years ago it has become an important part of the travel and tourism business in many parts of Ireland.  It is a vibrant business that makes a valuable fiscal contribution in Ireland and throughout Europe.  The EU directives passed in 1991 and 1992 and agreed to by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, allow intra-EU duty free sales to continue until 30 June 1999.  We know that duty free sales were originally to end in 1992 but agreement was reached to allow inter-EU duty free sales a stay of execution on the grounds that its immediate abolition would have a serious effect on those involved in the industry.  Ireland is particularly vulnerable as ours is a peripheral nation with a small open economy, and as such we are heavily dependent on our air and sea links with Europe. The loss of duty free revenue will have a heavy impact in many areas, such as the air and sea passenger sector, where it has helped carriers to <Col N="594" /> control costs, to maintain competitiveness and to allow greater investment.  Its abolition would affect the tourism sector through increased access costs and manufacturing costs through increased transport costs.</P>
      <P>A major benefit of duty free revenue has been increased investment in equipment and facilities. Its abolition would lead to an increase in airport charges to compensate airports for the loss of duty free revenues, and that increase would then be passed on to travellers.  The European Travel Research Foundation suggests that air fares within the EU would increase by 20 per cent on average per return journey.</P>
      <P>The maritime sector would be affected by the abolition of duty free sales because there would be increased passenger fares due to reduced income for carriers.  Certain low profit routes could be closed; routes out of Cork would be particularly vulnerable.  There would be increased environmental damage because a reduced number of ferry routes would lead to increases in the length and number of road movements.  Investment in new ships might be jeopardised if the numbers of passengers decreases.</P>
      <P>Cheap access fares have fuelled the growth of Irish tourism, and duty free sales have been a factor in the development of certain regions, such as Shannon.  However, that airport would be proportionately less affected as it has a higher proportion of extra EU duty free sales.  However, 50 per cent of its duty free sales are from intra-Community trade, and that is an important factor. Regional airports would also be vulnerable.</P>
      <P>Certain sectors of Irish manufacturing would also suffer, as duty free facilities are a vital shop window and retail channel for many Irish goods. We do not have to list the range of goods from crafts to those of Irish Distillers; we know the importance of duty free sales as a shop window for these goods.  The European duty free lobby suggests that over 140,000 jobs in the EU depend on duty free sales and that 30,000 would be lost if it is abolished.  Depending on the report one reads, from 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be lost in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Ironically the Irish EU Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, is responsible for Employment and Social Affairs.  The European Parliament recently voted unanimously for a study of the effect of the abolition of duty free sales to be conducted. The Government is kicking to touch on this issue and I ask Government Senators to ensure that the Minister for Public Enterprise, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are concentrating on this.  They have an important input regarding the resolution of this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government now wants the abolition of duty free sales to be put on hold until that study is completed.  One can understand the conflict of interest when one considers that the present Taoiseach was instrumental in agreeing to the abolition of duty free sales; he is now compromised in dealing with the matter as Taoiseach. Last 17 March, the Minister for Public Enterprise <Col N="595" /> came under pressure on this issue at the Council of EU Transport Ministers.  I hope that, with the help of Fine Gael lobbying and the network of contacts made during our successful EU Presidency, she will be successful.  This is not a party political issue; all parties, to my knowledge, want the same outcome to this debate.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise's proposal to the Council for an impact study was supported by her colleagues at the Council of EU Transport Ministers.  On 3 April the European Parliament called unanimously for an impact study of the socio-economic and regional impact of the abolition of intra-Community duty free sales.  This decision was then sent to all member states and the Commission, but a reply has yet to be received.  Our Minister for Finance requested another impact study at the ECOFIN meeting, and eight countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Greece, supported us.  Germany is overtly supporting us and is the only other country that, apart from supporting an impact study, has called for the maintenance of intra-Community duty free sales.</P>
    <P>An important issue has arisen in this debate on whether postponing decisions creates a precedent for overturning decisions made in Europe. Senator Cassidy alluded to it and there have been many debates here and in the Dáil on the democratic deficit and on the people's voice in member states in relation to the European Parliament. The views of the people in relation to duty free sales are clear, as are those of European trade unions, the European Parliament and eight members of ECOFIN, including France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom &mdash; some of the major players in Europe.  Yet there is a refusal to countenance revision of the original decision, taken in the late 1980s and put into directives in 1991 and 1992.</P>
    <P>As this debate gets more frustrating the less logical it becomes.  The initial decision on the abolition of duty free sales was taken on the need to harmonise tax and excise rates within the Single Market.  The policy of harmonising excise rates has long since been abandoned, so there is no logic in persisting with the abolition of duty free.  We can defend our revision of the decision taken on the directives of 1991-2 by saying that the Commission has abandoned that planned harmonisation. Given that that was the plank for the abolition of duty free sales, logic dictates that we can revise the decision to abolish duty free.  The Government should put all its efforts into this.</P>
    <P>If we abolish duty free sales at ports of exit, there is nothing to stop a ferry company going from Ireland to the Netherlands &mdash; through three territorial waters &mdash; and selling goods at three different tax rates at sea.  A ferry company going through international waters could sell at the duty free rates we now have at our ports of exit.  There will be fiscal chaos if duty free sales are abolished. The abolition was to help with the harmonisation <Col N="596" /> of excise rates, as per the original reason, but if it results in fiscal chaos and the loss of the vendor control we now have at duty free shops in the EU, we are on a hiding to nothing.  To remove duty free facilities would result in extra chaos because of people travelling through international and territorial waters and airspace, all of which have different tax rates.  There would be nothing to stop on-flight or on-board sales of goods at different rates and this would cause chaos.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If it ain't broke, don't fix it,&rdquo;; it is not broken and duty free sales have been extremely successful. Ireland introduced this concept 50 years ago that other countries adopted very successfully. The Government must make every effort to ensure that this very successful industry, which accounts for £68 million in sales in Ireland alone, is preserved, despite its difficulty in being party to the original proposal to abolish it.  It can use the political and popular support across the board to ensure abolition is not proceeded with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on tax and duty free shopping post 1999.  It is argued that Ireland is particularly vulnerable to the negative impacts of abolition due to its island and peripheral status.  We are a small open economy which is heavily dependent on air and sea transport links with its trading partners as a result of having no land boundary with Europe.  The loss of intra-EU duty free revenue, it is argued, will have a significant impact for both air and sea passengers as well as on tourism and the manufacturing sector because of the potential need to increase access costs.  Historically, the benefits of duty free have allowed carriers control fares thus allowing Ireland remain competitive.  In addition, investment in equipment and infrastructure has been made possible by using revenues generated by duty free sales.</P>
      <P>It is argued that the abolition of duty free is against the Treaty of Rome's objective of free movement of people between member states as fewer people will be able to afford to access parts of Europe due to higher air and sea fares as a result of increased airport charges being passed on to passengers.  Further effects of abolition would be reduced revenue to airlines due to lower on board sales, increased staff costs for airlines where an element of cabin crew pay is a share of in-flight duty free revenue, further pressure on regional airports to survive and charter traffic switching to non-EU destinations.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has publicly indicated that airport charges could increase by up to 50 per cent and that, should it not be in a position to generate similar profits to those likely to be foregone, it would have to turn to alternative sources of business to fund urgent investment in new runways and facilities.  To date, improvements in infrastructure have been funded from its own resources, much of which has come from duty and tax free sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="597" /> The maritime sector has indicated that the loss will mean reduced income to carriers thus requiring higher passenger fares to retain existing profitability, and increased environmental damage as fewer ferry routes and higher freight charges lead to more and longer road movements and increased congestion.  For the ferry business in particular abolition will come at a time when the maritime industry will have to respond to increased pressures on costs as a result of agreed improvements to safety requirements.  New investment in modern ships crucially depends on the number of people travelling in order to make investment worthwhile.  Should the costs of air travel increase too significantly, the ferry business may well benefit from a transfer of air passengers.</P>
    <P>The advent of cheap access fares has fuelled the growth in tourism and passenger numbers.  A reversal of this would put such growth at risk.  The greatest adverse impact is likely to be experienced in local economies and premier tourism destinations which are located in the remoter areas of the country.  The duty free business has played a significant role in regional development &mdash; for example, Shannon Duty Free &mdash; and continues to play a role in ensuring the economic viability of regional airports such as Cork, Knock, Kerry, Galway and Donegal.  Furthermore, it is claimed that duty free shops provide an important shop window and unique distribution channel for Irish manufactured goods and are seen as a vital element in the world market success of many of Ireland's leading brands.  For a small number of Irish suppliers duty free outlets are their only sales outlets.</P>
    <P>In particular, the duty and tax free industry is seen by industry as a generator of employment and any reduction in its scale will have an employment impact.  This is at odds, it is argued, with the objectives of the European Commission which has consistently espoused job creation and retention.  The duty free lobby suggests that over 140,000 jobs, directly and indirectly, in the EU are dependent on the industry and that these jobs are at risk should abolition occur.  Unions argue that the reduction in employment will mean the aviation sector will be a less attractive industry for workers as salaries are reduced and the industry becomes casualised, with the main impact being on females who account for 90 per cent of duty-free employees.</P>
    <P>It is argued that the benefits of duty free are being sacrificed for the sake of a principle of harmonisation while the reality of the internal market is significantly different.  It contains many exceptions and anomalies with widely divergent excise duty and VAT rates ranging from zero to 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>The continuing statements by the European Commission confirming the abolition of duty free late next year have generated much discussion and concern about the effects of the decision on the Irish and other EU economies.  A number of national and EU wide organisations have been established to argue the case for retention of duty <Col N="598" /> free and they have published a range of reports predicting significant job losses, a reduction in tourism numbers and an increase in air and sea fares.</P>
    <P>Because of the general concern of the many interested parties on the impact of the EU proposal, including airlines, ferry companies, airport and port operators, tourist interests and industry, the Department of Finance decided to commission an independent study to establish the precise impact of the potential abolition of duty free sales on direct employment, travel costs and the Exchequer.  The key findings were that total intra-EU duty and tax free sales in 1997 were in excess of £100 million, including £64 million by Aer Rianta which contributed significantly to the financing of major transport infrastructure.  In 1996, Aer Rianta generated a contribution of £38 million from duty and tax free sales.  By the turn of the century this figure could reach £60 million.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the study found that not all duty and tax free sales will be lost as they will continue in the context of non-EU destinations.  Counter arguments to the negative effects of abolition include reference to the fact that some passengers will continue to purchase duty and tax paid goods while the opportunity exists to increase sales on certain tax paid goods such as perfumes and cosmetics by absorbing VAT.  Also there will be an opportunity and incentive for the authority to introduce new forms of retail sales.</P>
    <P>It is agreed that airport charges will have to increase to replace some of the lost contribution made by duty free.  A 50 per cent increase on the current discounted average passenger charge by Aer Rianta will mean an increase of £1.58.  Of course, the actual allowable level of increase will be a matter for the Government.  Airlines which sell duty and tax free goods generate a contribution in excess of £1 per passenger, a figure which is verifiable.</P>
    <P>Taking all factors into account, including the loss of in-flight duty and tax free sales as well as any contribution to cabin crew salaries, and assuming a 50 per cent increase in current airport discounted charges, the impact of abolition corresponds to an average increase in air access fares of up to £10 per return journey on intra-EU routes.  Airlines have indicated they will have to pass on any increase to passengers given their tight profit margins.  However, airlines strongly argue that Aer Rianta, and presumably the authorities of other affected airports, should absorb all if not some of these increases through improved operational efficiencies.  Air freight rates are unlikely to increase materially because of the keen competitiveness of the freight sector.</P>
    <P>Duty free income is particularly important for regional airports all of which operate in difficult economic circumstances and most of which are already in receipt of some form of subvention.  In the aviation sector the total number of full time equivalent jobs directly associated with the duty free sector is 466 of which 444 relate to the airport sector.  Not all these jobs are at risk and few <Col N="599" /> may be lost in airlines.  Most of the potential jobs at risk in the air sector are part-time, contractual and seasonal, although I am not sure I agree with this finding by the investigative study.  I am not sure I agree with that finding.</P>
    <P>I am bothered by the impact this move will have on the Exchequer.  It has been said &mdash; there are figures to back up this point &mdash; that there could be an inflow of funds of up to £30 million to £45 million into the Exchequer.  I hope people in the Department of Finance are not considering receipts which may be helpful to them as against the overall impact on the country which will be expansive in terms of jobs and the commerciality of duty free.</P>

      <P>I support the call for the retention of duty free status after 1999.  Duty free was first introduced in Shannon Airport, generated substantial business and was an important part of the financial development of that airport and Aer Rianta.  We are members of the EU and the reason for the removal of duty free is to simplify and regulate the Single Market in which we have agreed in principle to participate.  The transition period of seven years will end in 1999 and we must make the changes recommended by the Commission and the European Parliament.  These changes will create many difficulties for those involved in the duty free sector.</P>
      <P>Duty free is a substantial business and comprises 1 per cent of trade and sales within the European Union.  It is a strong and growing sector and employs somewhere in the region of 150,000 people.  There is a huge dependence on duty free and it plays an important part in the economy of the State, particularly in the semi State sector in the areas of air and ferry travel. The Government along with other EU member states must find a way to alleviate the difficulties which will be faced when this decision is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the Irish Retail Newsagents Association made a submission to the General Assembly in Athens in support of the retention of duty free status after 1999.  It outlined the importance of duty free and made a strong case for its retention.  The association was supported by the Stena Line ferry service which is hugely dependent on profits made from duty free sales. It is essential to retain these profits in order to implement the reinvestment programme necessary to retain the service.  As an island economy, we depend very much on the services provided by air and ferry companies and by our airports. The ferry companies must reinvest in order to meet recently introduced safety regulations.  A <Col N="600" /> change of this nature and magnitude would place a huge financial strain on these companies.</P>
    <P>I come from a regional area and have firsthand knowledge of the dependence on duty free of airports such as Shannon, Knock, Donegal and Cork.  These changes would have a massive impact on the long-term and, indeed, the short term viability of these airports and would pose a serious financial challenge to their sustainability. The seriousness of the situation was strongly outlined at recent meetings with the Government and the Minister for Finance.  Up to 40 per cent of the turnover at Knock Airport is as a result of duty free sales.</P>
    <P>As regards Aer Rianta, duty free sales help to subsidise reasonably priced landing charges at airports which has an effect on the development of the tourism sector.  A long-term investment plan is in place in the tourism area.  According to studies carried out, there is no doubt but that the tourism sector is dependent on reasonably priced air and ferry fares which are subsidised by profits made in the duty free sector.</P>
    <P>There has been a transition period of seven years and the Commission will argue that the retention of duty free is not in line with the purpose of a single market.  The Commission believes we have had sufficient time to make the necessary changes.  Approximately 150,000 people are employed in this sector and while I accept we have had a transition period, it should be extended.  If not, serious decisions will have to be made by Governments to sustain and help companies which will face difficulties and which have developed this area of business which is important to them.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta has been a pioneer in terms of the development of duty free in America, Russia and elsewhere.  It has developed a huge business and has provided much employment.  It will face great difficulties diversifying and finding ways to replace this business.  I accept we agreed to the seven year period ending in 1999.  However, given the importance of duty free to the economy and the companies involved in the provision of air and ferry services, it is important the Government pursues a strong position and works with our European partners to bring about a positive change &mdash; perhaps through the study proposed &mdash; extending the transition period thus enabling companies to make changes which will alleviate the difficulties which will arise in 1999.</P>

      <P>Senator Chambers was very eloquent and there is only one minute of his time left.  May I call Senator Ryan next and then Senator Moylan?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am ambivalent about this matter for a variety of reasons.  Beyond doubt, the duty free provision is an anomaly.  However, an eminent free market economist from UCD with whom I seldom agree asked me once what is wrong with anomalies?  There is nothing wrong with them.  The continued existence of the Irish <Col N="601" /> language is probably an anomaly.  It should have been wiped out 100 years ago if one was to work on the principles of free market economics because it serves no purpose.  Anomalies distinguish human beings and their behaviour from that of animals, which do not have the capacity to reason, although I am unsure we have that capacity to any great extent.</P>
      <P>While the fact that something is anomalous should not mean that we should retain it, I have another reason to be hostile to the abolition of duty free.  The driving force for its elimination are the ideologues of Brussels, who have a peculiar view of what constitutes a single market.  In some cases they are for protection while in others they favour the maximum exposure to competition. One would have great difficulty in working out the tax breaks available to many of the officials working in Brussels <i>vis-à-vis</i> both their national taxation regimes and any others.  It would also be difficult to establish the highly anomalous position of many of them in terms of taxation of their incomes and various other benefits because of the extraordinary opaqueness of the Brussels bureaucracy when it comes to any exposure of its activities.  It is perhaps the least transparent institution of supranational Government in the world and it does a great job in covering its tracks.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission meets and does its business in private, claims to itself the right to initiate legislation, gives lectures about anomalies and says that because something is anomalous we should not have it.  As a democrat, if I was to eliminate anomalies the first to go would be the EU Commission because it is anomalous in a democracy to have an appointed body with so much exclusive power unaccountable to the electorate.</P>
      <P>However, although I was one of the Members of the Oireachtas who was against the Single Market, it was approved.  I have never believed and still do not believe in free trade.  Many economists have concluded that free trade often disadvantages underdeveloped countries and that varying degrees of protection are needed behind which countries can develop.  The development of south-east Asia, to the extent it happened and was not a fiction, occurred behind various forms of trading barriers, much to the fury of the US. Japan developed by protecting its industries and by making space for itself to grow behind protection barriers while at the same time using relatively free access to the US to build its export industry.  One of Japan's current problems is that it could export its way out of its present crisis, but that would upset the US so much that it has voluntarily refrained from exporting at the rate it could following the effective collapse of the yen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anomalies are part of trade and we should not, therefore, believe that there is a perfectly smooth free trade area.  They are also the backbone of the development of many of the countries that have succeeded in catching up with the west over the last 30 years.  Korea has used protectionism <Col N="602" /> very effectively, as has Taiwan.  So did Hong Kong.  Japan continues to do so.  Given this, we should not worry about duty free from the point of view of anomalies, rather we should worry more about the fact that, yet again, we are in the process of surrendering one of the instruments of policy that a peripheral country often needs to develop.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in protectionism <i>per se,</i> nor do I believe that there can ultimately be a well developed economy behind protection barriers. However, in many instances there is a case for different regimes at different levels of development. I also have a sentimental attachment to the fact that it increasingly appears the things we invented which have been very useful in assisting development are most under threat.  We invented duty free at Shannon and the rest of the world copied us.  We will have to abolish it, at least as far as travel within the EU is concerned.  We also invented a very favourable tax regime for multinational corporations, but to judge by many of the pronouncements from the President of the European Central Bank, that anomaly may be in his sights in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>While I have no problem with duty free <i>per se</i> because it is an anomaly, I have a problem with the things that are most available and attractive in duty free.  I must declare an interest.  My partner in life smokes and one of my sacred duties if I am travelling abroad is to acquire the maximum number of legal cigarettes at the minimum price.</P>
    <P>On the most extreme estimate, the allegedly horrific &mdash; in many cases correctly described as such &mdash; illicit drugs kill 200,00 people on the planet annually.  According to the UN, alcohol and tobacco between them kill five million people annually.  Explain the logic of a system which makes the two substances which are 25 times more hazardous to human life cheaper than the substances against which there is a worldwide war?  I enjoy whiskey enormously and I like buying it in duty free shops.  I like the selection.  My wife, who is important in my life, likes the fact that we can buy cheap cigarettes.  However, what is the rationale facilitating their cheap purchase?</P>
    <P>Cigarettes and alcohol are the only two things that are spectacularly cheaper in duty free shops. On the couple of occasions I could make a comparison, I found that electrical goods offered at tax free prices at Heathrow Airport were not cheaper than those in many of the downtown cut throat competitive electrical goods shops in London. I am not convinced that there is anything significantly cheaper in duty free shops other than drinks and tobacco.  There no logic in making these two commodities, especially tobacco, cheaper all over the world.  The health aspect of duty free shops is one we do not advert to very often.  However, it is very difficult to justify making commodities such as alcohol and tobacco cheaper than they are.</P>
    <P>I have wrestled with myself over the years and have concluded that, notwithstanding the health issue, I would prefer if duty free was preserved <Col N="603" /> because I like the eccentricities and anomalies of life.  I do not believe its abolition would close down Cork Airport, Knock Airport or any other airport.  It might close down Ryanair.  If so, I would not be too sorry.  Apart from that I do not hold strong views on the issue.  However, I will sign the petition, but do not expect me to be on the barricades on 1 January 1999 defending the duty free system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>If we heeded the points raised by Senator Brendan Ryan there would be no need for doctors.  Similarly, if we did not drive cars there would be far fewer crashes.  However, unfortunately, people both smoke and drink.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to highlight the serious consequences of the European Commission's proposal to abolish duty free sales within the EU.  The determination of every Member of the Oireachtas is necessary to ensure this issue is kept to the forefront of debate and people allowed to express their opposition to this pointless course of action.  It is estimated that if duty free were abolished, Aer Rianta would stand to lose in the region of £40 million per annum.  That would have serious effects on the airlines' profitability and would also have a detrimental effect on shipping companies, particularly those who offer economy rate fares.  The abolition would also result in serious loss of employment in Ireland and the EU in general.  The jobs which would be lost are not confined to the retail trade in the airport and ferry duty free shops; many distributors, manufacturers and others are also involved in this £4 billion business.</P>
      <P>The consequences of duty free abolition would be particularly serious for Ireland as a peripheral country which has no land link with the rest of the EU.  Transport costs would inevitably rise to make up the loss in income which would be experienced by many air and ferry companies, a significant part of whose income derives from duty free sales.  Ireland, as a tourism destination and exporting island nation, could not afford an increase in transport costs.</P>
      <P>We are told duty free is being abolished in the interests of tax harmonisation.  However, there is no tax harmonisation among EU states, neither are there any substantial proposals before the Commission to promote it.  If there is unlikely to be tax harmonisation, why is it proposed to abolish duty free sales?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The popularity of the duty free trade stands as a formidable defence against any criticisms which may be levelled at it.  It represents good value as well as a very effective shop window for many fine Irish products.  It is indicative of the democratic deficit which exists within the European Commission that it seeks to abolish this very popular business which has recently gained support for its retention from a number of European countries.  I hope the highlighting of this issue will encourage cross-party support for the retention of duty free throughout Ireland and the EU.  We <Col N="604" /> must publicise the issue as often as possible in order to convince some of our European neighbours who do not appreciate the severity of the proposed action.</P>
    <P>Duty free sales commenced at Shannon Airport more than 50 years ago and great strides have been made since then.  In Germany, both Houses of Parliament have passed resolutions seeking the continuation of duty free sales.  The economic and monetary affairs and transport committees of the European Parliament have held a joint public hearing on the issue.  The Taoiseach raised the matter at the EU summit on employment.  Major demonstrations have taken place in Brussels on this issue and we must compliment worker directors throughout the EU who ensured that in excess of 6,000 people protested. Aer Rianta workers and others were to the fore in supporting those demonstrations which served to make people aware of the very real problems faced from an employment point of view.</P>
    <P>We compliment the highly successful initiative taken by the Minister for Public Enterprise at the Transport Council on 17 March where she called for a study to be completed on the matter by September 1998 and sent to ECOFIN.  That resolution was passed unanimously by the plenary session of the European Parliament on 12 April.  The finance commission of the Italian Parliament also passed a resolution calling for the postponement of the abolition of duty free and the Italian Government accepted the resolution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has received letters of support on this issue from a number of heads of government. Chancellor Kohl stated the abolition is no longer cogent at this time and Spain is fully supportive of the Irish stance on the issue.  France is of the opinion that the battle is not yet over and stresses the need for the possible effects of abolition to be addressed.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, regretted the lack of consensus on the issue at ECOFIN and suggested further talks.</P>
    <P>There are a number of good reasons duty free should be retained.  Duty free shopping is one of the EU's most successful and dynamic industries, having commenced in Shannon more than 50 years ago and with a current annual turnover of more than £4.5 billion, of which £100 million is generated in Ireland.  More than six million people avail of duty free and tax free shopping at Irish outlets alone each year.  Duty fee and tax free shopping directly generate more than 140,000 jobs in the EU and 2,000 jobs in Ireland alone.  As a former board member of Aer Rianta, I want to put on record the importance of duty free to its development.  Many other excellent companies also depend on duty free and we will work together to ensure duty free sales continue into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on duty free status.  The Labour Party has had a motion on the Seanad Order Paper for some time calling on the Government to support the European Union <Col N="605" /> campaign for the retention of the duty free status at airports and ferry terminals.</P>
      <P>Unlike Senator Ryan, I am unambiguous in my support for the retention of duty free status.  I do not see it as an infringement of tax harmonisation.  The abolition of duty free status is a measure which discriminates against small countries, island nations in particular.</P>
      <P>Ironically, we recently discussed the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Bill.  This legislation enabled Aer Rianta to change its statutory structure from that of semi-State body to that a commercial enterprise operating with the Minister as the sole shareholder.  That had already happened in practice.  Since its foundation, Aer Rianta has been one of our most successful commercial enterprises.  It was one of the first Irish multinational companies, establishing a structure for duty free shopping and selling that structure to the world.  Aer Rianta runs duty free operations in 14 countries.  Duty free accounts for 50 per cent of Aer Rianta's profits.  Aer Rianta was targeted for commercial status because it has been the most successful of our semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>We have to do more to ensure we maintain the duty free status at our airports and ferry ports. We are an island state with a huge number of exit and access points by air and sea.  Regional airports also have duty free sections.</P>
      <P>The pass was sold in November 1991 when, at a meeting of the European Union Council of Ministers, Ireland did not see fit to send a single representative.  Not only was the then Minister for Finance, the present Taoiseach, not in attendance, but there was not a single Irish representative to argue the point.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the information I have. Maybe the Minister can correct me.  If there was someone in attendance, the point was not argued and the Minister responsible was not there to pitch for Ireland and argue the case.</P>
      <P>The pass was sold in 1991 and there is no use in the Minister for Public Enterprise shedding crocodile tears and getting all the EU Transport Ministers to agree that they will retain duty free status when there is no such activity from the Minister for Finance or the Taoiseach.  There has been a lethargic approach to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was Deputy Quinn who, as Minister for Finance, first decided to do something about it.  He commissioned a report from KPMG, in association with Fitzpatrick Consultants and MDS Transmodel, to examine the implications for Ireland of the abolition of duty free status.  That report, published in March 1998, was very damaging. It showed that 466 jobs would be lost in the aviation industry with a resultant spin-off loss of employment in production and associated activities. At the ferry ports 700 jobs would be lost. The potential number of job losses will have <Col N="606" /> grown since then as the tourist industry has grown.</P>
    <P>The report also indicated that abolition would result in increases in air fares when we are trying to work toward decreases in fares to improve passenger mobility.  It noted that this would damage regional airports, which operate on a shoestring budget and need as much business as possible. They require weekend business and short hops.  Journeys of that type are more attractive with duty free available.</P>
    <P>The ferry routes could be endangered by the abolition of duty free status.  Aer Rianta stated that it would have to increase landing charges if duty free status was abolished.  There has been criticism of landing charges as they stand.  That is another factor which could damage our tourist industry.</P>
    <P>The majority of our air traffic is to and from the United Kingdom.  Short term visitors to and from there are offered an extra incentive to travel by the availability of duty free products.  The abolition of duty free status would damage this section of the market.</P>
    <P>The argument has been made that this is an anti-competition measure by the European Union and that duty free status opposes all standard approaches to tax harmonisation.  There is no tax harmonisation in the European Union. Duty free is an opportunity for us to display our wares at the point of entry or exit.  We are an island nation and harmonisation of tax would militate against us.  The greater transport costs for goods because of our island status have to be balanced with attracting people to the island and enticing them to spend more in it.</P>
    <P>Duty free status is one of this State's most important inventions.  The notion was exported throughout the world and it is relished by all consumers. It is of considerable material and employment advantage and only someone indulging in sour grapes would seek to have it abolished.</P>

      <P>I would correct Senator Costello on one point.  There was no Minister for Finance in November 1991 at the time of the ECOFIN meeting.  It was an <i>interregnum</i> period and Ireland was represented by a permanent representative, which is usual in the absence of a Minister.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that the Programme for Government set out our commitment to resist the EU plans to abolish duty free shopping after June 1999 and we remain fully committed to that aim.  Like most Senators and Deputies, I have received a number of representations from people who are likely to be affected and I am also supportive of the extensive campaign being mounted by the duty free industry to reverse this decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the efforts by Irish Governments in this regard have not yet been echoed in all EU states.  Ireland has made all the running on this issue, apart from one early intervention <Col N="607" /> by Finland at Council level.  No other member state has brought the matter on to the Council agenda.  Finland now seems to have lost interest in discussing this matter at EU Council level. Only the Irish have pushed this topic at EU level and we have pushed it hard, although it will affect all 15 member states.</P>
    <P>Ireland was the first into the fray on the duty free issue.  We were also probably the first to seek to assess the direct impact of ending duty free, by a study undertaken by independent consultants which we have since published.  The danger is that this subject is being seen in Europe as a peculiarly Irish problem and is presented as one which only the Irish wish to see discussed.  Some other states are still assessing in detail the likely implications for them of the ending of duty free.  The impact of ending duty free in all member states is not identical.  States bordering the Baltic Sea and Germany are likely to be disproportionately affected if the volume of ferry traffic on those routes is reduced as a result of increasing fare prices.</P>
    <P>A number of countries have taken the view that the decision has already been taken; it has been enacted into law; the issue is past and no purpose would be served by re-examining it or undertaking a study.  They further argue that to conduct such a study would only raise the expectations of the industry that a further postponement of the day when it ends might be considered, at a time when the duty free industry and the carriers should be devoting their efforts to minimising the consequences of a long announced decision.  They do not want any further study or any reconsideration of the decision.</P>
    <P>The efforts by the Taoiseach at the European Summit and the Ministers for Finance and Public Enterprise are well known.  Minister of State, Deputy Flood, also raised the issue at the EU Tourism Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels, given the concerns about the possible impact of the proposed measure on the development of the tourism industry generally.</P>
    <P>In recent times we have had a little more success in getting other states to ask questions.  At ECOFIN in May, France and Germany were supportive of a study, but a large number of member states still oppose it, as does the Commission.  The position has now improved notably with France and Germany coming on side, but further support from workers in those countries still opposed is needed if any change is to happen.  Two years ago only Ireland supported the call to save duty free.</P>
    <P>I assure the Seanad that the Government is using every opportunity to raise this issue at political level in the appropriate EU fora and to suggest the need for reconsideration by the member states and the European Commission of the implications of the abolition of intra-EU duty free.  There is something of an inconsistency in holding summits on Europe's appalling unemployment problem and then condemning the duty <Col N="608" /> free trade.  We do not want to add to the EU jobless statistics.  The Minister for Finance is maintaining close contact with the interest groups, including trade unions, who are particularly interested in the topic and he met with them as recently as last Friday to consider future options that may be available.</P>
    <P>It may be useful to give some background to the decision already taken to end intra-EU tax free and duty free shopping in 1999.  Although it may seem like a facility that has always been widely available to Irish travellers within the EU, duty free and tax free sales were not available to travellers between Britain and Ireland until 1978 &mdash; the facility was confined to continental and third country destinations before that date.  The extension of the concession to Irish Sea routes, both air and sea services and the duty free shops at airports serving passengers travelling to those UK destinations, was undoubtedly made in response to the difficulties faced by the tourism and travel sectors at that time.  The decision undoubtedly arose from consideration of the frightful situation in Northern Ireland which had knock-on effects on our tourist business.  In that matter things have substantially improved and recent developments give grounds for optimism that apparently impossible problems can be solved.</P>
    <P>According to the EU Commission there is no good reason why one should be able to buy duty free goods when travelling by plane from Paris to Rome or Hamburg to Marseilles.  One cannot buy duty free goods if one takes a train or drives between the same two places.  What is so special about air or sea travel that it requires special tax concessions?</P>
    <P>The Commission has consistently argued that duty free sales are not appropriate for a single market without internal frontiers and has set its face on getting rid of this option for air and sea travellers.  It asks why such facilities should be available for persons using air travel but not for those who cross frontiers by car or take a train to another country within the EU?</P>
    <P>This inter-modal fiscal distortion problem, as the Commission would describe it, is of particular relevance on the Continent with the development of high-speed rail links in competition with air services on journeys such as Amsterdam to Paris. Journey times have fallen dramatically and competition is strong between rail and air services.</P>
    <P>I mention this because it would be unfair to the Commission to give the impression that its negative attitude to duty free is based on purely dogmatic views relating to duty free shopping or that its prime objective is to make people more miserable, as some form of perverse commemoration of the single market.</P>
    <P>As part of the package of single market measures adopted unanimously in 1991 and 1992, the 12 EU member states decided to allow the continuation of duty free and tax free sales for intra-Community travellers only until 30 June 1999.  This was agreed as part of a comprehensive <Col N="609" /> series of Single Market tax measures, including substantial changes to the entitlements of travellers to bring in tax paid goods more freely.  From 1 January 1993, travellers from EU countries benefited from enhanced entitlements to import items tax paid from other EU states and easier border controls, including the elimination of routine customs checks on incoming travellers.</P>
    <P>The duty free operators were made aware of the proposal to end duty free in 1992 and for many years before that they were active in lobbying for the extension of time.  The suggestion, sometimes made, that an indefinite retention of duty free could have been negotiated as part of an agreed solution allowing the Single Market to go ahead at that time, is too fantastic to be credible.</P>
    <P>The strategy of seeking extra time was fully supported by Ireland, but was only reluctantly accepted by the EU Commission and some member states who wanted an immediate end to EU duty free.  The extension to the end of June 1999, set out in Directives 91/680/EEC and 92/12/EEC, was agreed, not because the EU Commission was ambivalent about the decision to end duty free and tax free sales or was willing to accept permanent retention, but to allow the duty free operators, including those Irish operators who are very active in this sector, time to diversify their activities.  This agreement to defer was generally welcomed in Ireland, as it had been originally planned that duty and tax free sales would end in January 1993 for EU travellers.</P>
    <P>It is only intra-EU travel which will be affected by this decision.  Duty free facilities will still be available after 1999 for travel to destinations outside the EU.  This is a point of particular importance, not only to Shannon Airport, which has long served the needs of transatlantic travellers, but also to Dublin Airport, which has a reasonable amount of business with non-EU destinations, including the USA.  In this regard I welcome the strong growth of traffic on north Atlantic routes this year.  A new and welcome operator is Continental Airlines, which now provides service to Newark from Dublin and Shannon. Aer Lingus is also offering more capacity on the North Atlantic services this year than ever before.  This should help sustain the duty free operations at Shannon and at Dublin.</P>
    <P>The duty free industry has progressed considerably from its effective beginnings in a small shop at Shannon Airport in 1947.  It is business which is now widespread, which is influential in promoting brands to travellers and which is of great importance to certain carriers and airport operators. From that shop at Shannon, a large industry has grown.  In 1996 over 700,000 bottles of liquor were sold in the duty free shop at Heathrow Terminal Two alone, together with 83 million cigarettes. Some asked what that was doing for people's health.  However, these are the statistics.  According to some indicators, the worldwide total of duty free sales through all channels is estimated to exceed $20 billion.  Of this, the volume of <Col N="610" /> activity is estimated to have reached a level of almost six billion ECU in Europe in 1996 alone and in Ireland is now estimated to be well in excess of £100 million.  At this kind of level, it is easy to appreciate the significant contribution which the profit from duty free sales makes towards the overall viability of the travel industry.</P>
    <P>The income from duty free sales has long been recognised as playing a key role in the commercial plans of some transport operators.  Operators have been using the profits from duty free sales to cross-subsidise other activities.  For example, the cost of airport landing charges is lower as a result of profits from duty free sales in airport duty free shops and basic ticket prices paid by travellers are consequently lower.  The study conducted for the Department of Finance by KPMG, which was published some months ago, made this point clear.  The extent to which fares will have to increase after 1999 can be argued but everyone accepts the fact that operators are able to offer lower ticket prices as a result of the profit that they make from duty free sales.</P>
    <P>Additionally, the profits from duty free have been used to help finance capital investment projects at Irish airports.  Aer Rianta recently opened fine new terminal facilities at Dublin which will help reduce congestion at the departure gates during busy periods.  Last year a record number of over ten million passengers used Dublin Airport alone.  Airports are major job creators and are seen as powerful regional economic generators which help to create prosperity and employment in the regions.  It is ironic that it is these regional airports which will be hard hit by the negative effects following on the abolition of intra-EU duty and tax free sales.</P>
    <P>The cross channel ferry industry has been able to use such profits to help its investment program. New ships are expensive and the cross-channel trade is still seasonal.  Not only does the profit help the investment programme for some marginal routes and some of our regional airports which have a hard time getting by, but the availability of duty free sales is a key element in their survival.  I know this is the case with Knock Airport where duty free sales represent about 50 per cent of profits.</P>
    <P>A key argument for retention is that it helps to keep the cost of travel down, and of particular significance for an island nation like ourselves is that it keeps access costs down generally.  The number of people who choose to visit Ireland has been steadily increasing over the years and the numbers are expected to continue increasing.  All this activity underpins employment opportunities, not only in the duty free stores themselves but also in the supply and distribution chain.  By keeping the cost of access down, the employment in the tourist industry generally is maintained.</P>
    <P>It is partly the scale and volume of the industry now that creates the problem we face; yet it gives me grounds for hope for a change of heart and of opinion among those opposed to the retention of intra-EU duty free and tax free shopping after <Col N="611" /> June 1999.  This is a decision affecting many people and places, from Finland to Greece.  It is not just an Irish problem and I wish more people in Europe would recognise that it is an issue on which they must make their feelings known. However interesting an additional debate in the House may be to us all, I would prefer to see first debates on the topic in the other parliaments throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>As one travels about Europe one cannot but notice the &ldquo;keep duty free&rdquo; logos at airports and on ferries.  To publicise the issue, Britannia Airways, the UK based charter carrier, has large produty free slogans on some of its aircraft.  As it has business in Germany, the text is in German as well as English.  It all helps to put across the message. This campaign to keep duty free is being undertaken across the EU but there is no need to convince the Irish.  Any decision to change this decision must be unanimous.  The problem is not to convince the Irish people or Government &mdash; we are already on side &mdash; but to convince the EU Commission and other member states.</P>
    <P>We are now within the final year.  The renewed debate about duty free in Ireland is of a long duration. Previous Ministers for Finance raised the matter at the ECOFIN Council as long ago as 1996 during the Irish Presidency.  It is only recently that the issue has received much attention in other countries.  As the seven and a half year transitional period up to 30 June 1999, which was agreed to allow duty free shop operators and suppliers to explore alternative ways of carrying on business, began to tick away, people across Europe began to sit up and take notice.  I and my colleagues will continue to keep the issue of duty free on the agenda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. Coming from the constituency of Mayo, which has a regional airport in Knock, he more than any Minister appreciates the importance of the issue.</P>
      <P>The decision made by the European Commission in 1992 to abolish duty free sales was derogated until 30 June 1999 from the initial date of 1 January 1993 when free trade in the Union was introduced.  The reason given for the abolition was tax harmonisation within the Union. The European Commission also promised an impact study on the social and economic factors affecting the Union.  They also promised an impact study on the effect throughout the European Community of the social and economic factors affecting the region.  Neither has happened so I cannot understand why we must plough on and not be given a further derogation. Very little was done in the five years between 1992 and 1997, especially by the industry here, to prepare for the event which is to take place on 30 June 1999.  However, I must exonerate Aer Rianta from this because they have carried on developing their overseas businesses to try to create further income to counteract the expected loss at Dublin and Shannon Airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> The impact study carried out by the Centre of Economic Business Research in London on behalf of SIPTU last year showed a potential loss of between 6,500 and 9,000 jobs by the year 2005. The tourism industry would also be affected with a loss of approximately 121,000 visitors by 2005. Overall, European jobs lost due to abolition throughout the Community would amount to between 112,000 and 147,000.  The number of job losses here has been variously estimated.</P>
    <P>The SIPTU report stated that ferry services would be particularly badly hit.  The viability of year round ferry routes to and from Ireland would be questionable.  The loss of employment would be most serious and one wonders at the seriousness of the Amsterdam Treaty effort and the EU commitment to job creation being a high priority.  The report also stated that there would be fare increases of at least £17 for outgoing passengers and up to £14 for incoming passengers. The drop in tourism numbers will be particularly serious for those in the hotel and tour operation businesses.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission should rethink this issue not alone because of the issues raised in the SIPTU report but for its own future.  In the recent Amsterdam Treaty referendum 68 per cent of those over 50 years of age voted for the Treaty but 45 per cent of those under 30 voted against. Young people are the future of any organisation or country.  Our young people are obviously alienated from European affairs yet the Commission is trying to abolish the most popular consumer orientated initiative in the world.  This is not the way to endear the EU to the ordinary consumer.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, for raising this important issue early this year, for winning support from her fellow European Transport Ministers and for highlighting the need to carry out an impact study.  Unfortunately, the meeting of the ECOFIN Ministers on 19 May did not unanimously support the efforts of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to have the impact study carried out.  Despite the KPMG report presented by Minister McCreevy to that meeting on the impact of the abolition of duty free in this country, he only received support from eight other Ministers.  This report which was referred to earlier by Senator Costello stated that the abolition would lead to fare increases and would undermine the viability of regional airports, many of which depend on duty free sales for their survival. It would also undermine the viability of the ferry routes.  The loss to the economy would amount to £65 billion and would be offset by a small gain of approximately £30 million to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>However, I do not believe all is lost.  The Commission undertook to prepare a working document clarifying the instruments available to member states for addressing the consequences of the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales on 1 July 1998.  The Commission also invited member states to carry out socio-economic impact studies at <Col N="613" /> national level and to submit their findings.  There was no final decision on reaffirmation by the Council of Finance Ministers that duty free would be abolished.  Indeed, the issue will be back on the ECOFIN agenda when the Commission presents its working document.</P>
    <P>On 3 April last, the EU Parliament overwhelmingly voted for a resolution calling on the Commission to carry out a socio-economic regional and revenue impact study of duty free abolition.  This resolution was not acted upon at the ECOFIN Ministers meeting.  However, the Commission should note that the Parliament is the only democratically elected body in the EU and I trust they will reverse their decision at a later date.</P>
    <P>The Commission and Commissioner Monti also agree that regional airports would not be viable without duty free and they have acknowledged that they may have to authorise subsidies to regional airports.  Both reports predict substantial job losses.  I do not believe the matter is as serious in the large airports such as Dublin and Shannon as has been claimed.  Travellers who shop in duty free facilities do not buy essential items.  The goods bought are mostly gifts and are often bought on impulse.  Many of the jobs in the larger airports will be saved because that market will remain.  A serious situation will develop for the regional airports.  Like the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, I have a regional airport in my area which is barely surviving. More than 50 per cent of its gross profit comes from duty free sales.  I can vouch for that because I am the company's accountant.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister of State to clarify the question of duty-free fuel sales.  The provision of this service to incoming flights is very important for regional airports.  If it is abolished our regional airports will become white elephants. Even if duty free sales are abolished something must be done for our regional airports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am impelled to speak because this is an important motion.  As a frequent traveller through Dublin Airport I make use of the duty-free facility there.  Due to my indifferent health I tend to avoid the alcohol and nicotine counters but I buy presents for friends, aftershave and so on.  I must pay tribute to the efficient and courteous manner in which the duty-free shop in Dublin Airport is organised.  I have always been dealt with well there and I have a great deal of sympathy for the employees.  It would be scandalous if they were needlessly thrown out of work.  There is an important employment element in this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise the fact that the concept of duty free is an Irish idea.  Dr. Brendan O'Regan, who is still with us as an elder statesman of Irish public life, came up with this ingenious idea 50 years ago.  It is one of those good Irish ideas which have been copied all over the world. Ireland, as the originator of this good idea, has a particular interest in it.  Like other speakers I pay tribute, not just to the Minster of State, but particularly to the Minister for Public Enterprise, <Col N="614" /> Deputy O'Rourke, who had the temerity to continue to try to reopen this issue when the bureaucrats of the European Union thought they had it nicely sorted out.  This was another example of how the game is played according to rules that favour the big boys and girls in Europe.  As a small nation we should continue to network with other small nations in this area.  I hope the issue will be properly reopened and that duty free shopping can continue.  There are jobs involved and its abolition could lead to an increase in fares, which would be most regrettable.</P>
    <P>I accept that the EU is anxious to standardise and homogenise all aspects of the Union.  Having completed the Customs Union there is an apparent logic in abolishing duty free shopping but that fails to understand the human element and the requirements and needs of small nations, particularly the nation that had the ingenuity to invent the concept.  I strongly support the efforts of this Government to retain duty free shopping.</P>
    <P>The duty free shopping facilities in Dublin Airport are among the best I have seen.  In some large airports they are pathetic.  It depends to a large extent on one's destination.  Heathrow Airport, for example, is a bagatelle.  One needs to draw a lucky country to go through a decent duty shopping zone.  Until recently, the one that catered for passengers travelling from the United Kingdom to Ireland was one of the worst in the airport.  However, that is in keeping with the way Heathrow Airport authorities treat passengers to Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter, the treatment of the minority gay community in the Republic of Zimbabwe.  The wording of my motion was raised in a contentious manner on the Order of Business today.  I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Ryan, for using one of his sporadic visits to the House to draw attention to my interest in the continuing controversies in this area.  However, his sympathy for Mr. Mugabe, whom I described as a dictator, is misplaced.  Any such sympathy is of the same nature as the ill advised visit of the late President de Valera to the German Embassy to express his condolences on the death of Adolf Hitler.  I refuse to withdraw the statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Mugabe is a dictator by any internationally applicable standards and I intend to outline information to the House which indicates that this is so.  He is currently in a difficult situation both economically and politically.  I wish to refer to a number of responsible articles in <i>The Irish Times.</i> On Friday, 5 April 1996, it published a significant <Col N="615" /> article under the heading &ldquo;Behind the Model Facade, Democracy is Hard to Find&rdquo;.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Zimbabwe is a <i>de facto</i> one-party state, they say, with no democratic remedy against a growing corruption and disregard for individual rights.  If this does not change, they fear it could go the way of other former British colonies such as Nigeria and Kenya, which have degenerated since independence into corrupt and sometimes brutal dictatorships.</P>
    <P>Dr. Reginald Matshaba-Hove, chairman of the country's largest human right group, Zim Rights, blames the dearth of democracy on the 14 amendments Zanu has added to the constitution it inherited from the Lancaster House agreement in 1979.</P>
    <P>One of the first amendments abolished the upper house of parliament, so that all laws &mdash; even constitutional amendments &mdash; can be easily pushed through parliament.  Another allows the president to personally nominate 30 of the 150 MPs.  Other constitutional and legal changes give the president the power to rule by decree and to annul elections.  The government can even ban voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House I could not regard the destroyer of an upper house in the Zimbabwe parliament as a good person.  The article continued:</P>
    <P>Broadcasting is monopolised by the state and news centres sycophantically on the doings and sayings of Dr. Mugabe.  The country's daily newspapers have also fallen under the control of Zanu.</P>
    <P>The main independent newpaper, the weekly <i>Financial Gazette</i>, has been gagged by other means.  Last year, the paper's editor and proprietor were accused of &ldquo;criminal defamation&rdquo; under colonial era laws and imprisoned for 48 hours after reporting on the secret remarriage of the 72 year old Dr. Mugabe.</P>
    <P>This year, the paper found itself under fresh attack for publishing a Reuters report from Lesotho which said Dr. Mugabe had thrown a tantrum when his aircraft was asked to land behind President Nelson Mandela's as both leaders arrived for King Moshoeshoe's funeral. The editor, Trevor Ncube, was sacked and the owner ordered the staff to cease publishing articles that might offend Dr. Mugabe.</P>
    <P>A former political columnist, Iden Wetherell, who also lost his job over the Lesotho affair, believes it is no coincidence that the Gazette's holding company is heavily in debt to a state owned bank.  The Lesotho story must have touched a particularly raw nerve with Dr. Mugabe, he said.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 7 February 1998, an article in the world news section of The Irish Times stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mugabe is in bad shape today.  What he needs is a miracle, or some kind of political gymnastics,&rdquo; says Dr. Ibbo Mandaza, director <Col N="616" /> of the Southern Africa Regional Institute for Political Studies.</P>
    <P>He also arrested a strong political opponent, the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole, whom he has accused on trumped up charges of attempting to assassinate him.  These charges have now been dismissed.</P>
    <P>His actions are part of the pattern of somebody in a dictatorial frame of mind who is in a delicate situation and he might choose to turn against an easy target group which, in Zimbabwe, is the gay community.  Dr. Mugabe is on record as saying that gay people were &ldquo;less than and worse than dogs&rdquo;, a sentiment he repeated in Ireland on 10 March 1997, when he was the distinguished speaker and The Irish Times/Harvard University Colloquium in UCD.  He was asked by a courageous student at that college to apologise for these comments.  Instead of doing so he referred to his Irish education by the Christian Brothers. He refused to withdraw the comments and, indeed, repeated them.  Shamefully, he drew applause from certain sections of the audience.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and I regularly receive e-mails from that organisation.  I recently received a worrying one about Dr. Mugabe's concentrated focus on gay people.  I believe he is getting ready, if he is not stopped, to incite a pogrom against gay people, the like of which has not been seen since the Hitler era in Germany.</P>
    <P>Keith Goddard, programs manager of Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe &mdash; GALZ &mdash; and one of the country's most prominent gay activists, has been arrested under that country's sodomy law. Goddard faces up to seven years' imprisonment. The arrest represents a culmination of a mounting campaign of repression against lesbians and gays, a campaign led by the regime of President Mugabe.</P>
    <P>According to Zimbabwean activists, Goddard's arrest occurred after a year of blackmail attempts. This is similar to Mugabe's attempts to frame the Rev. Ndabaningi Sithole.  In May 1997, Goddard began to receive letters from a man named Siphephele Vuma.  The letters at first expressed affection but later letters turned to threats against Goddard for allegedly having had sexual relations with Vuma.  Goddard categorically denies that such relations ever occurred and states that he only met the man one when Vuma briefly visited the offices of GALZ.  In a letter in January 1998, Vuma raised the ante, demanding goods and cash to the value of US$2,000.  At this point, Goddard reported the threat to the police in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.</P>
    <P>Their response was curious.  No action was taken until 1 May when Goddard was visited by police from the Central Intelligence Department, an undercover division dealing with vice offences. Ultimately called to the police station, Goddard was told he would be charged with having sodomised Vuma at gunpoint.  On 12 June, Goddard and Vuma were both arraigned &mdash; Vuma charged with extortion and Goddard with sodomy. <Col N="617" /> Vuma initially admitted the charge of extortion. The judiciary are clearly not independent in Zimbabwe and we have a long record demonstrating President Mugabe's interference with the judiciary.  In one case he called on the chief justice to resign his position because he disagreed with chief justice's judgment.  In this case the presiding judge changed the plea to not guilty and encouraged Vuma to state that he had demanded $2,000 as compensation for the &ldquo;crime&rdquo; of which he was a &ldquo;victim&rdquo;.  That is prejudging a situation in a most extraordinary manner, that is, prejudice.</P>
    <P>Vuma faces trial on 27 July.  Goddard is free pending trial; no trial date has yet been set.  Zimbabwean law criminalises &ldquo;unlawful and intentional sexual relations per anum between human males&rdquo;.  The charge that Goddard committed the act forcibly could raise the sentence to as much as seven years in prison.  According to GALZ, the case against Goddard is clearly part of an overall strategy to discredit GALZ and its members.  It comes after GALZ was accepted by the World Council of Churches as a participant in consultations surrounding the WCC's General Assembly to take place in Harare later this year. Since then, President Mugabe has renewed attacks on gays and lesbians, calling them &ldquo;beasts,&rdquo;&ldquo;perverts,&rdquo; and &ldquo;worse than dogs and pigs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mugabe's professed repugnance toward homosexuality first became a political issue in 1995, when his government barred GALZ from maintaining an information booth at the Zimbabwe International Book Fair &mdash; another echo of Hitler.  Mugabe proclaimed that homosexuals &ldquo;have absolutely no rights whatever&rdquo;.  He has since used the issue to shore up declining support for his party, the Zimbabwean African National Union-Popular Front, which maintains a stranglehold on the country's political life.  In speeches he has urged members of the party's Women's League to tie up homosexuals and take them forcibly to the police.</P>
    <P>Recently, the state run media have also joined the campaign against GALZ.  An article in <i>The Harare Sunday Mail</i> on 24 May &mdash; citing, among other items, a lesbian only party which GALZ had organised &mdash; accused the organisation of running a &ldquo;brothel&rdquo; and of promoting sex with minors.  GALZ restricts membership to adults over 18.  According to GALZ members, one reporter from <i>The Sunday Mail</i> made sexual advances toward female members of the organisation. Another reporter obtained an interview with GALZ members by pretending to be a representative of Amnesty International.  Goddard's arrest, according to members of international human rights groups, is &ldquo;a flagrant assault on political freedom in Zimbabwe.  It is not an isolated incident but part of a state orchestrated campaign to eradicate the organisation and intimidate any dissident political expression.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I make no apology for describing Dr. Mugabe as a dictator.  It pains me to have to raise this issue.  As the Minister and Members know, I work <Col N="618" /> very widely for human rights issues throughout the world.  I do not concentrate exclusively on issues for gay people but when there is a danger that they will be targeted for political and expedient reasons, perhaps murdered, arrested unjustly, sentenced by courts that are vitiated by presidential interference, then it is time for me to speak out in this august Chamber which no doubt President Mugabe, had he the opportunity, would also abolish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be here on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to respond to Senator Norris's motion.</P>
      <P>In general the issue of human rights is a priority concern of this Government and as such is a central component of our foreign policy.  We believe that the international community has legitimate concerns in this area and we are conscious of the responsibility which devolves on all Governments to promote and protect human rights.</P>
      <P>With regard to the issue raised by the Senator, the Government is aware that, although the Zimbabwean constitution guarantees equal rights for all citizens, the official climate in Zimbabwe is in practice hostile to homosexuals.  President Mugabe and the government controlled press have unfortunately shown a generally intolerant attitude to homosexuality and there have been prominent incidents such as the attempts in recent years to prevent participation in international book fairs by the GALZ organisation, that is the Gays and Lesbians in Zimbabwe.</P>
      <P>In this year of the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Government is more than ever anxious to promote the principles which lie at the basis of that declaration. Like all other UN member states, Zimbabwe subscribes to those principles.  Zimbabwe has also ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which guarantees to all persons &ldquo;equal and effective protection against discrimination on any ground such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status&rdquo;.  Our position is to insist that tolerance, non-discrimination and respect for pluralism and diversity are essential elements of a successful inclusive democracy.</P>
      <P>With regard to the particular case of Zimbabwe, there has been some criticism of human rights abuses and of the repressive measures implemented by the Zimbabwean Government. Nevertheless, it is generally considered that there has been an overall improvement in the human rights situation since independence was achieved in 1980.  It is important however that all sectors of society should benefit from this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and its European Union partners are engaged in regular monitoring of developments in Zimbabwe including developments in the human rights situation.  The issue of the treatment <Col N="619" /> of homosexuals in Zimbabwe is viewed within this broader context and will inform any EU decisions on action in relation to the situation in Zimbabwe.  Ireland and the EU will be paying particular attention to developments during the run up to the next legislative elections, which are due to be held by April 2000.  This period affords an opportunity to advance and deepen the democratic process.  In this context, Ireland and the EU will attach particular importance to full adherence to the principles of good governance, full and inclusive democratic transition and full observance of human rights.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to Senator Norris's description of President Mugabe as a &ldquo;dictator&rdquo;, I should point out that President Mugabe is the democratically elected President of Zimbabwe, a country with which Ireland has established full diplomatic relations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for putting down another similarity with the late Adolf Hitler who was also elected with a tissue of democracy. But, that aside, perhaps the Minister would indicate that a message of concern will be sent by Ireland or the EU in this situation.  There is no question of doubt that as far as the gay community is concerned the situation has seriously and substantially deteriorated.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I take this opportunity to acknowledge the outstanding contribution he continues to make in his chosen brief as it applies to this motion.  I am aware of the Minister's concern and involvement in ensuring that the potential impact of the millennium bug will be minimalised and that it will be addressed to a degree that will not have an adverse effect on Irish society.  Therefore, it is timely that he is here to respond to this motion which arises from a series of articles published in the British press over the past number of weeks. It relates specifically to Bovis, who are one of the UK's leading building companies.  They have written to the owners of the 870 premises that they have built since 1994.  They warned their clients that integral systems installed in these buildings may fail.  During debates on the millennium bug, few have focused on microprocessors in building systems.  Instead, we have tended to concentrate almost exclusively on the impact on offices and other institutions.  Therefore, it is important that this dimension is addressed.  For example, up to 40 per cent of building systems could be affected by the bug if action is not taken between now and the year 2000.  Many system use micro-chips to identify dates for switching <Col N="620" /> machinery on and off and to alert maintenance staff to the need for servicing.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the United Kingdom National Federation of Builders, which is the trade association for builders, recently stated that the issue is so serious that lives could be lost if, as result of microchips crashing, heating and power systems failed or sprinkler systems failed when fires broke out. Hospitals and even air traffic control systems would be also at risk.</P>
      <P>Bovis is advising its clients to consult experts to examine and remedy the problem before the year 2000.  It has already identified 1994 as the date after which systems are at risk because few systems incorporated microchips before 1994. Many organisations, following the Government's promotion, are focusing on the possible damage if desktop computers crash on 1 January 2000. However, few commentators have focused on the impact it could have on the building industry. One can imagine what might happen if microprocessors are installed in buildings.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's response because there has been a huge growth in the number of new buildings, particularly in this city, over the last five years.  New apartment blocks, offices and hotels have been built throughout the city to accommodate the improvement in the country's economic wellbeing.  This fact prompted me to table this matter.  I referred to the position in the United Kingdom, but Ireland could be more at risk because of the number of new buildings that have been erected since 1994.  It is important the Minister has an opportunity to confirm that the problem has been identified and to outline its extent and the steps he intends to take to ensure the same attention afforded to desktop computers and offices is given to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for raising this important issue.  This is the second time he has raised the year 2000 computer date problem.  He is obviously concerned about it and I thank him for raising the matter again.</P>
      <P>The Senator is correct that there will be a problem if embedded chips and computer systems cannot cope with the change of date, or as it is commonly known, the year 2000 problem.  We are aware that there are electronic sensors, devices and controls as well as a large volume of computers that will not be able to handle the year 2000 unless they are either reprogrammed or replaced.  This will have a major impact on the building sector, as the Senator observed, because of the increased reliance in the past 20 years on computers and electronic devices to design, provision, build, service and control most buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 2000 represents a major concern for the real estate industry because many buildings systems are controlled by software that may have trouble recognising the century date change.  Such systems include elevators, alarm systems, heating <Col N="621" /> and ventilation, security locking and electronic access to buildings.</P>
    <P>There is no need to point out that the building sector will not be alone in this.  There is hardly an activity in business or daily life where computer systems or microchips are not in use and crucial. Each such device that uses dates for control or calculation purposes is in the greatest danger of going wrong or just not working perhaps from 9 September 1999 but definitely after 31 December 1999.  In simple terms, the computerised system will not know that it is the year 2000.  It will be aware only of the fact that the year &ldquo;99&rdquo; has become the year &ldquo;00&rdquo;.  Thus, old machinery and even some recent equipment may be unable to deal with that serious situation.</P>
    <P>While we have been aware of this problem for some time and have been seeking to raise awareness of it, it is still possible that, even in the last year, people may have bought computer systems and electronically controlled equipment in the expectation that it was year 2000 compliant. However, that should not be assumed.  The watchwords are testing and contingency planning. The feedback we constantly get from businesses is that their initial internal investigations have invariably underestimated the extent of the problem. People and firms must check and recheck every system, device and control system to test that it can work with the year 2000 date change.</P>
    <P>A firm or person should only be relaxed about this if they have received a solid guarantee from suppliers that their system is compliant.  Even then, the only certainty in this matter is the deadline of 1 January 2000.  Enterprise must consider this as a question of risk assessment and management. Contingency plans should be drawn up in the event that critical systems do not work properly on the day.</P>
    <P>If anyone asks why, my reply is that it is the difference between being able to continue doing business as normal and being at a loss.  We should remember also that the time required to investigate systems and to repair or adjust them could be substantial.  Obviously, anyone who puts this on a long finger as next year's problem is courting disaster.  Most importantly, it is not an issue for the computer buff.  It is vital, crucial for continuing in business and not sustaining heavy losses.  It is very much for the board of a company to ensure that a thorough, exhaustive and extensive investigation is made in each firm.  Putting that off would be sheer recklessness on the part of the directors and company management.</P>
    <P>Over a year ago the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment sent warning literature on this to 100,000 businesses in Ireland.  We have spoken on radio and television and with print media journalists to ensure that awareness is raised.  We have seen good coverage of the issue, but the fear still remains that some firms may treat this as a postponable, longer term issue that must await the solution of this week's or next week's problem.  Worse still, they may see it as a problem for someone else to solve for them. <Col N="622" /> Attributing blame in this case is neither straight-forward nor beneficial.  It is too dangerous.  I hope Senators will join me in imploring firms and organisations to attend to this serious computer problem now.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned about the translation of awareness into action and for this reason I have spent a great deal of time this year seeking a co-ordinated response from a number of bodies that could help me influence the private sector to act urgently.  I have held discussions with the auditing profession, the banking industry, the insurance industry, the Stock Exchange, chambers of commerce, the county and city enterprise boards, the Irish Computer Society, the software industry, IBEC, ISME and many other organisations.  I am pleased that each of them in their own way is seeking to impress and impel firms with which they deal to attend to this immediately.</P>
    <P>A series of seven regional public meetings have been held to highlight awareness of the problem. The auditors, the banks, the insurance industry, the Stock Exchange and others will be keen to know that the firms with which they deal are making a serious effort to deal with this complex issue.  Who wants to certify or advance facilities to a firm that will go under because of neglect of this matter?  Likewise I have asked IDA Ireland, Forbairt/Enterprise Ireland, An Bord Tráchtála and the enterprise boards not to make supports or grants available to firms unless they have assurances that the new enterprises are attending to this issue as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The year 2000 problem has an important cross-Border dimension.  Companies which trade in the international marketplace need to check that both their foreign clients and suppliers are also year 2000 compliant.</P>
    <P>In May this year I issued a further and more comprehensive brochure outlining the nature and implications of the problem and giving advice on how to deal with it.  This has been circulated to every business both directly and to the organisations involved in the national awareness campaign. If Members of the Oireachtas can help in any way to advance this mission, I would welcome it.  I am seeking to bring the message to every corner of the country through public meetings and national and provincial press coverage.</P>
    <P>The Government is, of course, concerned that public bodies make the necessary changes in good time too.  Each Minister is responsible for those bodies under his or her aegis.  Progress is subject to review at the Cabinet.  While I am not the person to speak for them, I am aware that my own efforts of raising awareness in business generally and to translate awareness into activity are having an impact among public bodies and local government generally.  I welcome and value every contribution from Senators to amplify my efforts.  This is a matter for everyone.  There is too much at stake for procrastination or gimmickry.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank Senator Mooney for raising this seriously important matter again.  It gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Government, to <Col N="623" /> raise the profile of this matter and to alert the nation at large about the seriousness of this very complex year 2000 computer problem.  We will be convening a major national year 2000 conference, which will be our final national get together on this matter, on 9 September 1998, which is exactly one year from the first crisis date &mdash; 9 September 1999.  We hope this will give ample opportunity and advance warning to business people and all those who use computer systems to ensure they are ready, because there will be only one year left from 9 September.  If people do not get it right in the next year, they will have no hope of catching up in the final quarter of the following year.  The deadline is definitely 31 December 1999.</P>
    <P>I hope this information is of assistance to <Col N="624" /> Senator Mooney and the House.  I thank him again for raising this topic which is of critical national importance.</P>
