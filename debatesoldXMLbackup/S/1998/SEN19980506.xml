    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 13, motion 18.  The contribution of spokespersons on item 1 will not exceed 20 minutes and that of other Senators will not exceed ten minutes.  Item 13, motion 18, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Since the Government has made its decision on the Luas proposal, will the Leader hold a lengthy debate next week on it and on the overall plan? It would be wrong if a matter which will affect the future of the city for the next 100 years and which has been discussed in every other forum was not discussed in the House.  If the Leader agrees to this debate, will he ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to agree to a question and answer format at the end of it?  There are many questions Members would like to put to the Minister on the issue on which many people still have an open mind.  Now the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is back in the country, will the Leader let us know the outcome of his discussions with him on when the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, will be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point raised by Senator Manning on the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, the Leader is not really enthusiastic about this legislation despite the fact that when he was on this side of the House he was committed to it. There is a question of integrity in politics involved.  From the point of view of understanding the idea of policy, I expect the Government parties to be four square in support of this legislation and perhaps extend it.  It is my intention, in consultation with those who have put their names to the legislation, to ask that this be put on the Order Paper this week unless the Leader has a clear and established position.  The Leader is stringing us along, although I do not believe he intends to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Time after time we have asked for a debate on industrial relations.  The Leader has given a <Col N="486" /> commitment and it is unfair that we have not found the time to hold such a debate.  I do not see why it could not be held tomorrow afternoon or some time over the next week.  This matter must be well discussed before the end of Partnership 2000 given the impact of the euro, the minimum wage issue, the Garda and nurses disputes, etc., on industrial relations.  I urge the Leader to agree to a debate rather than have us table an amendment to the Order of Business each day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards industrial relations, we have raised this issue almost every week.  The Leader indicated he would hold a debate and I support the call for an early discussion because a number of issues have been raised, in particular the Garda pay claim, trade union recognition, the Ryanair dispute and so on.  A full debate is needed, particularly in the context of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>On the Cabinet's decision on the Luas project referred to in item 19, I echo Senator Manning's request for a debate this week, or certainly no later than next week, on the Atkins report and in the Minister's presence.  If the Minister is not present, the debate will be hardly worthwhile.  I understand the Cabinet's decision is at variance with the Atkins report.  New elements were raised, such as the line to the northside which, thankfully, has been reintroduced.  There will also be an underground section which was not proposed in the Atkins report, although the underground section from Heuston Station to the city centre which was sought has not been included. Serious issues involving cost, the timescale and geological feasibility arise.  It appears a political decision was made without the benefit of a researched plan.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister to the House for a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity so Members can find out the exact nature of the decision taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader invite the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend a debate in the near future on the anomalies in telephone charges?  The same charges for telephone calls should be available in rural Ireland.  Businesses, health boards and hospitals among others are being affected by the difference in charges.  Ireland is a small country and it is unfair that local call charges apply to half the population which is based in Dublin while people in rural Ireland must pay trunk call charges.  It is long past time to address this anomaly. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this matter which will hopefully influence Telecom Éireann to examine this matter.  Major international telephone companies want a share of the action in Ireland and it is time Telecom Éireann looked at its operations.  It should accommodate people and ensure fair play.  I hope the Leader will arrange a debate because the House has a contribution to make.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should have thought about that before the charges were changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on the Dublin light rail system in view of the Cabinet decision taken yesterday.  I also support the comments made by Senator Costello.  As a result of yesterday's decision, £114 million of EU funding which was targeted at the original proposal cannot now be drawn down given the new plans agreed by the Cabinet, although the Minister assured us that money has not been lost.  Many miles of mainline rail track are severely deficient and dangerous.  Although the authorities may not admit it, a recent derailment was caused by track failure.  These miles of track, which are in the west and north-west in the main and include the lines from Mullingar to Sligo, Athlone to Westport and also Mallow to Killarney, need major upgrading.  They have not been attended to for over 50 years.  I hope a large portion of the £114 million of EU funds, which have been released from the Luas project in Dublin, will be directed towards that element of the transport infrastructure.  This aspect should be included in a debate on rail safety next week which I ask the Leader to arrange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is too late.  Deputy Browne, who represents Carlow-Kilkenny, has earmarked it for the Carlow by-pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Members have called for a debate on the likely impact the reduction in EU Structural Funds will have on Ireland, and particularly the likely effects on the western seaboard. Many social and economic indicators have proved conclusively that this part of the country has not benefited to the same degree as the east from Structural Funds.</P>
      <P>The recent report by the mid-west business forum on the likely effect of the year 2002 and the reduction in the market share of Shannon Airport <i>vis-a-vis</i> Dublin Airport is a further indication of the need for a debate on the likely effects of future reductions and the possibility of seeking Objective One status for certain areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Manning and others for a debate on the Luas project. I am particularly concerned about the vagueness regarding funding and I want the Minister to deal with this aspect in the House.  I hope other infrastructural projects throughout the country which may qualify for capital or European funding will not be jeopardised as a result of the increased cost.  Dr. Garret FitzGerald made a strong point about the need for extra money and nobody knows more about Luas than he.  I am concerned that the project is vague; I heard it referred to on radio as the never never project.  It is important that the Minister comes into the House and explains how she intends funding Luas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="488" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the chorus of those seeking a debate on Luas.  The House should be grateful for the moderate and wise way in which Senator Manning introduced this matter and was followed by Senator Connor.  It was first raised in this House and was given a very reasoned and thorough examination.  If anybody thinks this House is not relevant, they should read that debate and mark, learn and take note of the fact that it was the University Senators who held the balance of power and inserted the enabling amendment in that legislation without which the report would not have been commissioned and consideration of the underground option would not have been possible.</P>
      <P>I do not want to claim that uniquely for us but we should claim it for the Seanad.  The debate on that occasion was reasoned on all sides and it was virtually unanimous that there should be proper, serious consideration of the underground option. There was a general balance with some reservations that were expressed that underground was the best option.  Senator Manning's suggestion is very good and wise as there are questions about funding and the Minister is capable of answering them.  She is fully in charge of her brief and is a woman of considerable courage. I was reading newspapers on a flight to Dublin this afternoon and a number of journalists made the point that it is time Government Departments, particularly hers, reclaimed the right to make decisions from the grey people in CIÉ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to an issue I raised last week.  I am the chairman of a voluntary hospital in the Cork region and there is serious concern regarding student nurses.  Are Members aware that the lack of facilities for them has reached a serious level?  Can we have a discussion with the relevant Minister or Junior Minister to seek answers to the problem?  It is only right and proper that this House asks questions about the lack of facilities for student nurses.</P>
      <P>Nurses are not prepared to stay, particularly in the Southern Health Board region; they are moving to other regions or emigrating.  This is causing a serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for a progress report on the Garda dispute or is the Minister still in a blue funk over the blue &rsquo;flu?  I am disappointed that there appears to be little or no progress and attitudes are hardening.  It is bad for the country that this situation still pertains.</P>
      <P>As a Dubliner I am exceedingly disappointed about the further delay in the Luas project. Unlike Senator Norris, I will not join the Minister for Public Enterprise's fan club.  Is there any light at the end of the tunnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is dim enough to need one.</P>

    <Col N="489" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Government's announcement of the REPS package &mdash; £2 billion over 15 years &mdash; which will help to underpin the economy of rural Ireland, particularly in agriculture. It will also provide an opportunity to question the Minister about his rural development policy.  Will the Leader ask him to come to the House and outline his and the Government's approach to the White Paper and the progress that has been made following discussions on the matter throughout the country?  An exchange of views would be very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for the inclusion on the Order Paper, if possible next week, of the Shannon River Council Bill.  As was stated by the Leader last week, the Bill was introduced by Members on his side of the House in the last Seanad.  We can all support its broad principles and it would be a worthy subject for debate in the near future.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on refugee policy?  An applicant's right to stay in this country is determined, both in the initial and appeal stages, without the applicant being interviewed by anyone from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  This is not within the letter or spirit of the regulations.  In relation to the case which is currently in the public domain, I appeal to the Minister to exercise his right, on humanitarian grounds, not to force that family either to return to Burundi or to face the current wave of neo-Nazi political backlash in Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always impressed by Senator Norris' ability to mention the fact that he has either just arrived or is about to leave on a plane and that he read about a topic in a newspaper on a plane.  I would like to know which paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I also endorse the call for a debate on Luas.  Senator Jackman's reference to former Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, is very enlightening.  I am sure that he, above all, is more than happy with the Minister's decision to put the system underground as he has been promoting that view for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>He would not be happy about the funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that this House should have an opportunity to commend the Minister on a very courageous and far reaching decision which has been taken in the best interest of the capital city and of the country in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader will be aware of the comments made by Senator Connor about the <Col N="490" /> dispersal of the surplus of £114 million.  In the context of the debate on Luas, I will ask if any of this money can be spent in the manner Senator Connor, other Senators and I have been advocating. The EU has refused to co-finance railway development west of Mullingar.  That was a scandalous decision.  Now that we have this surplus money this House should consistently and persistently lobby for its use in the west of Ireland.  We cannot stand back and see an expenditure of between £400 million and £500 million in the capital city and on the east coast while no money goes to the rest of the country.  That is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have a debate on Luas and I would welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to that debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>We heard last week of files missing from the Department of Finance.  Could the Leader discover, for the benefit of the House, how many files are missing from other Departments? It is important that Departments know where their files are.  They may be mislaid in storage but they may also have been taken out on loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see the relevance of this matter to the Order of Business.  I suspect Senators are taking advantage of the leniency I have shown recently and of my reluctance, where possible, to interrupt Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Especially Senator Mooney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always appreciated your patience, a Chathaoirligh.  Can the Leader discover if it is possible to remove files indefinitely and what check is made when files are removed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Files have been missing from Departments for many years.  We saw that in the recent film about the Ballyseedy incident.  I join with Senator Chambers in calling for a debate on rural development.  The Minister, Deputy Davern, is highly qualified to speak on this area having spent several years in Europe, and he is bringing his expertise to bear.  It is appropriate that we should debate the information he has gathered from various seminars around the country.  The £2 billion to be invested in REPS over 15 years is an important development for rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Minister is to be congratulated for what she has done on Luas.  I hope the Leader can provide time for a debate and we should not confine it to Luas but should cover the rail system nationally.  There are implications for the rest of the country and western counties should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also debate the financial institutions, especially the banks.  There have been tentative discussions but we should have a full scale debate because of the further disclosures. That should take place as soon as possible and it is appropriate that it should happen now that we <Col N="491" /> have qualified for participation in the euro.  All financial institutions will come under scrutiny in the coming months and years and this House has a role to play in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should have a debate on how the Government should spend the money which it obviously does not need for Luas.  Since some rural railway stations do not have toilet facilities and are in a bad condition, some of that money be channelled into rural Ireland.  It should not be lost to us.</P>
      <P>I echo Senator Cregan's call for help for student nurses.  There is much concern about care for the elderly in our community and the good work nurses are doing.  Many old people want to stay in their communities but there are no backup facilities for them.  The number of public health nurses should be doubled.  A debate on this subject should cover all these issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate on Luas.  It was only one of many components of a scheme to help resolve Dublin's traffic problem.  If the £140 million cannot be drawn down in the short term for Luas it should be spent on other measures to relieve Dublin's traffic problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with those who wish to debate Luas but we have had traffic gridlock in Kilkenny for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Dustin was right &mdash; bring the DART to Dingle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>If some of the £140 million could be spent on Kilkenny's traffic problems and providing a fast commuter service to Dublin, it would alleviate many traffic problems in Dublin because cars would be taken off the road.  We should see where the traffic comes from in the first place.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could make time available in the next few days for a short debate on the Middle East.  Many people are currently celebrating the 50th Anniversary of the State of Israel but that also marks 50 years of deprivation of the Palestinian people who were thrown out of their homes.  We should celebrate with the people of Israel but we should also discuss what happened to the people of Deir Yassin and various other places in Palestine.  We may be able to say something that will not exacerbate the situation but may help to progress the peace process in the Middle East, which is of as much importance to Europe and the Mediterranean Basin as is the resolution of the problem in the North to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Luas and welcome the Government decision.  While the spin on the decision is that it is a loss for Dublin, in time it will be seen to have been wise, prudent and well thought out.  I agree with Senator Joe Doyle's view that Luas was but one part of a multi-faceted package to attempt to address the gridlock in Dublin.  I am sure that <Col N="492" /> when the matter is debated, all parties will agree that while the south, south-west and other regions deserve investment, Dublin needs its fair share.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Connor, Jackman, Norris, Ridge, Gallagher, Mooney, Finneran, O'Toole, Tom Hayes, Joe Doyle, Lanigan, Liam Fitzgerald and others requested a debate on Luas.  I will let the House know tomorrow morning when this timely debate will take place.</P>
      <P>With regard to the queries raised by Senators O'Toole, Gallagher and others on the Shannon River Council Bill, I hope to have information for the House tomorrow morning.  Senators O'Toole and Costello requested a debate on industrial relations.  I am trying to have time set aside and hope to hold a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I will be able to facilitate Senator McGowan's urgent request for a debate on telephone charges. However, if I am unable to facilitate him before the next Fianna Fáil Private Members' time, I will include it then.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan expressed concern about EU funding and Structural Funds for the west, especially the retention of Objective One status by the mid-west business forum.  Many Senators, including Senators Mooney and Finneran, requested a debate on this last week.  I will arrange to have the matter discussed at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I will be able to facilitate the request by Senators Cregan and Hayes for a debate on nursing. Senators Chambers and Finneran requested a debate on rural development.  I also wish to be associated with their words of welcome for the £2 billion allocation to the REPS package.  This issue is dear to the hearts of most Members and there will be a debate.</P>
      <P>I can facilitate Senator Gallagher's request for a debate on the Government's refugee policy but I will not be able to arrange a debate for at least four weeks.  Perhaps he could discuss with his leader the possibility of having this issue debated next week in the Labour Party Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>Senators Mooney, Connor and Finneran are anxious that the railway system in the west and throughout the county benefits from the use of the £114 million designated for Luas.  Perhaps this and the proposal made by Senator Manning could be included in the forthcoming debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran requested an urgent debate on the banks and other financial institutions.  I have agreed to such a debate and am doing all I can to arrange one within the next three to four weeks.  Senator Lanigan called for a debate on the Middle East.  I will try to ensure time is put aside for this matter.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Cregan's sentiments as expressed in his call for a debate on nursing.  I will look into this as early as possible.</P>

      <P>Is onóir dom an deis seo a bheith agam teacht os comhair an Tí seo chun freastal a dhéanamh ar an ábhar seo &mdash; an fhadhb ríomhaireachta atá ann maidir leis an mBliain 2000.  Tá mé ag súil, le bhur gcomhoibriú, go mbeidh toradh maith againn agus go mbeidh gach duine sásta leis na heachtraí agus an clár oibre atá á gcur ar bun ag an Rialtas i dtaca leis an fhadhb seo.</P>
      <P>I sincerely thank Seanad Éireann for the opportunity to debate the Year 2000 computer problem.  It is important that we heighten awareness of the problem and it is also a timely discussion as earlier today I officially launched the Government information campaign on this extremely serious issue.</P>
      <P>There has been much publicity about what is variously described as the millennium time bomb, the millennium bug or Year 2000 meltdown. Despite awareness campaigns in Ireland and world-wide on this complex issue, many businesses have, to date, failed to take proper action to deal with the Year 2000 computer date problem. The threat which this problem poses for businesses is a real one which, if ignored any longer, could have very serious implications for the ability of companies to continue to operate after January 1, 2000.</P>
      <P>Recent research on the Year 2000 computer problem has indicated that while there is a high level of awareness of the problem, the level of action to deal with it, particularly among small and medium-sized enterprises, still falls well below what is required.  That is why today, on behalf of the Government, I launched a national campaign to heighten awareness of the problem in the business community across the State.</P>
      <P>Year 2000 is more than just an IT issue.  It is an issue of fundamental importance to the continuing successful operation of business.  The problem has far more significance than simply a computer systems fault.  Its potential impact is enormous because it is not one big problem but millions of small problems.</P>
      <P>It is the sheer scale and scope of the problem which presents the challenge.  All organisations could potentially be affected, from large financial companies with mainframe systems, to SMEs with PC-based systems, even companies with no computer systems at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem is not confined to computer systems alone.  It also affects components of many of the normal functions of our community, through the embedding of computer chips in everyday <Col N="494" /> household and industrial appliances.  Embedded chips which control the date function in equipment such as lifts, mobile phones, fax machines, security systems and environmental control systems may all be affected and are the most intractable problem.  Many large companies have major programmes underway to address the millennium date problem.  However, some have not and the Government is concerned, in particular, that the small to medium enterprise sector may not be well prepared.</P>
    <P>Our role is to increase awareness of the problem and to provide guidelines on how to secure compliance.  It is a matter for each individual business and other users of computer systems to assess the implications of the year 2000 on their particular systems and to determine the necessary solution.  The Government cannot and should not try to assume the responsibilities of individual company directors and business people.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's Year 2000 Business Awareness Campaign, I launched a new brochure today, prepared by our Department to alert businesses to some of the risks of the year 2000 computer problem and to provide guidelines on how to tackle it immediately.</P>

      <P>It was launched officially at 1.30 p.m. and I gave strict instructions for it to be distributed to Members.  I am confident that it awaits the Senator.</P>
      <P>This new brochure will be distributed over the coming week directly to around 100,000 businesses throughout the country.  It will also be distributed to other businesses by IBEC, the chambers of commerce, the city and county enterprise boards and other State agencies.  I strongly advise everyone in business to take the time to read it immediately and act urgently on it thereafter.</P>
      <P>Other Year 2000 Business Awareness Campaign activities will include a series of regional conferences on year 2000 for the business sector. These conferences, to which admission is free, will provide an opportunity for companies to listen to and to question various experts on preparing for the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the various business organisations and development agencies which are participating in our national year 2000 committee which I have established to support the business awareness campaign.  They include the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Computer Society, the Irish Insurance Federation, the Irish Bankers Federation, the Institute of Chartered Accountants, IBEC, the Small Firms Association, ISME, Forfás, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, the city and county <Col N="495" /> enterprise boards and various company representatives. I am delighted to have the support of these organisations for this important national campaign.  They represent key organisations in the business community and their ability to influence companies to tackle the problem is an essential part of our campaign.  They are very concerned about the need for the business sector to prepare for the year 2000 and they are planning activities to increase awareness of the problem.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that there is a serious issue to be addressed immediately.  We need business to assess the implications and to take action to solve the problems.  The resolution of any problem is in the hands of individual companies and businesses.  I hope that the combined efforts of the Government and the organisations which I have mentioned will, with Members' support, ensure that Irish business will be fully aware of the problem.</P>
    <P>Being aware of the problem is only the first step.  It is vital to move from awareness to action. Every company, be it large, medium or small, across all business sectors must examine its vulnerability, prepare a plan of action and implement it.  Time is running out.  Companies which have not yet tackled the problem may soon run into difficulties.</P>
    <P>Some companies have already encountered difficulties with financial transactions and stock control systems as a result of the failure of their systems to process future dates.  Examples of what can go wrong where software applications fail include the loss of contracts from inability to meet just-in-time deliveries; the cancellation of orders of new stock; inability to issue stock invoices or track debtors and creditors; incorrect processing of payments and disruption of supply chains due to year 2000 problems suffered by key suppliers and customers.  In other words, the year 2000 problem could have wide-ranging effects from disruption and inconvenience at one extreme to catastrophic losses, at the other.  On either 9 September 1999 or 1 January 2000, various companies could create a seriously uncomfortable inconvenience for their clients and end up with an absolute disaster on their hands.</P>
    <P>The situation is further complicated by the fact that even companies which rigorously tackle the problem within their own systems remain very exposed to others in their business chain.  If a business depends heavily on key suppliers or customers who have not addressed the problem, their failure will affect that business.  Therefore, companies must take action not alone to ensure that their systems are free of Year 2000 problems, but also to ensure that their suppliers and customers are not going to cause them problems.</P>
    <P>To do this, it is essential for a business to evaluate its dependency on the business chain and to request confirmation of Year 2000 compliance of all of its major customers and suppliers.  It is vital for companies which have not yet addressed Year 2000 to do so now.  Information technology consultancy <Col N="496" /> services may not be available on demand during 1998 and 1999 and the costs for consultancy, when available, may increase as the compliance deadline fast approaches.  No one can get an extension to the Year 2000 deadline, but one can decide not to waste any more time.  The cost of ignoring the problem now could ultimately be far greater than the cost of solving it at this stage.</P>
    <P>I again thank the House for giving me this opportunity to discuss the Year 2000 problem.  I urge all public representatives to assist us in putting this complex issue high on the agenda of Irish business immediately.  I have arranged that every Senator and Deputy will receive copies of the information brochure.  I hope this will assist Members in spreading the message to Irish business.</P>
    <P>While my own ministerial involvement is concerned with the impact on Irish business, I would like to inform the House of the position of Government administration in relation to the Year 2000 problem.  All Departments and offices have produced Year 2000 plans.  The volume of Year 2000 compliance activities varies considerably from Department to Department and in some cases can be relatively minor.  Many potential Year 2000 problems have already been eliminated by the replacement of aging computer systems and infrastructures.  Considerable remedial work has been ongoing for some time in those Departments and offices most affected.  The extra cost involved in adjusting computer systems in use in the Civil Service to make them Year 2000 compliant has been estimated at £13 million.</P>

      <P>I oversee the achievement of Year 2000 compliance, for IT systems and other office equipment across the Civil Service, and an interdepartmental Year 2000 monitoring committee with private sector participation was established by the Government.  This committee is chaired by the Minister for Finance.  The committee's first report was considered by the Government at its meeting on 7 April last.  The Government has observed that while detailed planning has been completed and steady progress is being made on the correction or replacement of systems, a significant amount of work still remains to be done to achieve Year 2000 compliance.  The Government agreed to continue to give urgent attention to the Year 2000 problem and agreed that Ministers and senior management will closely monitor progress in the achievement of Year 2000 compliance in their respective Departments and in the public service bodies under their aegis.</P>
      <P>The committee will be monitoring performance and progress against plans very closely on an ongoing basis over the coming months and will be reporting every two months to Government on the progress being made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Seanad for allowing me to speak on the Year 2000 IT issue.  It is a business issue and <Col N="497" /> not a political issue, but I would urge all politicians to use their public platforms to encourage business to address this problem immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

      <P>I thank the Minister of State.  I would like to establish if this will be an interactive debate and if the Minister of State will reply to queries.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, set a very good example recently, holding a quick question and answer session once Members spoke for ten to 15 minutes each.  It depends on the number of speakers offering, but we should aim for an interactive session.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the brochure he launched today, although I have not seen it yet.  I rang his Department this morning and it was unavailable.  When I entered the House today it was not in my pigeonhole and I have not yet had a chance to go back and see if it has arrived. I would have liked the courtesy of a copy for today's debate.  That is not the Minister of State's fault; it is a logistical matter.  There is no point in offering me the brochure now because I cannot sit, read it and then continue my speech, although I appreciate the Minister of State's gesture.  I asked the Minister of State for a copy 25 minutes ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it does the job intended for it, which is to increase awareness of the need to be Y2K compliant, particularly in the business sector.  Commentators have described the problem of tackling the Y2K bug as one of apocalyptic proportions which will cost billions of pounds to overcome.  That is not an exaggeration when one regards the problem on an international basis. Those who have not yet started to plan for it might find it is now too late.  I share the Minister's concern about the readiness of small and medium sized enterprises and their willingness to invest in ensuring they are Y2K compliant.  The message has not got through to the SME sector that it will cost far more to resolve the problem if they wait until the time comes rather than investing in a planned way at this stage.</P>
      <P>The problem is spread across the information technology spectrum, from hardware to software and from mainframe computers to desk top PCs. The mainframe computers are the main concern because they are generally older applications which hold a large amount of data.  There is a historical problem with resolving those issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early years of computers they had far less memory capacity than they do today and year <Col N="498" /> dates were represented by two digits instead of four, for example, &ldquo;1998&rdquo; was represented as &ldquo;98&rdquo;.  As we approach the year 2000, &ldquo;00&rdquo; could be read as &ldquo;1900&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;2000&rdquo;, &ldquo;01&rdquo; could be read as &ldquo;1901&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;2001&rdquo;, and so on. This would result in serious errors in computer calculations and operations generally.  Examples of the fallout in terms of serious failures and dangerous calculations are readily available. There has already been a case in the US where a computerised dosing machine for the radioactive treatment of patients provided an overdose which killed patients because of a computer miscalculation. This is a very serious area.  I do not wish to hype the issue or scaremonger but such examples make an impact on people and bring home to them the seriousness of the problem outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Y2K problem is a design difficulty.  Despite the common parlance referring to it as a &ldquo;bug&rdquo; it is not a computer virus and will manifest in all areas of electronics, computing and communication services generally, as well as control electronics embedded in industrial plants and vehicles.  This latter area is of particular concern in regard to embedded chips.  Examples include transport systems, air traffic control and many other airport functions, oil rigs, lifts, electricity and water supplies &mdash; we can cherrypick our own lists of areas in which problems might arise.  The problems are endless and impact on every aspect of life.  The implications for the embedded systems are particularly serious and it is extremely difficult and costly to identify potential Y2K failures.</P>
    <P>A special interest group on the Year 2000 problem for the public sector has been in session since 1996.  It has met regularly and has identified and addressed the common technical issues which affect Departments.  All Departments and offices have by now produced Y2K plans.  According to a Department of Finance document on the issue, the volume of Year 2000 compliance activities varies considerably from Department to Department and, in some cases, can be quite minor. Many potential Year 2000 problems have already been eliminated by the replacement of aging computer systems and infrastructures.  Considerable remedial work has been ongoing for some time in the Departments and offices most affected and all expect this remedial work will be completed by early 1999.</P>
    <P>The additional IT cost arising in 1998 and 1999 for the resolution of Year 2000 problems has been estimated at £12.8 million for the Civil Service, although the Department of Finance document to which I am referring is a couple of months old.  The Minister of State mentioned £13 million.  When addressing this issue in the Dáil last October, the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, mentioned £12.6 million.  The figure on the Government's web site a few months ago was £12.8 million.  If the cost goes up by £500,000 every six months we can see the sort of money we are getting into.  When the Taoiseach mentioned <Col N="499" /> the figure of £12.8 million last October experts said that this was extremely conservative and that is proving to be the case.  In the long run it is going to cost far more.  However, no matter how high the cost, it is money well spent.  If we are not ready, if all Government systems are not up and running and Y2K compliant, all of us who are customers of the public and Civil Service, Departments and State agencies will suffer in terms of the standard of services we have come to expect.</P>
    <P>The Departments of Social, Community and Family Affairs and Agriculture and Food and the Revenue Commissioners were singled out in October 1997 by the Taoiseach as priorities for preparedness for Y2K.  I would have added the Department of Health and Children to that list as there are enormous implications for the readiness of that Department, the health boards and the myriad hospitals and other care agencies under its aegis.  The media has recently commented on whether hospitals will get financial help from the Department to become Y2K compliant.  What of blood supplies and the best before dates on those supplies?  There have already been problems in some countries with blood supplies because of the event horizon issue.  If there is a two year event horizon in terms of best before dates or expiry dates on products, services or credit cards, systems cannot cope because they cannot handle any date beyond 1999.  What is being done about this? Is help coming from the Department of Finance to the Department of Health and Children, health boards and hospitals to ensure full compliance in this critical area?</P>
    <P>Some medical diagnostic machines have automated dosages and are completely dependent on accuracy and compliance.  Will all of this be looked into and will everything be in place by 2000?  These are the issues which impact on the punters and patients who are the consumers of public services.  We need to be assured and in so doing we are helping to increase awareness in all sectors of what needs to be done in this area.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental monitoring committee set up last autumn, which is separate from the special interest group on year 2000, has private sector participation and is chaired by the Department of Finance.  However, it only held its first meeting in December 1997.  I have been requesting a debate in this House on this issue for six months.  It is six months since I became concerned about what I perceived as a lack of activity in the public service in this area.  I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance on the movement in the intervening six months.  Last October the Seanad first requested information from the Government on what was happening on Y2K compliance and there has been tremendous progress since then.  I compliment the interdepartmental monitoring committee on the work it has done to date.  Its first quarterly report has gone to Government.  I do not think the Minister of State referred to it in his <Col N="500" /> statement but I would like to know when it will be made public and when we can have a copy of that report.  This is not a political issue.  It is only with all party support that we can raise public awareness to the point where we have readiness on Y2K compatibility.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is leading other Departments in terms of its Y2K programme and I commend the Department for this.  It established its Y2K board in 1996.  It depends on its network of computer systems.  If there was a failure in the year 2000 to pay cheques to those depending on payments from the Department, one can only begin to imagine the chaos and confusion which would ensue.</P>
    <P>I have not seen the Minister of State's brochure but I would appreciate if, in replying, he could indicate what he is doing in the area of small and medium enterprises to ensure a greater awareness and willingness in this sector to be Y2K compliant on time.  Has he spelt out in his brochure and press release the enormous implications for the business sector generally of failing to meet compliance on time?  I would appreciate if he could expand on that in his reply.</P>
    <P>Another problem to which I thought the Minister might refer, especially as it impinges on his area of responsibility, is the problem of euro compliance which compounds that of Y2K compliance. Financial experts pleaded with Europe to delay the date for the introduction of EMU and the euro because its coinciding with the Y2K problem compounded the major difficulty faced by small and medium enterprises.  Government Departments and big corporations have the financial and human resources to cope with the difficulties of Y2K and euro compliance.  However, small and medium enterprises face critical difficulties which are not properly recognised at this stage.  Companies already dealing with different currencies will have to adjust to new rules; but single currency companies, which comprise the majority of small Irish companies, are in for a shock and they do not realise it yet.  There are complex issues relating to software and euro compliance generally.  A company may think it is euro compliant, but will it match its suppliers and distributors? All small companies are part of an interconnected business web and, unless all their suppliers and distributors are euro compliant, their system will not work.  Small companies will have to ask whether support and maintenance contracts for various software packages cover the euro adjustment?</P>
    <P>Problems concerning spreadsheets, historical data, double disk requirements, ATM machines and difficulties in a range of other areas raise their heads.  Any ATM card or other plastic money card with an expiry date beyond the year 2000 could be rejected.  AIB has decided its ATM system will change over at the start of the dual cash period on 1 January 2002.  Will there be six months' chaos during the changeover period or will the dual cash period be reduced from six <Col N="501" /> months to the minimum period necessary for the logistics to be put in place to reduce the period of chaos?  Will the Minister respond to that when he replies because there is huge concern about euro compatibility compounding the difficulties of Y2K compatibility?</P>
    <P>Most companies will not be able to handle the two problems of Y2K and euro compatibility simultaneously. Despite the pleading of various experts, the introduction of the euro is on the same date as Y2K.  The latter is an information technology concern with a business impact and the euro is a business concern with an IT impact. They are different but related.  The IT subcommittee of the EMU business campaign of Forfás reported that there were three core IT issues arising from the necessity for euro compatibility. First, conversion will have to be done to six significant figures and not four in the multi-currency packages.  Second, the subsequent rounding up or down of amounts will lead to certain discrepancies which will have implications for balance sheets.  Third, conversion between any two currencies within EMU will have to be done through the euro.  A new buzzword has entered phraseology &mdash;&ldquo;triangulation&rdquo;.  Eurospeak extends day by day.  Triangulation means that, with the advent of the euro, if one is changing from French francs to punts, the francs will first have to be changed to euros and then from euros to punts rather than from francs to punts.  It will be a three way transaction rather than the two way one it is at the moment.  This is referred to as triangulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the concept of triangulation and the difficulties it entails. I concentrate my remarks towards small and medium enterprises.  I repeat that for the benefit of the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, who has just entered the Chamber.  I have no fear for the public sector and the large corporations as their access to resources will allow them deal with Y2K; but I have serious concerns about the SME sector, especially its lack of awareness and preparedness and the extra cost which will be <Col N="502" /> imposed on it by that.  While triangulation will be a more complex system than at present, it will not impact on exchange rates as they will not vary.  I would like the Minister in his response to address the questions I asked about Y2K and the compounding difficulty of euro compatibility in the context of the Y2K problem as it is important.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to another point which the Minister never mentioned in his presentation.  It is the compounding difficulty of the year 2000 being a leap year.  I would like some indication in his response as to how that fares in the preparedness of the public and private sectors.  The date of 29 February 2000 will cause major problems in relation to dates.  We now have three dates which will cause problems: 9 September 1999, 1 January 2000 and 29 February 2000.  What is being done as regards preparedness and what difficulties are foreseen if people do not address the problem? Are the various consultants and individuals working in this area giving sufficient priority to leap year compatibility as well as Y2K compatibility?</P>
      <P>Difficulties have already arisen relating to the leap year issue.  A multi-million pound scanner in a British hospital would not work on 29 February 1996 because it could not handle leap years.  An aluminium smelter in New Zealand lost $500,000 because two plants shut down unexpectedly when the process control computers failed to allow for the extra day.  These are examples of what can and did happen in 1996, the last leap year.  Multiply that by all the problems we could expect if people are not ready for Y2K and if the leap year problem is heaped on them as well?  Will the Minister indicate what work and preparedness is being done in relation to that problem?</P>
      <P>There has been criticism that Europe is way behind Ireland in terms of Y2K difficulties.  The US is stated to be a year ahead of us in preparedness, but Europe is at least six months behind Ireland.  Has the European Commission been negligent in this area and in alerting member governments to the various needs in relation to the Y2K question?  What is our Government's view on what I think is a negligent European Commission in this area?  What are the insurance implications for major systems failure, dose miscalculations, failure to extend credit terms or the collapse of companies because of Y2K failures? How are legal actions likely to stand up if serious problems arise from Y2K?  Perhaps the Government could comment on that and on the work it has done in that area.</P>
      <P>I mentioned event horizons.  We do not have until 31 December 1999; the event horizon issue is already with us.  Best before dates extend beyond two years in many cases of non-perishable goods, including blood supply, as do expiry dates on credit cards and ATM cards.  We could all pick a particular selection.  Will the event horizons be met?  Are areas which involve projections or event horizons up and running in terms of their readiness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will our banks follow the lead of British banks and ask for Y2K compliance guarantees from <Col N="503" /> their customers as a condition for continued credit facilities and loan sanction?  Small businesses need to know whether the banks will continue to extend credit and loans to them if they are not Y2K compliant.  The banks need to state their policy and whether they will follow their British counterparts.  Conversely, will building societies, credit unions and the banks assure their customers that their money is safe and accessible after 1 January 2000?  We need to talk about this and hear more about it generally.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister respond as to whether he is satisfied we have sufficient human resources to resolve the problems given the demands which will be put on these experts by the public and private sectors?  The number of individuals who have expertise in relation to the old COBOL legacy systems are few and far between.  I have a feeling the limiting factor in terms of preparedness and readiness may not only be a money resource but a human resource in terms of physically fixing and adjusting computer mainframes and various other systems.  Perhaps the Government could comment on what is available in terms of the human resources needed.  As awareness increases, the demand for these individuals increases and it is only then people will realise that having failed to plan, it will be extremely costly to get the resources necessary in terms of expertise and consultants to help them complete their readiness for Y2K generally.</P>
    <P>There are many other questions and areas into which we could go, but the Minister has been generous and I appreciate his generosity in relation to the time.  The concerns are numerous and include the small and medium sized enterprise sector, sections of the public service and their particular readiness, the financial institutions and how they will handle their customers in relation to Y2K compliance, hospitals and the health services.</P>
    <P>A recent expert study in the US went through the different areas where there could be difficulty in relation to Y2K compliance and failure to comply. If we transpose the study done in relation to New York city and wonder how ready Dublin, as the large capital city of this State, will be, we could ask similar questions.  Corporation 2000 studied New York and forecast that the millennium will throw the city into chaos with powers supplies, schools, hospitals, transport and the finance sector likely to suffer severe disruption. Remember, the US is one year ahead of us in relation to preparedness according to the experts.</P>
    <P>Corporation 2000 reckoned that in New York, a major city, 50 per cent only of the electricity supply would be available from 1 to 10 January 2000, that hospitals would work on emergency systems only for four weeks, that schools could be closed for four weeks, that the stock market and banks could be closed for eight days such would be the chaos, that 50 per cent availability of telecoms only from 1 to 10 January would be the prospect, that there would be ten days disruption <Col N="504" /> of the postal services and that there would be 30 days disruption of transport, including air traffic control, rail and bus services.  Picture Dublin with failure in even this menu of areas without going into a range of other areas which we could all pick as examples.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue of awareness.  While I welcome the awareness launch today for the business sector by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, I hope it is not too little too late.  I have not seen the brochure.  It is certainly late but perhaps better late than never in relation to this issue.  I compliment the public service on the work being done in the past 12 months, particularly the past six months, in relation to readiness and Y2K preparedness generally.  I need to hear more on how euro compatibility will be married to Y2K readiness. That is a very serious issue.  We need reassurances that the European Commission and Europe is up and running.  We are told it is six months behind Ireland in terms of preparedness. Outside Europe, I hear Scandinavia is even 12 months behind that again.  What does that mean for interaction and infra-trade for a small open exporting country like Ireland?</P>
    <P>The list of difficulties and problems is there and we could all choose queries and problems.  To borrow the words of an expert commentator in this area, there is no doubt that failure to plan is to plan for failure.  I look forward to the Minister's response and thank him for being with us this afternoon.</P>

      <P>As Senator Avril Doyle has done, it is my intention to focus on the effect of the year 2000 on small businesses.  We are talking about IT and technology and yet we do not have the use of aids such as overhead projectors and computers screens.  In an effort to try to bring us into the modern world, I made two signs, one for the year 2000, Y2K, and a new one for the year 2000 compliant, Y2KC, to which I have added the letter &ldquo;C&rdquo; and which I will patent as something at which we will look in the future.</P>
      <P>Without a doubt, the largest difficulty for the small and medium sized business sector, where the business is generally owner managed and where they make a significant contribution to the economy, is awareness and acceptance of the seriousness of this problem.  I intend to address that issue, look at the action which needs to be taken and to comment, as Senator Avril Doyle has done, on the compounded difficulties of the implementation of the Year 2000 and the euro in and around the same time.  I will also look at the inflexibility of the year 2000 deadline and the fact it cannot be moved.  I would, however, also like to take a slightly different tack in terms of focusing on the year 2000 issue as an opportunity for Ireland as well as the threat it poses for our businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we get carried away on a tide of fear that the world is falling around us, we might remember Chicken Licken and the acorn which fell on his head.  He ran helter-skelter around <Col N="505" /> worrying that the sky was falling until somebody with a little common sense told him it was only an acorn.  I do not intend to take away from the seriousness of the problem but it is important people know the Year 2000 problem is fixable in case they fear they cannot solve it.  We can plan for and address this problem.  It is not rocket science. If people think about it and do a little study, it can be handled and they can take effective action in a planned and organised manner.</P>
    <P>As Ireland is a small island on the periphery of Europe we sometimes suffer from an inferiority complex.  We think we cannot do anything right and the problem is our fault.  However, this is not an Irish problem.  It is a global issue and many countries will have as much, if not more, difficulty than Ireland addressing it.  It is the millennium time bomb and awareness is the most important aspect.  In a recent study to which 40 companies responded, 17.5 per cent had taken no action whatsoever in relation to the Year 2000 difficulties while 57.5 per cent had begun to study the issue.  A further 15 per cent had begun a formal impact assessment but only 7.5 per cent had begun to change codes and computer systems.  If one examined the 7.5 per cent of the 40 companies, I suggest many of them would be large multinational operations with large budgets and resources.  This is why I intend to focus my comments on small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>In a worst case scenario on 1 January 2000, one gets into one's car which starts.  One travels to the end of the road but the traffic lights are not working and one is caught in a traffic jam for 30 minutes.  One arrives late for work and tries to use the lift but it is not working.  One arrives in the office but one has missed an important meeting so one decides to fax the details one intended to discuss.  However, the fax will not work because it has an imbedded chip with a date.  One decides to use one's PC and e-mail the details. However, the PC or e-mail will not work.  The company's communication systems internally and externally will not work.  One then discovers that the bank did not process a payment so the money for which one is waiting did not arrive in one's account and money which was supposed to have been paid out was not transmitted in time.  The just in time processes on which one's business depends did not work.  This is a worst case scenario but it should not happen if people prepare and take action now.</P>
    <P>The issue of funding gives an idea of the seriousness of the problem and how big businesses are considering the matter.  The Bank of Ireland estimates it will cost it upwards of £40 million to address the issue properly, involving the spending of £20 million this year and £20 million next year.  The cost to Ireland is estimated at approximately £7 billion.  The ESB suggests it will spend £11 million.  The international company, Unilever, estimates it will have spent £300 million before the issue is finally addressed.  However, its big concern is how it will know it has finally solved all the problems when some of the difficulties <Col N="506" /> have not yet arisen and have not been considered.</P>
    <P>We should not only consider the big businesses which have large budgets but also consider small 0businesses.  Many people say hardware has been replaced in recent years, but many companies are still operating 486 computers which have not been replaced because they are still doing the job for which they were intended.  However, such computers now need to be replaced and each new PC will cost in the region of £1,200 to £2,000.  If a company has an old fax which is not Year 2000 compliant, it may cost approximately £350 to £500 to replace.  In terms of software upgrades, a company may have a system which operates a payroll for 15 to 20 employees.  The system may include an accounts package which handles purchases, debtors and creditors and regularises stock. However, it is not Year 2000 compliant and it must be upgraded.</P>
    <P>It may also be necessary to upgrade operating systems, project management and spreadsheet software and databases.  Even WordPerfect version 6.1, which is the word processing package used by Senators, is not Year 2000 compliant.  For a small company with five employees the approximate cost of those software upgrades is £5,000 to £10,000.  For a slightly larger company with ten employees, the approximate cost will be £10,000 to £50,000.  This must be funded from pre-profit income.  Most organisations may be working on a 10 per cent margin.  To pay for upgrades which may cost a minimum of £5,000 and a possible maximum of £50,000, the turnover must increase by somewhere in the region of £50,000 to £500,000.  This is the scale of the problem facing us.  A company may have to increase its turnover by up to £500,000 to pay for the right to survive in the economy.  The difficulty facing small and medium sized enterprises in Ireland, Europe, America and elsewhere is that the cost appears to have no direct business benefit except continued existence.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is competitive advantage and the concept of the chain.  The Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, stated that we should not only worry about ourselves but also our suppliers and customers.  Will companies miss deadlines because suppliers missed their deadlines?  A huge number of manufacturing organisations deal with a large of number of suppliers which operate just in time delivery systems.  Stock is not delivered to companies by subcontractors until it is required on the assembly line.  A company may get away with missing a deadline once, but it will not get away with missing any further deadlines.  What will happen if a company misses a deadline because its supplier missed its deadline?</P>
    <P>Regarding the incorrect processing of payments, every small business is aware of the importance of cash flow and having money to pay its debts.  It is dependent on money arriving from suppliers and customers.  The banks have pushed automated transaction systems and a large number of companies are paid by electronic data <Col N="507" /> transfer funds.  The information no longer arrives in the form of a cheque which one can run to the bank and lodge to one's account.  It now arrives overnight on the computer from one system to another.  Any hiccup in that chain will affect cash flow, payments to the company and payments to its suppliers.  There may be cancellation of orders and new stock may not arrive on time.  Stock may be <i>in situ</i> because it cannot be issued in time.  I mentioned intercompany communications.  A huge number of companies now depend on e-mail systems to communicate internally and externally with their clients and suppliers.  This area is likely to be affected if proper planning is not carried out and action is not taken.</P>
    <P>Action can be taken and despite the comments of Senator Doyle, it is reasonably easy to take. The systems in an organisation need to be identified.  It is not rocket science. Every piece of software which deals with a date needs to be examined and checked to find out if it accepts a four digit date. The difficulty is software which only accepts dates in a two digit format where, for example, &ldquo;98&rdquo; represents the year 1998.  In the year 2000, the &ldquo;00&rdquo; may throw the computer software back to the year 1900.  People can type in a date, for example, 29 February 2000 as 29-02-00 to take account of the leap year, and check if the software can handle it.  It is also possible to check if the software can handle 1 January 2000 by keying in 01-01-00.  If it cannot, we will know there is a problem.</P>
    <P>Data for the next millennium can be inputted, various reports run and systems can be audited and tested with the results recorded.  When an inventory has been carried out on the various software used we can then conduct an impact assessment on what changes are necessary and the effect of not implementing them in time. Many small and medium sized enterprises do not have bespoke software written specifically for them.  They tend to buy off the shelf packages and are in a better position because they will be able to buy the solution from software suppliers and will not have to recruit a programmer to make the changes.</P>
    <P>It is important that senior management takes responsibility for this matter.  There is no time for reports and decisions; action must be taken now. We must realise the seriousness of the situation and what must be done.  We must plan to get it done effectively and set achievable deadlines so that the work can be completed.  The deadline of the year 2000 cannot be extended.  Deadlines are most important and the work must be completed before the deadline in question.  The Bank of Ireland said 125 man years is needed for the work to be done to get their systems ready and it is estimated it will cost £40 million.</P>
    <P>Change will be more gradual in terms of EMU and the impact of its implementation in association with the year 2000.  The deadlines are not as urgent and could be extended.  The impact of <Col N="508" /> EMU, the Year 2000 and the minimum wage issues will lead to a difficult time for small businesses. The Government is committed to implementing these measures as is evidenced by the programme of information and awareness it is putting in place and recognises the difficulties ahead.  I commend the partnership approach evident in addressing this issue.  Banks and building societies are sponsoring a television programme which will be broadcast at prime time later this week or early next week.  They are putting together advice packages to offer their customers. Chambers of commerce, employers organisations and trade unions are coming together in partnership to try to address these problems.  That will be the saving grace for the country.</P>
    <P>Hardware and software companies will have to work together for the good of the country and will have to share their knowledge with us; they are large multinational organisations with huge resources available to them globally.  They must be prepared to share information with the Government and other information organisations. The Year 2000 difficulty is an opportunity as well as a threat.  When we talk about the need to purchase additional equipment we should look at the number of computer manufacturers located in Ireland, such as Dell, Gateway, Microsoft, Lotus and HP.  These companies will need more people as they will have more sales and orders to meet.  They have a direct impact on the economic growth of their locality as they provide work to suppliers, subcontractors and temporary workers. We must get the message out that there are positive aspects to this issue for suppliers, customers and natives.  If the problem is seen as too daunting, the ostrich approach will be adopted which is to stick one's head in the sand and think it will go away.  This problem will not go away and action must be taken now.</P>
    <P>The role of the Government is not to come along and manage our businesses; it is to heighten awareness and to provide guidelines and support. The brochure that has been produced is colourful and clear and will have a significant impact on the tens of thousands of businesses which will receive it in the coming days.  The regional conferences being organised are free and everybody can attend.  The Government acknowledged the partnership approach and the seriousness of the problem.  Its role is to advise and to heighten awareness and it will not try to run anybody's business.  It agrees the problem is serious but is addressing it and doing its best.  The question is whether companies are Year 2000 compliant; this is not rocket science.  Companies must be assessed individually and plan the way in which they will address the problem.  They must test and review and, if necessary, do so again.  It is possible to make the grade.  Ireland is a country of saints and scholars and the scholars are well able to handle technology.  If we move from awareness to action and are not afraid to handle the problem, we can sort out the difficulty and not end up in the worst <Col N="509" /> case scenario with no traffic lights, telephones, computers and software that work on 01-01-2000.</P>

      <P>There are 605 days left and we are getting closer every day.  Is it 605 days to a bright new millennium or severe chaos that could disrupt the economy, threaten lives and directly affect the lives of every citizen?  I first raised the issue of the millennium bug in the House in March 1997 when I said we were running out of time.  The situation now is considerably more serious because we are well beyond the eleventh hour.  We are insiders who know about the problem, its cause and we have an inkling of the enormous importance of it and the vastness of the task of coping with it but the problem is that only insiders know.</P>
      <P>Most big private institutions and organisations with IT departments are on top of the problem. Tackling this problem is a very costly issue for companies such as mine but we are aware of it and are coping with it.  I returned yesterday from the United States and the concerns that were addressed there were interesting.  Senator Avril Doyle referred to the effort made in New York. I attended a food marketing conference and heard of one company which is closing a store shortly.  It has decided that the day after the store closes it will move everything in it forward to the year 2000 and carry out an experiment to check for unforeseen problems.  Those of us who have walked around our businesses may think we have identified the problem areas but it is possible that we have not.  Something is bound to crop up which we have not thought about.</P>
      <P>In my own company, which I am sure is no different from many others, we have gone through every line of computer code which we use and adjusted it, where necessary.  This involved hundreds of thousands of lines of codes and that is not all.  The embedded microprocessors in the equipment could each, potentially, have the same problem.  We have walked through our shops, listed every piece of equipment that might or might not have a microprocessor inside it and followed up each item with the manufacturer who supplied it to find out if it is Year 2000 compliant.  If it is not, we hope that we and the manufacturer will take remedial action.  This is a major project, even for a company like my own which has only 16 branches.  I am not at all complacent or confident that we have done enough to overcome this problem.</P>
      <P>The banks will also have a major problem but I believe they have it in hand.  I am concerned about two parts of our economy &mdash; the public sector and small business firms.  Both have been referred to and Senator Cox has concentrated on the small business sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The verdict on the public sector must be mixed although I acknowledge the steps the Minister has described and I congratulate those who have taken them.  Some Departments are taking the matter very seriously and are working hard on it but others are taking a laid back approach which <Col N="510" /> is possibly a throw back to the old days before the strategic management initiative when the customer did not really matter.  It is a matter for concern that the public sector, in general, does not appear to be allocating the level of resources that experts suggest is needed to do the job properly and in time.  I am sure that everyone who is working on it is working very hard indeed but are enough resources being put into solving the problem? It is difficult to tell from the outside and we are right to be sceptical about the bland assurances on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in Europe, overall, the public sector seems to be spending a great deal less on this problem than the private sector.  That may turn out to be disastrous for the citizens of Europe, including ourselves.  I would like to think that our public service is not taking a lead from their counterparts elsewhere but is instead being guided by the kind of action the big hitters in the private sector are taking.  However, I am not holding my breath.  I am worrying.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about what I call the devolved public sector &mdash; the health boards, local government bodies and places which are removed from the centre of the State.  The problem in these areas has the potential to affect every citizen and even, in some cases, to threaten their lives.  Senator Cox referred to traffic lights failing to work.  We are also talking about lifts in hospitals taking on a mind of their own or &mdash; even more scaringly &mdash; all kinds of hi-tech medical equipment in hospitals behaving unexpectedly. Drip-feed machines at the end of hospital beds might contain parts which will not cope with the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned because it is very hard for central Government to exercise precise control over these devolved areas.  Departments can send out circulars but they form part of the mountain of paperwork that pour into these bodies every day.  Past history should suggest to us that central Government is not very good at getting things done at a distance except when it controls the purse strings and can make people do their bidding.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of the public sector I will touch on a problem of culture which may cost us dear in this case.  I have often observed that the public service has a different attitude to time.  It is best summed up in the notion of doing things retrospectively.  Traditionally the emphasis in the public service has been on doing things right but not always in the right time.  Time sensitivity has not, in general, been part of the public service tradition.  It is always difficult, therefore, to create a sense of urgency in the public service. In relation to this problem time is of the essence because the millennium is not going to wait, not even for the public service.  The millennium is not something that can be coped with retrospectively and it is vital that this message gets through to all levels of the public service, however distant they may be from the centre of power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> I know some people who plan not to fly in the days immediately following 1 January 2000.  I can understand their fears.  They are not merely worried about aeroplanes but also about air traffic control and many other areas of air travel. Others, of course, are planning to celebrate the millennium in the air.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The main concern in the private sector is about smaller firms.  Big firms can look after themselves and, to the best of my knowledge, are doing this already.  This does not appear to be the case with smaller firms and this is a major national problem.  Most of our businesses &mdash; 95 per cent &mdash; are small.  Nine out of ten are what are called micro businesses, employing fewer than ten people.  There are more than 100,000 small businesses.  They represent a significant part of our overall economy and they interact on a daily basis with millions of Irish people. These businesses need help to cope with the millennium bug and, as far as I can see, they are not getting it.</P>
      <P>The Government needs to take a two headed approach to the problem.  Where big firms are concerned the role of the Government should be to reassure itself that all the big players are Year 2000 compliant.  The Government's attitude to big business should be, this is your problem; have you solved it yet?</P>
      <P>A totally different approach must be taken to smaller companies.  These companies need information but they also need help.  At the moment they are getting some information from people with a vested interest in selling them a solution. They do not know how seriously to take this information and wonder if it is merely scaremongering. One cannot blame them for this because some of it probably is.  Some small firms are not convinced that the millennium bug is a real problem for them.  Some are likely to ignore the problem unless we encourage them not to do so.  This debate is one further step in reminding everybody of the problem and I welcome it for that reason.</P>
      <P>Small firms do not have much information from independent sources and that is where the Government should be playing a greater role than it has up to now.  The Government should also be active in creating a high profile sense of the urgency of the matter among small firms.  It is in the nature of running a small business to focus on the practical things in front of your nose. You deal with the here and now, not with the problems that stretch into the far distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Six hundred days seem an eternity to a small business person but the message must go out that this is a problem, that it is a problem that may wreck an entire business and one that must be coped with now if businesses are to be ready in time.  There is a good possibility that products on <Col N="512" /> shelves may be affected &mdash; some products have been rejected by up to date computers on the grounds that they were out of date since 1900. Most shops, small or large, do not have point of sale equipment which identifies the date of the product, but that technology is developing.  That is only one technicality out of many in my business and many things may not have been considered in other businesses.  It is much more likely to affect smaller businesses, which is why the urgency of the matter should be stressed.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government should give financial help to small companies to deal with the problem and we can justify this on the grounds that the continued viability of small business is a critical national issue.  My hunch is that many small businesses will need financial help to get into action.  It can be argued that it is in their interests to cope with the problem and they should therefore bear the full cost, but we must get them moving quickly and money may be part of the solution.</P>
    <P>Everyone who has been in touch with this problem since it was first mooted has had his or her attitude challenged along the way.  They have come to realise that the more one looks at it, the more serious it becomes.  In the beginning we thought it affected only old computers, that personal computers would not be affected and that all recent software would be year 2000 compliant &mdash; none of that was so.  No one thought about the imbedded microprocessors which are an integral part of every piece of equipment we use, such as traffic lights, video recorders and lift controls, as mentioned by Senator Cox.  The daunting truth is that even yet, a long way past the eleventh hour, we may not appreciate the full seriousness of the problem.  There may still be more of this iceberg under the water, which is all the more reason that we should deal fully and effectively with the problems we have identified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the debate because it gives us an opportunity to spread the message.  This is not intended to scare people but to be an alarm call which wakes us up to the fact that there are only 605 days left to go.</P>

      <P>I am not the computer wizard of the House but I think I understand what the problem means and I welcome the debate.  As Senator Quinn said, small business people may not have a problem but large, highly organised businesses will.  Some multinational companies are spending many hours to find a solution and let us hope one is found.  The problem is like two cog wheels which mesh and run satisfactorily until someone puts in an extra cog which stops the system working.  The solution may be to provide an extra chip or to change the chip already in the <Col N="513" /> computers.  This will cause a major problem for big multiples such as Senator Quinn's business. Every item going through their systems is coded and the information world will come to a standstill.</P>
      <P>I have great confidence in an ordinary, simple solution, even if we have to stop the clock and start it again.  The world will not end and business will not stop.  People have called on the Government to do more but the problem is so big and affects so many countries that no single Government can provide the technology to solve it.  We are entitled to be concerned and to keep our business people informed, whether they run small rural businesses or work in the IFSC.  We are all in this together.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my views, which are simple.  I am confident that a solution will be found because too much is at stake.  The people who invented the computer in the first instance, and the technology for control of information, are working overtime to provide a solution. We will never be allowed to reach rock bottom &mdash; technology will not stop and we will not have to return to counting on our fingers.  No one, not even in remote parts of Ireland, is thinking in those negative terms.  People are confident that a solution will be found by those working on the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government is aware of the research being done and will have an input if it is necessary. Everyone is aware of this problem and it is the subject of debates on television and at conferences. Many people are expressing fears and there may also be some scaremongering.  Nevertheless, common sense will prevail and hard headed business people, who have so much at stake, will find a solution which will be available to all businesses, from small rural credit unions to huge international banks.  I am sure we will find a solution in time, before we reach D-day.  There is a problem if we look at the downside but there is also a solution and I have total confidence in the ability of the IT world to find it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be ridiculous to avoid this problem so we must confront it.  No one has mentioned that technology has been the most profitable industry for a small number of people. Some Irish people have become multimillionaires in a short time through providing solutions to problems.  If we look at the Bill Gateses and Dells of the world, one thing is guaranteed &mdash; they will become much richer as a result of the in-built problems which will arise as we approach 2000. The problems will be resolved, especially if those involved in the technological industry tackle the issue.  A 14 year old could possibly provide a solution but would be prevented from doing so by the computer industry, which is too big and profitable and controls too much of the world's industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn said that small businesses will have to cope with the problems associated with the millennium bug.  However, they will suffer as <Col N="514" /> a result of the action or inaction of their suppliers and providers of services.  If the latter find themselves in trouble they will pass on the costs and their customers will suffer more.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that banks calculating interest levels could find that their programmes could produce seriously incorrect interest amounts.  They are doing that at present and unknown to their customers.  It is also suggested that telecommunications operators may have problems with their charging systems and that companies relying on just-on-time manufacturing could face systems breakdown.</P>
    <P>The banks have embraced information technology and have got rid of all of their employees over 50 years of age.  However, their computers are unable to identify the potential businessman who, for example, can make money from a sandpit. In consequence, they are recalling their former plant management teams and are having to revert to their former ways of doing business.</P>
    <P>If computer providers set their mind to this issue there would be no millennium bug. However, this would not pay the industry.  As a result, Irish computer companies will go out of business because they will not be up to scratch.  It could result in a wipe out of the computer industry in this country, especially if a 14 year old devises a solution to the problem and passes it on to Bill Gates.  That is as big a problem as the one confronting the smaller or mainframe computers.</P>
    <P>The developments in computers over the past 25 years have been a disgrace.  When I first went into business in the late 1950s and early 1960s mainframe computers were being introduced. Some of them were as big as this Chamber.  While they were increasingly developed and progressively reduced in size, the one certainty was that a person buying a computer could never get it repaired; he had to upgrade to stay in business. Computers were continually dumped and the millennium bug will accelerate this trend.</P>
    <P>Comptometer operators &mdash; effectively an old computer &mdash; could work out percentages, for example, how many pounds of sausage would fit in a container or how many tons of produce could be stored in the hold of a ship.  They could know the difference between something dated 2001 and 1901 and it is a nonsense that modern computers are unable to make this distinction.  This problem was built in by the industry to once again rip off businesses and individuals who rely on computers.</P>
    <P>All Members and staff in the Oireachtas have received new computers.  It is suggested that they will be out of date before the end of this year, never mind 2001.  Again, another computer company will win a contract from the Houses of the Oireachtas and all computer equipment, whether it entails telephones, printers or whatever, will be dumped again.  In the process, another rake of money will be made by companies such as Dell and Microsoft.</P>
    <P>Given the numbers who have been playing with computers from the age of two or three, there will <Col N="515" /> be at least one 14 year old who could solve this problem.  However, when people have a problem with their computers they will be told to replace them because they are not 2000 compatible. While surveys have been undertaken by companies such as IBM, they have not checked the position of smaller companies.  They will suffer from the inaction of the bigger firms who will be ripped off again by the computer companies.  However, they at least will be able to write off the cost of new machinery against their profits.</P>
    <P>The real timebomb is not the millennium bug but the need to control computer manufacturers. The US Government has at least attempted to impose some order on them.  For example, it has imposed a fine of $1 million per day on Bill Gates if he does not do something about the lack of competition world-wide in the computer industry. While a debate like this is useful, we must realise that the bigger computer firms are ripping everybody off and the millennium bug will be the biggest rip off ever perpetrated by them on individuals and business people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the campaign launched today by the Minister of State This is a problem for all, both in the private and State sectors. Time is of the essence.  The experts and those involved in consultancy services will not be readily available because of the pressures they will face.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, inadequate planning is evident. The Minister of State rightly said that the Year 2000 problem is very much with us today.  Many businesses have failed to take proper action to deal with the problem.  If ignored, it could have very serious consequences for businesses and their ability to operate after 1 January 2000.</P>
      <P>The Government is right to be concerned that small and medium sized businesses especially are not sufficiently prepared.  I therefore welcome the brochure which it launched today and I hope it achieves a widespread distribution.  It will be very important in bringing about the necessary awareness, which appears to be absent.  I also welcome the announcement of regional conferences on the matter.  Hopefully all of the efforts being made will ensure this complex issue will be at the top of everybody's agenda.</P>
      <P>It is important that everyone in business ensures Year 2000 compliance for all their customers and suppliers.  It is reassuring to know that all Government Departments and offices have produced Year 2000 plans and that they are acting on the replacement of all ageing computer systems and infrastructures.  It is also reassuring to know that an interdepartmental Year 2000 monitoring committee with private sector participation is in place and working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being aware is the first step in ensuring a proper response.  In business this is a problem which requires top level management involvement.  The potentially major impact on business requires the involvement of all relevant functions of any large <Col N="516" /> organisation.  As we know, this is a luxury which small businesses and sole traders do not enjoy; they have to take all the necessary steps themselves. These steps are well defined.</P>
    <P>Testing will be the largest and most critical task.  It is not limited to demonstrating that each system and component works properly with dates exceeding the year 2000, but must ensure interconnected systems inside and outside the organisation are able to co-operate correctly.  Presumably there will be failures so a great deal of fine tuning will be necessary.</P>
    <P>The shortage of programming and project management skills has become one of the most critical issues.  Apart from the overall scale of the problem, the availability of professionals who are proficient in older programming languages and able to manage large and complex projects is limited. Organisations with a substantial internal IT staff will strive to retain it, whereas organisations relying on external staff will soon be confronted with the rapid exhaustion of the available capacity and the related price increases.  Costs are huge. Organisations, small businesses in particular, using commercial software packages must urgently inquire about the plans of their suppliers to make such packages compliant.</P>
    <P>Suppliers of computer hardware and software and of computer based products and services should provide their customers with timely and transparent information about the readiness of their existing and new products for the Year 2000 and adopt a proactive and responsible attitude to their customers.  I hope we will not hear of the total rip offs to which Senator Lanigan referred. That is a danger.  Senator Fergal Quinn put the issue into sharp focus when he said that we were only 605 days away from the year 2000.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate and wish the campaign launched on the issue every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points made by many Senators about the problems facing small businesses.  Multinationals can answer a problem of this nature but let us hope there will not be a problem.  It is not realistic to say that because we are going from one century to another, the whole system must break down.  I would be very confused if it was realistic, particularly with technology improving so much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am involved in a small business.  It is unfair to the small business dependent on a turnover of £400,000 to have to upgrade constantly and attempt to hold onto staff.  I know Minister Treacy is aware of the problem, but as a small country do we have any power at all over what is happening? The United States is prepared to fine companies involved in computerisation millions of dollars for every month they do not comply with regulations.  What power do we have if there is a problem in the year 2000?  Is there any way to secure an international agreement that, if systems break down after 1999, companies such as Apple and Microsoft should have a system for the year 2000 if a solution is not found before then?  Can <Col N="517" /> we agree to a stamp for computer systems indicating that they are year 2000 compliant?  That is one answer.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan commented on the upgrading of computers.  No one buys an addition now, instead that person buys a new computer.  People pay up to £3,000 for a computer to help their student children and it is out of date after four months.  I find that most unfair and yet nobody is answerable.  If that happened with anything else we would demand an upgrade and a guarantee. In this area everyone is at the mercy of the computer manufacturers.  What rights do we have?</P>
    <P>We are a small consumer of the equipment but can boast of being involved in the high-tech industries.  We are doing well from them, we are delighted about that and do not wish to speak negatively of international companies which are creating work.  Developments in Leixlip are a good example and we appreciate it, but we do not want to be in a situation where we are monopolised and given no guarantee.</P>
    <P>Has this issue been discussed by the European Commission?  Can Europe speak as one on this matter?  We are talking about a population of over 300 million people.  Is it possible to exert pressure via our MEPs?  We should demand that they take action.</P>
    <P>Mobile &rsquo;phones are being upgraded constantly and their use is becoming more widespread.  I never thought I would use one but I cannot do without one.  I can get more done in an hour with the &rsquo;phone than in a day sitting at the desk.  The constant upgrading of technology begs the question of where it will end.  When will we have a technology that will last?  A family known to me bought a computer for their student son and was told on the day it was bought that it would be out of date after four months.  Had I been the sales assistant I would have been ashamed to say that. If one spends £2,000 or more on a system one should expect it to last longer than three or four months.</P>
    <P>A serious examination of the development of technology is required.  We are but two years from the end of the century, yet we do not have a solution to the Year 2000 problem.  Is it that there is no answer despite all the expertise?  I suspect there may be an answer but the multinational companies are holding out to make more money.  They should be compelled to provide solutions. The EU member states should act collectively to seek solutions.  It is imperative that we do so.  We must develop systems to which we can add in the future rather than having to eliminate them.</P>
    <P>I am not an expert in this field but I am a realist.  I do not like the idea of going to computer superstores where expensive technology which is obsolete after a few months is for sale.  We have a responsibility to ensure that we are not left with a monopoly in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue, which has been <Col N="518" /> raised on many occasions on the Order of Business. We could not have dreamed of the transformation in technology which has taken place. We look forward to the year 2000 with excitement and enthusiasm for the opportunities it will present for further development and progress.  On 22 May our generation will take a most important decision in the referendum which, hopefully, will be carried overwhelmingly with the aim of unifying the country and the nation.</P>
      <P>The country has made amazing progress under partition, particularly in the last 20 years.  I think back to a meeting in Castlepollard, County Westmeath, during the 1965 general election caused by the death of M. J. Kennedy.  The late Paddy Lenihan, the father of the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, and the former Tánaiste, Brian Lenihan, said at that meeting outside the local church that the greatest scarcity in Ireland was knowledge.  How right he was.  When Donogh O'Malley introduced the school transport system in 1966 it gave many children the opportunity to obtain second and third level education.  That is where the progress started.</P>
      <P>Our young people have been able to take advantage of technology.  They have an attitude which is open to technology and it is amazing what young children can do with computers.  I am a product of the education system of the 1940s and 1950s and I am pleased to be able to congratulate those who contributed to the development of the present education system.</P>
      <P>I admire the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy. He has been one of the best Ministers of State in recent times.  He made a range of points which must be taken into account in the decisions to be taken by industry and commerce.  He pointed out the various problems which might arise.  The brochure which he launched today highlights the problems resulting from the failure of software applications or data corruption:</P>
      <P>&mdash; loss of contracts from inability to meet just-in-time deliveries</P>
      <P>&mdash; the cancellation of orders of new stock</P>
      <P>&mdash; inability to issue stock invoices or track debtors and creditors</P>
      <P>&mdash; incorrect processing of payments</P>
      <P>&mdash; disruption of supply chains due to Year 2000 problems suffered by key suppliers and customers</P>
      <P>&mdash; computer controlled production systems could fail in a manner that causes physical damage</P>
      <P>&mdash; automatic controls could fail to operate leading to overheating, fire and perhaps explosion</P>
      <P>&mdash; rapid and uncontrolled shutdown of processes may lead to damage to process machinery and other possible consequences [it would be very serious for an industrial undertaking to have to face such problems.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" />&mdash; safety guards on machines could malfunction increasing the risk of injury to employees</P>
    <P>&mdash; failure could arise in fire alarms, sprinkler systems, air conditioning, heating, lifts, telephone exchanges, photocopiers, fax machines, VCRs, refrigeration units, ovens, etc.. the Year 2000 problem could have wide ranging effects from disruption and inconvenience at one extreme to catastrophic losses at the other.</P>
    <P>The guidelines laid out by the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, are most important.  He and his Department officials will have to meet all the business agencies and groups which have played their part in this country's success.  The difficulties that business will encounter must be explained in detail.</P>
    <P>In common with most of the public, I did not realise until recently how serious this problem will be.  I always thought that a &ldquo;0&rdquo; would come after a &ldquo;9&rdquo;.  This problem will be a bonanza for the computer business, and Ireland has been very fortunate in attracting so many of the world leaders in that area.  The year 2000 is a leap year, in addition to the existing problems, but this should also be an opportunity for businesses to update their databases.  Most businesses will avail of the opportunity to improve their computer infrastructure.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the transformation caused in business by the mobile phone, which meant one could do twice the work one was able to do before mobile phone use became widespread.  We have all become far better businessmen because of the availability of mobile phones.  There are also other methods of updating one's skills.</P>
    <P>Ireland has achieved much in the past 20 years. If we have the same progress in the next ten years, who knows what technology we will be discussing here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this timely debate on the millennium bug or Y2K.  As Senator Cassidy said, the year 2000 is a leap year and we will no doubt have the prophets of doom and gloom telling us the end is nigh.  However, the end will be nigh for some mainframe computers because of short cuts taken in computer technology in the 1970s and 1980s by removing the first two digits of the year.  It would have cost a small amount of money to remedy at the time, and now we face huge expense in rectifying the matter.</P>
      <P>Estimates of the cost for Irish business vary between £500 million and £2 billion.  The Minister of State said the problem would cost the Civil Service £13 million; it is not clear if that sum refers to remedial work or the purchase of new technology, but there is no doubt that this will be an enormous problem for world business, given that the year 2000 is only 18 months away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that there have already been instances of computers programmed to operate into the new millennium malfunctioning.  For <Col N="520" /> example, computers have released prisoners from jail and told people of 100 years of age to come back to kindergarten.  Marks and Spencers had to destroy thousands of cans of beef because they had exceeded their sell-by dates by over a century, according to the computer dealing with their labels.</P>
    <P>The problem has already impacted considerably on some of the most modern computer systems, and we must take whatever steps are necessary. I was interested by the Minister of State's statement that 100,000 leaflets on this matter would be distributed and that there would be a number of regional conferences on the topic.  The Minister of State stated that he would like everyone in business to read his brochure immediately and act thereafter.  Unsolicited literature of various types goes to businesses on a daily basis, and it is unlikely that all businesses will act on the basis of a request by the Minister of State.  We need a tighter framework for dealing with this matter.  We have approximately 18 months to resolve this matter, but is there a monitoring process in place to check if businesses have moved to deal with the problem?  Is there a help line in the Department to deal with queries from the business sector?</P>
    <P>Issuing 100,000 leaflets will not solve the problem, nor will regional conferences.  The vast majority of businesses are small to medium sized and may not have the finance or know-how to solve this problem.  Some may throw the brochure in the bin.  What steps will be taken to follow up this initial step?  Are there any inspectors who will be responsible for seeing if our major industries are complying?  I presume the multinationals will be to the fore in remedying this problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned the Civil Service. What is being done in the very large and important semi-State sector and the health boards?  Incorrectly programmed computer chips could cause problems in cardiac hospitals, lift failure and traffic gridlock.  Health and education are very important areas.  Has the Minister put in place inspection procedures to ensure essential public utilities are kept up-to-date?  Is he certain they have put in place remedial mechanisms to ensure they do not break down in the year 2000 as a result of the millennium bug?</P>
    <P>Are reports being made on this matter?  Can we ask for a report on what has taken place to date in six months' time during the autumn session? Will the Minister provide statistics on the number of businesses which have updated their technology?</P>
    <P>Ireland does business with other EU countries and Third World countries.  Have any steps been taken to ensure a co-ordinated approach by the EU member states to the implementing of remedial work in this area?  We have a great deal of trade with Third World countries, particularly in the agricultural sector.  Is the Government taking a proactive stance in regard to that client base or is it leaving it to individual businesses to ensure they have taken remedial technological <Col N="521" /> steps which would allow us to continue to trade without a breakdown in communication?</P>
    <P>These are very serious matters.  There will, undoubtedly, be flaws and breakdowns and some companies will not take the necessary steps. However, it behoves us to ensure we have done everything in our power in this regard.  Litigation may rear its ugly head when clients are not serviced in the manner which they expect.  The State might not have responsibility in that area in the private sector but it will have in the public sector. We should ensure we are above reproach in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  The issue is quite simple in that a serious malfunction will occur in the year 2000 in all the major mainframes which predate 1996 if steps are not taken to deal with it now.  It is our responsibility as elected public representatives to ensure a strong level of public awareness about this issue so that remedial action can be taken.  Will the Minister return to the House with a report or statement within a reasonable space of time so that we can be satisfied the steps he envisages have been implemented?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is of great importance to everyone it concerns.  Much of what the Minister said in regard to the year 2000 is somewhat frightening when one realises we should have taken the necessary steps before now.  It appears there may be fairly serious problems.  One would wonder why we have not moved faster in this regard and why we did not foresee the problems we might face over the next few years.</P>
      <P>We must examine the threats faced by business. We depend to a large extent on the software industry and any breakdowns in this area could cause serious problems.  Unfortunately, we have not tackled the problems although we are moving closer to D-Day.  Business people who thought they were modernising and moving with the times are now facing a serious financial burden.  Businesses which were advised to follow a particular course of action now do not know what financial expenditure they will incur as a result of this problem.  The Minister outlined the huge financial burden faced by Departments.  If that is the situation in Departments which were probably modernising and preparing for this, what will be faced by businesses?</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to conferences and the need to bring people up to speed, which is very important.  However, should people not have been made aware of the likely problems they faced several years ago?  People thought they were investing in facilities which would last for their business life but they now find a few years later that the facilities are in trouble.  When people purchased equipment they were given the impression it was very modern and would last for many years but the same company soon produced a new brochure and people realised they had wasted their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister outlined the serious problems we face.  Educational conferences are one way to <Col N="522" /> help industries in this regard but how are they to deal with the unexpected financial burden they face?  How do they take on this burden which so many of them did not think they would have to face?  They are aware that the problems are enormous.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker stated that so many valuable leaflets posted are never read and the Minister of State was correct to highlight this problem. The document which is being launched today needs to be read carefully.  Those in industry must study the document and make decisions.  We are talking about modern technology which is quickly going out of date.  People are spending substantial amounts of money updating equipment which is already out of date.  Previous speakers have raised important points and I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I could not help reflecting on how far we have come.  We are on the brink of the millennium discussing technological matters.  Our forefathers would have had extreme difficulty interpreting the terminology let alone the hardware.  This is a product of our economic success allied to the rapid and astonishing development of information technology over the past two decades. Until the 1950s and 1960s it would have taken a room half the size of this Chamber to contain the hardware.  The mind boggles when one considers that the memory available on such large computers did not compare to the laptop or personal computers operating on a microchip which one can fit on one's finger.</P>
      <P>This technology has come upon us so fast and the question before the House, so excellently addressed by the Minister of State, is a product of this success.  The year 2000 is rapidly approaching and many companies find that like many things in life, change has been put on the long finger.  I am pleased that the Government has taken the initiative, not only within Departments, as outlined by the Minister of State, but also by setting up the interdepartmental committee which incorporates the private sector.</P>
      <P>It is inevitable that some computers will not be capable of conversion in the year 2000.  One must assume that such hardware will be obsolete.  The Minister of State might confirm that this will be the case.  If that is the case, what will happen to the computers which have slowly been introduced into the education system?  This has taken place to a limited extent and we would all like to see more rapid advances in this regard where every child would have access to a PC at primary level. Sadly that is not yet the case but the Minister for Education and Science is moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of the millennium bug does not apply to computers manufactured in recent years. The Minister of State might confirm the cut-off year.  The problem lies before that year.  Many of <Col N="523" /> the computer systems operating in rural primary and secondary schools are quite old.  Their memories have been upgraded but they were manufactured in the early 1990s.  If these computers will be obsolete does the Minister of State have any plans for dealing with this issue?  There could be a huge financial burden placed on the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>If these machines are obsolete there is the wider question of how the Government plans to deal with their disposal.  It seems that there is a certain toxicity involved, if that is the correct word, because of the radioactive element in computers. It is similar to the debate some years ago on the problem of CFCs in old refrigerators. Plans were advanced at that stage to tackle this problem.  There is no similar disposal mechanism in place for obsolete computers.  Has the Government addressed this problem and has the Minister of State any views on this subject?</P>
    <P>I bought an Amstrad computer which is now referred to as an antique.  I subsequently purchased one of the discarded computers from the House.  The word processing facility suits me. However, thank God Members were given state of the art PCs and laptops in recent weeks.  I now have two computers which, effectively, are obsolete. I hope to pass them on to some voluntary organisation and perhaps Senator Cox might be able to brief me as to how I should dispose of them.  If there is a problem with toxicity or radioactivity which will continue for a number of years, does this pose a health risk?  What will happen to this mountain of computers?  Where will they go? They cannot be upgraded.  Their components are of little use so what will happen to them?</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  I have known the Minister of State for a long time.  He has taken to his task with the enthusiasm, commitment and dedication which I have always associated with him personally and politically.  He has highlighted an area of science and technology which might be boring in the hands of another Minister.  One could never accuse the Minister of State of being that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their fine contributions to this important debate.  It is an example of the relevance of this House to the modern problems of the country and the technological advancement of commerce.  I commend the House for introducing this debate and allowing Members an opportunity to speak on this important day when we launch the national campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle referred to the need for various Departments, particularly the Departments of Health and Children and Social, Community and Family Affairs, to ensure that they and their agencies are Y2K compliant.  Senator Quinn raised a similar point on the devolved public sector.  I assure the House that the Cabinet has consulted on this issue on a number of occasions. <Col N="524" /> Each Minister will ensure that this issue receives appropriate attention.  The Cabinet has issued strict instructions to each Minister to take a personal management interest in this area, to liaise not alone within their own Departments but with all State agencies and Government services reporting to them, to ensure they are working towards making compliance commonplace across their area of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also referred to the introduction of EMU compounding the Year 2000 problem. This is a fact and there is no doubt about it. Although we had an input into the introduction of the euro, the date of its introduction is now set.  Forfás, which operates under the aegis of our Department, has been running what I consider to be an effective campaign in educating small and medium enterprises on the euro issue.  There has been a great deal of involvement with that and there has been a significant positive response to the work being done by Forfás.  I congratulate Mr. Travers and his team for the great work done.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle also raised the added difficulty of leap years and quoted examples of what can happen, such as a medical scanner in the UK which could not operate on 29 February and a smelting plant which lost significant preparation. This is an added issue but all our discussions with software experts indicate that they are aware of this complication and that it is being considered along with the infinity date, 9 September 1999, and the Y2K date, 1 January 2000.  All these are component parts of the same problem and are being addressed simultaneously.  This means that whoever has to spend money within companies to redress the problem will resolve all three issues together.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the issue of liability and the position of banks and insurance companies. Liability in any given case is ultimately a matter for the courts, but the banking and insurance companies have given their support to the Government's campaign and we have included statements from both sectors in the brochure which I launched earlier today on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the issue of human resources because that level of activity will involve high demands on our software skills base. I believe we are in a better position than others, not least because of the investment by the Government in expanding the number of software graduates by an additional 1,000 per annum.  This is creating a skills base which means other countries with much greater populations and greater problems in the technological field will not have the response opportunity our graduates will make available to us over the next 12 months.</P>
    <P>As regards the European Commission, it is true to say that there has not been a high level of activity to date.  This is changing and it has recently brought member states together to share their experiences collectively.  We are participating in that and the Department is represented at <Col N="525" /> the European Commission level.  Senators can be assured that, while we will bring our strengths to the meeting, conversely we will take from it the experiences and strengths of others to assist us in our campaign.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox, an eminent professional in this field, gave a graphic description of what the likely charges for SMEs would be.  She estimated costs of between £5,000 and £10,000 for small and medium-sized companies.  The cost may be difficult for the SMEs and levels will vary from company to company.  It may be that small companies will not be penalised too greatly as in some cases it will merely mean bringing forward equipment replacement decisions.  Some research carried out by Forbairt indicates that many small firms will not have insurmountable problems.  Senator Cox also drew attention to the fact that many of these companies use off the shelf software which is easier to replace than bespoke software.</P>
    <P>Senators Quinn, Doyle and Coghlan also focused on the SMEs.  The main focus of the Government campaign is on this sector.  Both through the brochure and the roadshows we want to engage small firms.  In doing this we will also use other channels of communication, for example, financial institutions, banks, building societies, chambers of commerce, financial advisers, auditors, accountants, State industrial development agencies and county enterprise boards.  We are not just relying on the brochure which, as Senator Costello noted, can only achieve so much.</P>
    <P>Some Senators questioned whether a solution can be found to the problem.  The fact is that solutions are available.  We want to get companies to apply the solutions where they have a problem. Our campaign is directed at getting the companies to act now, to assess their systems, to consult with the professionals in the field, to take the necessary remedial action and to make the appropriate decisions to ensure their systems are compliant. This is so that we will be in unison and that we can continue with the commercial services and the economic growth which are vital as we move from this millennium to the next.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello asked about monitoring of industry's reaction to the campaign.  I established a monitoring committee to follow up on the campaign and to monitor its effect.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney raised a query regarding PCs becoming obsolete.  They may or may not.  The problem is less likely with recently produced and purchased computers but it cannot be overcome and remedied in many cases.  I will have the question of toxicity examined as requested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for its positive contributions. We are elected by the people to ensure we fashion laws which suit modern Ireland.  We have a tremendously committed Legislature.  Seanad Éireann is a gem when it comes to creating the necessary legislation, be it primary or secondary supporting legislation.  The Seanad has today created an opportunity to have a focused debate <Col N="526" /> on a major important component of economic and commercial development in the life of this country.  I ask for the full co-operation of all elected Members of the Oireachtas so that we can collectively, through our communications systems, collaboration and interaction with small and medium-sized enterprises, put across the message that this is a serious and complex problem of international proportions which needs to be tackled immediately.  To do this, each company needs to assess the systems it has, have them evaluated, consult with the professionals, take the necessary remedial action and make the commensurate investments necessary to ensure computer systems in all businesses comply with the year 2000.  This must be done so that Ireland can continue to grow in a harmonious way and produce the economic growth vital for continued expansion and higher living standards as we move from this millennium to the next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  On the 100th anniversary of the setting up of the local government system it is appropriate that we should examine its strengths and weaknesses.  It can be said without any doubt that the local government system and those who served in it have served this country well.  With the abolition of rates in 1977, local government somewhat lost its way and what we now call the democratic deficit set in.  Unfortunately, from that date on local authorities became more dependent on central government for funding.  I am pleased to note that with the introduction of the Local Government Bill, 1998, the Minister is endeavouring to give back to local authorities some measure of independence through financial measures.  I accept the Minister has made strenuous efforts to consult with local authority members but as changes are being made to a system which has been in operation for over 100 years, there is room for ongoing consultation which is the purpose of this motion.</P>
      <P>As a member of the premier local authority for the past 20 years I welcome the new changes now proposed.  The local authority system in which I and my colleagues in the House have served for the past 20 years and more is becoming tired and is in need of being revamped.  In the revamping of local government I welcome the establishment of the SPCs.  Some councillors have reservations about these new committees but we should remember the council will remain the primary unit of local democracy and will retain final decision making responsibility.  The SPCs, therefore, should not be considered as a threat but rather as an opportunity to reform the role of the elected member.</P>
      <P>The new system will motivate elected members to become facilitators for dialogue, positive development and community action at local level. Clearly, this is a dramatic change in the role of the councillor.  There will also be a need to concentrate on the development of a strategic focus for the function of local government and, more importantly, the creation of a process of partnership which will facilitate the implementation of strategic planning at local level.</P>
      <P>The creation of the SPCs and the successful implementation will give back to local authorities their rightful role in society.  For the first time since the foundation of the State, there will be a framework which will recognise the importance of local government and there will be a responsibility on it to establish long-term strategic partnerships at local and regional levels.  Personnel in local government at local and regional levels will have to genuinely appreciate the need for and the role of the local councillor.</P>
      <P>The motion criticises the Government for its failure to consult with interested parties on the restructuring and financing of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> In fairness to the Minister, I attended a number of conferences at which he has consulted widely with local authority members.  There is one aspect of the Local Government Bill, 1998 &mdash; I do not want to make a Second Stage speech on it &mdash; to which I wish to refer.  Under the proposals of the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, I understand 85 per cent of the motor taxation fund was being retained by the local authority and 25 per cent was going into an equalisation fund.  The Minister proposes that the taxation receipts will go back to central government and that he will divide it out through the local government system.  There is a doubt about the mechanism used to give this money back to the local authorities and perhaps the Minister might clarify it.  That is a concern which has caused the tabling of this motion.</P>
    <P>There is another issue which I find difficult to accept.  If, as I wholeheartedly accept, the Minister genuinely intends to give more powers back to local authorities, I find the capping of rates difficult to understand.  If a local authority is responsible in the way it spends its money, there should be no capping of rates because that is its sole income.  That is important for a city like Dublin. We are entering an interesting time for local government and its restructuring will give a new role to the elected member.  For that reason, I welcome the measures the Minister is taking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly pleased the Minister is present because he served as a member of a local authority for many years and is aware of the trials and tribulations endured by members of local government bodies.  The people are well served by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, because they are capable and know what local government involves.  The motion is unfair because it states that the Minister has not consulted widely.  In the short time since his appointment, the Minister has consulted the General Council of County Councils and LAMA and he has also visited most local authorities.  In fairness to the Minister, he should be commended for the level of consultation that has taken place.</P>
      <P>The debate involves local government and the reform of the local government system but little recognition has been given to county councillors. Many Members are also county councillors.  I have been a member of a local authority for a considerable number of years and I know many local authority members throughout the country, some of whom are members of political parties and others are independent.  I am not aware of any dishonest or corrupt local authority members. People in the media discuss the elected members of local government but the Minister appreciates their honesty and integrity.  It is right that Senators elected by local authority members should pay tribute to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authority members, whether they are county councillors, urban councillors, town commissioners or corporation members, are people <Col N="529" /> with common sense.  They are honest and they work hard on a voluntary basis.  It is unfair that allegations are made against people who serve voluntarily and to the best of their ability. They may make mistakes but they are never dishonest.</P>
    <P>The functions of a local authority are to provide housing and to maintain roads but its primary role relates to planning and development. Local authorities and their members serve the people well in that regard.  By and large, there is partnership between the executive and the members.  However, the number of superstores round the country is increasing.  Such developments are considered a failure in Europe and Britain and hostile to town and city centres. There is a need for new legislation to control the development of such stores.  The planning legislation is no longer sufficient to deal with the number of applications from multinationals for such centres.  There are social and planning reasons for stopping the development of superstores which spoil the centres of villages, towns and cities.  I urge the Minister to take this matter on board.</P>
    <P>I was elected to the Seanad by county councillors and I have served as a member of a local authority for many years.  The Minister also served on a local authority and it is time local government members received proper remuneration and compensation for their time.  It is not right that elected members should be required by local authorities to attend meetings without proper recompense.  The Minister has initiated a review but it should go further.  Members may leave local authorities in three ways.  He or she may die or may be defeated at an election and a member may also decide that he or she has served long enough.  Something should be done for people in those circumstances.  It is time to reestablish the county enterprise boards and the regional authorities under the umbrella of local government.  The review that is under way should also examine this area.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the financing of local government.  The Minister of State stated that to address the weaknesses in the current financing arrangements, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government has introduced a Bill in the Dáil to provide the legislative basis for a new funding system.  He also stated that the key elements are the establishment of a statutory local government fund with effect from 1999 and the financing of non-national road improvements from national motor taxation receipts.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State went on to say that a sum of £270 million would be provided in the Department's 1999 Vote for the general purpose requirements of local authorities.  It will be ringfenced in legislation and used solely for local government purposes.  This sum will be index linked for future years to take account of the additional expenditure needs of local authorities identified in the KPMG report.  The financing of local government should also take account of new <Col N="530" /> functions and responsibilities placed on local authorities over the years without the necessary resources.  The Minister of State continued that the legislation will contain special measures to ensure that the base line provision in any year can be altered to reflect any changes in the powers, functions and duties of local authorities.  This is designed to ensure that no additional demands will be placed on local authorities without matching funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister intends to complete the review before 1999.  Local authorities provide a small number of services under their own direction and guidance.  Over the years central government has kept too tight a grip on local government.  It is time the Department was required within a strict time limit to carry out an exercise similar to the strategic management initiative to determine what functions should be devolved to local authorities. All Departments should be included, except perhaps the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs.  The other Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs, should be directed to carry out rigorous devolution studies.</P>
    <P>Ireland is exceptional in Europe in that local authorities have no involvement in education or social welfare.  There is no reason various local offices of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs are not joined with local authority offices and managed by local authorities. Local policing must be seriously considered.  Over the years traffic, litter and animal wardens have been appointed.  There should be one local police force to deal with these areas.  This would allow the Garda Síochána to concentrate on major crime.  This is the position in most European countries.</P>
    <P>I want a local government system where local authorities which represent local communities are in a position to direct the affairs of the community in the name of citizens.  Local authorities are representative.  As local bodies the local government elections should be held at regular intervals and not postponed except in major emergencies.  The worldwide declaration of local self-government includes the following:</P>
    <P>Local self-government denotes the right and duty of local authorities to regulate and manage public affairs under their own responsibilities and in the interest of the local population.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, in the 21st century Ireland can look forward to that ideal becoming a reality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking the tenor of Senator Doyle's remark, it is obvious nobody has a stick to beat the Minister.  However, I am beginning to worry because, instead of coming to bury Caesar, we are coming to praise him.  The Minister will have to be a little interred nevertheless, because the motion refers to wider consultation.  If we are truthful, one can never consult enough because someone always has a better way.  I am a native <Col N="531" /> Dubliner who is practical with regard to the application of local government and developing my role as a councillor.  I am interested in realistic funding mechanisms for local authorities.</P>
      <P>Given the major population spread in the greater Dublin area, will the Minister consider returning to the Kenny report in terms of the windfall gain received by people whose land was rezoned by a local authority?  I accept one can be helped by an act of God or by finding a gold mine or discovering oil on one's land.  It is highly unlikely but when one's land value is enhanced by the direct action of another body for the good of the people, it would be of greater assistance to a local authority if the 40 per cent capital gains tax was collected by it since it made the decision to rezone the land.  It is a valid argument, particularly in areas of urban deprivation where the money could be used for realistic local government reform.</P>
      <P>Senator Callanan referred to local policing, etc., but I wish to deal with school attendance officers.  There should be funding for them and the Minister would do young people a great service if he allowed such funding.  Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council have such a scheme, but the outer suburbs of Dublin do not, for example, Blanchardstown, Swords, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  It is a realistic goal and it would be proper to give funding from the Exchequer to local authorities and provide a simple, positive mechanism of distribution.</P>
      <P>I wish to put on record the Minister's almost total availability to local authority members.  We are coming from the same viewpoint and I have no doubt if a Fine Gael Minister was holding office, motions would be tabled against him or her in this House also.  However, Members are polite and well behaved.  We are looking for the best and if a negative must be tabled, it does not matter as it is the results that count.  If money was generated through the windfall tax, school attendance and tenant participation schemes could be dealt with and amenities could be enhanced.  I appreciate the Minister will always have mandarins guiding him in many directions, but will he consider as a practical possibility giving a percentage of the funding to local authorities in the larger urban areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A school meals system should be provided by local authorities similar to those provided by every other European local authority.  Regrettably, as a result of drug addiction, alcoholism and the breakdown of parenting, some children do not have an adequate diet and it is incumbent on local authorities to arrange for the provision of same in areas of urban deprivation.  Another potential source of income for local authorities is to increase the levies on those who provide take-away and fast food services because they spend a fortune cleaning up after them.  The service will still be required and financial owners should be <Col N="532" /> compelled to make a contribution to a cleaner environment because litter is killing this city.</P>
    <P>Other forms of consultation might work to everybody's benefit, especially local authorities.  I am disappointed at the recent newspaper satisfaction rating of 17 per cent for politicians. Measures such as those I suggested, which would channel funds into local authorities might help to change that perception.  My feelings on the erosion of power to local councillors are known.  We deserve much better and I support the argument as I do not want to have to die in order to receive a pension.  A long-term service payment should be awarded based on the fact that service was given, not whether one failed to be re-elected or opted not to run.  If the Minister was a member of my party I would have every confidence in him, but I have a great deal of confidence on him anyway.  He is hearing the voices of experience in this debate as they put forward possible proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and welcome him to the House.  He knows what consultation is about and has left no stone unturned in his dealings with the General Council of County Councils or councillors.  Whenever I ring him or officials from his Department, I receive constructive answers to my concerns.</P>
      <P>The debate deals with the reform of local government as we head towards the 21st century. The Minister is taking on a real challenge.  His proposal constitutes a radical reform of funding for local authorities, availability of human resources, consultation, customer effectiveness and value for money.  Each of these areas presents a challenge to the Minister, local authorities, local councillors and county managers to give a better service to our constituencies and ward areas in the 21st century.</P>
      <P>I welcome the shift of power from the centre. In the past councillors had very little power and simply did what the managers said.  In my own area of South Dublin within the last few weeks I became aware that in Rathfarnham Castle there was to be a hotel and bar.  This was to happen without consultation with the local people or councillors because decisions were taken at the centre.  We were, fortunately, not too late to tackle the problem.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government and Dúchas were aware of the development.  Power must rest with the local people.  The Minister must aim for consultation, consultation, consultation.  I congratulate the Minister on his awareness of the importance of consultation with local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a very educated public. They know before local politicians what is happening in each area.  I welcome the new strategic policy groups.  I am concerned that the right people will be appointed to the various positions on these groups.  What criteria will be used to assess the suitability of those who will represent us in the areas of planning, community or parks? I discussed this matter with the county manager <Col N="533" /> and found that he too, with others, was concerned about this.  I hope the right people will be appointed and that they will not have a different agenda from the overall vision for the future of our areas.</P>
    <P>South Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown are new councils and are closely involved with each other.  My own area, in South Dublin, is close to the border with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  Actions taken by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown frequently impact on my area but I get very little satisfaction when I consult officials on these matters.  They frequently quote the section of the Local Government Act and point out to me that the problem is the responsibility of the neighbouring council.  I would like to see a better process of consultation between adjoining councils so that councillors in boundary areas can be consulted on matters which are the responsibility of one council but which impact on another.  These problems constitute part of the teething problems which arise when new council areas are established.</P>
    <P>I welcome the placing of funding on a statutory basis and the allocation of revenue from motor taxation to local authorities for the road infrastructure. Residents of areas such as Knocklyon and Firhouse often spend an hour and a half on journeys which should take five minutes.  I hope we will now have sufficient resources to provide a broad package of local government service. Senator Ridge mentioned the problem of litter. We have established a litter unit in South Dublin but we do not have the resources, either financial or human, to do what is required.  Reform depends on adequate funding and human resources.  We must also get value for money. Every aspect of local government reform must be examined with a view to making it more efficient and cost effective.  The people are crying out for local government reform.  We are held in low esteem by the public because we do not seem to be able to get the jobs done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the plan for the remuneration of councillors.  We have all found ourselves short of money at the end of the year.  I have, however, some reservation about this measure.  Those councillors who, having given 20 or 25 years service, stand for election at the next local government elections and do not get elected should be rewarded for their service in some way.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on this initiative and I hope he will give some consideration to my few reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most fundamental change in this package of local government reform is the retention of road tax fund revenue by local authorities. This development will be a major boost to many local authorities.  However, I would like the Minister to address an anomaly in the measure which applies, in particular, to rural counties.  I am speaking especially of Mayo where we have many semi-State companies, such as the ESB and Telecom Éireann as well as the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> These bodies have their headquarters in Dublin where most of their vehicles are registered. Under the new system these agencies will be using Mayo roads but paying their tax to Dublin Corporation.  I know that they do not need any money in Dublin because they are planning to give £114 million away.  I hope the Minister will address this anomaly.  In the past the tax on Garda vehicles would have been paid by one arm of the State to another but in the future this tax will be paid by the State to the local authority.  I have not seen this issue raised and it is an important one, especially for rural counties.</P>
    <P>Semi-State vehicles are taxed in a similar fashion in other counties but we in Mayo want to get every penny available from the road tax fund. There is an equalisation system but it works on a percentage basis and we would lose heavily if semi-State bodies continued to tax their vehicles at a central location like Dublin.</P>
    <P>That is a major and fundamental local authority reform.  We have been talking about such reform for ten years but much of what has happened has been cosmetic and we need more radical measures such as the Minister's proposed funding changes.</P>
    <P>When I joined the local authority in 1985 I heard about powers for local councillors but we do not have much power even today.  With the SPCs coming on stream there is a feeling that things are changing.  In my county there are many misgivings about the new committees.  In the experience of many councillors, including myself, there is a chasm between the thinking of community workers and of those elected to local authorities; they are two different cultures.  We often try to bridge that chasm but are not always successful because many community workers &mdash; who will be the type of people to join SPCs &mdash; are not aware of the different functions of local authorities.  They might not even understand the difference between reserve functions and executive powers.  This will cause problems on the SPCs.  From dealing with community workers down the years I know that this difference in thinking exists.  Perhaps it will be overcome after a period but it could be a significant problem in the short term.  The non-elected people who join SPCs may feel the influence they exert is not what they think it should be.  The SPCs are a pioneering experiment in local democracy and like all such efforts they are fraught with dangers. We can only hope problems like those I have outlined will not come to pass.</P>
    <P>Many Senators mentioned the continually increasing workload of county councillors which arises through the development and expansion of local authorities.  This workload must be carried by people who do not receive anything like the correct remuneration.  For instance, many members of county enterprise boards leave in the morning, drive 50 miles to a meeting, come home in the evening, all for no return.  That is not local government, it is philanthropy.  I ask the Minister to bring the county enterprise boards under the <Col N="535" /> aegis of local authorities so that board members would get recognition for their work and input.</P>
    <P>I welcome the other minor changes.  For instance, local authorities will give up their antiquated accounting systems and adopt accrual accounting.  At every annual estimates meeting I have a heated debate with our finance officer about local authority accounting systems which do not reflect the true position &mdash; they do not deal with creditors, debtors or assets.  The Minister is to be commended for introducing accrual accounting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his overall approach to local government.  He has not forgotten what it is like to be a county councillor and the frustrations they experience.  As a councillor myself I am only too aware how thankless it is to be a local authority member.  We attend meetings night after night and mostly only get abuse in return &mdash; we certainly do not receive expenses.  The abuse is mostly as a result of trying to reconcile different positions.  However, we volunteer for it and most of those who volunteer for county council positions do a good job.  I am glad the Minister is examining the area, including remuneration.</P>
      <P>He has provided £125 million extra in funding compared to when he came into office, which is a substantial amount.  I am glad this money will not be siphoned off for emergencies in other areas but will be left with local government &mdash;&ldquo;ring fencing&rdquo; is the current way to describe this process.  Best of all, this money will increase in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>Many Senators mentioned the strategic policy committees or SPCs, through which councillors will have a deep and meaningful involvement with different sectors of the community and a direct input into policy development.  This is extremely important.  I welcome the availability of the Minister in this regard and commend his willingness to consult.  Councillors have been asked for their views on a wide range of issues and he has shown a capacity to listen which, to put it delicately, was not always there.  I praise him for agreeing to meet members of local councils and municipal authorities through the General Council of County Councils, or GCCC, and the Local Authority Members' Association, or LAMA.  Not so long ago Ministers would not even acknowledge LAMA's existence, let alone meet it.  These are important bodies which represent the views of councillors and corporation members &mdash; literally hundreds of people &mdash; who do many civic duties for little reward.  I commend the Minister for meeting them and listening to what they have to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many ways people have a peculiar idea of councillors.  They think we do nothing but go on junkets or such like.  In the only junket of which I was part we spent an entire Saturday looking at waste management plants in London and Bath.  I can think of better ways to spend my Saturdays <Col N="536" /> than to be looking at rubbish.  The local authority to which I belong, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, has a huge waste management problem, as has the city of Dublin.  It must be tackled by landfills, incineration or whatever.  It is important that councillors look at these aspects.  I recently heard Councillor Courtney of Kerry County Council defending the decision by his councillors to look at waste management strategies abroad.  Trips like this are essential because we must see how these things work.  People will have to be much more careful about how they dispose of their rubbish. For example, they will have to store it in different stockpiles and so on.</P>
    <P>I am not keen on the Minister's undertaking to look at the possibility of expenses for councillors. We should have a salary which could, for example, be related to the number of meetings we attend.  We spend a large amount of time at council meetings.  It is very difficult to get business done.  Senator Ormonde referred to the trials and tribulations involved in meeting the public night after night and explaining that money is not available for various projects.  When many councillors resign or retire they have little recompense for their years of labour.  I am, therefore, glad to see the Minister has moved in this direction in offering an incentive to some of the older councillors. I would not put myself in that bracket yet but perhaps the Minister will keep the package in place for when it comes to my turn.</P>
    <P>I know most of the councillors around the country.  They work very hard and are very committed. Yet, they receive little or nothing.  The glory is negligible and the abuse is huge at times, especially with regard to some of the issues which we must tackle in Dublin.</P>
    <P>We have shown the potential among ourselves to co-operate.  Three of the four authorities in Dublin have co-operated on taxis, a very important issue which has been continually shelved.  We also co-operate on many other issues.  We have huge problems with halting sites, another area which the Minister is tackling, and with the provision of accommodation for travellers. It is an issue on which we must move.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to listen to councillors' concerns.  I also welcome his commitment to improve the lot of councillors and his major commitment to restructure local government.  It will be for the best.  I congratulate him and wish him the best in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing an excellent job.  I know he pays special attention to his adjoining County Louth.  We look forward to more funding.</P>
      <P>I am an urban councillor since 1974 and a county councillor since 1979.  Much of my time has been spent willingly and happily working for people in my community.  However, local government is failing in many respects; often it is a political failure.  For example, it is failing to look after disadvantaged people in large urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must look again at the way we build and <Col N="537" /> plan our housing estates and in the facilities we do or do not provide for them.  This may not be a problem in rural areas.  However, in urban areas &mdash; for example, Drogheda and Dundalk &mdash; successive Governments have failed to invest adequately in community facilities.  There is no investment in community buildings, youth clubs and youth activities.  Money is spent on priorities, such as housing.  While that is to be welcomed, it leaves communities denuded of community facilities. In consequence, many of the housing estates in the larger urban areas are riddled with drugs, unemployment and crime.  Communities must play a much more active and supportive role for people living there.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative by the Department in looking after housing associations.  However, it is not enough.  Young people growing up in large areas of unemployment are without support apart from the local community facilities they build themselves.  Not enough money is being invested in them and a blind eye is being turned to the problems in these communities.  Our young people especially deserve much more than this.  It is time to invest in the future of local government, to set a limit to the number of houses we will build in any one estate and to invest in community facilities.</P>
    <P>Investment in the SPCs is part of the change. It represents positive progress because it involves the community again in the running of local government affairs.  They have much potential.</P>
    <P>However, local government has been by-passed by other bodies, perhaps because people consider it to be inefficient and to be failing to get necessary funding.  In this regard, I am especially concerned about the development of our partnerships. They are excellent bodies and have millions of pounds to invest in many of our urban and rural areas.  However, local government elected members are excluded from these activities.  It is a disgrace that not one elected politician can sit on a partnership board and participate in the expenditure of money which deals specifically with their areas of responsibility.  It is time to end this discrimination.</P>
    <P>While we can become members of county enterprise boards we are debarred from becoming chairmen.  It is a ridiculous slur that anybody should be singled out as being unworthy to hold the chairmanship of such a body.  That must change.</P>
    <P>The issue of landfill management and waste disposal is very costly.  I spoke recently to a member of the German Parliament, the Bundestag. He told me that in his area of Munster people have reduced the cost of waste disposal by 75 per cent and that following the active pursuit of progressive policies in their communities and cities, they have a much smaller amount of waste to dispose of than we would have.  It is not enough to have landfill sites.  We need an active recycling policy and a much more aggressive policy to stop the waste of finite resources in our community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> The Minister has an important role in that regard, which I am sure he will address.</P>
    <P>The EPA will increasingly impinge on our communities in defending the environment.  This will be very expensive.  Perhaps there is a further role for the EPA in holding seminars for elected members and helping them get to grips with the question of waste management.</P>
    <P>The role and powers of elected members as opposed to the reserve functions of the manager and his officials is very important. There has been a sea change in the bureaucracy in the last 20 years which I welcome.  It is much more of a partnership than it used to be but there is still not equity in that relationship.  The Minister himself proposed the direct election of chairmen of borough councils.  It is important that we redress the balance within decision making in local government to full-time public representatives who are paid for the work which they do.  We have much to offer but as part-time councillors we cannot give the commitment it needs.  Managers generally would welcome much more involvement in decision making.  More power should be given to elected representatives within that area. Obviously there are matters which should remain functions of the manager but many decisions are taken without proper consultation because of time limits.</P>
    <P>Health boards have been advised that they must establish finance committees.  As elected members we need a more hands on approach to our roles in the county councils.  We ought to have financial subcommittee meetings regularly to go through all of the issues which affect our community.  All this would come together with paying councillors and public representatives for the job they have to do.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to seriously consider the remuneration of public representatives so we have a much more inclusive local democracy.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about another area of local government which needs reform.  In my own county, Louth, there are two large urban areas with an urban district council and a borough council.  The power for decision making lies with the county council and yet the county council is not real to the people of Drogheda and Dundalk. I am elected to the county council, yet no member of my electorate lives in a rural area.  It would be a good idea for reform of local government to install councils in areas of greatest population concentration.  That would transcend county boundaries; but towns like Drogheda, a growth centre for east Meath, north County Dublin and south Louth, should have the decisions which affect those areas under the control of one council. It is ridiculous that the pollution of the River Boyne is a matter for Meath and Louth County Councils, and Drogheda Corporation, within their respective areas.</P>
    <P>We need a more modern and dynamic form of local government for towns such as Drogheda and Dundalk.  The balance of people and <Col N="539" /> resources is moving into urban population areas and that is where decisions should be made and where the power base for administrative decisions must be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister. Nobody can doubt his commitment to local government, its expansion and the expansion of the powers of the councillors.  He himself has suffered in the ranks of county councillors over the years and watched how any good ideas or opinions which he had were deemed irrelevant because under the present statutes, the opinions, desires and needs of county managers are paramount, working with the civil servants in the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day the county councillors take the heat of battle.  They are blamed for decisions over which they have no power.  If only for equity, more power should go back to the county councils.  Dublin City Council disposes of £250 million per year.  This is a major enterprise by any standard.  There is a lack of answerability to the people who elect us because we do not have the power to dispose of that money as we see fit.  Before it arrives in the coffers of Dublin Corporation, 90 per cent is already spoken for due to commitments made in previous years to large scale building, drainage and water schemes, salaries and payment of county council officials. The county council receives 10 per cent of the budget.</P>
      <P>In Dublin Corporation one source of pride is the parks and gardens.  The way a good park can raise the morale of the people living in an area is incredible, yet we are working with less than £1 million per year.  The way the park rangers and superintendents can make this money work for the betterment of the community is amazing.</P>
      <P>Chairmen of county councils and lords mayor should have executive powers.  They should be elected on a full-time basis, either from the body of the county councillors or directly.  I have not decided which would be the correct method but this must happen because the nature of government at any level is becoming so demanding.  It will require a greater input by the county councillors into the working of the councils.  Part-time councillors will soon be on the way out; the nature of the job demands more and more of their time.</P>
      <P>That raises issues such as the payment and terms of office.  The Minister himself is thinking along these lines, how far we can go, how far political and financial reality will let us go, but these problems must be addressed.</P>
      <P>We are undertaking a review of the functions of the health boards in this State.  Having been employed by, and a member of, a health board, I feel the two areas in which the health boards work well are general hospital care and special hospital care.  It falls down in community care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community care is treated like the other two <Col N="540" /> areas in the health board, but the effect of a community welfare officer is felt on the ground and there is no overseeing of his actions by county councillors.  There is no county councillor on the Eastern Health Board for the areas which I represent &mdash; north inner city, Cabra, Finglas &mdash; areas of high need and deprivation.  Dublin 7 has the highest number of institutions in the city.  The community welfare officer has great discretion under section 24 of the Social Welfare Act to dispense money for rent, clothing and housing allowances. In the Dublin area the Eastern Health Board is probably a bigger housing agency than the local authorities yet the actions of those involved is not overseen.  I do not suggest their actions are malign.  However, county councillors are in a better position to see the effects of the actions of people who are not accountable and over whom they have no control.  The Minister may be able to raise this matter with the Government in the course of considerations of the interaction between local authorities and health boards, especially with regard to community care.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to having strong active local authorities and to this end special policy committees are to be introduced.  These committees will have some unelected members.  I was against the idea initially because I felt that those not elected by direct franchise would not be accountable for their actions.  There are unelected members of health boards and they do not have to take the heat, so to speak, for policy decisions they make.  This issue has been brewing for some time.  The local area committees will have a more important effect on the work of local authorities because they will allow local issues to be addressed locally.  Councillors will then be able to deal with policy issues at their monthly meetings.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that a public representative is statute barred from chairing an enterprise board. I praise the work of the enterprise boards.  They are the Society of St. Vincent de Paul of lending institutions because they will lend money to those to whom financial institutions will not.  I pay tribute to the excellent work of the enterprise board in my constituency which is creating jobs at a cost of about £2,000 per job which compares very favourably with IDA job costs.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address the accounting practices of county councils.  Their practices remind me of the glass used in bathroom windows which lets in light but conceals what is going on. County councils are accountable for every penny spent but one cannot always see how the money is spent.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the debate.  A debate on local authorities and the devolution of power cannot but be <Col N="541" /> founded in the concept that the democratic role of elected members is of paramount importance. The public and members of local authorities feel that democratic power has been taken away from them over the past few years.  The role of county managers and engineers seems to have become more important and what they say goes.  That is not good for local democracy or the public who elect the local authority members.  We must consider giving local authority members more say in local areas.</P>
      <P>The introduction of SPCs is a step in the right direction.  It is good to involve the public and to get advice and input in decision making on roads, housing or other issues.  The committees will be of help to the elected members.  However, I am concerned about the role of some bodies.  In my county we are in the process of setting up the SPCs.  Many bodies have applied which are not representative of the views of the public but they have vested interests and I am concerned that some of those bodies will be included in the process. That would not be good for local democracy and, I am sure, is not in tune with the Minister's ideas in setting up the SPCs.  I would like the Minister to address this issue.</P>
      <P>We must consider the future direction of local authorities.  There is scope to devolve more power to them, in particular with regard to industrial promotions.  There are many areas in which local councils should be involved which are handled at present by State agencies.  The more rural counties in the west and south would benefit from the involvement of local authorities with industrial development and tourism.  There is great potential for the devolution of power to local authorities.</P>
      <P>Senators have spoken about the remuneration of councillors.  We live in an age in which people are paid for what they do and councillors should not be an exception.  A proper financial structure should be put in place.  The supervisors of FÁS schemes have mobile &rsquo;phones.  However, a councillor must use his or her own &rsquo;phone and their &rsquo;phone bills are very high.  That is a cost to the individual.  Councillors must be paid for their efforts.</P>

      <P>Local government reform has occupied the minds of councillors for a considerable time.  There were three or four years in succession in the recent past when papers on reform were presented at every conference.  The only possible way to achieve meaningful reform is for the parties to plan reform collectively.  The only way to devolve real power is by giving power to local authorities to raise finance, which might be considered in the context of the reform of the tax system.  Part of the amendment relates to the practical commitment to the policy of equalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, outlined the structures and accounting systems he envisaged in the document <i>Better Local Government.</i>  There were then two <Col N="542" /> items in equalisation: the rate support grant and motor tax receipts in lieu of the abolition of water and sewerage charges.</P>
    <P>Under the Local Government Bill, 1998, new funding will replace arrangements introduced by the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, and the proposed local government fund will come from two sources.  I have a figure of £320 million, which appears to be the motor tax proceeds, and there will be a top-up from the Exchequer of £270 million in 1999.  That will include lorries and drivers' licences fees, which is separate from private car tax.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer grant will be increased in line with the consumer price index, giving a total of £590 million.  This amendment refers to £125 million. Between the initial 1997 allocation and the expected 1998 outturn, how much of the £125 million is already in the system?  I am a member of Limerick County Council, and £35 million was our estimate for 1997.  Our outturn was £40 million. Is the £5 million difference part of the £125 million already in the system?  Our road grants were thankfully higher than in 1997, and how much of those increases were already in the system? We got the grant increases after the initial allocation.  I am a little concerned as to what the new system will replace.  What is being abolished to be replaced by the motor tax/local government fund?</P>
    <P>Will councils be given funding for new functions? How are strategic policy committees to be paid?  Will it come out of the £125 million?  In relation to the submission of the Local Authority Members Association, the Minister will be aware of the request for a £5,700 annual salary and the £570 pension fund for each year of service. Members have given 30 or 40 years' tremendous service and may want to stand for election again. Those who have given their time to local government should be recompensed and it would be unfair if they did not get that funding.</P>
    <P>Regarding banding, Limerick County Council meets 80 or 90 times a year.  We do not talk all the time because the 28 members have other matters to occupy their time.  However, we need those meetings because local authorities have become extremely complex and it is essential to have an extra ten meetings in the 50 band.  I am sure those in the 40 band would need the same.</P>
    <P>Every local authority has a waste management problem and Limerick's Slieve Felim landfill site is particularly controversial.  It is creating tremendous angst among people.  The criteria usually used for landfills relate to how near the site is to a major centre of population, but the opposite is the case with Slieve Felim.  It is far from population but is in an area of scenic beauty.  It is proposed to locate the landfill at a height of 1,000 feet, which seems daft, and the roads can barely take the existing traffic.  The Minister should get EU funds for reduction; I have returned from Germany, where they have had reduction with a population of 81 million.  I cannot see why we cannot get people to use paper bags when at the <Col N="543" /> supermarket.  Composting, which I heard discussed on the radio today, should also be examined. Limerick County Council is anxious to hear more about the new energy source in the pipeline for us, and the council would like that waste energy project, which would be financed by the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his work.  He has lived up to his word and visited almost every local authority, which no other Minister has done since I became a councillor.  He listened attentively to councillors, but I have always found him to be a councillors' man.  I am sure that every councillor, no matter what their political persuasion, would compliment him on his work.  He has plans for improving the structures of local authorities, which is important to all members.</P>
      <P>I have been involved with local authorities for many years, and chaired the General Council of County Councils for a period.  I know the problems facing local authorities and the changes being made now will help with those problems.  I thank the Minister for providing that motor tax collected by local authorities will be returned to them in order to be spent on the roads.  However, a fund should be set up in the Department of the Environment and Local Goverment for storm damage to roads.  Last winter storms did enormous damage to the roads in my part of Kerry and the amount of money sent from Dublin to repair the roads was inadequate.</P>
      <P>People are critical of councillors and their work, but I have said on local radio that pensioners now get as much money as councillors.  A councillor's allowances amount to approximately £10 a day.  A person cannot be expected to do the work of a public servant for that amount and the Minister should examine this situation.</P>
      <P>The strategic policy committees have been mentioned by speakers and I am delighted they have been set up.  They will probably have internal elections, although this is not very clear. I hope democracy prevails.  The county enterprise boards have also been mentioned and I compliment these bodies on their tremendous work, particularly in rural areas, in creating jobs. However, the Minister should examine the work of other organisations.  The work done by the Leader programme and organisations such as FÁS should be brought under the umbrella of the county enterprise board, which would reduce the duplication of administrative work.  The county enterprise board would be a far more credible organisation to implement the various programmes in the county.  A great deal of money is being wasted on administration.  Everyone knows what work needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applicants who first approach the county enterprise board are often told to approach another organisation, such as the Shannon development company.  The entire process takes several months.  It would be far better if industrialists <Col N="544" /> or people who wish to set up a business could go to a one stop shop.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of providing such a one stop facility in the local authority system?</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the amount of money he has allocated to local authorities this year for the road network, particularly the money provided for the restructuring of roads, which is the way forward.  Most of the roads in my county will be restored as part of the five year plan we have put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>We have plenty of reasons. However, in addition to restoration, the Minister will have to provide extra funding for the maintenance of roads which are not part of the five year plan.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the provision of extra funding for roads, housing, sewage treatment plants, refuse services and landfill sites.  If we are to have clear waters and a clean environment, funding must be provided for new sewage treatment plants and so on.  I compliment the Minister on taking that course of action.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister re-examine the retirement pension plan for councillors?  Long serving councillors who lose their seats should be rewarded for their services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The interest shown by Members in this debate indicates our concern about how local government has been neglected over many years by successive Governments.  I appeal to the Minister not to forget from where he came.  I have seen solicitors and barristers appointed to the bench who suddenly forgot they had been appearing before the bench the week before.  The Minister had a successful local authority career before he attained greater heights and I ask him not to forget the ordinary five-eighths of councillors.</P>
      <P>Most Senators were councillors before they became Members of the Oireachtas.  We know about the various tasks faced by councillors and the time constraints and lack of general facilities under which they work.  We also know about getting calls at all hours of the night.  Reference was made during the debate to executive decisions.  It should be remembered that while the manager makes the executive decisions, the councillors receive the calls about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time to review all aspects of local authorities &mdash; how they can be made seem more relevant, how they can be better funded and how they can be made more amenable to the public. None of us could underestimate the work done by many councillors and the many helpful officials.  We are often the intermediary between the public and the officials in trying to iron out problems.  Most of these problems are non political and concern matters such as traffic calming measures, drainage, housing problems, etc.  Such <Col N="545" /> problems do not change, regardless of who is in Government or which side has the majority on the council, and we try to sort them out on a council or ward basis, which is how it should be.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give realistic recognition to the role of councillors in the future.  Will he clarify the position in regard to certain murmurings about the dual mandate for councillors and Deputies or Senators?  In an ideal world we could say members have enough do to in trying to serve one body.  For example, all parties thought it was expedient to run Deputies for European Parliament seats but such Members spent most of their time in Europe and very little time in the Dáil. The Minister should tread cautiously in regard to any mooted changes because Deputies and Senators are viewed differently.  Also, when Deputies are appointed as Ministers they must resign from their local authority seat but if they lose their Dáil seat they must then start again in the local authority.  It is important to address these questions.  If the Minister announces draconian measures overnight he will face a great deal of opposition &mdash; and not just from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Councillors should receive proper remuneration and long service should be recognised. Councillors with, for example, 18 years service should receive the same recognition, regardless of whether they retired or lost their seat.  There should also be some weighting between 18 years and 36 years service.  I ask the Minister to respond positively to these points.</P>

      <P>I apologise to Senators for not being able to attend this debate last week as I was away.  I was disappointed when I saw the wording of the motion but I am more heartened by the comments today and the reports of the comments made last week, even by those from the party which tabled the motion.  Most Senators stated that the reason for the motion was to arrange a debate on local government reform and they have succeeded in doing so. However, if they had asked me they would not have needed to table a negative motion as I would have been more than happy to come into the House to discuss this issue.  I issued an invitation to the joint committee to discuss this matter and to take into account and bring forward whatever ideas it had on any policy change I wished to make.  I accept the reasoning for the motion and I welcome this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office I have gone out of my way to consult and to listen to the views of Members of both Houses, local authority members and others and I will continue to do so even after the major new Bill on local government reform is introduced before the end of the year.  I have heard and taken note of a variety of different issues mentioned, many of which will or are already covered in the Bill.  I reiterate that I am not one who does not consult.  My door is open and if the House wishes to put forward ideas and <Col N="546" /> proposals on local government reform I will listen to those views.</P>
    <P>There has been an enormous amount of consultation on local government reform over the past 20 years.  As experienced members of local authorities, general councils, LAMA, etc., Senators would be the first to admit that there are stacks of paper resulting from consultations over the past 20 years.  We have had conferences, White Papers, Green Papers, excellent papers drafted by the representative organisations, expert reports and so on.  We have consulted to death on this issue.  While I have no difficulty with ongoing consultation, I am not going to allow that to become an excuse for doing nothing.  That is why I am pressing ahead with local government reform, talking to people and asking for views.</P>
    <P>Last week, the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, outlined the different measures I have taken since coming into office to try to ensure that as many people as possible were listened to.  If Senators or councillors have good ideas or views they should bring them forward.  They should not wait until the Bill is published or passed; they should bring them forward now and I will take them into consideration and try, as far as possible, to put them in place.</P>
    <P>I have a strong belief in local government and the necessity to reform the system.  My views and some of the changes I wish to introduce will not find favour with all Members or councillors but that is democracy.  We are all entitled to different views and I am open to changing my mind on different aspects of my proposals.  In fairness to myself and the local government system we need the ideas to be brought forward and not to wait until after the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>The local government fund was referred to by a number of Senators.  Despite my best efforts I still seem to be failing in communication in this area.  The local government fund will comprise motor tax receipts and £270 million Exchequer funding from 1 January.  Senator Caffrey raised the issue of semi-State companies being based and taxing their cars in Dublin.  It makes no difference where a car is taxed.  The only issue for the local government fund is the total tax take. That total figure goes into the fund to be distributed to the local authorities.  I wish to explain what will happen then.  The previous Government proposed that 85 per cent of the tax on cars raised in a local authority area would remain with that authority and that the remainder would go into the central fund.  The fund is a local government fund.  It cannot be used on anything other than the local government system.  It is not a question of the money going into the Exchequer and local government having to go cap in hand.  The money will be there to be spent by local government.</P>
    <P>There was no formula in place for distributing the fund.  A council was to be established to advise and distribute the money.  I do not mind advice but I am reluctant to set up any more quangos and the Bill reflects this.  In the initial stages a quango will not decide what local authorities <Col N="547" /> will receive.  What is more important is how the money is distributed.  It will be distributed on the basis of needs and resources.  Senators from Galway particularly will be aware that we are trying to devise a needs and resources study. The corporation, county council and urban councils in Galway, with assistance from the Department, are trying to create a framework and build a model by which we can decide the needs and resources which must be made available for local authorities generally.  It will be an objective measurement.  It will not be a question of the most money going to wherever the Minister happens to be.  There will be a needs and resources study for each local authority and, based on the model being developed, that is how the money will be distributed.  It is based on equalisation, taking into account the individual circumstances of each local authority.  That is a fair way.  There is no magic formula which can be devised which will give an easy way out.  It must be based on something concrete and the areas of needs and resources have been chosen.</P>
    <P>As regards queries about the fund, I have always said that there will be £125 million over and above what was available to local government when I came into office.  Some £43 million of that is built into the 1998 allocation, with £17 million coming from motor tax and £26 million from non-national roads.  Next year there will be just under £80 million over and above the 1998 figure.  That is a sizeable but necessary figure and it is to be hoped it will be used well by local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is important the local authority system gives value for money and we are putting in place audit systems to ensure that.  We are trying to ensure the taxpayer who funds local government receives value for money.  If local authorities give excellent value for money, instead of earmarking funds, more funding will go to them by way of block grant so that they can decide how to spend it.  If there is a priority of roads or housing in any specific year, the locally elected councillors will be able to allocate money to it.  That block grant will go to the efficient and effective councils whereas those which do not meet standards of efficiency and effectiveness and do not give value for money will continue to receive earmarked funds.  I would like to be in a position at the end of my term of office where block grants will be given to every local authority.  While that is Utopian from what I know of the local government system currently, it will nonetheless happen in most cases within the decade because the local authority system is good and efficient and should be able to deliver value for money.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with points raised today and last week.  The system of local government which I hope to have in place next year will be a new one and people will have the opportunity to opt into it or to finish their term of service with the local authority and to have it recognised in the form of a gratuity.  I intend to introduce that system by <Col N="548" /> way of amendment to the Local Government Funding Bill.  I am aware of the depth of feeling of some people about the gratuity, but it will be paid to people retiring from local government service in the manner I have explained and that is the only basis on which it will be paid.  If councillors feel strongly about this, I say to them that it will be paid on that basis or it will not be paid at all.  I do not want councillors under any illusions about that.  That is one decision which is final.</P>
    <P>Remuneration has been mentioned and it is an issue dear to Senators' hearts, because councillors are their electorate and they always represent their electorate well.  When I started out in politics as a local councillor, I viewed it as an honour to be elected to a local authority and regarded that as sufficient recompense, although the expenses were useful in meeting bills.  While I would like to believe that idea of service still exists, I also recognise that there are many demands on people's time and many pressures on them and that that concept no longer exists.  I hope to bring proposals to Government to recognise that fact and to give some basic remuneration to councillors in addition to the existing expenses regime.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to SPCs, development bodies, local development and local government.  Membership of SPCs is a matter for elected council members.  They must decide whether a person is representative of a sector, such as the environment, the socially excluded or the disabled.  It is not a matter for the Minister. Local public representatives should take account of the responsibilities they are given and make choices because some of those will not be easy to make.  Nonetheless, they must make them.</P>
    <P>As regards local development and local government, part of my responsibility as Minister for the Environment and Local Government is to integrate the two systems.  It is not in the interests of democracy or accountability that there be two parallel systems, one which is elected and the other participatory.  However, councillors have much to learn from participatory democracy in the form of local development bodies.  That approach has to be incorporated into the new integrated system and the people mentioned by Senators, such as the socially excluded and the disabled, must be made to feel part of the new local government system and must be catered for in the manner in which they are currently being catered for.</P>
    <P>Local development must accept accountability for the taxpayers' money it spends.  The local government is ready, willing and able, as judged by what I have heard about the SPCs and the local government system getting people involved.  The local government system will have no problem adapting to this and I would like to see a little more willingness on the part of the local development organisations in giving this a try because I have not seen that so far, but I hope to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> Some Members spoke about funding.  Senator Burke looked for more power to raise finances locally and I would like to hear other councillors views on that.  We had a system of financing local authorities locally, but it was abolished.  Following consultation locally, it is my intention, as it was that of the previous Government, that local authorities will have the power to set up a community development fund.  In the context of the review of the planning laws, I intend to try to build into the system a provision so that builders and others making a considerable amount of money will contribute to a community fund to allow for the building of community facilities in particular areas.  I hope I will get the support of the House in that regard.</P>
    <P>Levies on takeaways were mentioned.  Local authorities can levy takeaways under the Litter Pollution Act and should use that power.  One of the greatest problems we have is litter.  As a result of an amendment we tabled to the Act when it passed through the House under the previous Minister, the fines imposed on people for littering are payable to the local authority.  There is no excuse for local authorities not to try to enforce those laws and impose fines.</P>
    <P>I would look more favourably on cries from the heart for funding from local authorities if I thought they were taking their business seriously. Some local authorities and corporations do not charge for refuse collection at a time when the cost of providing these facilities is going through the roof.  It will bankrupt some local authorities if they do not do something about this matter.  The EU is taking a dim view of the fact we do not charge for water and we are fighting the case with it.  It has made the case that if we do not charge for water, we do not need money to provide the infrastructure to provide it.  I would say the same to local authorities which need money but which do not charge for a service like refuse collection even as purely an environmental tax to try to get people to reduce the amount of waste they generate. I would not be amenable to increasing the amounts of money made available to such local authorities.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I do not have more time but perhaps we might repeat this exercise when I have more time because local government reform and a renewed local government system is dear to my heart.  It is a matter of great interest to Members of this Houses, as judged by the number who spoke, and on which we could have a long session. I look forward to returning to the House with the Local Government Funding Bill shortly when I might have the opportunity to address some of the others issues raised.  I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has presented a challenge to members of local authorities.  Most Members are members of local authorities and would understand the language the Minister chose to use.  I could not help but reflect on the fact that 100 years ago, when debates were taking place on the creation of local government, which was at that time a reforming measure taking over from the boards of guardians and the poor law, a challenge was almost certainly presented and there must have been a mission statement of the role and function of local authorities.  The Minister is evolving and when the legislation is presented we will have a definitive mission statement on the future role of local authorities.  What he has outlined so far would indicate that we are about to embark on a new concept of local government, which is to be welcomed by all of us and those in local government, notwithstanding the fact there will be niggling irritations along the way.</P>
      <P>Unquestionably, some councillors are concerned about the gratuity issue.  On the face of it, it looks like a losing battle as far as the Minister is concerned.  However, one of the strongest arguments put to me about the Minister's proposals was that Members of the Dáil and Seanad who lose their seats are entitled to a gratuity or severance pay and why should local authority members not be treated in the same fashion.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but was going to say that on the face of it, it seems we are entering into a new era.  Will the Minister consider a training regime &mdash; for example, seminars, etc. &mdash; for councillors who will assume new broad wide-ranging powers which they have not traditionally had?  Will members of local authorities be given the technological facilities we, as Members of this House, have recently acquired?  We are living in a technological age, an age of IT.  I understand some local authorities are receiving this technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree the role and status of local authorities has diminished to such an extent in the public mind, because of the abolition of rates and the consequence of that coupled with the rise in the participatory development organisation to which the Minister accurately referred, that the education system at local level needs to be appraised of the future role of local authorities? This parallel development is to come to an end and there will be an intregrationalist approach, which all of us welcome.  Nothing has <Col N="551" /> been more frustrating for councillors over the past number of years than to watch what has been going on in the participatory environment.  This is not a criticism in that we all welcome what has been going on there.  In some cases it has been a joy to watch communities, which have been given a hand up rather than a hand out, come together.</P>
    <P>During my year as chairman of Leitrim County Council, the first occasion I was invited to attend a function in an official capacity was the opening of a marina in Ballinamore, County Leitrim.  The three people who were acknowledged and called upon to speak were the representatives of the funding agencies, the area partnership, the Leader programme and the International Fund for Ireland.  The local authority was not one of the agencies.  This must end.  Local authorities must become more involved.  The Minister has presented a challenge and I hope councillors will accept it.  I welcome the Minister's thinking in this area.  As he said, we will return to this topic and I look forward to that debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls made during the debate.  I have known the Minister for many years and I say without fear of contradiction that he will be a Minister of action.  No other Minister in the portfolio has been better briefed, particularly given his experience as secretary of LAMA.  He worked hard during his ten years with LAMA and I have every confidence in his intended actions.  The right actions may not have been taken at the start but, as the Minister said, he is prepared to listen to views and to change or adjust the proposals.  What more could the House want?</P>
      <P>The Minister's action with regard to the remuneration of members of local authorities should be serious.  They should be given something decent because councillors work in a voluntary capacity.  Every Monday I and my colleagues on Westmeath County Council and other local authorities give up our time.  We must find somebody to replace us in the workplace and people lose a day's wages if they work in industry.  If they are farmers, they must find people to do their work on that day.  People give their time and expertise for free.  The least they should receive is an acknowledgement in terms of money to pay the people who must replace them in the workplace one day a week.  The calibre of local authority members is high and the Minister is young, enthusiastic and energetic.  The economic climate is good and buoyant and the public expects efficiency.  They want their requests met immediately but this cannot be done unless the right people are in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authority members are the salt of the earth.  They are involved in voluntary organisations throughout the country.  These people probably devote 40 hours of their time a week to various organisations in addition to their political work.  Local authority members are at ground level and they bring the message back to the <Col N="552" /> Government.  They represent the poorest and underprivileged in society.  In my role in public life I get the most satisfaction from helping such people.  Individuals who are well off can employ a team or firm to represent them and get whatever they consider they are due.  However, local authority members get most satisfaction representing people in underprivileged communities.</P>
    <P>I hope local authority members will respond positively to the Minister's proposals.  These people have served for many years for free and I hope they will get a decent offer from the Minister to ensure they can enjoy their retirement with their next of kin.  They should be able to enjoy the last years of their lives without having to ask people to help them out by organising a fund raising function for them.  I look forward to the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister to the House.  I recognise he is willing to consult.  I attended a conference recently where he spent two hours replying to questions.  He only held back in a number of small areas and these are the areas I wish to mention.</P>
      <P>I said previously that the motion was not a knee-jerk reaction or an attempt to go against the Government.  There is a two fold reason behind it.  The Minister spotted the first which relates to the need for a debate on local government. Senators are the main representatives of local authority members and we considered it correct that such a debate should be held.  I admit the motion was introduced through the back door, but the label on it was &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  I have talked to many members of local authorities and they considered certain areas were being consulted while others were being ignored.  They said it was a case of allowing them to do the donkey work but they would be excluded from the consultations on how payments would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion condemns the Government for its failure to adequately consult all interested parties in relation to funding.  Local authority members are familiar with the motor taxation aspects but they were not aware of what was happening to the equalisation fund.  The Minister may say I should know what is happening in Galway Corporation and Galway County Council because they are running the pilot scheme.  However, no member of the corporation or county council is aware of what is happening to the fund.  There is no consultation at that level and members feel there is no consultation whatsoever about the fund.  They do not want a quango but they want a representative member of the General Council of County Councils, LAMA or AMAI to be part of a consultative body to ensure there is equity.  I do not suggest the Minister will not ensure there is equity but such a body would resolve the issue. Local authority members would know that they have a part to play and they could not complain about the final decision.  They could not say that various things were not done or that they should <Col N="553" /> receive more because they would be tied into the process.</P>
    <P>The SPCs are a novel and new development but they are frightening to many councillors. They did not know what would happen to them. They felt excluded that the SPCs included radical elements and that single issue candidates could take their seats.  As the Minister is aware, there is always a resistance to change.  Nevertheless, the representative bodies met the Minister and departmental officials.  They also met representatives of the previous Administration and discussed the matter.  They then explained what was happening to their members and, in the main, they have secured agreement on the SPCs.  They are almost in operation in many councils, including my own.</P>
    <P>Nowadays council members are professional people.  This is reflected in the fact that the Minister is considering giving a gratuity to council members in the future.  However, if they have that standing, why are they excluded from the debate on the financial aspects?  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, recently launched a new housing unit and he welcomed the fact that the unit will bring together representatives of the main interests in social housing working together in common cause.  He said this partnership approach is the way forward in social housing.  Managers and voluntary groups are represented but local authority members are excluded.  If one believes local authority members are professionals, they are entitled to be part of such representative bodies and to discuss issues which will affect them in the future.</P>
    <P>An element of the motion was introduced through the back door to start the debate on changes to local democracy.  The Minister said there is a democratic deficit and that he is considering the direct election of mayors.  This has opened a can of worms and 102 representatives debated the issue at a meeting of the General Council of County Councils in Ennis last week. There was a degree of resistance to the idea <Col N="554" /> because there is a question about the purpose of a directly elected mayor or chairperson.  What standing will he or she have <i>vis-a-vis</i> the manager? Will he or she dictate to the manager or <i>vice versa</i>?  Will the mayor have control over finances?  How will he or she relate to the SPCs and elected members?  There are many questions to be answered and I want clarification on the control aspects.  Will it be similar to the French or American systems?</P>
    <P>The question must be asked whether a system is to be adopted where a mayor is elected, is in charge of finance and every other aspect of local government but is also in charge of raising finance for the local authority.  Local authorities are capped and the forthcoming Bill includes a capping of commercial rates.  That is worthy of debate.  There are many issues and the Minister will return to debate them, but it was felt it was critical to hold a debate before the Bill was introduced in case any modifications or insights could be provided by Members.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister is trying to tie local development systems back into local authorities because they were outside the realm of democracy. We did not know what they were doing as they dispernsed funds like Santa Claus.  However, the resistance to this came from the Department of Finance, not the Minister's Department.  I turn now to gratuities for members.  If individuals have committed themselves to 30 years in local government, they should be given a commensurate gratuity irrespective of failure to be elected.  It is wrong, inequitable and unfair to do otherwise.  If anybody has given a commitment over many years to local government, he or she should receive a gratuity commensurate with that commitment. I hope the Minister takes that into account and I have no doubt he will do his best for local authority members through whatever new format he introduces.  However, he must recognise facilities must be provided for local authority members, and funding commensurate with the work they carry out should be provided.</P>
