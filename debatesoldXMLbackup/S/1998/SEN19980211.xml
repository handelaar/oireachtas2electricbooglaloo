      <P>I have notice from Senator Connor that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to review the position of designation of certain sites in County Roscommon as special areas of conservation given the difficulties the proposed designation causes to owners and occupiers of these sites who engage in turf production for domestic heating purposes on these sites.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to report on his visit to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the concerns of the Dublin Horse Owners' Association about the lack of implementation of the Government's own recommendations regarding local horse projects.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide a library for the Cabra/Navan Road area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to establish immediately the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute as a company as the failure to do so is hindering the successful completion of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="182" /> I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take immediate steps to ensure that young children are not endangered when accompanying their parents or guardians who are selling the <i>Big Issue</i> magazine at major traffic intersections in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Connor and Henry as suitable for discussion and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Avril Doyle, Costello, O'Meara and Ridge may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 8, motion 13.  Item 8, motion 13, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and the proceedings on item 1, if not previously concluded, will resume at 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That item 8, motion No. 15, be the first item on today's Order of Business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Last April, a promise was made to people with an interest in this Bill that it would be the first item restored to the Order Paper on the resumption of the new Seanad and that it would be restored at Report Stage.  It is now February and the Bill has not yet been restored.  If my amendment is accepted, it does not mean that time will be taken up today.  The item will simply be restored to the Order Paper as was promised by the parties opposite and by the parties on this side of the House.  It would be an act of faith to the people involved that the commitments we gave them were being honoured.</P>
      <P>On the Order of Business last Thursday, in response to Senator O'Meara, the Leader implied he would take Second Stage or allow her Private Members' Bill on to the Order Paper.  He indicated clearly that legislation was a matter for Government and that he had no intention of having a series of Private Members' motions taken during the life of this Seanad.  Will he clarify that? He knows well that during the last Seanad, five Private Members' Bills were taken, all from the opposite side of the House with one exception, two in the name of Senator Daly, one in the name of Senator O'Kennedy, another in the name of Senator Roche, and Senator Henry and Senator Honan also moved Private Members' Bills.  All were given a Second Reading.  I want the Leader to clarify at an early stage in the life of this House that the practice of allowing Opposition Members introduce Private Members' Bills and have a Second Reading at least will not be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  On the last sitting day prior to <Col N="183" /> the election last year, I received a commitment from the then Leader of the Government and the then leader of the main Opposition party that the question of the adoption of children from Paraguay and other South American countries would be resolved.  We were waiting for legal advice being sought by the Attorney General.  I understand it is not appropriate to enter into discussion on that.  However, I ask the Leader of the House to accept item 8, motion 15, as part of the Order of Business today.  It may be dealt with without debate because it simply proposes that the Bill be restored to the Order Paper and that the legal advice received by the Attorney General be placed in the Oireachtas Library so that we can see what it means.  Such advice is already available from other lawyers and this would add to it. Many families are upset and feel insecure.  The children are growing older and it is clear that this issue must be sorted out.  Everybody in the House shares this view.  The Leader should be brave and he could start by cracking the whip and having the issue resolved.  He is only being asked put the matter on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise the sitting arrangements for the House.  People have certain expectations regarding sitting days, whether they be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.  The Leader should consider discussing some cyclical arrangement with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges so that people can plan in advance and work out the days on which particular issues are to be discussed.  At present the House is too much at the mercy of Departments which request business to be done by a particular time or day, leaving us to jump to attention.  It is time the Leader took control by outlining the days on which we will sit and ensuring ample prior notice is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of the previous two speakers and say that the Labour Party will support the amendment which calls for item 8, motion 15, to be taken first.</P>
      <P>A related issue concerns the Refugee Act, 1996.  Many asylum seekers are waiting for implementation of this legislation and many parents are awaiting developments on the adoption legislation. When will the Refugee Act, 1996, be implemented?  Everything is in limbo, with 4,000 people waiting for their cases to be heard.  It seems that a number of cases already heard are being presented in the context of deportation. Will the Leader say whether the Minister intends introducing new legislation, whether existing legislation will be implemented and what will happen to those whose requests for asylum have been refused and who are on hold for, apparently, deportation?</P>
      <P>Has the Leader acted on the numerous requests from this side for a visit to St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, during February?  Perhaps he has up to date information on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the local elections will the Leader contact the Minister for the Environment <Col N="184" /> and Local Government and invite him to come into the House?  When meeting with the General Council of County Councils on 4 December 1997 the Minister stated that he intended postponing local elections.  He cannot do this unilaterally: a motion must be put before the House.  What is happening in relation to this?  Will he put an order before the Oireachtas?  The Minister indicated on that occasion that he was going to establish a committee or commission under the 1991 local government legislation.  Does this require legislation?  What will be its terms of reference? Will it seek public submissions?  Senators who are democratically elected by the universal franchise of elected councillors&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>And Members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;have considerable interest in the committee proposed by the Minister.  The Minister indicated that he intended the committee to be broad ranging and to look, not only at population movements over the past number of years but also the delivery of area based services. Perhaps the Leader will invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come before the House so that we can hear his views and have a debate on the reform of local government and the new boundary commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to motion 15, all parties in the House are anxious that this matter be dealt with.  It is true that before the last Seanad rose it was agreed &mdash; or at least it was suggested &mdash; by all parties that it would.  Following remarks made on the Order of Business last week, I checked the current position of the legislation and was told it is at an advanced stage of preparation. There were certain difficulties with regard to adoptions in Paraguay but I am confident the Bill will be brought before the House quite soon.  That is not to say that I would support the motion if it were put to a division.  However, much progress has been made in terms of bringing the Bill before the House and Members should take that into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue which was raised in the House last week and on other occasions &mdash; rail safety.  Can the Leader organise a debate on the matter as soon as possible?  Last Friday Iarnród Éireann announced that it had received the report on the serious rail accident at Knockcroghery.  The announcement was made in a two page press release which said little about the nature of the accident itself.  However, the general manager of Iarnród Éireann said he had forwarded a comprehensive report on the accident to the Minister for Public Enterprise.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to publish that report as soon as possible?  I am of the view that if the report is objective and is the result of a thorough examination of the problem, it might contain information which the Minister and Iarnród <Col N="185" /> Éireann might not like the public to have.  It should be published as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader organise a debate on the current problems in Northern Ireland which are causing serious concern for all the people on this island?  It must be recognised that people in the Republic share this island and the problems and difficulties that arise.  It is time this House had an opportunity to clarify its stance.</P>
      <P>Members of the House and the Garda Síochána have been accused by many sectors of being complacent about the killings and other paramilitary activities in Northern Ireland.  That is unacceptable and we should have an opportunity to state our disapproval of what is happening. The Republic has never had a Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Government which were more clear about Northern Ireland, carried less baggage in that regard and were more prepared to reach an understanding with the people of Northern Ireland.  That should be spelt out in this House.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on Northern Ireland as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Leader promised that the House would have the chance to debate the serious problem of telephone masts.  Can that debate be held next week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my name to motion 13, which was put down by the Independent Members.  The omission of my name is probably the result of confusion for which I might have been responsible.  However, I strongly support the motion.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader intend to hold a debate on the dangerous situation in Iraq?  It could be held in the context of an item on the Order Paper regarding the Amsterdam Treaty.  News has emerged in recent days that certain German chemical companies have supplied Iraq with materials for the manufacture of chemical weapons and anthrax bombs.  It is a matter of public concern if Ireland is being led into alliances with these unwholesome groups.  The Minister should make a statement about the facts in this regard. Who are these people and should they not be brought to justice for crimes against humanity?  It appears that some elements are returning to their nasty old ways.</P>
      <P>Is it proposed to have a debate on genetically engineered materials?  Ten more trials are planned at present.  In April last year I spoke in the Seanad about Monsanto, which has been convicted of scientific fraud.  Ten more trials are due to take place without the openness about which this House was given assurances as late as April of last year.</P>

      <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil deamhéin sa Teach seo don Ghaeilge, ár dteanga <Col N="186" /> náisiúnta.  Aréir d'fhógraigh Glór na nGael buaiteoirí na bliana seo.  Ba bhreá liom go gcuirfeadh an Teach seo comhghairdeas chuig na buateoirí, go mór mór chuig Aonach na Mumhan i gCondae Thiobraid Árann a bhuaigh an chéad duais.  Is cúis dóchais dúinn go léir go bhfuil na bailte chomh gníomhach sin ar fud na tíre ag saothrú ar son na Gaeilge agus an chúltúir Ghaelaigh i gcoitinne.</P>
      <P>I would like the House to convey through Minister Ó Cuív our best wishes to Nenagh, County Tipperary, on winning the premier prize in the Glór na nGael competitions and to compliment all who participated.  We are committed to the Irish language here and it is a source of great encouragement to realise people throughout the country are so active in the promotion of our native language.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's call for a debate on rail safety.  The Minister for Public Enterprise is commissioning a report which will take more than two years to complete.  In view of what Senator Connor said about Knockcroghery, I support his call for the issue to be examined in the House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>I call for a debate on the State agencies, the ICC, ACC and the TSB.  There is much speculation that some of those institutions which have served the State so well are going to be sold.  We should debate this issue at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator McGowan's call for a debate on mobile telephone masts.  We may not get very far with it as the World Health Organisation has pointed out on many occasions that they are not a health hazard.  Let us debate the matter anyway.</P>
      <P>I also support his call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I appeal to the media to be more positive than they are at present.  They have adopted a very negative attitude to debates in the North, pitting Gerry Adams against the Unionists and forcing them into corners.  This is not helpful to attempts to resolve a difficult situation.  The media should be more positive in their approach.</P>
      <P>I also call for a debate on child care.  Senator Quill pointed out very ably the problem of child homelessness in a debate here last week.  One of the Sunday newspapers published survey results showing teenagers as young as 13 years of age are involved in drug and alcohol abuse and in teenage sex.  As they are children until they are 18 years of age, there is clearly a serious violation of the law taking place.  It is time we had a debate on how the law can be amended or what measures can be taken to prevent those young people falling into such a desperate trap from which they may never escape.  It is time to take a serious look at the present teenage problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the crime prevention policy articulated earlier this week by our party spokesperson, Deputy Jim Higgins.  I appeal to <Col N="187" /> the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the need to provide for more community training workshops. The wonderful work being done by the workshops is not generally recognised.  The last Minister toured some of these facilities and saw the great work being done in places such as Canal House in Ballinasloe and the Tuam community training centre.  If more money was provided for this area there would be less need for prisons.  I appeal to the Leader to press the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the work being done by the community training workshops and to provide more money for them. This would be a meaningful attempt to prevent crime at an early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the fact that you could not allow my Adjournment motion.  I shall resubmit it at a later date.  I draw the House's attention to an instance of child abuse which I witnessed.  I saw a refugee woman with a very young baby running across the intersection at Newland's Cross while selling <i>The Big Issues</i> to motorists. About 56,000 cars per day use that road.  It is surely within the capability of the Minister to prevent a situation such as that.</P>

Go háirithe, ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis na bailtí i dTuaisceart Éireann a bhuaigh duaiseanna.  Tháinig ceathrar den seisear buaiteoirí i gCúige Uladh as Tuaisceart Éireann.  I support Senator Ó Murchú in congratulating the towns which won prizes in the Glór na nGael competition and I particularly congratulate the Northern Ireland towns.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the rising spiral of house prices.  It has been reported that house prices have increased by between 5 and 10 per cent since Christmas.  The Minister has begun to tackle this question by setting up a working group but there is another dimension to the problem.</P>

      <P>I will conlude by referring to interest rates for local authority loans.  These rates stand at 12.5 per cent compared with the normal mortgage rate of 7 per cent.  Something <Col N="188" /> must be done for local authority mortgage holders.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader bring to the notice of the Minister the decision taken by the board of the ESB last evening which will have devastating consequences for a small company, John Francis Spaight and Company, which is located a few miles outside Tipperary town?  The company employs 21 people and is the main supplier of creosoted poles to the ESB.  At last night's board meeting the ESB decided to source them from another company outside the State.  This is a cause of great concern in my constituency of Tipperary South.  Will the Leader ask the Minister if she is aware of this decision and can she take urgent action in the matter?  During the storms at Christmas when poles were knocked down and broken, these people worked on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and every other day they were required to.  They supplied a top quality service and are now concerned about the decision made by the board of the ESB last night.  The matter needs to be resolved urgently.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this question last week. Why does item 7 remain in its current form on the Order Paper?  The Leader said he would come back to us on the revised wording for the proposed schedule in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Does he have a further report on this?  Why does the item remain as worded if the Government said it would change it?  Does he share my concern that the delay in deciding on the referendum wording is not a great start to a campaign many of us hope will be successful? In the light of the Government's delay in finalising the wording, will he confirm that it will not proceed with the referendum in May, as originally intended?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Public Enterprise the concerns raised about the Luas project?  Will he obtain an update for Members of the House and the people of Dublin who are increasingly concerned about the traffic gridlock, which is deteriorating instead of improving?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader raise with the Minister of Justice the issue of young males in Dublin who verbally abuse motorists, especially female ones, if they do not fork out money for having their windscreens cleaned?  The problem is increasing and needs to be addressed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to intercede in an appropriate manner to ensure a speedy resolution of the difficulties at Deelis power station in Caherciveen? I am concerned for the Iveragh turf suppliers because the business is worth £1.4 million annually to the local economy.  All of last year's turf is stacked on the roadside and along the <Col N="189" /> river.  It cannot be taken away because of the ongoing dispute.</P>

      <P>Is the Leader satisfied that the Minister for Finance and the Government are doing enough on the matter of duty free sales, which is important because of the implications for jobs?  It is a matter which is close to the Leader's heart and I leave it with him.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning raised the status of the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  The Government approved the restoration of the Bill to the Seanad Order Paper on 28 January on the basis that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, would consider the outstanding issues outlined in the memorandum to Government with a view to addressing these difficulties and reporting back to the Cabinet. The issues referred to relate to ordinary adoptions effected in Paraguay.  The Department is currently pursuing these issues to enable the Minister of State to report back to the Government prior to the moving of the motion to restore the Bill to the Order Paper.</P>

      <P>Senators O'Toole, Dardis and Manning raised the issue of proposed legislation. On the Order of Business last week I did not object when Senator O'Meara announced her intention to publish a Bill.  That was the second Bill to be proposed by the Labour Party.  I agree with Senator Manning that five Bills were introduced by Fianna Fáil during its two and a half <Col N="190" /> years in Opposition and that during the past two weeks, two Bills have been introduced by the Opposition.  I have no difficulty with this if it enhances legislation and improves society in general, provided that each Bill is treated on its merits.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised the matter of sitting arrangements.  I would like to hear the views of the Leaders of the groups in this regard at our meeting following the Order of Business because a large amount of legislation is due to come before the House.  On the last occasion I stated that 25 Bills were published during the previous session.  A total of 15 Bills have been promised by the Government before Easter.  During the lifetime of the previous Seanad, six Bills were initiated in the Seanad.  The current Seanad is different from its predecessor because much new legislation is being initiated, which is a welcome development.  I ask the support of the Leaders to enable me to have as much legislation as possible initiated and debated in the Seanad.  I know I can rely on Senator Manning in this regard because he has been most helpful.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello inquired about St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  I wrote to the hospital authorities seeking a tour of the institution by a Seanad group.  It is for each individual Senator if he or she wishes to visit the hospital.  When the hospital replies to my request, I will communicate further with the Senator and the House.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello also raised the Minister for the Environment and Local Government's proposal to redraw local electoral boundaries.  The Minister will be before the House in the coming weeks and the matter can be put to him then. I may also inquire what are his thoughts on the proposal from the Department.</P>
      <P>Senators Connor and Burke requested a debate on rail safety.  Last week I promised the House that such a debate would take place at the earliest opportunity.  However, I must wait for the Minister to make time available to come before the House to deal with this worthy proposal.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan and others requested a debate on Northern Ireland.  I understand the Minister is not available next week.  As soon as he is available I will arrange a debate on the matter. Senators McGowan and Farrell requested a debate on telephone masts.  I will make time available for such a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Iraq.  Perhaps, we could debate foreign affairs in general and various topics could be discussed when the Minister for Foreign Affairs attends.  He is extremely busy, but as soon as I can find a date in his diary I will come back to the Senator.  He also raised his serious concerns about genetic engineering.  I will try to acquire information on it and will revisit the matter with him privately.</P>
      <P>I join with Senators Ó Murchú, Bonner and O'Meara in congratulating all the Glór na nGael winners, particularly Nenagh.  The House is pleased to be associated with their remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> Senator Burke called for a debate on the ICC, the TSB and the ACC and I will consult the Minister for Finance on this.  However, the Appropriation Bill will be discussed in the House on Friday and Members who have raised matters of grave concern on the Order of Business could avail of that opportunity to debate them.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell raised his concern about the abuse of alcohol and teenage drinking and I will try to have a debate on this issue at the earliest opportunity.  Senator McDonagh called for more funds from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for workshops.  The Appropriation Bill is an ideal opportunity for the Senator to take this issue up with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner called for a debate on house prices with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I support this and at the earliest possible opportunity I will seek a debate. Senator Tom Hayes may discuss the matter he raised on Friday.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> On last week's Order of Business Senator Gallagher also raised item 7 on the Order Paper.  The position is that the Taoiseach has been consulting leaders of other parties and he has imparted his legal advice to them as well.  Perhaps, the Senator will consult with his party leader in this regard.</P>

      <P>Senator Coughlan raised the matter of the power station in Cahirciveen, County Kerry, built in the early 1950s and with which I am familiar. He may take the matter up on Friday's debate on the Appropriation Bill and I am only too pleased to be able to facilitate the Senator.  With regard to his concerns on duty free sales I hope to have a debate on the matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <Col N="193" /> It is not necessary to repeat everything I said on Committee Stage.  However, in reintroducing these amendments on Report Stage I wish to underline the importance of enshrining bilingualism in legislation rather than paying lip service to our notions of a living Irish language.  On the Order of Business we congratulated the Glór na nGael winners which were announced last night. That is an example of actively keeping the language alive.  As public representatives and legislators we are failing in our duty if we do not use every opportunity to pursue the clearly stated aim which is supported by all political parties.  This amendment presents an opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>Having examined the legislation I do not think this amendment would impose an onerous responsibility on the Courts Service.  We are establishing a service which will be efficient and professional and able to bear an additional load such as this.  The main objective of these amendments is to give legislative effect to our stated aim and ambition.</P>

One wonders what objections the Minister can have to these amendments in the light of that &ldquo;enunciated principle&rdquo;.</P>

Dúirt mé cheana go bhfuil an-suim agam agus an Rialtais ár dteanga a chuir ar aghaidh agus chuir mé leasaithe ós chomhair an Tigh seo seachtain ó shin.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara's amendments were tabled last week and they are the same as those proposed by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  I am on record as saying that the Government and I have a deep interest in promoting the Irish language where possible.  That is the reason I tabled amendments on the Irish language last week.  My Committee Stage amendment, which is now subsection 7(2)(d), provides that the strategic plan for the Courts Service will have regard to Government policy on promoting bilingualism.  It requires that regard be had to the need to ensure that an adequate number of staff of the service is competent to provide a service in Irish and English.  This is a practical approach which goes a long way towards meeting the concerns of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge as expressed in these amendments.</P>
      <P>Last week I made it clear that I fully recognise the importance of the Courts Service being in a position to deal appropriately with people who wish to transact their business in Irish.  The difficulty with the detail of the amendments is that, in practice, they would place too great a burden on the service, at least in the short term.  If we had to ensure that the Courts Service was in a position to comply with all these requirements, the effect of accepting some of the amendments would be to delay the establishment of the service for a considerable period.  I simply could not countenance that.</P>
      <P>As regards the Senators' amendment relating to the board of the service I would be reluctant to amend its constitution in the manner proposed. The board comprises members specifically representative of groups or bodies with a direct functional relationship with the Courts Service and gives direct effect to the recommendation of the working group, chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, on a courts commission.</P>
      <P>The requirements inserted by my amendment in section 7 will, of themselves, ensure the board of the service will have the effective delivery of services through Irish on its agenda.  Overall, my response to the Senators' amendments is that I consider the current legislative provisions and the case law relating to the use of Irish in legal proceedings, taken together with section 7(2)(d), to be sufficient to ensure that persons wishing to conduct their business through Irish in the courts can be appropriately facilitated.  That provision arises from consultations with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has responsibility for both the Gaeltacht and the State's policy on bilingualism.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that section 7(2)(d) is a practical recognition of the importance of the Irish language and that this approach would not result in delays in the establishment of the Courts Service which would be the unintentional effect of the Senators' amendments.  Senators will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, has announced that work has commenced on a Bill on the provision of Irish language services by State agencies.  That legislation will provide the House with an opportunity to revisit the issues involved here on a wider front.  In those circumstances, I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom a rá arís go bhfuil mé an-bhuíoch do na Seanadóirí as ucht an méid atá ráite acu ar son ár dteanga sa Teach seo.  Tá sé anthábhachtach agus ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil dóibh.</P>

      <P>The amendment tabled by the Minister last week on Committee Stage in response to this set of amendments is purely aspirational and its effect is to state the aspiration that the strategic plan shall have regard to Government policy on bilingualism.  Unfortunately, I do not believe that will have an effect on the ground in the Courts Service and it falls far short of recognising a person's right, as an Irish language speaker first and foremost, to have a case heard in his or her native language.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 27, after &ldquo;judges&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or County Registrars and any other person who has a judicial or quasi-judicial function according to law.</P>
      <P>We debated this issue at length on Committee Stage last week.  We now ask the Minister to reconsider this amendment in which we ask that county registrars would get a specific mention alongside judges.  We have improved the wording of the amendment by saying &ldquo;and any other person who has a judicial or quasi-judicial function according to law&rdquo;.  That covers the difficulties raised by the Minister last week when he pointed out that it would be necessary to include everybody who has a judicial or quasi-judicial function. By rewording the amendment in this way, we believe the Minister should have no difficulty in accepting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> County registrars have very important judicial and administrative functions under this Bill and they will carry out many of the administrative functions of the courts.  However, when they step outside of their administrative role, as they will in many ways whether in relation to the register of electors or sittings delegated to them from the Circuit Court requiring them to make orders of discovery and so on, effectively they will be acting as judges.  The Bill must clearly state the distinction between the functions of the county registrars.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I spoke about the doctrine of the separation of powers on which we pride ourselves as a democratic country.  Any legislation which deals with people who have both administrative and judicial functions should state that clearly.</P>

      <P>I listened to the arguments on this issue on Committee Stage and again today.  The amendment now includes the words &ldquo;and any other person who has a judicial or quasi-judicial function according to law&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to the term &lsquo;amenable&rsquo;.  My interpretation of the principle contained in section 9(b) is that it protects the independence of a county registrar, Master of the High Court or any other person whose functions, to a greater or lesser extent, would be in the quasi-judicial area.  If that protection is afforded to their independence, surely, as the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage, the inclusion of today's amendment would be superfluous.  A person's independence is either protected or it is not.  The Minister is obviously satisfied, from his own careful interpretation of the section, that protection is afforded and is foolproof and sacrosanct in so far as that can be determined.</P>
      <P>Section 30, in transferring the functions of the county registrars to the Courts Service, only does so in so far as those functions relate to the functions of the Courts Service which are, in the main, administrative.  If that is the case, functions that do not apply to the Courts Service are still retained and protected under section 9(b).  It does not seem sensible to insert additional phrases into the Bill without justification, notwithstanding the principle which Senators are rightly attempting to establish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this amendment.  The Minister has recognised what we have been attempting to do in relation to county registrars. Section 9 states that no function conferred on, or <Col N="197" /> vested in the service, the board or the chief executive, under this Act shall be exercised so as to interfere with the conduct of that part of the business of the courts.  If the Minister were to accept the amendment and add &ldquo;county registrars and any other person who has a judicial or quasi-judicial function according to law&rdquo; at that point, paragraphs (a) and (b) could be deleted.  It is a straightforward amendment which makes common sense and inserts the title &ldquo;county registrar&rdquo; in the Bill, which is why I support it.</P>

This is an opportunity to give official recognition to them within the structure of the Bill.  The Minister will have no difficulty accepting this amendment as it is in line with the sentiments he expressed on Committee Stage.  Neither does it not cause any difficulties, legal or otherwise.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions on this set of amendments.  Amendment No. 6 proposes the inclusion of a reference to county registrars and other persons with judicial or quasi-judicial powers in section 9. Amendment No. 20 proposes to insert a reference to county registrars in section 40.  The sections are similar.  Section 9 provides for the independence of judges and the exercise of judicial business and that of persons exercising quasi-judicial functions. Section 40 makes similar provision in respect of the transitional provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated on Committee Stage that, in addition to their courts administration work, county registrars exercise a wide range of quasi-judicial functions as well as certain functions, such as returning officer, which are unrelated to the courts.  Before Committee Stage, Senators expressed concern that the Bill may not <Col N="198" /> adequately safeguard the independence of county registrars, especially in the exercise of their quasi-judicial functions.  In response to those concerns, I brought forward an amendment, section 30, to ensure county registrars are part of the courts service only in so far as their functions relating to the administration of their court office are concerned. Their quasi-judicial functions are excluded from the effect of the provision by reference to section 9 which ensures the service, the board or the chief executive will not be in a position to impugn the independence of a person who exercises such limited functions of a judicial nature conferred on them by law.  A county registrar is such a person exercising limited functions of a judicial nature conferred by law.  That is the position as a matter of fact and as a matter of law.</P>
    <P>County registrars exercise limited functions of a judicial nature conferred on them by law in accordance with the 1937 Constitution.  I am fully satisfied, therefore, that both sections 9 and 40 provide for the independence of county registrars in the exercise by them of quasi-judicial functions and I see no grounds for specifying the persons, be they county registrars or any other person, comprehended by the provisions of those sections.  I fully subscribe to the view expressed by Senator Liam Fitzgerald that the amendments are, to that extent, superfluous.  It is clear the proposed amendment is redundant in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is surely beyond doubt that paragraph 9(b) encompasses the relevant functions of county registrars.  It also does so in a way preferable to the formula of words used in the proposed amendment which refers to quasi-judicial functions. While that is a phrase used in ordinary debate, the phrase &ldquo;limited functions of a judicial nature&rdquo;, contained in paragraph 9(b), is a more appropriate phrase to use in law in that it reflects the wording used in Article 37.1 of the Constitution which deals with such powers.  I am satisfied the changes made to the Bill last week adequately meet the concerns expressed to me by representatives of the county registrars.  For the reasons I have outlined I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Senator O'Meara and her colleagues appears to have the objective of recognising the special position of county registrars in the exercise by them of quasi-judicial functions.  Article 37 of the Constitution provides for the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature in matters other than criminal matters by any person or bodies of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers.  The amendment seems to me to state the current position under the Constitution and the law that county registrars may exercise functions of a quasi-judicial nature and that in the exercise of these functions the decisions of county registrars may be appealed to the Circuit Court.  The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides a wide range of quasi-judicial functions which country registrars may exercise and which may be <Col N="199" /> appealed to the Circuit Court.  I see no necessity for such an amendment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of the Senator's amendment would have the effect of conferring additional powers on county registrars corresponding to those of the Master of the High Court.  The powers of county registrars and the area of quasi-judicial business are being kept under review. The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, represented a major overhaul and extension of the powers of county registrars.  At this point, it would be premature to further extend these powers conferred under the 1995 Act until their full impact is assessed.  It is doubtful that additional powers of a quasi-judicial nature could be conferred by way of rules, which is what the amendment seeks to do.  In the circumstances, I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very disappointed by the Minister's attitude.  Before he left us last week, he gave the impression he would look afresh at this. We got the impression he would concede this point.  I know he received legal advice on this issue, but so did we. We are pressing the amendment this far because our legal advice is it cannot be expressed often enough in this Bill and that every opportunity which presents itself in the legislation should be taken to confirm the independence of county registrars and other persons who have a judicial or quasi-judical role.  We appreciate that section 9 deals with the points the Minister made. Nevertheless, the amendment is not superfluous, as he states, and our legal advice confirms it is not superfluous that the desired words are added in the sections requested.  We have not, as the Minister seemed to imply towards the end of his contribution, sought additional powers for county registrars other than those given to them under the Court and Court Officers Act, 1995.  We merely seek to ensure this separation is clearly stated at every opportunity in the Bill.  There is nothing superfluous about that.  We do so on the basis of what we consider good legal advice.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments are self evident.  We simply want to allow for where Bar and solicitor representatives are elected by the members rather than nominated by the chairman.  This principle is similar to that of promoting the use of Irish and ensuring the rights of Irish language speakers are <Col N="200" /> protected.  As legislators we should take such principles into account when drawing up legislation. A further example is that of gender equality.  This Bill does not seek the promulgation of gender equality in the judiciary, although it is something which others like me might like to see.</P>
    <P>The principle in this amendment is important. It ensures a level of democracy through the election of Bar and solicitor representatives.  There is an important distinction between representatives being nominated by a chairman as opposed to elected by the members.  It might seem a small issue but the principle is very important.  We have an opportunity to include such a principle in the Bill and I would like the Minister to accept it and also include it in other legislation.</P>

      <P>This is similar to the amendment tabled by Senator O'Meara on Committee Stage.  Section 11 sets out the composition of the board of the Courts Service.  It includes a practising barrister nominated by the Chairman of the Bar Council and a practising solicitor nominated by the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland.  These amendments propose that, rather than using the nomination procedure provided for in the Bill, it should be specified that members of the board should be elected by the council and the society respectively.  It seems reasonable that it should be left to both groups to make their own arrangements in relation to their representation on the board of the Courts Service. In these circumstances I regret that I do not consider it appropriate that the legislation should specify that these people should be elected.</P>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage, the present provisions are those which are standard in other legislation and I see no good reason to depart from that approach.  In the circumstances I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendments.  The Chairman of the Bar Council and the President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland will make the nomination.  This is not to say, however, that I am directing that only these people, without consultation, should make the nominations. Both can make their own arrangements as to whom they nominate and they would appreciate being given the latitude and independence to so do.  This is why I ask the Senators to withdraw the amendment.</P>

However, the legislation does not allow this to take place, and while it might be the Minister's aspiration and wish, we can assume it will not happen if such a provision is not included in the Bill.  The reason for tabling these amendments is to ensure there is consultation.</P>

It is logical and makes common sense that a chief executive of any organisation is at the coalface at all times when important decisions are made.  Important decisions are made on an ongoing basis by rules committees.

      <P>The House will recall that during the debate on Committee Stage I undertook to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage dealing with the position of the chief executive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the rules committees, the subject of Senator O'Meara's amendment.  Both the Senator's amendment and mine are intended to <Col N="202" /> give effect to a recommendation contained in the second report of the working group on the Courts Commission which said that, when the Courts Service is established, the chief executive or his or her nominee should be a member of each of the rules committees and that the necessary legislative steps should be taken to enable this.</P>
      <P>As the Bill deals with the functions of the chief executive, I am satisfied it is appropriate to include a provision making the chief executive a member of the rules committee.  Accordingly, my amendment provides that the chief executive will be a member of the Superior Courts Rules Committee, the Circuit Court Rules Committee and the District Court Rules Committee.  The amendment also provides that the chief executive may derogate his or her membership of these committees to a member of the staff of the Courts Service and that he or she may revoke such derogation.</P>
      <P>The effect of the Senator's amendment is also to make a general provision for the designation by <i>ex-officio</i> members of the committee of their membership.  In particular the amendment provides that a judicial member could derogate his or her membership to a judge of the same court. This is to make more general provision relating to the composition of the rules committee.  It goes beyond the scope of what is necessary in the context of legislation dealing with the establishment of the Courts Service.  Further changes which might be made to the operation of rules committees should await another courts Bill.  For this reason I ask the Senators to withdraw their amendments in favour of the Government amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 24 also relates to the rules committees and adds section 44 of the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961, to the Second Schedule.  Section 34 of that Act provides for the <i>ex-officio</i> membership of the District Court Rules Committee and, in particular, that the Minister may nominate a District Court Clerk to be secretary of that committee.  The effect of the Government amendment is to transfer to the Courts Service the function of nomination of the secretary of the committee.  Amendment No. 23 is a consequential drafting amendment.</P>
      <P>The service should have this function especially as, under the previous amendment, the Bill will provide for the direct relationship between the service and the rules committees in terms of the committees' membership.</P>

On Committee Stage, I undertook to have the drafting of the subsection considered in consultation with the parliamentary draftsman.

It would be unfortunate if the administration of the law were to be hindered because proper planning procedures were not applied to the buildings in which courts were held and if decisions of such courts were to be null and void.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment is a practical and sensible measure in view of recent court decisions.  It should not cause difficulty since all public bodies are bound to apply for planning permission for their premises.  Such permission was not required previously but the situation is different now. However, it is important that recent case law be enshrined in statute law and this amendment offers such an opportunity.

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald is most perceptive.  This amendment was put down on Committee Stage.  Section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1993 provides for developments which are exempt from requirements relating to planning approval.  Such developments include courthouses, but the Act does not explicitly include temporary courthouses. Recent planning decisions have indicated the desirability of ensuring that the exemption that already applies to a permanent courthouse should equally apply to temporary courthouses. Section 32(2) achieves this by redefining courthouses to include a temporary courthouse.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald is correct with regard to the terms of the amendment.  It amounts to saying that the Courts Service should obey the law.  It would be most unusual, to say the least, to include such a provision in legislation.  The wider issue regarding planning permission is addressed by section 32(2) so I cannot support amendment No. 15.</P>

      <P>I spoke about this on Second and Committee Stages.  I regret amendment No. 18 has been ruled out of order as it has a financial connotation. These two amendments have financial considerations also.</P>
      <P>It is hard to believe that when this Bill was drafted no consultation took place with the local authorities.

We are introducing a Bill and saying everything else will be sorted out afterwards.  There will be serious problems.  I expect the local authorities will hold out in this case to the end.</P>
      <P>Senator Donovan said on Committee Stage he was delighted courthouses were being taken over by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as it would remove a burden from rate payers and local authorities.  In many areas the local authority area engineer's office is in the same building as the courthouse and many local authority functions are carried out there.  When the day of reckoning comes all the property the Minister has outlined in this Bill will be vested in the Courts Service.  In areas where the courts and the county council have property jointly, will the local authority have to pay rent for the use of facilities which will be in the ownership of the Courts Service?  In County Mayo there are many area engineer offices and many county council functions are carried out in the courthouses.  Will the Minister explain what will happen after vesting day?  In Castlebar, the county council will be required to move out of the courthouse.  What will happen to county council offices on vesting day when they have no alternative but to leave?</P>
      <P>There are many questions to be answered and that is why I and the other Fine Gael Senators tabled these amendments.  County councils will have to be compensated where they have been using a courthouse alongside the new service body at no cost to the local authority.</P>

      <P>I second the amendment.  Some of our finest public buildings are courthouses.  They are an important part of the built heritage of the State.  James Gandon's masterpiece, the Four Courts, is one of the finest public buildings in the country.  James Gandon has another minor masterpiece in Kinsealy, but there are Gandon courthouses in many towns.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has spent very little on the upkeep of these buildings.  Many of them have been kept by local authorities on a shoestring budget with no support from the Department.  Local authorities found themselves in the position of caretaker.  I do not wish to see these buildings made redundant, although the Department would do this.  It would close down many court services in towns such as Boyle, Westport <Col N="207" /> and Ennis.  The previous Minister for Justice commissioned a report clearly giving instructions to recommend a paring down of court venues. That is what the politically late Máire Geoghegan-Quinn implied when giving officials their terms of reference.</P>

The Courts Service may be good at providing a court service but it could prove to be a philistine in the matter of our architectural heritage. They might dispose of an architecturally important building to a body which might do something inappropriate with it.  Local authorities could be relied on to ensure that these buildings would be maintained architecturally intact and would continue to be used as public buildings and not turned into shopping malls.  The courthouse is the focal point of town squares and diamonds throughout the country.  The finest public building in County Roscommon is the courthouse in Roscommon town.  The finest public building in Boyle is the red sandstone courthouse, built in 1827, on the Crescent.  The same is true of Castlebar. There is a fine Doric court building in Ennis.</P>

      <P>Senator Connor has impressed upon the Minister the fine architectural heritage that we have in our courthouses.  I hope the Minister appreciates the importance of these buildings to local communities and to local authorities.  It is important that no cost is incurred by the local authorities because of the formation of the Courts Service.  In many towns courthouses have dual functions.  This varies from area to area. Clare County Council chamber, for example, is in the courthouse in Ennis.  The motor taxation office is also situated in Ennis courthouse.  These two important local authority functions are carried on in Ennis courthouse.  If the Courts Service takes over Ennis courthouse, will Clare County Council have to find an alternative chamber or will they have to ask the permission of the Courts Service to maintain their position within the courthouse?  These are practical issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The luminaries in the Minister's office who are dealing with this matter might find it difficult to comprehend these basic practicalities but I hope the Minister will bring our concerns to the attention of those who will administer the service.  If a local authority were obliged to vacate a court building and had to build or rent an alternative <Col N="208" /> building, an additional cost would be incurred by the local authority.  This would unacceptable.  The Minister, in establishing the Courts Service, must ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke, in amendment No. 17, proposes, in the event of any courthouse premises used for the purposes to which the functions of the service relate, becoming redundant, that premises shall revert without cost into the ownership of the local authority.  It is extremely important that it is recognised that these buildings have always been owned by the local authorities who maintained them, often with great difficulty. It is important that local authorities should not be charged commercial rents by the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>Many small courthouses or courtrooms are also used by local authority officials.  It is important that the spirit of co-operation which has existed between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the local authorities should continue. It is fundamental that no cost should be incurred by local authorities in the form of rents to the Courts Service or in the provision of alternative accommodation.</P>

      <P>I commend Senators Burke and Connor on these amendments.  I agree with almost all they have said.  The Dickensian conditions in many of our courthouses is an appalling testimony to the disgraceful attitude of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to court facilities.  We have heard judges complain that they cannot conduct court business because of the poor conditions in some courthouses.  It would be extremely high handed of the Courts Service to take over court buildings and dispose of them at will.  Senators Burke and Connor have, rightly, demanded that the Courts Service will not be given <i>carte blanche</i> to dispose of court buildings. Some court buildings are in an extreme state of dereliction but many are fine buildings in prominent locations in our towns and cities.  It is imperative that the Minister ensure that adequate sensitivity is shown to the architectural importance of our courthouses.  I laud these amendments and I encourage the Minister to accept them.</P>

      <P>It would appear from Senator Fitzgerald's contribution that he is a gamekeeper turned poacher.  Amendment No. 16 would provide that land vested in, or leased by, a local authority would vest in the Courts Service without any cost to the local authority.  It relates to land dealt with under the provisions of section 26(2)(b) of the Bill which covers land, or court buildings on that land, in mixed use &mdash; that is, used partly for purposes to which the functions of the service relate and partly for the purposes of the local authority.  Typically this means a council office which houses a court venue. <Col N="209" /> The policy underpinning the Bill in regard to court buildings is that they will be transferred from the Commissioners of Public Works or local authorities to the Courts Service under a vesting order to be made by the Minister.  That vesting order can be made on a building housing both local authority offices and a courtroom only with the consent of the commissioners or the local authority.  I hope this addresses the concern expressed by Senator Taylor-Quinn regarding the council chamber in Ennis which doubles as a court venue.</P>
      <P>It will be for the Minister and the local authority concerned in the context of this process of consultation to settle any cost issue which might arise in respect in the proposed vesting of a courtroom in such circumstances.  Where a central feature is the consent of the local authority, it would not be appropriate to include in the Bill a specific provision on costs.  These are matters proper to negotiations which would take place.  This Bill does not give the Minister power to vest premises where the consent of the authority is not forthcoming. This is important in addressing another concern expressed by Senators.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 appears to deal with a situation where the Courts Service has ceased using a court premises subsequent to that premises having been vested in the service.  I cannot rule out a court becoming unoccupied because a new replacement venue has been built.  The final details of the arrangements relating to the vesting of premises in the Courts Service will be dealt with in the context of the consultation procedures provided in the Bill.  The question of whether a premises will revert to a local authority if no longer required as a courthouse could be dealt with on an individual basis in the consultation process prior to its vesting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not all courthouses are vested in local authorities, although the amendments envisage all courthouses which have become redundant reverting to them.  It may be that during a period when a courthouse is vested in the service, much capital investment may be put into it.  It would seem inappropriate in such circumstances to provide <Col N="210" /> definitively that no cost should be incurred by a local authority on the reversion of the premises to it.</P>
    <P>Broader policy questions relating to the acquisition and disposal of courthouses which could not be appropriately addressed in the Bill will be considered by the Minister in the context of the strategic plans produced by the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>I hope this explains the situation.  There is no question of rule by diktat.  A consultation procedure is provided for and local authorities are treated fairly under the terms of the legislation. For those reasons I cannot accept the amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear the Minister has been sucked in by the Department.  In fairness to Senator Liam Fitzgerald, he can see what we are trying to do.  The amendments are simple and self-explanatory.  Under amendment No. 17 courthouses no longer required by the service revert to the local authority who can dispose of them.  There is no better organisation than a local authority to do this.  Locally elected people and the county manager can decide on the future use of a courthouse.</P>
      <P>Under amendment No. 16, there is no doubt the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have the upper hand in negotiations. It is closing the door when the horse has bolted. We will pass this legislation and then the Courts Service will consult with local authorities on a matter which is already decided.  There will be difficulties for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform trying to conclude the final handover of property following its vesting. Local authorities will rightly dig in their heels because they owned the property for many years.</P>
      <P>In such cases as the Ennis courthouse, will the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the local authorities be jointly responsible for the upkeep of the building?</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response. These are simple amendments which will safeguard properties which should revert to local authorities, to the benefit of the community.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, indicated last week that I wished to have time to consider for Report Stage the matter raised by the Senator's amendment.  The First Schedule sets out details of officers who will be transferred to the Courts Service on its establishment.  It includes every principal officer within the meaning of Part I of the Court and Court Officers Act, 1926.  I am advised that formula would include the Master of the High Court and to that extent the Senator's amendment would be redundant.</P>
      <P>However, in light of the amendments to the Bill agreed last week in regard to county registrars I am now satisfied that it is appropriate to amend the Bill in terms of the position of the Master of the High Court and the Taxing Masters.  The Master of the High Court has a wide quasi-judicial jurisdiction and Taxing Masters are concerned with the taxation of legal costs.  These are not functions for which the people involved could be expected to be responsible to the chief executive of the service.  The effect of my amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage was to exclude the quasi-judicial functions of county registrars from the remit of the Courts Service.  Accordingly, I find it no longer appropriate either to include the Master of the High Court or the Taxing Masters in the Schedule as members of the Courts Service.</P>
      <P>The effect of my amendment is that all the principal officers referred to in Part I of the Court Courts Service on its establishment day with the exception of the Master of the High Court and the Taxing Masters.  Senators may agree this exception is consistent with the overall purpose of the Bill and, in particular, with amendments already made relating to the position of county registrars under it.  I am indebted to Senator O'Meara for bringing the matter to my attention.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Senators for their contributions.  While we may not have agreed on every detail &mdash; and clearly we could not &mdash; significant changes have nonetheless been made to the legislation and it is better for that.  It is one of a number of Bills I have introduced in the Seanad in recent times and I look forward to progressing these and other measures in future with the co-operation of the House.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members will join with me in expressing appreciation to Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and the working group on the courts commission for their contribution in laying the groundwork for this landmark legislation.  Mrs. Justice Denham has been most co-operative, helpful and knowledgeable.  Senators have played their part in ensuring we will have a Courts Service which is well equipped and will respond effectively and efficiently to the demands which undoubtedly will be made of it as we face into the new millennium.  In particular, I thank the spokespersons and other Senators who contributed so forcefully and knowledgeably to the debate.</P>
      <P>The legislation has been improved as a result of its passage through the House and that is a tribute to Members.</P>

I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill in this House, making it more relevant in the process.  I also thank him for agreeing to a number of amendments tabled by the Opposition and for introducing others to accommodate concerns expressed during Second and Committee Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been much improved.  When the Minister brings it to the Lower House, he might consider further some of the amendments which he could not accept here.  He might like to remove a number of sections from the Schedule, particularly those relating to the division of the <Col N="214" /> circuits which should be a political rather than an administrative issue.  I hope the Courts Service will not decide on that in the future.  That aspect has not been fully addressed.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for their co-operation. The county registrars' association seems happier with the Bill as passed by this House than as initiated.  Officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform co-operated with the association and held a number of satisfactory meetings with them, and I thank the Minister for responding positively to the concerns the association outlined.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Senator O'Donovan, the Fianna Fáil Party spokesperson on this Bill, who cannot be here today, I compliment the Minister and his staff on the manner in which the Bill was introduced here.</P>
      <P>This is a radical reforming Bill.  It represents a legal milestone in the history of legislation, addressing problems in the courts.  There is no doubt that a new direction has been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Minister and others in commending Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  She produced four reports of her extensive investigations, research and review into the operations of the courts.  No doubt the fruits of her work, as borne out mainly in this legislation, will stand the testimony <Col N="215" /> of time as a radical and effective move in the reform of the courts, taking account of the modern needs of the speedy pursuit of justice into the next century.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Opposition spokespersons for the excellent debate.  Despite the elements of mirth, most of the debate was serious, well researched and informed and, despite the forcefulness and assiduousness of Opposition spokespersons and Senators, it was always constructive. That is a great tribute to all concerned.  I pay tribute to the Minister for the open manner in which he received all amendments, even though he could not accept many of them.  He was constructive in the way in which he approached amendments and careful to point out his reasons in detail when he was unable to accept amendments. He went out of his way to facilitate with his amendments, where that was needed.</P>
    <P>In complimenting Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, I am aware that she is also involved in drawing up a report on the drugs courts.  I am sure all sides of the House eagerly look forward to the publication of that report and to the Minister's response to it, where we, in turn, will have an opportunity to have our say.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for initiating this important landmark Bill in the Seanad.  It is a tremendous tribute to the Minister that the Seanad was honoured by its initiation here.  We look forward to many such Bills &mdash; tomorrow there will be another &mdash; where the Seanad is first to deliberate important justice, equality and law reform Bills.</P>

      <P>I would not call it a radical Bill by any means but it is sensible and necessary.  It is a common sense Bill and it is will make a major difference. The modernisation of the Courts Service is long overdue.</P>
      <P>In particular, I, like other Senators, thank the Minister for initiating the Bill in this House.  In so doing, he gives us an added relevance and continues the trend set by his predecessor in the then Department of Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor.  I was pleased to work with the Minister and to feel that we, on this side of the House, had made a contribution to improving the Bill.  I am sure that work will continue in the Lower House.

    <P>While the matters I want to refer to are critical in terms of what needs to be done, I cannot point the finger at the current Minister or his predecessors.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are now facing a crucial teacher shortage as a direct result of serious planning and strategy deficits.  Some 28 schools rang the INTO's Dublin office this morning seeking cover from trained substitute teachers &mdash; some for a period of a week or a fortnight and in some cases for maternity leave &mdash; but we could not find one trained teacher.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the only county where trained qualified teachers are now available for substitute work at primary level is Kerry, where there are approximately 60.  I had a meeting with those 60 people recently and they thought there should be a new set of rules for County Kerry.  I am not proposing that because I do not think the Minister would accept it.</P>
      <P>I have been dealing with this issue for eight years and I have been able to identify trends correctly. In 1989 I was able to identify the fact that we would run out of teachers in the early 1990s, which we did.  The Minister of the day had to increase the intake to teacher training colleges through graduate courses to meet the need, but we still have a huge problem.</P>
      <P>I would like to define where the problem lies. The motion states what I am trying to achieve, but if the Minister decided to concede immediately, I would have to say it could not be implemented because the teachers are not there. Consequently, the only outcome I am seeking is a commitment to do what the motion asks over a five year plan as well as increasing the intake to the colleges.  I accept this proposal will require the back up of the Government and the Department of Finance.  I am seeking the Minister's commitment to raise the matter at Government and national level.</P>
      <P>There are five reasons there is a problem with teacher numbers: the birth rate, the number of additional pupils coming back into the school system with immigrating parents, the huge number of teacher retirements over the next ten years, the growth in the economy and, consequently, better off people wanting to have more children, and the European factor.</P>
      <P>Today, the leader of one political party told me that since the birth rate has risen three years in a row one can no longer call it a blip, it is now a trend.  If the Minister looks at the 1990 report of the Primary Education Review Body he will see that his Department is working on the basis of an average birth rate of 46,000 in the 1996-2000 period. However, births exceeded 50,000 in 1996 and were over 53,000 last year, although we do not have the exact 1997 figures yet.  This year's figure will be the same or slightly up and there is no indication of any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the Minister's point of view that means that, on average, more than 5,000 additional <Col N="218" /> pupils will be coming into the schools when the children born in 1996 start coming into the system, that is, from the year 2000 onwards. However, because the upward trend began earlier than 1996 we are already feeling the effects.</P>
    <P>Some 5,000 extra pupils divided by the pupil-teacher ration of 22 or 23:1 means the Minister requires 200 additional teachers in the system this year just to stand still, without improving the worst class sizes in Europe and without providing an additional remedial teacher or teacher/counsellor for special education needs. While I accept the statistics are somewhat simplistic, they provide us with an indication of the problem.</P>
    <P>The second factor concerns immigrants &mdash; Irish people in the main.  Over the past five years, 35,000 children have come back into the education system, an average of 7,000 per year.  The figure is actually higher than that at the moment and it is growing.  Two-thirds of these children are entering the primary sector &mdash; that is another 5,000 &mdash; and no matter what the Minister does he cannot hold that position without additional teachers.  None of these figures is taken out of the air; they are factual and they must be faced.</P>
    <P>The retirement issue also presents a problem. In the early 1950s post-war colleges of education were reopening.  There was an investment in education stemming from the first and second national economic plans and we are reaping the benefit now.  The colleges expanded and teachers emerged.  Consequently, a huge number of teachers are now at retirement age.  I am talking about the compulsory retirement of people who cannot stay in the system beyond the years I have mentioned.  In 1994 the number of teachers retiring on compulsory grounds was 141.  While some might retire early, the figure is based on people staying on until retirement age.  That is the figure we have to go on because it gives us the picture. That figure will more than double this year to 295.  By the year 2010 525 teachers will be retiring annually.  This means the Minister will be short that number of teachers at that time.</P>
    <P>The fourth reason there is a problem with teacher numbers is that people are deciding to have more children because of the growth in the economy.  The fifth reason is the European factor. The fertility rate graph in every country in Europe shows a similar trend.  Births peaked in this country in 1980 &mdash; I assume it had something to do with the Pope's visit in 1979 &mdash; but it has gone down steadily since then.  I would like to bring the Pope back to help the situation.</P>
    <P>The introduction of contraception meant there was a rapid drop in the fertility rate in most European countries, particularly in northern and central Europe.  It dropped below what is called the replacement fertility rate of 2.1 &mdash; in other words, the number of children an average woman would need to have to ensure the population replaced itself.  As soon as it did, European countries started to adopt pro-natal policies.  The Government <Col N="219" /> is currently discussing maternity leave. There is up to 18 months maternity leave in certain areas in Scandinavia.  France also adopted pro-natal policies because it wanted more white babies, which was one of the worst reasons for doing so.  This led to a gradual increase in the birth rate.</P>
    <P>It took the three European Catholic countries &mdash; Italy, Spain and Ireland &mdash; some time to find out how it worked.  They were slow to go into a decline and they are coming out of it a little later. Although the birth rate has increased, it has been reinforced by remarriage, second relationships and economic factors.  There is no doubt that the figure will remain over 50,000 a year and that it will not drop to 40,000 in the next ten or 15 years.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be able to do what he has in good faith set out to do.  He will not be able to get the resources because there are not enough qualified teachers.  A remedial teacher in the Minister's own county is trying to cope with teaching in ten different primary schools in one week.  Others in single schools are trying to deal with up to 60 or 70 remedial pupils in a week.  The Minister has given a commitment to one teacher schools and to do something about the number of classes with over 30 pupils.  However, he cannot expand special education or help the disadvantaged without teachers.</P>
    <P>The Minister should provide an additional 800 places in the colleges of education.  If a graduate course started in the next couple of months, graduates would be ready to come on stream in September of next year.  If there were two graduate courses over the next two years and an additional intake to BEd courses in the colleges of education this year, there would be 800 graduates coming on stream three years in a row. Assuming that those numbers are enough to deal with the natural wastage from retirement, it would be possible to solve the substitute problem by setting up a substitute panel of approximately 850 teachers.  The Minister would also be able to reduce the largest class sizes in Europe by one per year over each of these years, which would solve the remedial problem.</P>
    <P>The Department will argue that it will take another 300 teachers to ensure there is enough remedial coverage nationwide, to which everyone in this House, including the Minister, is committed. However, it would take approximately 500 teachers to do that.  The Department's figure is based on the assumption that teachers will continue the nonsensical practice of covering ten schools in one week.  An additional number of teachers is needed to give a proper service which could be done in three years.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear coy because what I am asking for will be costly.  We need an extra 1,000 teachers to deal with class sizes, 500 teachers for remedial services, 850 substitute teachers, 400 teachers to act as administrative principals for smaller schools of 150 or more pupils, 800 or 900 <Col N="220" /> teachers for the disadvantaged and 500 teachers for special education.  I accept that is over 4,000 extra teachers at an additional cost to the Exchequer of £80 million a year, which is approximately 4 per cent of the total education budget.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister coming here tonight. This issue will continue to be raised.  We are doing research at present on its impact on the various areas I discussed and we will put that information together over the next couple of months. There is a huge problem at school level which must be addressed.  I recognise and accept that the Minister does not have the resources at present.  However, I hope he makes the hard decisions quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  I am nervous that if the number of national teachers keeps expanding at the rate Senator O'Toole cogently argued they must, it will not be long until the INTO will be looking for a second seat in the NUI constituency.  There will be so many teachers to vote for whoever Senator O'Toole casts his mantle on that the rest of us will feel even more threatened by him.</P>
      <P>Many academic commentators have tried to create a spurious competition between first, second and third level education and have in some cases mischievously used arguments about the <i>per capita</i> expenditure on primary, secondary and third level education to suggest that we need a redistribution of resources from one level of education to another when, in fact, we are still underspending.  It is not often a Minister for Education will get as many compliments in this House as the current office holder.  I accept his bona fides and the fact that he has done a considerable number of good things in his time.  However, a problem is emerging.  This is not one of the redistribution of resources within education but an ideological problem not in the Department but elsewhere.  I will not name it for a while as it has been named too often but it believes that public expenditure is a bad thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues raised in this motion are in that rare category of issues where two things of fundamental importance are dealt with at the same time. One is social justice and the other is economic performance.  While there are many who try to pretend that there is a tension between the two, particularly those of the low tax do not spend brigade who are represented by the minority party in Government, there are many who recognise that the only way our economy can perform successfully in the future is if we continue to invest in education.  If we abandon forever the notion of education as a social expenditure and a subsidy to the poor, education is the most productive investment this country has ever made and the empirical evidence is now overwhelming. Only the ideologically blinded can now discount the value of investing in education which involves <Col N="221" /> investment not just in plant and equipment but in the people who work in education.</P>
    <P>The observed value of that is that it produces a workforce that can respond flexibly and intelligently to the changes in trade and the world markets. The other value and the reason this motion serves two purposes is that to invest particularly in primary education is to invest dramatically and effectively in social equality.  There is no more effective route that I know to improving equality in society than investment in the type of things listed in this motion.</P>
    <P>There is a library full of research which indicates that these are measures which need to be introduced to promote social equality.  In the spirit of the times I have to declare an interest &mdash; all of my children went to schools which were classified as disadvantaged.  One is still in such a school and deservedly so because of the extraordinary social mix in the school.  These issues need to be addressed if we are to tackle the most scandalous form of social injustice in this country &mdash; child poverty.  Child poverty is measured in terms of income.  Under these terms, one quarter of our children live in poverty.  However, there is no hope of these children escaping from inequality when they enter an education system which is unsuited to their needs, where the deprivation which is already institutionalised before they enter primary school is confirmed by large classes, inadequate remedial education resources and the burden of multiple deprivation which poorly equipped, first level education involves.</P>
    <P>When it comes to second and third level education we run into the much talked about skills shortage.  This is because, potentially, 25 per cent of the population do not have the educational capacity to handle new technology and the new world.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister accepts that these are great ideas.  The peculiarly worded Government amendment accepts that these measures are necessary.  It is only a matter of words as to whether we call on the Government to introduce them or say please.  The real question is not whether we can afford to do this but whether we have the political will to do so.  This is no longer a poor country, it is not short of resources.  It is now making decisions as to how to allocate those resources.  If we can afford to change our capital gains tax to give one of our best known speculators a £600,000 gift because he sells his shares in Golden Vale, then we have the resources to look after our deprived children.  If it is a choice, it is not between third level and first level but between Dermot Desmond and the poor children of our society who deserve a decent start in education.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="222" /> the need to continue to invest in the primary education sector;</P>
    <P>that provision for children with special needs should be a particular priority; that policies should ensure that areas of significant disadvantage are targeted;</P>
    <P>that support is also needed for rural one-teacher schools;</P>
    <P>that these priorities form an integral part of the Government's Action Programme for the Millennium; and</P>
    <P>that the Government has allocated a 9 per cent increase in primary funding in the 1998 Estimates.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment seeks to focus attention on investment in primary education over the next five years; the targeting of special needs and the disadvantaged and the integrated plan for the next millennium.  I am here to defend the Minister.  It will be hard to do so after the statistics quoted by Senator O'Toole.  However, I will do my best.  The Minister has set out his plans.  He should be allowed the time to implement them during the next five years and deliver on the priorities specified by the Senator's motion.</P>
    <P>There is a 9 per cent increase in funding for the primary sector in the 1998 Estimates.  We should start on a positive note.  We have a quality education system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to tidy up areas where there are defects.  No system will ever be absolutely right.  The Minister's five points indicate how he will commit himself to identifying the priority areas and deliver on them over the next five years.  We must look at the issue of substitute teacher panels.  I spoke to a primary teacher who confirmed that there is a problem with finding substitute teachers.  If a teacher is out for three days the INTO cannot supply a replacement.  By the time a replacement is supplied the original teacher has returned.  There are weaknesses in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will agree with Senator O'Toole that there is a particular need for remedial and special needs teachers in schools.  He has committed himself to delivering on this issue.  One only has to look at the role played by a remedial teacher in a disadvantaged school.  I would be worried if we did not have a remedial teacher in every school.  From my own experience, no matter how socially secure the environment, at least 3 per cent of pupils in every class will need a remedial teacher.  We must define the word &ldquo;remedial&rdquo;.  It can mean a deficit in literacy and numeracy.  This could result from psychological, emotional or family problems.  The children might <Col N="223" /> be very bright but they have difficulties because of an emotional problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to introduce a national psychological service for schools.  If we tackle problems at source we will solve many of the problems which would otherwise have to be addressed at a later stage.  Every student should have access to a psychological service from the age of four.  This service should be brought to the school &mdash; the student should not be brought to a child guidance clinic in the Mater Hospital, Castleknock or wherever it may be.  Many parents and children fear moving away from the school and do not wish to go to a hospital.  The Minister has made a commitment on this issue.</P>
    <P>Special needs is an area of great concern to me. The Minister is aware of this as he has heard many Senators speaking on the issue.  Special needs students are not the same as those needing remedial education.  They are students with a learning deficit of some kind.  This may result from many background reasons.  They cannot be contained in a classroom but there is no place for them as schools do not have the necessary resources.  Remedial teachers can deal with remedial problems but they cannot provide the one to one attention which special needs children require.  If these children are to be integrated into a normal school there must be a resource teacher available to move between a number of schools. This is not available at present so special needs students do not have the education suitable to their needs as do other children.  I am concerned that we tackle the areas of remedial and special needs teachers.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the pilot programme called Breaking the Cycle.  It is a very worthwhile project and I would like to see it extended.  I know the Minister has already referred to it and made a commitment to the project.  This scheme brings the schools into the community and the community into the school.  It is not one dimensional thinking in our learning.  It embraces the parents, the home-school link, the community at large and all the voluntary agencies and sees how best we can dovetail those at four years of age, where the kernel of the problem is.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the key areas.  I would welcome the commitment to implement a national psychological service.  I welcome the Minister's commitment that he will look at Breaking the Cycle and the terms of reference and criteria used for assessing schools.  He also said he will look at targeting the remedial service and the special schools for those who are not catered for under the remedial service.</P>
    <P>I am unconvinced by Senator O'Toole's argument that there are not enough teachers, perhaps he is right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <P>First, my job is not to defend Senator O'Toole but it is unfair to say he made an attack on the Minister because I thought he was being helpful.  I would have thought that in Senator O'Toole's other role as a representative of the INTO his job would have been cut-throat and demanding but instead he was restrained and realistic.  He did not apportion blame to anybody which shows how fair he was.  In fact the only threat came from Senator Ryan when he implied there was a possibility of a second Senator O'Toole if the numbers of teachers increased. That would be a spectre we would not like to see here, but that is not my own view.  I think he has a wonderful contribution to make and he did so by outlining the statistics here.  The statistics speak for themselves and the Minister would accept there is a shortage of teachers.  The Minister does not have to defend his position because he has inherited it but he must state what he is going to do about it.</P>
      <P>The imagery I got when the previous speakers were making their contributions was that of a duck in a very fast stream.  The duck appears to be standing still but under the water his legs are going like heck.  In this case, particularly at primary level, that duck is slipping a bit downstream. It is going to demand not just the Department of Education and Science but, as Senator O'Toole referred to, the Department of Finance will have to recognise they have to make a contribution. The expression that investment in education is an investment in the future has been bandied about and perhaps sullied at times.  But if that contribution is up to £80 million then in the current economic boom it would be an investment.</P>
      <P>The truth of the matter is that young people are left out of the education system through the lack of a remedial service.  This is caused by a variety of reasons some of which have been mentioned by Senator Ormonde.  For example, I know of a case where a young man with bad sight in one eye did not reveal his disability because he did not want to be called names.  He cheated on his eye test and slipped through the system for a year.  He then had to catch up and would demand remedial teaching.  Others come from broken homes and there are a variety of reasons for slowness and late starters.  If these young people are left out of the system it is so much harder for them to catch up.  They can make a contribution in the future if they are given an opportunity now but that opportunity will not be there unless we make a decision to invest in their future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the frightening 1992 OECD statistics on the pupil teacher ratio.  Ireland's <Col N="225" /> pupil teacher ratio at primary level is the second highest in the OECD.  Ireland with 25.8 pupils per teacher is second only to Turkey at 29.4 pupils per teacher.  Italy is as low as 10.5 and Belgium had 13 pupils per teacher.  It would be unrealistic to aim for the 17.4 average in just one year. Again, I compliment Senator O'Toole for suggesting to the Minister not to do it overnight.  We do not expect him to do it overnight.  But giving five years might be a bit too lenient compared to what I would suggest from this side of the House. I would like to hear a timescale in which these trends can be reversed.</P>
    <P>This motion is like a scattergun and hits a number of issues.  In the short time allocated to us I would like to mention one aspect of it.  As Senator Ormonde already mentioned, one of the difficulties the Minister has is the idea of clustering schools together for remedial teachers. This would be difficult because of the geographical spread and it would be nearly impossible to get it right.  I am not sure what the answer is. Obviously the simplest answer would be more remedial teachers but clustering is not going to be easy.  The Minister might refer to the Australian programme called Reading Recovery when he responds.  It is a remedial programme intended to give an intense teaching period of between 16 and 20 weeks.  It affords a student who had fallen behind an opportunity to catch up at an earlier stage.  As I said earlier, the longer student are left behind the more difficult it is for them to catch up.  This programme would also give flexibility in distributing remedial teachers as they would only have to stay in one place for up to 22 weeks.  The programme appears to have vastly improved the students' ability to catch up rather than meet more long term aims.</P>
    <P>Again, I fully support Senator O'Toole's request to the Minister to give a reasonable timescale for improving the pupil-teacher ratio. Senator Ryan referred to social justice.  We all recognise these are the people who need it most. We are their guardians and must protect them.  I thank the Minister for being present.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion before the House this evening.  It gives an opportunity to debate the education issue again.  There is no fairminded person in this House not concerned with the idea that we would not put and keep in place the best possible education system.  Having said that, I am more confident now than I have been about the future of education here.  This Minister is infinitely more interested in approaching every issue from the educational standpoint rather than an ideological one and I feel education is in good hands.  I am particularly pleased that plans put in place by the last Government to pump scarce money and badly needed money into administration have been scrapped so that the limited moneys we have can be put into the classroom and into areas with the greatest need.  That was the correct decision to make and I applaud it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="226" /> I am very encouraged by the emphasis that is put on primary and pre-school education in the joint programme for Government.  That is where we have to put our resources.  If we do not put a sufficient amount of sources into this sector what we do from there on in is not going to give a fair chance and decent start in life to all of our children. If fair play is our motto we have to put additional and well targeted resources into primary and pre-school education.  I am also pleased to see an increase of 9 per cent in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>We must give every child a proper educational foundation at primary level.  I agree that a substantial number of new teachers is required as is a significant number of special subject teachers.  I am not satisfied there is a sufficient level of teaching of music, art or physical education in our schools and that must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole pointed out that some 900 schools do not have access to remedial education of any kind and that is not acceptable.  Even schools which officially have access to remedial education do not have sufficient time for it.  My sister is a primary school teacher and tells me that children with severe reading difficulties only have access to one hour of remedial education per week which is insufficient.  If young people do not master the art of reading in primary school, they are permanently condemned to be part of the underclasses.  Even where schools are seen to have access to remedial education, a thorough investigation must be carried out as to the extent of that provision to see where it can be improved upon.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the 20,000 young people who drop out of education every year without completing the second level cycle.  I am even more concerned about the children at primary school level who are not attending school in any kind of a structured way.  I would ask the Minister to put in place a tracking system for these young people as a matter of priority.  If they do not attend primary school, they will never reach second level.  We track cattle and tag their ears for very good reasons.  I am not suggesting we should tag children's ears but it is sad that no proper tracking system is in place to trace young people who are not attending school but are instead mitching or playing truant.  That problem must be rectified.</P>
    <P>Educational deficits are very often marked by a series of social deficits in the home and community. As a starting point a system must be put in place which would ensure that all young people attend primary school and complete their primary school education.  That should be the Minister's first objective.  What hope have these young people if they drop out of education at seven, eight, nine or ten years of age?  They will be condemned to a life on the streets.  A tracking system would involve targeting particular areas and targeting interdepartmental and multifaceted resources to reach out to these young people and <Col N="227" /> provide them with a system of education which is meaningful to them and will ensure their attendance at primary school.  If that can be done at pre-school and primary school level, the hardship experienced at second level will be halved.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the 20,000 young people who drop out of secondary education without sitting the final State exam.  A report carried out by the NESF on youth unemployment contained a very strong recommendation that the Government should put in place a system of education welfare officers.  That is something which the Minister should try out on a pilot basis to ascertain if it would interest young people and their parents in education.  The system in place at the moment is patently not working.  Perhaps a system of education welfare officers would garner these young people into the educational system and provide them with the kind of education which would sufficiently interest them in continuing their schooling.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Breaking the Cycle scheme.  I compliment the Minister on extending it to a school in Knocknaheeny in my constituency. The previous Government's failure to extend the scheme to Knocknaheeny broke my heart.  I argued for its extension week after week although it did not result in my getting any extra votes in the election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of schools in my own area which were crying out for additional teachers and which have received them under this Administration.  Where the issue of education is concerned I never have sufficient time to speak but I want to make a particular plea to the Minister this evening.  We need more teachers but those teachers must be specifically trained in a number of new skills to meet newly emerging situations in the classroom.  Those new situations are arising out of a host of social problems which did not exist when I began my career as a teacher. A substantial number of remedial teachers must also be provided.  More than anything else, we must reach out to young children and make primary school meaningful to every young person in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a 99 per cent attendance level at primary school can be achieved during the Minister's term of office, he will have earned his place in history. I am not a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, nor do I intend to be in the future, but in the past some of our outstanding Ministers of Education came from that party, namely, George Colley, Dr. Hillery and Donagh O'Malley.  These were people of great vision who did new and creative things in the area of education.  We want more teachers but their skills, training and qualifications must be properly targeted.  We cannot <Col N="228" /> have too many primary or secondary school teachers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  As a doctor, I frequently see the needs of children with disabilities and it is an issue close to my heart.  I am sure the Minister has read the report of The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. It is interesting to note that the section on education is one of the largest.  Once a child is born and diagnosed as having some special need, its family is in a continuous battle to overcome barriers in every aspect of its life.  All parents want their children to participate to the greatest possible extent in every aspect of life and education is an area they naturally focus on.  If at all possible parents want their children to be part of the general Irish education system and I am sure the vast majority of us would like to encourage that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Ombudsman's findings that the efforts of a family which sought to prove its child's entitlement to public transport to and from a national school have proved successful.  A recommendation has been made for the Minister to publish a schools transport scheme which would particularly focus on the needs of people with disabilities.  The child in the case in question was not in a position to avail of free school transport as the child was confined to a wheelchair. The nearest collection point was two miles from the family home and the family was not in a position to hire a taxi to bring the child to it.  The Ombudsman found that the necessary subvention should have been given to the family and awarded it retrospectively for two years.  I welcome that.  I also welcome the Ombudsman's finding that if a family provides its own transport for someone who is so severely disabled they cannot gain access to public transport, they should be recompensed at the same rate as civil servants are when they use their own transport.  Such a positive statement regarding the integration of people with special needs into the education system is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Rural Ireland has particular problems because there are fewer special schools for the child to attend.  Unless the child becomes a boarder, it is essential for parents, management of local schools and teachers to come to some compromise as to how the child's best interests can be served within the general State system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that from the time the child is born and it becomes obvious there is something wrong with him or her, the State expects the carers or parents to initiate or instigate everything, rather than some facility being readily available within the State services for them to apply to or to take up.  I have had to deal with too many people who have been dealt with in a &ldquo;pass the parcel&rdquo; fashion where the problems of their child were sent from one Department or one section of a local authority to another.  I am sure other <Col N="229" /> Senators have had experience of similar problems.</P>
    <P>When we speak of making education facilities available &mdash; in this case I am referring to primary schools &mdash; and making them accessible to children with disabilities, it does not just mean making the school accessible to wheelchairs.  It must be remembered that the child must get as far as the school gates so that they can enter in their wheelchairs.  It is important this be examined because the physical aspect of getting a child to school can be greatly underestimated.</P>
    <P>When children get to school, there is a great lack of appropriate equipment, even suitable desks on which children in wheelchairs can operate. It is unfortunate schools seem to be left to themselves to obtain this additional equipment. This is also an area I would like addressed.</P>
    <P>The training of teachers to deal with special difficulties has been greatly improved but it is not fully understood how important classroom assistants are.  Many teachers with whom I have spoken said there are many good and reliable FÁS trainees who act as classroom assistants, but these are withdrawn after a certain length of time when their tenure is over.  Teachers are frequently left unattended or with someone less able to do the job.  Only a small number of classroom assistants is employed by the State, so this should be examined to try to increase the number, especially in areas where children with special needs have be to be integrated.</P>
    <P>Another area of schooling of which little is said is the speech therapy service.  It is very important because primary school teachers cannot be expected to deal with speech disabilities.  A child may be of normal intelligence but may not grow to use their full capability because they are not as intelligible as they should be.  Speech therapy services must be brought to the forefront of primary education as a matter of urgency.  There is no point expecting a child and its parents with no access to facilities to remedy the situation.  It requires much care and attention.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous that so many facilities are withdrawn from a child based on its chronological age rather than considering its mental age.  We need to be very careful about this because one 11 year old can do things another cannot.  We are not in a position to discard children just because we believe they do not measure up to the chronological measurement we have for them.  I would also like to see that addressed.</P>
    <P>Children with autism and Down's Syndrome have an enormous amount of special needs in primary schools but they may benefit enormously from them.  A person who has taught many children with Down's Syndrome told me &mdash; I do not know if Senator O'Toole or any others who have taught in primary schools would agree with this &mdash; that Down's Syndrome children do very well with reading and writing but seem to run into problems with mathematics.  I do not know whether it is better to try to improve the mathematical <Col N="230" /> side or concentrate on their abilities in reading and writing.  We must prioritise nonetheless. I am always fascinated when people tell me about children with Down's Syndrome who are educated well enough to be employed in the workforce.  It is important we recognise that these are people with definite levels of ability which can be used by and integrated with society so that they can become useful and happy members of it.</P>
    <P>The level at which we supply assistance to parents with children with special needs who may want to or may have to work is pathetic.  Any woman who has a child with a special education need had better understand that, unless they are well off, she will be expected to give up whatever job she has because all the care outside school hours must be given by her.  One or other parent will be expected to be at home and it will usually be the mother.  I do not want teachers to think they are perceived as respite care for parents. However, they are an important part of other people participating in the upbringing of these children.  To a large extent, they are the only part.</P>
    <P>If the needs of people with disability, major or minor, within the education service are not dealt with at primary level, dealing with it at secondary level can be forgotten about.  If they are not capable of becoming usefully involved at the primary level of the system, they will not be capable of progressing to further education.</P>
    <P>I welcome all efforts made on the continuing education of children in hospital.  This is a most important area highlighted by the Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital about 20 years ago.  It is terrible to see children who become long stay patients in hospital fall behind in their education, although it happens less than before.  The amount of work done by teachers in the hospital goes unrewarded, but I hope it is at least recognised by us tonight.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the Minister is doing a fine job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report issued in 1993 by the special education review committee suggested that 11 to 12 per cent of pupils received some degree of remedial support with the ratio being three boys to two girls.  Many teachers estimate that up to 15 per cent of pupils are in need of remedial assistance. The majority of primary schools currently have access to a remedial teacher.  Any difficulty is due to demography.  In some cases a remedial teacher is shared between a number of schools. There are many cases of remedial teachers serving the needs of three to five schools and a few <Col N="231" /> cases of them serving up to seven.  One anecdotal account of which I know concerned one teacher in the west serving 11 schools, but I am sure that has changed since the Minister took office and is long since history.</P>
    <P>The special education review committee in 1993 also suggested 77 per cent of the pupil population in 1,700 primary schools had remedial services out of 3,207 at the time.  It suggested that many small schools unfortunately still did not have a service. If remedial teaching infers remedial teachers spend some time on a regular basis teaching students with special education needs, then the appointments system should be examined.  No remedial teacher should have to spend more than a minimum specified time travelling between schools.  Remedial teachers should be appointed to serve an agreed maximum number of schools. It would be great &mdash; although Utopian &mdash; to have one remedial teacher for every school.  Realistically there should be a remedial teacher to a maximum of two to three schools.  A maximum case load should also be designed.  The Minister has done very positive things in this area and the quietness of teachers, including remedial teachers, in a positive sign.</P>
    <P>At present some teachers are assigned to three or more schools.  If this is so, it changes the meaning of remedial teaching to one which is closer to resource teaching.  These teachers can only give support and advice to class teachers.</P>
    <P>The provision of remedial teachers in post primary schools is relatively new and is to be welcomed. Previously, many pupils with special educational needs which were catered for in the primary sector were not receiving such assistance in the post primary.  The situation has now improved dramatically.  Remedial teachers in second level only devote a variable number of hours to remedial teaching.  There is evidence to suggest that in some schools remedial hours are often diverted to subject teaching and, in some instances, to cover absenteeism.  Schools in which this is highlighted should be called to book as hours allocated for remedial work should be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>We are aware that not all schools have a remedial service.  We are pursuing the correct path in the work being done in this regard.  The situation in small schools and those in sparsely populated areas should be addressed as a matter of priority.  The more specialised training needs of remedial teachers outside the Dublin area should also be considered.  The discussion on technology which we had before the recess suggested that great strides are being made in the context of grants for equipment, which is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>In addition to remedial teachers, there will continue to be a need for resource teachers catering for pupils not catered for in the context of remedial work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The second part of the motion refers to EU norms.  As far as I can ascertain, there is no European norm.  In the UK, for example, excluding Scotland, which has a separate Education Act, legislation provides many legal directives for the education of pupils with special education needs. There is a statement of needs for such students which outlines their entitlement to the relevant teaching resources, equipment, support provisions, etc.  Countries vary in the degree to which they support an inclusive or segregated system of education.  Italy, for example, claims to have a near 100 per cent integrated system with almost all special education need pupils being included in mainstream schools.  On the other hand, Holland still supports a wide range of special schools with provision for a variety of categories of special education needs for pupils.</P>
    <P>Special needs provisions should be realised through their incorporation into existing and future school provisions from pre-school through third level and continuing education.  An important aspect of educational support for pupils with special needs is access to an appropriate curriculum regardless of the type of school they attend.  The issue is currently being addressed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which has been mandated by the Department of Education and Science to produce curricula for various categories of special needs pupils.  These curricula are being developed in consultation with many groups involved in special education as well as persons skilled in curriculum development.  The curriculum guidelines will eventually be brought before the Minister for approval and implementation.  Some measures are already in place to support the effective education of pupils with special needs in a variety of school settings.</P>
    <P>Breaking the Cycle should be immediately evaluated, and modified if necessary, and subsequently extended to include all schools designated as disadvantaged.  This has long term implications for pupils in such schools and money spent at this level will result in financial savings later on.  There is a European average regarding class sizes, but it means nothing because the systems and legislation are different.  However, account could be taken of the inclusion of special need pupils into classes when calculating the maximum class size.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to calculate the need for supply teachers, but funding is one area which would cause major hassle.  There is also the availability of qualified teachers, particularly in certain rural areas: it may not be possible to keep a panel teacher living in Donegal who is called to Galway for too long.  There is a shortage of teachers in many areas for certain subjects.  The increased birth rate is currently being documented to allow estimates of pupil numbers entering school to be forecast.  Account must be taken of the implications of decisions made on the expansion of the remedial teachers service and any changes in the <Col N="233" /> level of educational support and provision for special education needs pupils in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the motion.  It is not possible to sufficiently highlight the needs of people with special educational needs.  With the Minister at the helm I have no doubt that the situation will improve and I thank him for his contribution to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil as ucht an rúin.  Tugann sé seans dom an cheist thábhachtach seo de bhun oideachais a phlé libh.</P>
      <P>I welcome the varied contributions and am extremely heartened by the concentration on special needs and disadvantage.  The collective consensus emerging from the contributions is that people are extremely anxious that we target resources in the direction of special needs children and children from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
      <P>The quality of our primary education has provided one of the key pillars on which our education system has supported the development of our country.  As I said during the debate on the Education Bill in the Dáil last week, we have much to be proud of but have much more to do. Both in the area of basic mainstream primary and special needs provision, there are a range of existing and developing demands which are not currently being met and which need action.</P>
      <P>I wish to outline to the House the various ways in which we need to prioritise issues at primary level.  I also wish to outline some of the ways in which we have begun to move towards meeting our objective.  This latter point is crucial, because it is simply not accurate to say there is no positive movement on the points raised in the motion.</P>
      <P>In its programme the Government has specifically recognised the need to address the funding of primary education.  This relates to general funding and the specific issues of special needs provision and the unique educational disadvantage faced in certain one teacher schools.  We have already begun to make a significant move towards fulfilling these commitments.</P>
      <P>Primary education funding is increasing by 9 per cent in the 1998 Estimates, twice the level of increase in overall Government current expenditure. Some people have commented on the fact that this increase is largely based on payroll costs. I have no difficulty with investing in the quality of our teachers and that the product of their teaching aptly justifies the fact that we reward our teachers more than most OECD countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also made moves in a number of other areas.  These include a 40 per cent increase in capital funding over the 1997 allocation.  The allocation is £40 million this year compared with the 1997 provision of £27 million.  We have provided for the introduction of one of the most ambitious schools information technology schemes in the world, at a cost of almost £40 million to the Exchequer over the next three years.  Of that £40 million, £25 million is capital funding and £15 <Col N="234" /> million is current funding.  There is additional funding of £10 million from Telecom Éireann and other companies are expected to get involved. There has also been a significant increase in funds for school books schemes and a new, albeit small, scheme has been introduced to provide funds to schools to develop their school libraries.</P>
    <P>There has been provision for a £5 increase in the capitation fee for schools.  At 11 per cent, this increase represents a start in the process of increasing capitation grants.  We recognise the need to move capitation to a more equitable level <i>vis-á-vis</i> second level, but it is important to note that the second level figure includes a number of items which are paid for through other means in the primary system.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House concentrates on the staffing issues relating to primary education and I am glad to have this opportunity to outline my attitude to dealing with these areas.  In 1988, the then Minister for Education, my party colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, initiated the policy of retaining teachers who had been freed by falling numbers in primary schools as a result of demographic decline.  This policy, known as retaining the demographic dividend, has continued and has led to significant improvements throughout the system.  Improvements have been particularly evident in the overall pupil/teacher ratio and in special needs provision.</P>
    <P>In advance of the last general election, the INTO asked all political parties if they were committed to retaining the demographic dividend. Our response, together with that of our partners the Progressive Democrats, was that we would retain our commitment to using these posts to improve the quality of education.  The Taoiseach and I repeated this at a meeting with the INTO before the election.  This remains the case.</P>
    <P>The motion overlaps in many ways with the points included in a press release issued yesterday and I wish to address those points.  In previous years, discussions between my Department and the INTO about staffing issues in the coming school year tended to begin late in the year.  Last year, for example, these discussions did not begin until after the Easter conferences.  Indeed, it was only on the eve of the conference that my predecessor agreed that the dividend would be retained within the system.  As a result, I had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate late last year to cover the cost of the additional posts.</P>
    <P>This year's process began last month when officials from the INTO were facilitated by the primary administration section of my Department in examining staffing profiles for next year.  Fuller discussions commenced last week when officials from the Department met Senator O'Toole and other representatives of the INTO.  At that meeting, my commitment to introducing further improvements in the areas mentioned in this motion was made clear.  In particular, my intention to target additional teacher posts at children <Col N="235" /> with special needs and one teacher schools was outlined.</P>
    <P>This approach to consultation reflects the partnership approach which is central to progress in the education area.  I accord great importance to this approach and wish to work with the partners in education in developing the primary sector in a way which reflects our shared goals.</P>
    <P>The overall pupil-teacher ratio in our primary system is currently 21.7:1. This has declined steadily over recent years from 25.2:1 and will decline further next year, on current projections, to roughly 21.2:1. This is a welcome move which is making a significant contribution to the quality of education.  While there are 1,242 remedial teachers in our primary schools, there remain 758 schools without a remedial service.  I am aware of this deficiency and am committed to moving towards a situation where all schools have access to a remedial service.  That does not simply mean allocating a teacher to five or ten schools, as has been the practice to date.  Ideally the ratio should be a realistic one of one teacher to between one and three schools, depending on the geographical and logistical considerations of an area.</P>
    <P>Yesterday's press release from the INTO claims there is &ldquo;little or no evidence&rdquo; that the recommendations of the special education review committee are being implemented.  I wish to correct this inaccurate statement.  The SERC report pointed to the need to reach specific levels of PTR in 13 categories of special schools and special classes.  This year, the targets will be fulfilled in nine of these categories and the remaining four categories are either one or two short of the targets.  All the targets will be met during my period of office.</P>
    <P>Other moves have been made on the recommendations in the report, including the provision of resource teachers.  There are approximately 76 resource teachers and more are required.  I accept the points made by Senator Kett and Senator Henry with regard to special needs children.  I will be happy to discuss them further with the Senators particularly with regard to classroom assistants, the integration of children with special needs in mainstream education, ensuring that physical access is no longer a difficulty and the aids and equipment that must be made available to such children.</P>
    <P>Before Christmas, the Department cleared the backlog for all children within mainstream primary education who were waiting for computers and other aids.  It received an additional £100,000 from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs and with £400,000 of its own budget it managed to clear the logjam at primary level.  Children should not have to wait inordinate lengths of time for something that is basic to their capacity to learn.  We are determined to improve in that area of provision.  The Department will also progressively increase the number of remedial teachers in the system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> The challenge of properly targeting resources on disadvantaged schools is one of the most important issues of public policy today.  There is little doubt that the traditional model of targeting is not effective enough, a fact recognised by both the Combat Poverty Agency and the Educational Research Centre in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. The ERC recommended a move away from general schemes towards greater targeting. At present, 17 per cent of pupils and 16 per cent of schools are designated as disadvantaged and receive additional supports.  A pilot project, Breaking the Cycle, is currently operating with distinct urban and rural dimensions.</P>
    <P>The focus which has been put solely on the reduction in PTR in the urban dimension of the pilot project misses the broader issues.  There is more to be considered which relates to how schools plan to meet their needs, how they interact with the community and how they apply extra resources in a focused and productive way.  The home/school/community liaison scheme is also making a valuable contribution which should be encouraged and expanded.</P>
    <P>Any debate on tackling disadvantage, if it is to be constructive and move away from a one-dimensional approach, must take these wider issues into account.  There must be a multi-input approach to disadvantaged schools.  Disadvantaged children should have access to psychological, remedial and home/school/community input and there must be a more integrated response than simply to allocate an extra number of teachers to the school.  There are other ways of tackling the problems of disadvantaged children. I met a number of representatives of area partnerships who are assisting schools in their areas. They have developed integrated models and they are worth expanding further in terms of how the system helps and assists disadvantaged schools.</P>
    <P>A particular form of educational disadvantage can often be experienced in schools with only one teacher.  These schools are principally located in rural areas with declining populations.  The need to address the isolation felt by both teachers and pupils in these schools has been recognised by many groups, including the INTO, and the Programme for Government commits the Government to providing a second teacher for one teacher schools with more than ten pupils.</P>
    <P>The lack of a proper psychological service is clear and the Government is committed to establishing a national schools education psychological service.  The planning for the service is at an advanced stage.  It is being carried out by the working group I established shortly after I was appointed.  The group includes people from both the health and education sectors to ensure there is a coherent education psychological service.  We do not want to improve one arm of the service at the expense of the other.  In the meantime, an additional 15 psychologists are being appointed to enhance the service. <Col N="237" /> Senator O'Toole has made a number of comments on demographic issues which are incorrect. My Department uses demographic projections which are continually updated in conjunction with the Central Statistics Office.  We have consistently made it clear we are not projecting on the basis of an outdated figure of 46,000 births per year, as is claimed in yesterday's press release.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the figures myself. I am bamboozled by figures from the departmental statistician for primary, second and third levels. I worry about statistics generally because, ten years on, all the projections do not materialise. One interesting statistic was the 1980 projection for the White Paper on Education where the figure for participation was out by around 30,000. My statistician, whose office is understaffed, had it almost correct for 1997.  Her projection of the birth rate for 1997, working on an assumption of at least 51,100, was based on the three quarterly returns and the final figures for 1997 which we are yet to receive.  At the minimum the figure will be 51,900.  The Department is not totally out of step with what is happening in terms of the birth rate.  I accept the Senator's rationale.  He has his ear to the ground as regards what is happening in the maternity hospitals.  He has a commendable channel of information.  I emphasise we are not working with a projection of 46,000; we are updating constantly and when making a projection for 1998 we will update the 1997 figures.</P>
      <P>The projections also include an up to date estimate of immigration.  For the information of the House, despite the fact that since 1995 the birth rate has risen, which will manifest itself in enrolments in 1999 and beyond, this year there are 11,000 fewer pupils in our primary schools than last year &mdash; that is still the demographic reality &mdash; and the decline next year is projected at almost 12,000.  The increased birth rate is essentially arresting the decline which was pronounced from the 1990s onward.  Over the medium term, until 2005, we will be witnessing a significant arrest of a one way trend in the demographic decline. There will still be reduced enrolments over the next ten years.  Much will depend on people returning to the country because of economic growth and there is evidence people are returning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are committed to an intervention scheme for children aged eight to 15.  The European Commission has been helpful with the funding for the scheme &mdash; it will be a £3 million project.  To <Col N="238" /> take up Senator Quill's point, we intend to introduce a tracking system as part of that eight to 15 pilot project.  It is extraordinary that we do not have a tracking system for primary school children. We do not know where every child in the system is at present.  The ESRI estimate that 1,000 children are not moving from primary to second level is unacceptable.  It must be a fundamental objective of the Department that we deal with that and that every child, through innovative programmes, can at least complete primary level and ultimately second level, this is our target.  It is our intention through the eight to 15 pilot project to introduce such a tracking system for every child in the country.  The system would also enable us to follow the child's behaviour pattern and academic performance to ensure we can identify early the children who are at risk of leaving school early.</P>
    <P>We should maintain a proper supply of qualified teachers.  The supply of teachers has reduced in recent years due to a number of factors. Around 900 teachers are availing of career breaks and job sharing schemes.  The introduction of an early retirement package and availing of the opportunity to retire after 35 years service have also lead to outflows of teachers.  Recognising this I authorised an increased intake into our teacher training colleges of 200 students per year last summer.  Another significant move was my decision to remove the Irish language requirement for teachers in special schools and classes. These developments will ensure an improved supply of teachers.  We are also examining a graduate conversion course.  If I have taken on board one message from the debate, it is the need for more student teacher places within the colleges. Any place available within the teaching colleges will be used.</P>

      <P>I have been to Mary Immaculate College recently.  The director there is very undemanding but she has made tremendous progress with the Department and myself.  We must increase the number of places in the teacher training colleges but, as Senator Quill said, we need to look at the whole area of primary teaching: the primary curriculum, new education developments and special needs.  The new pre-service programmes should examine special needs and incorporate related modules.  We are looking at a general review of the primary teacher training colleges and their programmes.  The colleges have approached the Department about certain issues such as course duration and content.  It is time for a fundamental review of training in tandem with the expansion of the number of places available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to the supply panel scheme, I am glad to be able to inform this House that an excellent scheme has been developed to assist in the provision of short-term substitute cover at primary <Col N="239" /> school level.  The scheme, which operated initially on a pilot basis, was developed into a permanent scheme from 1 November 1997 and has been extended to 11 new locations throughout the country.  I recognise the success of the scheme and the work put into its development by both my Department and the lNTO.  Its extension can, of course, only be provided for in the context of general resources.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed primarily to provide substitute cover for permanent and temporary teachers who are absent on short-term certified sick leave.  The scheme operates on the basis of a host school employing permanent teachers to perform substitute cover for a range of schools within close proximity of the host school.  The host school is responsible for the overall management of the supply scheme within its designated area, including the allocation of the supply teachers to schools requesting substitute cover.</P>
    <P>The approach I have outlined concerning the retention of teachers within the system will mean that a large number of teaching posts will be retained in 1998.  This represents a very significant financial allocation and honours the commitment we made before the last election.  The demand in yesterday's press release, and rearticulated tonight, for an additional 4,200 teaching posts represents an entirely new approach.  These new posts would entail an additional cost of in the region of £105 million per year, £25 million more than Senator O'Toole's estimate.  It is highly unlikely that any government would be in a position to accept this demand.</P>
    <P>In the spirit of partnership we are willing to discuss and advance these issues with the partners in education.  Education policy will benefit from the contributions of this House and Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>As I said at the start the Government is committed to demonstrating a real commitment to primary education.  I believe we have already begun to deliver on this through the 9 per cent increase in primary funding included in this year' s Estimate.  There is much more to do and we are intent on doing it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Education, Ms Bhreathnach, recognised that a large number of students in the senior cycle of second level schools were unable to cope with the traditional leaving certificate.  I am not a member of the Labour Party but I must commend Ms Bhreathnach as a Minister of great vision.  I do not mean this as a slight on the present Minister for Education and Science.  Because the former Minister recognised the fact that second level students had learning difficulties the Department, with the co-operation <Col N="240" /> of Senator Fergal Quinn, designed the new leaving certificate applied syllabus which we all welcome.  Had intervention been made earlier, however, and a remedial service provided in primary and secondary schools many students who are now pursuing the leaving certificate applied course would have been able to pursue the leaving certificate vocational programme or the traditional leaving certificate.  I do not cast a reflection on the leaving certificate applied course which has an intrinsic value, and much credit is due to the former Minister and to Senator Quin.</P>
    <P>Every student who has a learning difficulty, whether attending a big or small school, should have access to a remedial teacher.  In a rural area a remedial teacher could be appointed to a cluster of small schools.  I see this system working fairly and succesfully in the parish of Lackagh about ten miles from Galway where we have four schools and one remedial teacher.  Similar arrangements are working in many other areas. This scheme could also be provided for second level schools where a school is not large enough to justify a whole-time appointment.  I would like to see the Minister review the matter, identify the students who are in need of remedial education and seek the necessary funds to make such appointments to these schools.</P>
    <P>While some progress has been made with regard to the reduction of class sizes we have a long way to go.  In rural areas teachers often have to teach two or three classes in the same room. These teachers cannot provide the best education. Such schools should have a more favourable teacher allocation.  Large schools experience problems of a different kind.  These problems can also be helped by the allocation of extra teachers.</P>
    <P>Demographers have been telling us for many years that our primary school population is in decline.  Senator O'Toole has elaborated on the view of the demographers.  The Celtic tiger has reversed this decline somewhat.  There is evidence to suggest that the primary school intake will, from now on, be increasing.  In Galway the population has increased by 7 per cent in recent times with consequent implications for school attendance. It is important that the Minister ensures that sufficient primary teachers are provided to meet this growing demand.  I was sad to read in todays <i>Irish Independent</i> that there is a scarcity of primary teachers.  We have been described as the island of saints and scholars.  We do not produce as many saints as we used to but there is no reason we should not produce more teachers. We have the greatest teachers in the world and it would be regrettable if this State diminished the number of teachers.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that teaching is a very stressful occupation.  It is not surprising that many teachers miss work regularly through illness.  It is important that we have an adequate substitute panel.  Students get only one chance to receive an education and it is encumbent on the Minister for Education and Science to support students and <Col N="241" /> parents.  I look forward to debating this matter on another occasion.  I commend those who tabled these motions and I wish the Minister well.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator O'Toole for tabling this motion.  It is an important issue.  If proper foundations are not laid for a house it will crumble and fall.  If a child does not receive a sound primary education he will not go anywhere in life.  For many years we took primary education for granted.  I compliment Senator O'Toole's profession and, in particular, the members of the organisation of which he is general secretary.  My father was a member of that organisation and profession.  Many Donegal people are primary teachers and I know that Senator O'Toole has many friends from my own county.  Our education system suffers from lack of funding and lack of teachers.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire agus comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis as ucht sárobair a Roinne.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh sé ann le fada an lá agus go mbeidh sé ábalta an obair a chríochnú.  Tá tosach iontach maith déanta aige agus, mar a deir an seanfhocail, &ldquo;Tús maith, leath na hoibre.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Most of the measures introduced by the Minister affect primary education.  He granted £250 million for the IT programme, although I am disappointed that more of that funding was not given to national schools.  As a parent of three children, I learned how well they adapt to using computers.  I would prefer more funding to be given to computer education than to the pilot European language scheme.  There is plenty of time to learn a language at second or third level.</P>
      <P>The Minister also scrapped regional educational boards, as there is enough bureacracy.  I hope the money wasted there will be well spent on primary education.</P>
      <P>The 15 per cent additional funding for capital expenditure on new schools and the 25 per cent funding for repairs and renovations allowed in the budget is also an improvement.  Many schools are in a bad state of repair, as Senator O'Toole's organisation has claimed for many years.  The overall 9 per cent increase in the educational budget is also welcome.  However, there was a reduction in the training budget even though many problems in primary education are because teachers are not retrained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had little contact with the educational system since I left school.  I was well educated and I owe most of it to my primary school teachers. However, a number of issues in the past few years have reawakened my interest.  I am a parent of three children, the last of which has just completed national school.  I have always thought the Irish primary school system is the best in the world.  Many of my aunts and uncles emigrated to England and when they came home with their families they told me the primary education system here could not be matched anywhere. However, when I hear the problems raised by the <Col N="242" /> INTO and those I have encountered, I wonder what is happening in other countries.</P>
    <P>As an accountant, I do the books for a number of secondary schools and I am amazed at the finance given to secondary, as compared to primary, education.  While the capitation grant increased from £45 to £50 and to £80 in disadvantaged areas, little money has been given to address other needs.  The amount of money for the provision of materials in primary schools is laughable when compared with that given to the teaching of different skills in secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Most other speakers mentioned the needs of the primary education sector, including the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio, which the Minister said is 21:1.  I know one school which is way above that.  The Minister also provided £40 million funding to address the issue of substandard buildings.  The panel of supply teachers needs to be expanded.  I spoke to a teacher last night who told me one remedial teacher is covering six schools in his area.</P>
    <P>The biggest problem is that not all children are treated equally.  Two of my children sailed through primary school without any problems. However, one of my children had great difficulty. He was in fourth class before he was diagnosed as having learning difficulties, and that happened only when a special needs teacher was employed by the school.  I praise the work done by the ACLD workshops.  If the Minister cannot provide teachers through the Department, he should help the ACLD continue its great work.  I was fortunate enough to be able to employ a teacher for a few hours a week.  In two to three years, my son has made such progress that he has now completed his first term in a boarding school and is running in the Leinster cross country championships today.  I am proud he achieved what he has but I was fortunate to be in a position to help him financially, with the assistance of the ACLD workshop.  Otherwise he would have been lost in the education system and would have had a bleak future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the motion and the amendment &mdash; the two should be taken as alternates rather than together.  Perhaps the motion should have had an addendum and we could have then accepted both of them, as well as emphasising the £250 million investment fund.  The issues covered in the motion are worthwhile &mdash; the Breaking the Cycle scheme, extra remedial teachers, the pupil-teacher ratio and the provision of extra teachers.</P>
      <P>Education should be seen as an investment &mdash; in our children, our future, our society and our business &mdash; and not as a draw on taxpayers and money which could be otherwise spent.  It is one of the, if not the most, important investments we can make.</P>
      <P>Greater personnel and resources should be invested in primary education.  We should also have a greater, better and more integrated structure for the delivery of education across the spectrum. This motion proposes what is required in the primary sector.  The second level sector has similar problems and issues.  The pre-school sector, including nurseries and créches, does not receive any State funding on a national basis.  We could also discuss third level and adult education.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the need to target and focus.  There are disadvantaged areas where educational attainment is impossible and youngsters are falling through the system at every level.  The support mechanisms have not been integrated into the system to ensure that students obtain an adequate level of education.  The single greatest failure of the education system is that no one has inquired why so many young people from disadvantaged areas are not able to make the breakthrough into third level education.  Many of them drop out of school when they reach the compulsory age limit.  The reason for this is our discreet tiered or layered system which comprises pre-school, primary, second level, third level and adult education.  These levels do not dovetail to meet each others needs.  For example, primary level is class oriented while second level is course or subject oriented.</P>
      <P>We require a system whereby a model of educational delivery can integrate the necessary services and supports.  As Senator Quill stated, young people should not pass through the system without being tracked.  We must ensure that mechanisms are put in place to stop them dropping out of the system.  The element missing from the motion is a requirement that, in addition to extra personnel, support mechanisms and funding, there should be a more integrated structure to ensure adequate delivery at all levels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for sharing time.  I compliment the Minister on his distinguished performance.  He departed from his prepared script with great confidence and expanded clearly on many points.  His invitation to Senator O'Toole and others to look at the <Col N="244" /> graphs is welcome and shows he is confident and prepared to co-operate.</P>
      <P>Everyone is aware that this matter involves the allocation of resources and we have witnessed battles between different Ministers, various groups, etc. , in that regard.  Senator O'Toole's case for a commitment to increase teacher training over five years is good.  It seems the Minister met him half way on this.</P>
      <P>With regard to children with special needs, there should be an assessment of those needs so that they can be catered for at the point of entry. It is not enough to place these children in ordinary schools.  It is good that they should be placed in normal environments.  For example, a photograph appeared in the newspapers recently which showed blind children happily at work in a school with other children.  Occasionally this can backfire in the same way the attempt to develop community psychiatric services backfired, not only in Ireland but also in America.  In that instance, people were returned to the community without adequate preparation.</P>
      <P>I am aware of one example which underpins my point.  A young person with learning difficulties and special needs, who also has serious physical disabilities and is confined to a wheelchair, was admitted to a local school.  However, no one took account of the fact that the entrance to the school is situated at the top of 39 steps.  Out of the goodness of his heart, a local contractor using a JCB excavated a new entrance.  That was a wonderful community effort but we cannot always rely on such behaviour.  For that reason, it is important that the needs of such children should be assessed so that school authorities are aware of the facilities required to bring them into the system.</P>
      <P>It is not acceptable that schools are being forced to take risks in employing unqualified personnel. Last year a person from Australia managed to sneak into the system despite the fact he had a number of convictions relating to offences involving child pornography in that country.  We cannot take this risk.  I note with wry amusement that Kerry appears to be the only county with a superfluity of qualified teachers.  I wonder if that has anything to do with Senator O'Toole's residing there?  This is similar to the phenomenon where there is rarely a pothole within a ten mile radius of a Minister's constituency office.</P>
      <P>As Senators Quill and Bonner stated, it is important to identify children at risk.  The Minister referred to this in terms of tracking.  A recent radio programme highlighted that children in Limerick are dropping out of the system without being noticed and becoming drug addicts or homeless.  I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for their indulgence in allowing me participate in this important debate.</P>

      <P>My point relates to the lack of remedial teachers.  I am a member of the board of management of Cashel community school, which is a success story in its own right.  I live in County Tipperary which has the lowest remedial teacher-student ratio in the country.  I hope the Minister will see if something can be done to change that. A survey was recently carried out at Cashel community school in respect of problem children.  It emerged that if these young people had access to remedial teachers in primary school some of the problem cases would not have been passed on to secondary schools.</P>
      <P>I accept that I am referring to a particular case and that the Minister receives many applications in respect of remedial teachers.  However, I ask that he take action to resolve this matter.</P>

I have little difficulty with the points made on either side of the House, with the exception of those made by Senator Ormonde.  If she considers my earlier contribution an attack on the Minister she should see us when we are debating in private.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to attack the Minister.  I have no reason to attack him on his record to date.  At the outset, I made clear I am merely highlighting a problem.  The Minister correctly stated that he met me and representatives of my organisation before the election when we discussed the demographic dividend.  For the record, we sought a commitment on that occasion which was subsequently delivered.  However, I am now highlighting a much wider problem.  The Minister was very open during his contribution and I will deal with the issues he raised later.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan's contribution on remedial classes was informative and I agree with his point in respect of clusters of schools.  Senator Quill raised a number of important issues such as tracking and specialised training.  The Minister might give consideration to Senator Henry's point on integrating speech therapy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Kett's outline of the needs of special education is also worthy of consideration.  I was delighted that he and Senator Norris raised the question of a statement of needs in respect of the integration of children with special needs, which is crucial.  I could speak at length on Senator Kett's comments on EU class sizes.  Even if class sizes in Ireland were the same as those throughout the EU &mdash; Members pointed out that they are much larger &mdash; we would not have the same level of support which exists in schools in other member states.  One problem which was not touched upon during the debate &mdash; Members living in <Col N="246" /> rural constituencies will be aware of it &mdash; involves the large number of primary schools which do not have the services of a caretaker or secretary.</P>
    <P>Senator Bonner stated that he does not have a great insight into this area.  However, his contribution belied that.  Senator McDonagh and others provided a useful outline on many matters.</P>
    <P>A number of issues were covered during the debate and I was glad to hear them from sources other than myself.  Senator Costello and I have worked in this area for many years and we are used to considering it from our point of view.  It is nice to obtain other views and realise people are considering the issues.  If I had time, I could answer many of the questions asked by Members.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his openness during the debate.  I am aware his contribution was conceived on the basis of advice, etc. He stated that we have consistently said the figure of 46,000 is not being used.  Perhaps it has been used but I never heard it before and I am dealing with these figures constantly. The figure came from a departmental report published in 1990 and was based on advice given to the primary education review body by Professor Gerry Sexton of the ESRI.  I was present when he provided the figure and argued for two hours against it.  I was not General-Secretary of the INTO at the time but it is significant that the person who refereed the discussion between us is now the Minister's newly appointed Secretary-General, John Dennehy.  He will confirm to the Minister that I never thought that figure would come to bear.</P>
    <P>The Minister was careful with regard to the other figures he used.  I said there was little or no evidence about the Commission on Special Education and he wanted to prove a point.  I do not disagree with his point but there is one easy way to deal with it.  I would have an audit carried out on the recommendations of the commission and formally send them to the Minister and Members to allow people to make a judgment on who was accurate.  It is a case of tweedledum and tweedledee.</P>
    <P>Regarding his costing of my proposal for additional teachers, it is up to any of us who came through six classes in primary school dividing the figure of £102 million given to the Minister by his Department, or the figure of £84 million which I used, by 4,200.  His figure allows an average annual salary of over £25,000.  Considering teachers start on a salary of £15,000 and go up to £26,000, my figures are right and his are wrong.</P>
    <P>My statement yesterday was directed very much at the Department of Finance.  I do not disagree with the Minister's figures for this year and last.  He correctly said &mdash; and Garret FitzGerald made the same point in two recent articles &mdash; there has been an arrest of the decline, except if one looks at the graph the birth rate has gone up and it will impact on schools next year.  The figures for the next six years at least will be wrong because of the impact it will have on schools.  I <Col N="247" /> do not know what will happen after that but I know what is happening with regard to teacher numbers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement, which is most important, that he would address the need for further action where identified.  However, he has acknowledged that it has been identified and needs to be addressed.  He said that he will make his statistics available to Members and that is important.  We must look at teacher supply and need realistically and come up with a multiannual approach to it.  We should stuff the words down the Department of Finance's throat. Officials cannot talk about the need for multiannual budgeting and then refuse the Minister's Department and others to do precisely that. Every year the Department of Finance says that it must plan over a number of years and it never does it itself when it must commit to other Departments.</P>
    <P>Ministers are entitled to get from the Department of Finance what it is looking to get from others.  I welcome the contributions made and, in recognition of the open way that the Minister approached this, it is not my intention to push the motion to a vote.  It would spoil the nature of the debate where people contributed openly and Members opposite were not afraid to raise issues in support of my argument, as did the Minister. There will be a great deal of difficulty with these issues in schools over the next few years, particularly dealing with substitute teachers.  I look forward to seeing if it can be resolved but it will not be resolved without additional teachers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin to wonder if the Minister for Health and Children is a little nervous about the issues I table on the Adjournment, but I realise he is very busy.  I have not had the pleasure of addressing him yet but I am glad the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great concern has been expressed about patients in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, by Senators and the public following a radio programme featuring conditions at the hospital.  A few weeks after the programme parents and guardians of some of the residents in the hospital received a letter from a doctor who works there asking for permission to include their adult children <Col N="248" /> or wards in a trial which involved medication and blood tests.  While no one questions the integrity of the doctor who wished to carry out the study, some parents and others, such as The Disability Federation of Ireland, were concerned as to the status of such trials within the hospital.  I am very glad the Minister for Health and Children visited the hospital and that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is here to give a report on his visit.</P>
    <P>Patients with mental illness or intellectual impairment rely more than most on others ensuring they have the best care.  Public representatives, as well as those staff who care for them, have a particular responsibility, with the parents or guardians involved perhaps being unable to exert as much influence as they would like over the physical, psychological and emotional care needed.</P>
    <P>The proper supervision of mental hospitals is considered so important that an Inspector of Mental Hospitals was appointed by the State many years ago.  He carries out routine inspections, usually visiting all the patients in Ireland at least once every two years.  He produces excellent reports but, amazingly, there is always a considerable delay in their publication and they are rarely debated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The 1995 report is the most recent available.</P>
    <P>While I understand the concern of Members of the Oireachtas about St. Ita's, much could be gained by debating the inspector's reports.  On page 29 of the 1995 report carried out by Dr. Hanniffy, Assistant Inspector Of Mental Hospitals, it is pointed out that while ward reorganisation has taken place in the hospital, many of the day areas for long stay patients are totally inadequate.  There is a more homely atmosphere in the night accommodation, but much more reorganisation of the day areas, especially bathrooms, was required.</P>
    <P>These are serious factors in the lives of long stay patients.  One quarter of the 328 people who live there were over 75 years and another quarter between 65 and 74 years.  There was not even proper bathroom facilities for 150 of the oldest people living on the campus and the Minister will realise the patients and staff are in an impossible position.  The corridors and walkways were described as being poorly maintained, but local management pointed out there were insufficient means to meet the maintenance requirements; yet regular meetings between the management and maintenance staff were not held.  The inspector recommended that monthly meetings be held to prioritise reforms and that they should be recorded.  It seems odd that this did not happen already.  I question the involvement of management in the running of the hospital when something as basic as that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Another serious criticism in the assistant inspector's report is that only some of the patients in St. Ita's Hospital had personal clothing and toilet requisites.  Years ago the Eastern Health <Col N="249" /> Board, of which I was then a member, stated that the policy of having a pool of clothes from which the patients were dressed would have to stop, and yet that policy continued in St. Ita's Hospital in 1995.  Did the Minister investigate this?  If one was an elderly person away from home in an institution, just imagine that one could be clothed in whatever came out of a bag that morning.  I do not want to go into the details of the sharing of toilet requisites because that is not in the report, but they could be very unhygienic.</P>
    <P>The inspector's criticisms were not only on the physical conditions under which patients were kept.  A section on seclusion procedures &mdash; one of his most serious criticisms in the report &mdash; makes one feel that their use and monitoring may be less than adequate.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Seclusion procedures represent a serious deprivation of patients' rights and all episodes must be properly authorised and monitored. The local seclusion policy should be updated to include excerpts from the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, relating to seclusion and bodily restraint.</P>
    <P>I have already said in other debates in this House that it is astonishing that we are working under the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, yet here is the inspector saying that a policy in one of our hospitals should be updated to include excerpts from that Act.  That extract from the report continues:</P>
    <P>The policy should define seclusion and policy guidelines and procedures should be clearly stated.  The medical and nursing staff should record seclusion in patients' case files, giving clear reasons as to why seclusion was used.  The record should also include evaluation of the effects of each episode of seclusion and should be included in the medical and nursing notes.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing to read that even if the report dates from 1995.  There would appear to be a lack of management interest in the hospital if the above recommendations on such a serious issue have not been instituted.  Did the Minister for Health and Children investigate this?  He must have read the 1995 report when he visited the hospital.</P>
    <P>Regarding the proposed trial and the concerns it raised, while the service in St. Ita's Hospital is accredited by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Irish College of General Practitioners, one would have to ask what are the procedures in place regarding drug trials, which may, indeed, be very worthwhile, which are to be carried out in the hospital.  It is essential to dispel the perception that people behind walls are ever used in trials which are not specifically for their benefit.</P>
    <P>On hearing of the trials, I immediately contacted the EHB to ask if there was an ethics committee at the hospital and if the trial had been submitted to that committee, whatever about the board of management.  I was assured there was <Col N="250" /> such a committee &mdash; it is not mentioned in the report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals although there is mention of other committees such as fire committees &mdash; but the trial was not submitted to it.  The trial, I was told later, not by the EHB but by another source, had been submitted to the ethics committee of the Irish College of General Practitioners.  It is unusual that a doctor, who understands the importance of ethical considerations, did not send the protocol to the ethics committee at the hospital if this committee was functioning as it should.  How frequent are the meetings of the ethics committee?  When did it meet last?  What trials did it look at?  What protocols were evaluated?  What trials have been carried out in St. Ita's Hospital to date?</P>
    <P>The statement from the EHB on the trial under discussion stated that it was to be carried out on patients with a &ldquo;learning disability&rdquo;.  Was the trial, therefore, to be carried out on those who live in St. Joseph's mental handicap facility, which is on the site?  Those in St. Ita's Hospital are hospitalised under different old medical illness categories. Some are even hospitalised under the heading &ldquo;Person of unsound mind&rdquo;.  I doubt if that category is used anywhere else in the western world.</P>
    <P>We are in a sorry state regarding our treatment of those in mental institutions in this country.  The Inspector of Mental Hospitals goes to a great deal of effort to produce reports, but I sometimes believe we think that once a report is made we have done something, although that is not the case.  I got two copies of the 1995 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals from the Library and neither appeared to have been opened.  They were in pristine condition.  We are working under mental health legislation which is nearly 50 years old, while the changes in attitudes to mental health and the improvement in mental treatment in the last few decades has been dramatic.  The concern about St. Ita's Hospital should spread to the whole service.  I hope the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands will ask the Minister for Health and Children to actively promote the interests of those who have no hope of doing so themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, regrets that he cannot be in the House this evening and he has asked me to relay his report on his visit to St. Ita's Hospital.  I know he will take special interest in what the Senator has had to say on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Senator will be aware, St. Ita's Hospital is administered by the Eastern Health Board.  The board's current development plan in relation to the hospital campus provides for the closure of old wards in the main hospital block in line with a reduction in patient numbers in the psychiatric service and mental handicap service provided at St. Ita's Hospital.  This will be facilitated by the provision of purpose built residential facilities in <Col N="251" /> the community and on the hospital campus for residents with a mental handicap, and the transfer of long-term older psychiatric patients from the main hospital block to more modern accommodation on the hospital campus as vacancies arise.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001&rdquo;, which was published in 1997, highlighted the need for a sustained capital programme to provide additional and enhanced services.  The capacity of existing facilities to absorb the additional places in the coming years and to provide the specialist services for clients with disturbed behaviour is now limited.  A programme of building is essential to deliver the volume and quality of services required.</P>
    <P>The Senator may be aware that the Minister for Health and Children recently announced the establishment of a £30 million capital programme for services to persons with a mental handicap to run in tandem with the service developments identified in the &ldquo;Assessment of Need for Services for Persons with a Mental Handicap, 1997-2001&rdquo; over a four year period.  The sum of £5.25 million is being provided in 1998 to begin the implementation of this programme.</P>
    <P>One of the main elements of that programme is the provision of new residential and day care facilities for persons with a mental handicap who are currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate settings, and the refurbishment of existing facilities which will continue to be used in the medium to long-term.</P>
    <P>Details of the capital programme are now being worked out with the health boards and voluntary agencies.  The programme will include the Eastern Health Board's development plan for its services to persons with a mental handicap in St. Ita's Hospital.  The board's development plan includes the provision of new facilities both on and off the St. Ita's Hospital campus and the refurbishment of some of the existing facilities.  It is understood that the board has already applied for planning permission for the first of the purpose built residential and day complexes planned for the services.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the Minister for Health and Children recently paid a visit to St. Ita's Hospital to view the facilities and services provided.  The Minister has also met the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the measures required to implement the remaining elements of the board's plan for the overall development of the hospital campus.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that the Minister for Health and Children, his Department and the board are fully committed to the implementation of the overall development programme for the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing me to raise this issue with which you are personally conversant.  I am raising this matter in the hope of convincing the Minister to make concessions to a relatively small number of people who have been adversely affected by the EU habitats directive or, more precisely, by the designation of certain raised bog sites as special areas of conservation.  These people cut peat or turf on such sites for their domestic requirements, but they have been informed by the Department that they can no longer use the sites for turf cutting.</P>
      <P>This is a totally unacceptable situation because it is about more than just domestic fuel supplies. The issue goes to the heart of a timeless tradition in rural areas and is part of a way of life.  This directive will not be accepted in a large number of cases.</P>
      <P>The issue of compensation is only half the story.  Like the fishing rod licence issue of ten years ago, the majority of those involved see one of their most cherished rights being taken away. They will resist and an ugly confrontation may arise.  I predict that the Minister and her Department would not be the winners in that kind of situation.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Minister to compromise.  I humbly suggest that such a compromise could be approached by lifting the ban on cutting turf on raised bogs in 1998.  It is an absolute principle of negotiation that no side in a dispute should take hostages as a negotiating weapon.  The ban on turf cutting this season &mdash; which is due to begin in a matter of weeks and when there is no chance of any settlement on compensation or the other issues &mdash; amounts to taking hostages.</P>
      <P>If the Minister wants these negotiations to go anywhere, she should remove this major irritant and lift the ban.  Granted, a number of people will accept compensation and will desist from turf cutting. In a small number of cases people will transfer or relocate to other non SAC sites, but the biggest problem is that few alternative sites are available.  It is impractical also in many other cases.  The remaining cohort of people will not accept compensation and will continue to exercise what they see as their right &mdash; and it is their right &mdash; to cut and save turf on sites they legally own or have occupied legally for over a century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not often appreciated that the total area of all such sites is relatively small.  Most of the plots that are owned or are under long-term occupation or tenancy are of no more than one or two acres.  Very few are one hectare (two and a half acres) sites or over.  The Department has identified <Col N="253" /> 11,523 hectares of raised bog as SAC sites in the western counties, in addition to some inland countries such as Cavan, Tipperary and Kildare.  The vast majority of these bogs belong to the Department of Agriculture and Food.  In my own county of Roscommon, as the Cathaoirleach knows, some 2,634 hectares are designated as SAC sites.  Without having accurate statistics, I would hazard a guess that well over 90 per cent of these sites belong to the State, so there is no problem.</P>
    <P>Why not leave the people who wish to cut their turf, and who have legal ownership and occupation rights, to do so?  Most of the sites are small and their sum total is a minimum percentage of the national total.  Why not leave them their right to continue cutting turf and confine them to the area of the sites they own?</P>
    <P>Properly handled, a plot of one acre of raised bog can provide an adequate fuel supply to a household for a period of 65 to 80 years.  I know from personal experience that is a fact.  The development of modern machinery for cutting turf now means that machine cutting is more environmentally friendly than the old hand-cutting method.</P>
    <P>The Minister can solve this problem by compromise and she should think along the lines I have suggested.  In the Dáil yesterday, the Minister said she was faced with a <i>fait accompli</i> when she assumed office, but that is not quite so.  Last March these sites were given legal protection, but the 207 SAC sites have still not been submitted to the EU for approved designation.  I have discussed the matter with sources close the European Commission in Brussels and it would appear they have no objection to the Minister's submitting the 207 sites, while letting them know that certain adjustments are required.</P>
    <P>These adjustments are, I suggest, at the edges. The Minister will be able to buy out many of the plot owners on the SAC bogs and will relocate some others, but the remaining cohort will not leave.  They see turf cutting as an absolute right and they will resist in the same way as the rod licence issue was fought, thus creating conflict in rural areas that none of us wants.</P>
    <P>I frankly believe the European Commission will accept my suggested way forward because the amount of acreage the Minister will lose, when people decide to hold on to what they own or legally occupy, will be relatively small.  The Minister should look at the matter in that light and seek compromise.  She should lift the ban on turf cutting this year as a start.  Please God, by this time next year the issue will have been settled to everyone's benefit.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I also thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing this debate.  I understand it is an emotive and sensitive <Col N="254" /> issue and debates such as this can help to clarify the situation.</P>
      <P>The EU habitats directive requires member states to designate their most important natural areas as special areas of conservation &mdash; SAC &mdash; and to protect them from anything that would damage their ecology.  The directive identifies all active bogs as priorities, which basically means that they must be given the highest level of protection. Raised bogs, which are found, for example, in the general Castlerea area of County Roscommon, are particularly important in this context.</P>
      <P>We have proposed only about 8,000 hectares from an original figure of over 300,000 hectares for SAC status.  Blanket or mountain bogs are also identified as priorities in the directive but, given that about 200,000 hectares are being proposed for SAC status, this kind of bog is clearly less rare.</P>
      <P>The directive specifies the scientific selection criteria by which these areas must be selected and provides that selection must be on scientific grounds only for priority habitats such as raised bog.  Social and economic factors cannot be used as justification for not protecting these areas.  A site can only be removed from the proposed designated area if it can be shown that the area does not, in fact, meet the directive's selection criteria.</P>
      <P>It is, of course, possible that areas have been proposed for SAC status in error.  Indeed, in an exercise of this size, it is virtually certain that anomalies will arise.  Consequently, mechanisms are in place to deal with this.  Those who feel that an area proposed as an SAC does not, in fact, merit this status, can appeal against the inclusion.  In the first instance, they would be best advised to make direct contact with the local officers of Dúchas, my Department's heritage service, and make their reservations known.  These local officials will look at the case and in the vast majority of cases the matter can be resolved at this level.  Where resolution is not possible, all those affected have the right to make a formal appeal which will be considered by an independent committee with equal representation from landowners and users and other interests and with an independent chairperson.  I expect this committee to begin its work in the near future.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested by some of those representing turf cutters that the restriction on cutting on raised bogs be deferred for another year. While it is difficult to be precise, it is estimated that perhaps 40 acres of intact raised bog is lost effectively forever for each year during which cutting continues.  It is difficult to see how the obligations to protect these areas can be reconciled with the kind of deferral suggested, under which the physical removal of part of what we are obliged to protect would continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has had a number of meetings with those involved in turf cutting at which it was indicated that the compensation package for those who have been actively cutting in recent <Col N="255" /> times and who are required to stop will include the following elements.  My Department will offer to buy the land from those affected.  We would envisage a price of £1,000 per acre which has been rejected by the farming organisations and others as being inadequate.  However, the price offered is based on long experience by my Department in buying similar land at anything from £450 to £800 per acre and, in that context, the price offered generously relates to prevailing market prices. For those who are not prepared to sell, it is hoped that in many areas we will be able to offer relocation to another bog.  Those who have to move some distance from their existing bog plot to the new alternative site will be offered a once-off payment of £100 per mile, up to a maximum of <Col N="256" /> £500.  Where agreement is not reached, independent arbitration is available.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult for people to accept the kind of changes that are necessary to protect disappearing habitats, but without change we will not be able to pass on the natural environment to our successors in anything like the state we received it.  The last thing that I or my Department want is to be seen as imposing something that people do not want.  I emphasise that the concerns of the people affected will be taken seriously and addressed to the maximum extent possible.</P>
