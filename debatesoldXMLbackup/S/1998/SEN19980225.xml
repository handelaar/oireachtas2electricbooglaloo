      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the need for a second special class at post primary level for children with special needs in Swords and, recognising that St.  Finians Community College is the only post primary school at present in the area with a special class, that the Minister would indicate his plans regarding the establishment of a second such class in another school.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide a library for the Cabra/Navan Road area.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take immediate steps to ensure that young children are not endangered when accompanying their parents or guardians who are selling the &ldquo;Big Issues&rdquo; magazine at major traffic intersections in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators O'Toole and Costello as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Ridge may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and item 12, motion 16, which will be taken at 6 p.m. All Stages of item 1 will be taken today with debate, the contribution of each spokesperson on Second Stage not exceeding 15 minutes and that of other Senators not exceeding ten minutes.  Senators may share time.  For the information of the House, the amendment to the Private Members' motion has been circulated on a Supplementary Order Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Referendum Bill, I was surprised that speakers after spokespersons will be confined to ten minutes.  These issues are important.  I do not believe there will be too many speakers offering and ten minutes is too short a time and I ask the Leader to change it.  I take it that as it is proposed to take all Stages today, there will be no curtailment of time and as much as is needed will be given.  It is not a good idea to take all Stages of the Bill today.  While there is a certain urgency, it is a bad practice to take all Stages of an important Bill on the same day and I hope this will not be seen as a precedent.  I do not see a great case for it so perhaps the Leader will explain when replying.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to reform the law on criminal insanity.  Will the Leader indicate the status of the mental health Bill, which was at an advanced stage of preparation when the last Government left office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Both sides of the House gave a commitment on South American adoptions prior to the election.  The Leader gave a commitment last week to deal with the matter and restore it to the Order Paper.  If there is no satisfactory explanation for its absence and the opinion of the Attorney General is not made available to us, it is grossly unfair not to do so.  Commitments were made.  It is unacceptable that the issue is not on the Order Paper.  I will not move an amendment today but I will do so every day if I do not get a satisfactory indication of progress on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problems with the allocation of time for the items to be discussed but I am unsure about all Stages of legislation being taken on the one day.  We laid down guidelines to ensure this would not happen.  I do not see the need to conclude this Bill today.  We could conclude it equally well tomorrow or indeed next week.</P>
      <P>Item 9 refers to the text of the referendum.  It remains unchanged even though there is a precise text.  I hope we will not be proposing one text in this House and another in the other House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 7 is the Private Members' Bill on the protection of workers as tabled by the Labour Party. We have asked for a debate on industrial relations and it becomes more pressing as we enter the seventh week of the industrial dispute <Col N="555" /> in Ryanair.  All sides of the House are agreed it is extremely disappointing that we cannot find a mediated solution.  It is high time this House had a debate on all aspects of industrial relations, particularly since this dispute is at the heart of Partnership 2000 and could endanger that agreement if there are cowboy operators who refuse to accept normal principals of mediation and a normal framework of industrial relations.  I would like to see the other participants, the farmers and the business sector, voicing their concerns about the serious threat to Partnership 2000 arising from the failure of Ryanair to accept the normal form of mediation.</P>
    <P>The debate we had last Friday on foreign affairs was remarkable because there was unanimity on all sides on the need for a peaceful solution to the crisis between Iraq and the United States.  Thankfully there has been progress in that respect over the weekend.  There should be a mechanism whereby the participants in the crisis, the United States Ambassador and Iraqi Government representatives, be invited to listen to the debate or that the text of the debate be made available to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us are anxious to have the Foreign Adoptions Bill brought back before the House.  There is all-party agreement on that. However, we know there have been difficulties regarding legal opinion on the matter and these had to be dealt with.  The families promoting the Bill would prefer that it be correctly framed. There is an anxiety to have it done quickly.  That is what has emerged from discussions I have had in the past week.  People are very anxious that the Bill be dealt with correctly rather than quickly but they are also anxious that the matter be dealt with quickly.  This is clear to me from discussions I have had during the past week.  I am confident that the Bill will be restored to the Order Paper within a very short period.  I hope that the Leader will be able to confirm that to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>That Item No. 3 be taken immediately after the Order of Business in place of Item 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an extremely important matter which has occupied some of the keenest political brains in the State &mdash; Deputy Spring, Senator Jackman and Senator Coogan.  It is unusual for a Member from another constituency to intervene and prepare legislation without the courtesy of discussion with the representatives of the consituency concerned, particularly when the intervention is accompanied by lectures on democracy.  I looked the figures up and I note that Senator Jackman received 45 votes in the Seanad election and Senator Coogan 62.  I received 4,866 so I feel quite comfortable listening to lectures on democracy. We are told that university Members are nominated by a rotten borough.  The nominating <Col N="556" /> bodies are such as the Royal Irish Academy and the Society of the Motor Industry, and all 900 votes, with the exception of about 15 are controlled by the three major parties.  I would welcome, this very afternoon, an extensive and wide ranging debate in which Members will no doubt feel inclined to raise the question of the Bible, in which we are told that it is important, before one seeks to remove the mote from one's neighbour's eye, to remove the branch from one's own.  I will attempt to remove the tree from Senator Jackman's eye when I find her.  Perhaps she, as a Christian, will remove the large and flourishing acacia bushes growing in the right eye of Deputy Spring.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader direct the attention of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to the great difficulties being experienced by the fish producing industry in Killybegs. The Minister appointed a task force to examine the difficulties of the herring boats.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not in order.  We cannot have a discussion on the fishing problems in Killybegs on the Order of Business.  If the Senator wishes to have a discussion on that matter I suggest that he submit a motion for discussion on the Adjournment.  I will be happy to provide him with the opportunity to raise the points he wishes to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling but this is a very grave and serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Twelve hundred jobs are involved.</P>
      <P>We have had statements in this House on the Seagate closure.  I agreed with that but I would like to highlight the difficulties being faced by 1,200 employees and up to 2,000 people in service industries.  I would like the Leader to bring this to the attention of the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I was taken aback to hear that Senator Dardis is worried that we might proceed too quickly with the foreign adoptions Bill.  It was agreed last August that this matter would be dealt with as soon as possible.  There is no fear of this moving too quickly.  Many people are depending on us to get the Bill back on the Order Paper as <Col N="557" /> quickly as possible.  I support Senator O'Toole's call to have this legislation on tomorrow's Order Paper.  The Leader has stated that he will be back with that business.  We need a full explanation today and a guarantee that it will be on tomorrow's Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Can we have structured discussions on the 2K bug &mdash; the millennium bug.  This is an important issue and we need to be told how the public service is preparing itself to ensure that no problems arise.  We would be doing a great public service if we continue to highlight this issue so that the private sector is aware of the difficulties which could arise if computers are not adapted in time to cope with the change of date.  We should also discuss progress on the management initiative in the public service.  This issue does not grab everyone's attention as being madly exciting.  However, it is enormously important to the governance of the country that the public service gets its act right.</P>
      <P>This year is the bicentenary of the 1798 Rebellion and we should have a day of structured discussions on the rising, its implications for the country and progress made over the past 200 years.  We should commemorate the rising by spending time in reflective consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment to the Order of Business.  For many years Senator Jackman has expressed the view that this is a matter of great urgency and I would like to see it dealt with once and for all before the by-elections.</P>
      <P>On a more serious matter, I regret that we did not have the opportunity to debate Northern Ireland last week.  However, I understand why we were discouraged from doing so.  In the light of the fact that the Taoiseach rightly saw fit to take part in expelling Sinn Féin from the talks last week, he should be asked to explain to the House why he welcomed members of Provisional Sinn Féin to Government Buildings yesterday.  This undermined the disapproval which both Governments and all parties expressed last week.  This is a serious matter.  It is somewhat farcical when the leader of this country takes part in a serious expulsion and, three or four days later, says &ldquo;don't take any notice of it lads, come in here you are welcome.&rdquo; Is he or is he not in favour of violence in this country?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning called for more time for speakers on the Referendum Bill.  I propose 15 minutes for all speakers.  Senators other than spokespersons may share their time.  The Mental Health Bill is coming before both Houses later this year and I will be only too pleased to meet any of the Senator Manning's requests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the status of that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come back to the Senator later today on that matter.  Senators O'Toole, Dardis and Doyle expressed strong views on the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  The Bill has passed Cabinet and will be restored to the Order Paper within the next 48 hours.  I will try to make time available for a debate on industrial relations as requested by Senator Costello.  This is an important topic on which the Senator has great concerns.</P>
      <P>I cannot agree to the amendment to the Order of Business proposed by Senators Norris and Ross.  I have structured the business for today with various Ministers, as Senators will understand I will try to facilitate their request at the earliest possible opportunity if they accede to my wish.  Legislation must come first and I know Senators will seriously consider postponing their request to another day when I will be only too pleased to facilitate them.</P>
      <P>Senator Bonner expressed concern for the 1,200 people employed in the marine industry.  I will discuss the matter with him after the Order of Business to see how he can be facilitated.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle requested a debate on all implications of the millennium.  This is a genuine topic and I would be pleased to facilitate the Senator. I would also be pleased to accede to the request for statements on our progress since 1798 and the commemoration of the 200th anniversary of the event.  I look forward to visiting Wexford during the year, as I am sure do many Senators, for the important conferences on this topic.</P>
      <P>Senator Ross expressed his views on the debate with the Minister for Foreign Affairs last Friday. The Minister issued a detailed and comprehensive statement in which Northern Ireland was included.  He allowed much discussion and many views were expressed about Northern Ireland.  I understand the Sinn Féin Party was not expelled but suspended from the talks.  I thought the debate last Friday was very full and I thank the Senators who participated.</P>

    <Title>Referendum Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the consolidation and amendment of the law relating to the conduct of a referendum effected by the Referendum Act, 1994, this is the first legislation on referendum law providing for substantial new procedures at a referendum since the original referendum law was enacted in 1942.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for new procedures relating to the conduct of a referendum.  The establishment of a Referendum Commission to prepare information statements and to foster and promote debate relates to the broader aspect of a referendum campaign, an area that was not heretofore governed by detailed statutory regulation.</P>
      <P>The new procedure relating to the appointment of agents at a referendum is an extension of the law relating to the detailed conduct of a referendum extending from the taking of the poll to the counting of votes.  In this context, while the Bill is a relatively short one, it nevertheless represents a significant development of the law relating to a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Bill breaks new ground in so far as the information aspect is concerned and I am sure we will gain much experience on how the procedures provided for in the Bill will operate in practice at the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>In the Dáil, Fine Gael Deputies opposed the Bill.  They expressed the view that the Government is entitled to campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote using public funds, notwithstanding the McKenna judgments and that if there is a role for a Referendum Commission it should be to determine whether the Government is impartial in the expenditure of public funds at a referendum. They envisaged that legislation should provide accordingly, with its constitutionality being tested in the courts.</P>
      <P>In the period of over two years since the McKenna judgments, it has been generally accepted that the Government may not spend public funds on advocating a result at a referendum to the detriment of those on the other side of the argument.  I do not see how the views put forward by the Fine Gael Party can be squared with the McKenna judgments.  While the judgments acknowledge that the Government may advocate a result at a referendum, they make it clear that it is impermissible for the Government to spend money in the course of a referendum campaign to benefit one side rather than the other.</P>
      <P>The commission to be set up under this Bill is charged with spending public funds in a way that is fair to all interests concerned.  In that way, I believe it meets the main point of the McKenna judgments on the use of public funds.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to establish an independent statutory Referendum Commission to prepare and disseminate information on the subject matter of a referendum and to foster and promote public debate in a manner that is fair to all interests concerned at a referendum.  It will also consider and rule on applications from bodies for a declaration that they be approved bodies, whose sole function will be to appoint agents at a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the establishment, by order of the Minister, of an independent Referendum Commission not earlier than the date on which the Constitution amendment Bill is initiated in the Dáil or, in the case of an ordinary referendum, not later than the date of the order appointing polling day at such referendum. Where the commission is established before the passing of a Constitution amendment Bill by both <Col N="561" /> Houses of the Oireachtas, it will be prohibited before the passing of the Bill from publishing any statements or incurring any expenditure without the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The section provides that the commission will be independent in the performance of its functions and, subject to the provisions of the Bill, it will regulate its own procedure.  This is an important point especially when considered in conjunction with the specific requirement in the Bill that the commission carry out its functions in a manner that is fair to all interests concerned. This should allay any fears that the funding to be provided by the Government to the commission may not be spent in a fair manner to both sides of the debate at a referendum.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also provides that a member of the commission shall not advocate or promote a particular result at the referendum in respect of which the commission has been established. While it might not be necessary to provide for this matter, given the membership of the commission, it is important to demonstrate explicitly that the commission will be impartial in its attitude to the proposal in the referendum.</P>
    <P>The section also sets out the membership of the commission.  The members will be a former judge of the Supreme Court or a serving or former judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice, who will be chairperson, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Clerk of the Dáil and the Clerk of the Seanad.  The section makes porovision for substitution where there is a vacancy in the office of one of the ordinary members of the commission and where the chairman or another member of the commission is temporarily unable to act.  A member of the commission, who ceases to hold the relevant office, such as on reaching retiring age, will normally continue as a member until the commission reports.  The former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay, has agreed to be chairperson of the first commission.  I take this opportunity to thank those who have agreed to serve on the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the principal functions of the commission.  It provides that it will prepare statements containing a general explanation of the subject matter of the proposal, the subject of the referendum.  The commission will also prepare a statement or statements of the arguments for and against the proposal having regard to any submissions made to it under section 6 of the Bill. The commission will be required to publish and disseminate these statements to the electorate.</P>
    <P>As this section confers such powers on the commission as are necessary for the performance of its functions, it will be open to it to decide the best way of communicating with the electorate. The commission can use television, radio and other electronic media in addition to printed matter in brochures, leaflets, pamphlets and posters. It will also be a function of the commission to foster, promote and facilitate public debate on the proposal the subject of a referendum.  The <Col N="562" /> commission, in carrying out these functions, will be required to be fair to all the interests concerned. This is an essential part of the commission's role.</P>
    <P>The process of providing direct information to the electorate has evolved over the last few years arising from the fact that, in recent years, most of the political parties represented in the Houses of the Oireachtas have been in favour of proposals put before the people at referenda.  This is a welcome development as constitutional change should have the widest possible consensus. However, it has the drawback that public debate is not as sharp or as interesting as some people would like.  The process of providing direct information on the advantages and disadvantages of a proposal at a referendum commenced in 1995 with the establishment of an <i>ad hoc</i> commission on referendum information for the divorce referendum. Since then there were two further commissions which had the responsibility of preparing statements with arguments for and against proposals at the bail referendum in 1996 and at the Cabinet confidentiality referendum in 1997.</P>
    <P>Criticism was expressed after the most recent referendum that the advertisements were not the best of way of communicating simple factual information to the electorate.  There is a view that the delivery of a leaflet in an easy to read format to every household is more effective than newspaper notices.  Notwithstanding the criticism, the <i>ad hoc</i> commissioners were a step forward in attempting to breach the gap in the provision of information.  I believe this proposal will be a further step forward in that process.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the commission may engage such consultants and advisers as it considers necessary for the performance of its functions. Again it will be a matter for the commission to engage professionals such as public relations experts, publicists, advertising agencies and other professional services to ensure that they get their message to the electorate in the most effective way.  This is important to ensure that public funds are not wasted on ineffective information and publicity.  Due to the criticism which arose after the last referendum on the lack of comprehensible information, the commission will have to ensure that its statements are prepared in simple and understandable language.  This section will enable the commission to engage the services of agencies with the appropriate expertise in this area.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is important.  It provides that the prohibition in the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and the Radio and Television Act, 1988, on the acceptance of political advertisements will not apply to advertisements to be broadcast at the request of the commission in relation to its principal functions at a referendum.  The importance of the commission's work, which is governed by the concept of fairness to all interests concerned, warrants the departure from the prohibition of political advertisements for the purpose of conveying <Col N="563" /> balanced information on a referendum proposal to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Under the section, the commission may, after consultation with the RTÉ Authority or the Independent Radio and Television Commission and having considered any proposals on their broadcasting plans in connection with the referendum, request the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, to direct the RTÉ Authority or the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange to make broadcasting time available to facilitate the commission in performing its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the public can make submissions to the commission relating to a proposal the subject of a referendum.  The commission will have regard to the submissions received when it is preparing statements under section 3.  This is not to say that the contents of every submission will have to be reproduced in statements prepared by the commission.  It will be a matter for the commission itself to decide the content of its statements provided they are fair to all of the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that a body may apply to a referendum commission for a declaration that it is an approved body for the purposes of the referendum. The only function of an approved body under the Bill will be to appoint agents at various processes at the referendum.  The right of such bodies to appoint agents will be in addition to the right currently conferred on Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to appoint agents.  This provision is included to take account of the High Court judgment in 1997 which held that the Minister has jurisdiction to rule on requests made to him by persons or groups to appoint such agents at a referendum.  In view of the confusion in the other House I wish to stress that the only function of an approved body under the Bill will be to appoint agents.  There is no question of appointing funding to such bodies at a referendum.</P>
    <P>A body will have to apply for a declaration at each referendum at which it wishes to appoint agents.  The requirements are kept to a minimum. The body must have an interest in the referendum. It, or a branch of the body, must be established in the State, have at least 300 members, have a constitution, memorandum of association or other such document approved by the members and a name which is not identical or does not closely resemble the name of a political party registered in the Register of Political Parties. The commission must be satisfied that the applicant body has a bona fide interest in the subject matter of the referendum.</P>
    <P>While some may criticise these requirements as too stringent, I stress that the role of an agent at an election or a referendum is serious and important.  It is a task which must be done correctly and not a matter to be taken lightly.  I wish to give some background to the appointment of agents, what they can do at a referendum and the reason for this provision.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="564" /> Section 26(1) of the Referendum Act, 1994, provides that a Member of the Dáil for the constituency and any Member of the Seanad may appoint agents at a referendum to be present at the issue of ballot papers to postal voters, the opening of postal ballot boxes and the counting of votes.  A Member of the Dáil for the constituency and any Member of the Seanad may appoint one person to be present in each polling station at a referendum for the purpose of assisting in the detection of personation.</P>
    <P>In November 1995, prior to the referendum on divorce, an anti-divorce activist wrote to the then Minister requesting him to redress what she referred to as a deficiency in the Referendum Act, 1994.  The person claimed that groups opposing the then proposed constitutional amendment were excluded from appointing personation agents and agents to attend the count without obtaining an appointment from a Member of the Oireachtas.  She indicated that most, if not all, the parties in the Oireachtas were supporting the proposed amendment and requested the then Minister to make provision by way of emergency regulations to allow anti-amendment groups to appoint such agents.  As that request was not acceded to, legal action was initiated.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, the High Court granted the plaintiff a declaratory relief and made a declaration that the Minister has jurisdiction to consider whether there exists circumstances of special difficulty arising from the operation of the power of appointment contained in the section.  Should he decide that circumstances of special difficulty arise, he may modify section 26 by providing by ministerial order that the power of appointment should be exercised by persons or groups in addition to the persons mentioned in the section.</P>
    <P>The practical arrangements to be put in place at a referendum where no political party in the Oireachtas is opposed to a constitutional amendment have to take account of any group opposed to it.  The Minister could by difficulty order determine which groups could appoint agents, or he could designate that this function should be performed by the referendum returning officer or each local returning officer.  It would not be the most satisfactory arrangement that the Minister would adjudicate on who should have authority to appoint agents at a referendum as a refusal by the Minister of a particular person or group to appoint agents would be likely to lead to allegations of bias or conflict of interest on the part of the Minister and could result in a referendum petition.  Assigning the duty to the referendum returning officer or local returning officer to determine which bodies should be entitled to appoint agents is not considered appropriate; it could embroil impartial election officials in charges of partiality.</P>
    <P>I consider that the procedure for making a difficulty order at a referendum is not an appropriate mechanism for authorising bodies to appoint agents.  Instead, section 7 provides that interest groups which are declared to be approved bodies <Col N="565" /> by the Referendum Commission will be entitled to appoint agents.  This will avoid any allegations of unfairness or partiality.</P>
    <P>Under section 8, a commission is required, as soon as possible after its establishment, to publish a notice in at least two national newspapers inviting submissions in relation to the proposal the subject of the referendum.  The public notice must also refer to the procedure for declaration of approved bodies for the referendum.  It must also specify the latest date for receipt of submissions and for applications to the commission for declarations as approved bodies in respect of the referendum. This public notice will alert individuals, groups or political parties of their right to make submissions which must be considered by the commission in preparing its statements.</P>
    <P>Section 12 amends the Referendum Act, 1994, to provide that the result of a referendum may not be questioned on the grounds of non-compliance by the Referendum Commission with any provision of the Bill or any mistake made by the commission if it appears to the court that the general principles laid down in the Bill were complied with and the non-compliance or mistake did not materially affect the result of the referendum.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the expenses of the Referendum Commission will be paid from moneys provided by the Oireachtas from the vote of the Minister who initiates the relevant Bill containing the proposal which is the subject of the referendum. The Government has approved funding of £2.5 million for the commission's promotional work in respect of the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>Some speakers in the debate on the Bill in the Dáil advocated that the commission should provide funding to interested groups at a referendum. I do not agree with such a proposal.  For instance, how would an allocation be divided if we assume the Government decided to allocate £1 million to be distributed to political parties and interested groups? Should it be <i>pro rata</i> to the size and representation of parties or groups or should 50 per cent of the funding be given to both sides? Either approach would be open to challenge on the grounds of unfairness.  This would be particularly true in the case of the Treaty of Amsterdam given that 97 per cent of the people's representatives are in favour of it.  I am not satisfied that taxpayer's would be in favour of the Government issuing large sums of their money, together with the extra costs of administering a scheme, to political parties and interested groups to persuade them to vote for or against the referendum. The potential for wastage of public funds would be enormous, especially if the electorate was bombarded with conflicting and perhaps inaccurate propaganda paid for with its money. The Government considers that the Bill provides a better option for supplying information to the electorate in a manner that is fair to all the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Under section 14 the commission will be required to furnish a report to the Minister as <Col N="566" /> soon as practicable, but not later than six months after the completion of its functions at a referendum. The Minister is required to cause a copy of the report of the commission to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  Where the Minister so directs, the report of the commission must include information on any particular aspect of the commission's functions as may be specified by the Minister.  The commission will automatically be dissolved one month after presenting its report.</P>
    <P>The question of information at a referendum was considered by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution following a recommendation in the report of the Constitution Review Group.  In its first progress report issued last April the all-party committee agreed, as part of its conclusions on this matter, with the Constitution Review Group that an independent body should be established to regulate the funding and conduct of referenda.  The all-party committee is currently reconsidering the matter and I have been criticised for not waiting for its report.  However, in view of the short time available before the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam, I had no choice but to proceed with the present Bill in order that the commission would have time to carry out its functions effectively.  I will, of course, consider recommendations the committee may make for inclusion in future legislation.</P>
    <P>The Constitution Review Group also recommended that a commission should allocate funds to political parties and interest groups to ensure a thorough sustained debate on a referendum proposal.  I am not convinced, and am not aware of evidence, that providing funds directly to political parties and interested groups would provide simple factual information to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The Bill will put in place a mechanism to provide information to the electorate in a way that is fair to all concerned interests.  The commission can only provide information; it cannot make the electorate read or consider it.  Neither can the commission force the electorate to vote.  As public representatives, we and others participating at various levels in political parties or public life have a role to play in this issue.  I hope that, irrespective of our views on the Treaty of Amsterdam, all persons active in politics will help in generating a healthy debate on it.  I also hope politicians at national and local level will urge electors to vote on polling day.</P>
    <P>Hopefully, the information provided by the commission will increase public awareness which will result in the electorate being in a position to make an informed decision and express that decision by coming out on polling day to cast their votes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael opposed the Bill in the Dáil and has not deviated from that position.  The Bill proposes the establishment of a Referendum Commission to prepare and disseminate information and to foster, promote and facilitate debate in a fair manner.  The Government stated <Col N="567" /> that the establishment of an independent commission is made necessary by the forthcoming referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam and that it will be used to regulate future referenda, notably that on the outcome of the Northern Ireland peace process.  We will all welcome such a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Bill comes before the House at a time when the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in its first report concluded that an independent body should be established to regulate the funding and conduct of referenda.  It was also of the view that, in addition to carrying out this function, the commission should also assume the functions currently undertaken by the Constituency Boundary Commission, the Public Service Ethics Committee, which was established under the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, and any other commission proposed to regulate election funding.</P>
      <P>However, in view of the time available before the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam the Minister is proceeding with the Bill.  Unfortunately, when it comes to important democratic issues there always seems to be a rush, and legislation which is rushed is not good.  It would appear that with the possibility of apathy and misunderstanding preceding ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Government has been pushed into a referendum campaign fudge which is likely to result in a bizarre campaign.  Whether the public will be wiser or more enthusiastic participants in the process will be seriously in doubt.</P>
      <P>As a result of the McKenna judgment which resulted in a ban on partisan funding for referendum campaigns, the Government has decided to seek the services of an independent commission to make a case for and against any referendum. The commission will have £2.5 million to fund the printing and distribution of its arguments and any advertising deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a lack lustre response to the main problems created by the McKenna judgment. Governments are entitled to issue information on any issue.  The key test for the judges who found in favour of the McKenna case was that information should be provided on the basis of fairness. There is no reason the Government should not provide information on such a basis.  The approach adopted by the Government in this Bill is wrong as the essence of the Bill does not tackle the main problem or resolve the issue concerning the entitlement of a democratically elected Government to advocate a point of view in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael believes in the Government's right to advocate a point of view in a referendum.  We believer that it is a proper part of the function of a duly elected Government in a democratic system to act and negotiate on behalf of the people. When an issue is put to the people in a referendum, the Government should explain its views on the issue to the people.  The Constitution is the fundamental law of the land and it is the preserve <Col N="568" /> of the people who make decisions about it.  They are entitled to be given the broadest possible base of knowledge on which to make a decision.  Every political party has a responsibility to present its case to its supporters, and there is no prohibition on that.</P>
    <P>When a Bill to amend the Constitution is before the Oireachtas, sufficient time for a full debate should be provided because these debates generate public interest.  If it is rushed through the Oireachtas, as was the Bill on Cabinet confidentiality, then the public has little or no interest in or understanding of it.  There has been a growing tendency in recent times from people who have no electoral mandate &mdash; and who have never sought one &mdash; to prohibit Members of the Oireachtas from contributing in referenda once the matter is before the people.  Members of the Oireachtas have debated these issues and are often the most informed people about them.  This is very dangerous for democracy and it has created a situation where the public has little or no interest in referenda; this is proved by the declining number of people voting in them. People still like to have arguments debated with passion, then they know exactly where they stand and what position they should take.  This was clear from the divorce referendum when both sides argued passionately before the people made their decision.</P>
    <P>A substantial budget of £2.5 million will be made available for the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Advertisements, leaflets, posters and arguments directed at voters will all contribute substantially to public understanding of the relevant issues.  However, the Government has stopped short of enabling money to be allocated directly to campaign groups.  In doing so it has left itself open to the criticism that the debate will not be carried convincingly to the electorate. I do not accept the Minister's arguments on this matter.</P>
    <P>It would defeat the purpose of the Bill if the publicity and arguments put forward by the Referendum Commission were cast in the dry legalese used during the recent referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.  By stopping short of enabling money to be allocated directly to campaigning groups, the Government failed to provide resources to political parties, to those who are democratically elected, to pursue public affairs here or to groups who have a particular interest in the referendum campaign itself.</P>
    <P>There are alternatives available to the Government. I commend the arrangements being made by the Danish Government which will hold a referendum on 28 May on the Amsterdam Treaty. That Government will spend £500,000 printing and distributing purely factual material for the referendum.  It has set aside a separate fund of £2.8 million for campaigners, half of which will be distributed to parties and groups through a formula that recognises both the need to reflect a party's electoral base and the principle that minorities need special help.  Half of this £1.4 million <Col N="569" /> is allocated equally among all registered political parties and the three EU focused campaign groups while the balance is distributed among the same groups in proportion to their electoral support.</P>
    <P>This system is overseen by an independent and widely respected committee which has the right to distribute £1.4 million to applicants promoting specific projects, whether those relate to meetings, pamphlets or publicity.  This allows those outside the mainstream political process or the minorities without the parties access to funds to play their role in a referendum.  Should this system be allowed in Ireland?</P>
    <P>The key test for all the judges who found for McKenna was that of equality; that citizens on one side of an argument should not be favoured against their equals on the other.  Clearly, if the Government accepted the principle that it should assist the debate by directly funding both sides of the argument in order to avoid another successful legal challenge, it would have to establish an impartial mechanism for distributing funds which would take into account the need to assist minorities and to reflect a real balance of forces in an argument.  If the Irish courts, as appears from a detailed reading of the McKenna judgment, are not so much concerned with the spending as with the bias of the State, it is arguable that such a system would be likely to be upheld.  If an impartial mechanism was to be found for distributing such funding, what better than the commission provided for in this Bill which will be chaired by Mr. Justice Finlay? It will play an important role in our democratic system.  The Government's approach to this is wrong, reflecting a paternalism and caution reminiscent of another age.  It does not reflect the confidence of a new Ireland, and I will oppose this Bill on Second Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister referred to this Bill as the first significant change in the referendum process since 1942.  It is a major change.  The Constitution is highly valued by the public.  We have had 20 referenda since 1937.  Of these, 15 have passed and five were rejected.  The level of voting in most of those referenda has reflected the interest and commitment people have to plebiscites and the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The McKenna judgment has changed the situation, giving rise to an information deficit during referenda.  Debate has been stifled and this Bill will set ground rules to restore the previous order, when there was healthy debate and controversy during important referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have some sympathy for Senator Doyle's position but the Government will be in a position to articulate its view very clearly in any referendum. I am not sure that it is necessary for political parties to source Exchequer funding to do so.  I would welcome an independent, statutory referendum commission with two major functions: first to prepare, distribute and disseminate information in a way that is fair to all interests and second to rule on applications from bodies <Col N="570" /> which wish to appoint agents to oversee the referendum. The commission will be established by ministerial order and it will be made up of eminent people who occupy important public positions. Their track records will assure us that they will discharge their responsibilities fairly and impartially.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the principal functions, such as the preparation of statements which explain the subject matter of the referendum proposal as well as statements setting out the arguments for and against the proposition.  Debate will also have to be fostered, which is the most important requirement.  I hope the commission will be innovative in the manner in which this is interpreted because that may be the criterion by which its performance is judged.  In recent referenda notices were placed in newspapers with arguments for and against the issue.  It was not the most effective way to get the message across in that the notice probably contained too much information and the small print did not make it user friendly and, therefore, the message was lost.</P>
    <P>Turning to a point made by Senator Joe Doyle, the cut and thrust of political debate is important during the course of these campaigns.  Certain issues will probably command the attention of politicians to a greater degree than others but if we are to attract the public's attention, particularly in a busy world where people are preoccupied with many other issues, the method of presentation is important.  Some people would attribute the failure to do so, particularly in the last referendum, to the large number of spoiled votes and the low turn out, which is not healthy for a democracy and which is at variance with past experience in terms of people participating and exercising their franchise.</P>
    <P>It is important that notices are user friendly. They should be limited to a small number of important points which should be put across in the most effective way possible.  I take the point made by the Minister that a leaflet posted to each household is also effective and should be part and parcel of each referendum campaign.  The issues would be grappled with and understood.</P>
    <P>Section 4 gives the commission the power to engage consultants and advertisers, as it deems necessary.  That is a welcome initiative.  Perhaps the commission would consider engaging consultants or professionals on one or other side of the argument and giving them the wherewithal to articulate their views.  That could be an effective way to get the message across because if we could generate that type of competitiveness in the debate, we would command media and, subsequently, public attention, which is healthy and desirable.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is important because the greatest mediums in getting any message across are television and radio.  The prohibition on the broadcasting authority in relation to political advertisements will be lifted where requests are made by the commission which will have the power to ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="571" /> Islands to direct RTÉ and, indeed, the Independent Radio and Television Commission to make broadcasting time avail.  During my days as a member of the junior chamber our debates generated much local interest and perhaps a television debate with three speakers on each side would be a good way to get the message across if done in a proper and entertaining way.  The programme would command a high rating with audiences and would be a good medium to ensure both sides of the argument are made in a fair and comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>Section 7 gives the Referendum Commission the power to appoint agents.  Bodies which are accepted by the commission will be in the same position as a Member of the Oireachtas from the point of view of appointing an agent to oversee and participate in that process.  It is good that bodies must have a national complexion, a minimum of 300 members, a proper constitution and memorandum of association.  It is important local grievance groups do not become involved in national debates such as this without a mandate. It is important to protect against that and it appears the Bill does so.  Equally, it is imperative in these days of transparency that interested bodies are involved in overseeing the efficacy of the election because, ultimately, it leads to an acceptance of the political process by the public at large and enables those who are not actively involved in politics to participate in the process.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the requirement on the commission to publish in two newspapers.  I hope the commission extends its remit and utilises to a great degree local newspapers and local radio which are effective mediums in getting the message across.  We should not lose sight of that in this process.  Section 12 is a precautionary measure to ensure that if the result is subsequently questioned on the basis of any act by the commission it will have to be adjudicated on against its compliance with the general principles of the Bill rather than on specifics.  That is a prudent measure to avoid technicalities being contested to set aside the democratic will of the people.</P>
    <P>Section 14 requires the commission to furnish a report to the Minister who must present it to both Houses of the Oireachtas.  That makes the commission democratically accountable, which is worthwhile.  I welcome the Bill and hope it will remedy the information deficit in recent referenda. I am sure that as time goes by and with an innovative approach by the commission, it will be an effective tool in our democratic process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy for Senator Joe Doyle's view.  I take the point that the Bill is inescapable as a result of the McKenna judgment.  The Minister said he did not see how the views put forward by Fine Gael could be squared with the McKenna judgment and neither do I. I do not know how he can deal with it except by way of a constitutional referendum to deal with the McKenna judgment.  Perhaps that alternative <Col N="572" /> was considered and might be considered in the future.</P>
      <P>In a parliamentary democracy, parliament should be supreme, subject to the Constitution and the ruling of the courts on it.  If parliament decides, either by a small majority or by consensus, on a particular advocacy in respect of a constitutional referendum the European Union or the Amsterdam Treaty, it is appropriate for that to be disproportionate.  I accept that is at the heart of the McKenna judgment and that is where the difficult lies.  There may be an alternative way to do this.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that, in the case of the McKenna judgment, the action was dismissed by the High Court and upheld by the Supreme Court by a majority of four to one.  The Supreme Court held that the Government, using public funds in the promotion of a yes vote, was acting in breach of the Constitution.  The decision was based on the people's prerogative to amend the Constitution, the constitutional right to equality, fair procedure, freedom of expression and a democratic process in the referendum.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the Committee on the Constitution.  I am a member of that committee. While I accept it when he says he need not have waited for the report of the committee, it would have been useful if the committee had looked at the Bill as drafted and given a view on it.  It is down to the Government of the day to decide whether it accepts that view.  There should have been a greater interface between the Committee on the Constitution and the preparation of the Bill.  That might have been beneficial.</P>
      <P>The question of the use of public funds in the promotion of a yes vote and the resultant breach of the Constitution brings us back to the difficult area of advocacy.  One way to advocate a case is by pamphlet rather than by newspaper advertising. In October 1995 the <i>ad hoc</i> Commission on Referendum Information used pamphlets, costing £134,000.  We are creating a gravy train for newspapers. I would hate to see the densely worded full page notices in newspapers which nobody reads.  That was confirmed by a study in Massachusetts in 1976.  People were asked how they came by information and by far the greatest proportion was by way of a pamphlet.  A very small proportion received information by way of newspaper advertisements.  A pamphlet going into every home may cost a great deal less, be as effective, and fulfil the obligations imposed upon us by the McKenna judgment and the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle raised the difficulty of the Northern Ireland question.  When the talks come to a successful conclusion, a proposition will be put to the people on both sides of the Border on the same day.  We may be putting a question which, on the day, does not involve a constitutional amendment.  In those circumstances I am unclear how the McKenna judgment would impact.  I see no difficulty there in promoting one side of the question.  In that instance it would be <Col N="573" /> improper that a small minority opposed to the question should be given equal space to the vast majority who would be likely to be in favour of it. Debate is important but it should reflect reality.</P>
    <P>The Government should be able to advocate its case and there should be a matter of choice.  If we get that wrong the electorate can kick us out.  I get impatient with people saying Members of these Houses do not reflect a particular point of view.  If people are unhappy with that they can elect somebody else who will represent that view after an election.  That is part of parliamentary democracy.  Nothing we do by way of legislation or otherwise should undermine that principle.</P>
    <P>It is true spending can affect the outcome.  We have introduced legislation on the spending of political parties in general elections&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in all elections.  If there is a principle it should be universal.</P>
      <P>There are other legislative models which would indicate ways it could be done.  The Canadian Referendum Bill, 1992, gives some examples of the way interested groups can make application to the commission to receive funds and have their case represented when it comes to a referendum.</P>
      <P>The Clerk of the Seanad will be a member of the commission.  In recent years the workload of the Clerk of the Seanad has become greater by way of constituency review commissions and other bodies.  The Clerk should be on these bodies but should be given the remuneration and resources required to fulfil the obligations which are increasingly put upon her by law.</P>
      <P>Section 2(7) of the Bill mentions &ldquo;a member of the Commission notifies the Minister that he or she is . . . temporarily unable to act.  . . &rdquo;.  How long is temporarily? Section 2(13) covers resources but section 2(1) it says that the Minister may &ldquo;if he or she considers it appropriate&rdquo; by order establish a commission.  I do not understand the need for the words &ldquo;if he or she considers it appropriate&rdquo;.  If it is considered as inappropriate, are they to do the same thing? This is just semantics but it is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of engaging consultants, people who can translate this opaque language into something ordinary people can understand should be employed and paid well.  The usual consultants have emerged, advertising agencies and so on but I would have a journalist do the job.  I have a vested interest here, having been one myself.  I spent most of my professional life translating scientific language into language people could understand.  There are many people with that ability.  They are important and the commission should make use of them to simplify the language.  The legislation introduced at the start of the century is easy to read as the language used was very plain.  We are constructing an edifice for the benefit of the legal industry where the lawyers have a ball and the State pays the fee.  Section 3(2)(b) mentions the presidential electorate <Col N="574" /> because it is the presidential electorate who vote in a referendum.</P>
    <P>Television advertising and submissions in writing and by electronic mail are taking up a great deal of time.  If we impose too many obligations on the commission, they may find it extremely difficult to get all the work done by the time the referendum is to be held.  We must bear in mind that the commission should be able to do its duty well.</P>
    <P>Section 7(4)(c), states that the Commission may refuse to make a declaration if the name of the body is identical with the name of any party registered in the Register of Political Parties.  This seems to be a disqualification of political parties although I am sure that is not what is intended. Section 7 (9)(b) states that a political party that is for the time being registered in the Register of Political Parties shall be deemed to be a body. One subsection of the Bill seems to say that a political party cannot be a body and in another that it can.  I am sure there is a reasonable explanation for this and I would like to hear it.  These technical aspects are a little obtuse but they must be given some consideration.</P>
    <P>I accept the need for the legislation based on the McKenna judgment.  The only alternative is to hold a constitutional referendum which might lead to further hearings in the Supreme Court. We need to vote on the Amsterdam Treaty.  I will enthusiastically advocate the adoption of the Treaty.  It is to our advantage to adopt it and I do not think that the reservations which have been expressed about it are real.  A referendum on the McKenna judgment would further delay a referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.  If this legislation is necessary to have the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty held on time, I support it.</P>

      <P>This is, of course, a very welcome provision.  I celebrate the McKenna judgment which seems to have infuriated the entire party political system.  Had I not been worried about the possibility of a large award of legal costs against me it might have been the Ryan judgment.  Prudence, not an attribute which is associated with me, got the better of me and I did not make the challenge but I am very glad it was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the party political system. I do not regard myself as a superior species as an independent politician.  It is, nevertheless, a mystery to me that political parties could accept the fact that governments could spend as much money as they saw fit advocating a particular outcome to a constitutional referendum.  Who would have set limits to that spending? No checks or balances would have existed except for the faint possibility, mentioned by Senator Dardis, that the electorate might dismiss the Government at the next election.  That would have been no use in this case because virtually every political party in the State had accepted the principle of the free use of taxpayers' money to advocate one side in a constitutional referendum.  The Green Party <Col N="575" /> was the only party not involved and the election of a Green Government was highly unlikely.  It was particularly disturbing that, for a long time. the principle was accepted.</P>
    <P>The current White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam is accepted as an honest effort, even by people who are usually critical of the Government's European policy.  It is a better document and makes a better case for the Treaty for being fair.  It is careful to avoid both excessive claims and scaremongering.</P>
    <P>I was wrong to advocate a no vote in the 1972 referendum on EEC entry.  I now attach great value to European cultural diversity and to the benefits we have received from being liberated from a single focus on the island between us and the rest of Europe.  The Government did not spend money on the 1972 rererendum.  Political parties and organisations such as farming organisations devoted resources because they believed that membership of the EEC was an important issue.  That is how it should be.  The referendum on the Single European Act was unexpected and was the outcome of a brave man's decision to contest something in the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court occasionally demonstrates the principle of the separation of the judicial and legislative powers by disagreeing with the Government's legal advice.  This separation is a necessary part of our constitutional arrangements and adds to my scepticism about the system of government of our neighbouring island.  Other people are, of course, entitled to run their own countries as they wish.  That is one of the reasons we chose not to be part of those constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a referendum was being held on a fundamental European issue and opinion in the country was closely divided.  A government, in its anxiety to have the referendum passed, would be tempted to spend a vast amount of money on the campaign.  Political parties and independent candidates spend money during election campaigns as though there were no tomorrow.  This is also done by individual candidates &mdash; one is running in an election and thinks that one is all right but all of a sudden Senator O'Toole produces yet another leaflet out of his 10,000 from the INTO and fools like me believe they have to respond.  If this happens to individuals there can be no doubt that it could also happen to parties and Governments.  Unfortunately, the Government's purse is bottomless.  Where will this end?</P>
    <P>Let me put an extreme position.  If the McKenna judgment is wrong, as many believe it to be, what measures are in place to prevent Governments spending £10 million or £20 million on the outcome of a referendum or spending so much money that every printer in the country is kept busy for the three weeks before a referendum? This would be a breach of the fundamental principles which the Department of the Environment and Local Government is trying to <Col N="576" /> implement but what would stop the Government doing so if it so decided? There was nothing in our laws which could have stopped it.  Even if there was such a measure we could have changed the law if the Government had a majority.  The only barrier which could have prevented a marginal abuse of power becoming a gross abuse of power was a judgment by the Supreme Court. This was why I ventured down the first step of that trail but then got scared and did not pursue it further.  Given the outcome I am sorry now but if the judgment had been different I would be glad that I did not go further.  The McKenna judgment was necessary.</P>
    <P>I never know whether the Attorney General's Office develops fits of pique but it appears that it has decided nothing can be done.  I have heard that people have been restricted from using State cars during elections.  This is to be encouraged as it is an abuse of power.  The Attorney General's Office is now attempting to say that all sorts of things cannot be done because of the Supreme Court judgment.  Many people see this as a way of softening up public opinion in advance of a referendum to reverse or dilute the McKenna judgment.  We should remember that all the Supreme Court decided was that Governments could not use public money to advocate a particular outcome to a referendum.  This seems the most logical decision to the average citizen because the alternative is unthinkable.</P>
    <P>Any Member of the Dáil can introduce a proposal to amend the Constitution but the practicality is that it is unlikely to be passed if Government does not support it.  However, the constitutional principle is that any Member of the Dáil can advocate a constitutional amendment.  If the Oireachtas passes such a Bill it goes to a referendum. Under the Constitution it is not the Government which <i>de jura</i> decides whether a constitutional amendment goes to the people. Such a decision is made by the Oireachtas, and the Dáil in particular, because this House, quite rightly, cannot introduce a constitutional amendment. One could have the ridiculous situation of a Government being defeated in the Dáil.  This almost happened in the horrendous pro-life amendment, horrendous in the sense of the experiences of everyone involved.  In that instance, a wording which the Government did not want went to the people because the Dáil decided not to follow the Government's instructions. What would have happened if the then Government had decided to spend a large amount of public money advocating a no vote? We would have been in a very peculiar position.</P>
    <P>People in Government forget that the Constitution is the property of the people, as are the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Elected representatives get annoyed when people like me give them lectures.  That is not what I mean.  One has to remember the constitutional hierarchy.  The people give us whatever power we have.  The Constitution is the contract between the people and the Oireachtas.  It is the rules under which <Col N="577" /> the people allow us to act in their name.  If we want to persuade them to change a constraint they have imposed on us or on society, then it seems a constitutional contradiction to use their money without their approval, regulation or control to do so.  I have long believed that the McKenna judgment was inevitable; it was a four to one decision.  As I said I wished to celebrate the McKenna judgment because it is very important.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a good idea and I am in favour of it.  I hope that imagination is used so that we will no longer have dull, long documents.  Let us find creative ways to stimulate debate; conflict is one way of doing so.  My only regret about this Bill is that it will not fund conflict, by &ldquo;conflict&rdquo; I mean debate.  There will be such a careful balance now that we will not have interaction.  That is why I regret the lack of any attempt to explore the possibility of funding both sides of a referendum. I appreciate the difficulties of doing so, particularly when one has a 99 per cent to 1 per cent position.  However, we ought to have introduced legislation which would address the possibility of funding both sides so that we have a real debate. As it stands it will be like an economist giving both sides of the argument &mdash; attempting to be fair but not addressing the issue.</P>

      <P>I do not know where Senator Ryan got the impression that every member of the Government and the House does not share his views on the McKenna judgment.  I have grave difficulties with some of the interpretations put on the judgment in relation to other matters.  If anyone kept records of letters sent at the time of the judgment they would find one from me which stated that I agreed with the principle of what was being outlined. I agree that the Constitution is the people's document and that the Government should not be in a position to spend money advocating change in a biased manner.  However, I have great difficulties with some of the subsequent interpretations by Attorneys General on party political funding and other matters raised by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The Constitution is the people's document and I have no difficulty with Governments having the right to introduce proposals to change that document. They can advocate whatever decision they wish but should not spend taxpayers' money in a one sided campaign.  I would not agree with the original Fine Gael proposition that taxpayers' money should be used to engender debate where Ministers debate both sides of the argument and the Referendum Commission would then adjudicate as to whether they were being fair and accurate. Such a position would be untenable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I will deal with some of the points raised.  As regards the McKenna judgment, the view has <Col N="578" /> been put forward by the Fine Gael Party that the Government is entitled to campaign for a yes vote, irrespective of the McKenna judgment, and that the role of the Referendum Commission is to adjudicate whether the Government is impartial in the expenditure of public funds.  I do not understand this argument put forward.  On the one hand, we are expected to be fair and even handed but, on the other, we can advocate one side of the argument with a Referendum Commission set up to adjudicate whether we are being fair.  If money is spent on one side of the argument, one cannot be fair.  Fine Gael's argument is rather strange.  Since the McKenna judgment, it has been generally accepted the Government may not spend public funds advocating a particular result in a referendum to the detriment of people with opposing views.  I cannot square the Fine Gael position and that of Senator Doyle with what is generally believed outside the Fine Gael Party to be the position at the moment.</P>
    <P>As regards the political debate on the referendum, there is nothing in the Supreme Court decision to prevent politicians from engaging in debate on the referendum.  The publication of material by the commission should assist politicians and others engaging in such debate as objective information will be made available by an independent body.  This means real issues can be debated as opposed to the propaganda of one side or the other.  It should help the debate that there will be an independent and objective body disseminating information.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses expressed fears that this might end up being very sterile and Senators Doyle and Walsh made a point about there being passion in the debate, I believe we are giving the commission sufficient scope to generate that passion by not being prescriptive about what it does. While I do not want to be seen as giving directions to the Referendum Commission, I stress there is nothing to stop the commission from organising or facilitating a debate between someone from one side of this House who favours the Amsterdam Treaty and one from the other side who is against it.  There is nothing to stop it from having people from outside either House who feel strongly and passionately about this issue to do that as well.  There is nothing to stop it, if it so decides, from having a televised debate between such people.  I hate to think the Referendum Commission would feel inhibited in what it intends to do.  The only limitation on it will be its members' imagination in bringing about debates.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle referred to the Danish proposals for referendum information.  An essential part of those proposals is the division of funding made available by the Danish Government.  As I understand it, the fund is divided into two, one half is paid to grass roots groupings which are in favour of and against the proposal and the other half is distributed as follows: two-thirds to be divided among political parties in proportion to their electoral support and the balance to be divided equally among three groups &mdash; the European <Col N="579" /> movement and two organised groups which are anti-EU.  With respect to the Danish proposals, I cannot see them working in this country.  If the same scheme were proposed here, I believe we would end up in the High Court very quickly.  The approach upon which the Government has decided is to give the funds to a statutory commission to set out the arguments in a fair manner. It will then be up to us to make use of that information.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh referred to the role of the commission in fostering, promoting or facilitating debate on the proposals or the subject of a referendum. The commission will be independent in its functions, and I have outlined that the only limitation on it will be its members' imagination.</P>
    <P>Senators Walsh and Dardis mentioned the use of leaflets as opposed to newspaper notices.  I agree with this.  In my experience, the leaflet which clearly explains something is very useful in informing the electorate, and I am sure that will be taken into account by the commission.  I learned the lesson the hard way in the 1989 election that newspaper advertising on a large scale is not an effective way of putting across one's message, and it is even less effective if it consists of densely printed pages of arguments for and against.</P>
    <P>I wish to clarify for those Senators who are members of the All Party Committee on the Constitution that this Bill is not an attempt to gazump the committee, as was recently suggested by a member.  The urgency of having something in place on a statutory basis before the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty is what prompted me to introduce this Bill and I was instructed by the Government to do so.</P>
    <P>I have been asked why I did not stick with the existing <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement.  One of the major criticisms of the last referendum was information was not issued in a digestible form.  There was no great public debate on it on television and radio and it was not discussed in detail, when it was discussed at all.  The reason for that might have been the presidential election.  However, I believe the forthcoming referendum is so important that the power granted in this Bill, aside from the powers granted by virtue of its being established on a statutory footing, to allow the Referendum Commission to direct RTÉ, could not have been on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Along with others I have outlined, that is one of the major reasons this Bill has been introduced now.</P>
    <P>As regards Senator Dardis's point about a commission member being temporarily unable, the commission will generally act in about three to four weeks.  Since, if a person were unavailable for two or more weeks, the commission could not possibly wait, this measure will allow the commission continue its work.  As regards the Senator's query about the presidential electorate, that is used because those who can vote in a referendum are the same as those who can vote in a presidential election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The Senator referred to the section in the Bill which would give the Minister the right to set up a permanent referendum commission if that were deemed appropriate.  The principle behind the Bill is that a commission may be established, by order of the Minister, at a referendum.  The Minister has the discretion to decide whether such a commission should be established depending on the circumstances of a referendum.  In the normal course of events it would be expected, and would certainly be my intention, that a commission would be set up.  When I say &ldquo;in the normal course of events&rdquo; I am referring to the existence of arguments on both sides of an issue.  A situation could, however, exist where an amendment might be of a very technical nature and everyone might agree with it.  In that event, it might not be deemed necessary to carry out an information campaign or establish a referendum commission.</P>
    <P>If I were to specify that the Minister &ldquo;shall&rdquo; set up a referendum commission, I would be obliged to come into both Houses and pass a Bill which would allow me not to do so.  The provision is a purely technical one.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 7 (7) is not intended to disqualify political parties as those are recognised under this Bill.  It seeks to prevent other groups with a similar name to an existing party seeking the commission's approval.</P>
    <P>I presume the commission will secure the services of legal people to put the arguments for and against an issue.  Those arguments should be drawn up with regard to submissions made to the commission and general knowledge.  I hope that when legal arguments are drawn up on both sides, the commission will then hire the necessary experts to produce the information and write it in plain English in order that people will understand the various issues involved.  Those people may be drawn from the areas of communications, advertising or journalism.  The commission will have the freedom to do that as the Bill is non-prescriptive.</P>

      <P>Section 3 deals with the functions of the commission.  I have no difficulty with the commission and I am thankful to the people who have come forward and offered their services as members of it.  I do, however, have some difficulty with the commission's functions.  The Supreme Court has decreed that the State cannot spend public money arguing one side of a referendum over another.  I do not believe the solution to that problem has been addressed in this legislation. The Government, in this Bill, proposes to set up a commission which will have the role of arguing both sides of a debate.  I believe that, in doing this, the Government is setting up a process <Col N="582" /> which could lead to a sterile and artificial referendum. That is what the Fine Gael Party is concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting any kind of ulterior motive lies behind this section.  The injunction on the commission to be fair to all concerned is similar to RTÉ's legal obligations. Those of us who have been on the wrong side of successive referenda would not be under any illusion that RTÉ was fair in these matters.  Its distribution, for example, of party political broadcasts has always been based on party political representation and not on equivalence in terms of portraying both sides of an argument and the way in which a topic is presented in news bulletins always represents party political structures.</P>
      <P>If we are to be fair we must ensure that all sides of an argument are seriously debated.  The Maastricht Treaty represented a desecration of debate as the only two issues discussed during the referendum were abortion and neutrality when the real nub of the Treaty was Economic and Monetary Union.  I sent a script to the national media every two days for four weeks which dealt exclusively with the economic issues of the referendum. Irrespective of whether my views were right or wrong, the economic issue was the major one involved.  I watched vast quantities of waste paper accumulate which only added to the Minister's waste problems.</P>
      <P>The commission will find it difficult to be fair. If it succeeds in working out a way of being fair, perhaps it could pass on the message to our broadcasters.  We cannot tell the print media what to do but RTÉ and other broadcast media do have an obligation to be fair.  I do not want anybody to receive special privileges but, in the interests of a good debate, all sides of an argument must be well articulated.  A one sided debate results in people losing interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ryan said, the obligation to be fair to all is based largely on the Broadcasting Acts.  We could be philosophical and ask what is fairness.  One man's fairness is someone else's unfairness.  If 99 per cent of people advocate an issue and we must have a referendum, is it fair that funding and air time should be divided 50-50? That is why the term &ldquo;fair to all&rdquo; is used rather than equal.  I do not want to refer to any particular case as there is an ongoing court case in relation to party political broadcasts.</P>
      <P>I dealt with the issue of a sterile debate on Second Stage.  A lack of imagination in how the Referendum Commission approaches it and a lack of participation by political parties will make this debate sterile.  If the debate is sterile it will be as much the fault of Members of this House as anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the Bill which deals with RTÉ is a necessary provision.  There is a danger that people will decide the discussion of this matter on the basis of whether it is good television.  They <Col N="583" /> will forget it is a public service to have a debate, even if it happens to be as dry as dust and bad television.  The Referendum Commission can instruct on the televising of a debate and it is up to the participants whether it is lively.  None of us can be sure, but I think it will be a lively debate and we have given the commission every means to ensure that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Senators who participated in the debate for facilitating the Bill's speedy passage through the House, which I appreciate.  The Bill represents an advance in the provision of information to the electorate about proposals in all future referenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into the matter in great detail as I have already mentioned it on Second Stage. However, I freely admit, as I did in the Dáil, that we are in a learning curve in relation to this matter. I do not know how effective it will be, although I think it will work well and an imaginative approach by the Referendum Commission should be helpful. <Col N="585" /> I do not have a closed mind with regard to information for referenda.  Should the All Party Committee on the Constitution make further recommendations, I will be pleased to look at them and will try to take them on board.  Equally, if the Referendum Commission comes forward with other ideas after its experience with the Amsterdam Treaty referendum, I will take them on board.  The £2.5 million being made available to the commission will not restrict the information it can give out.  Obviously, it does not have to spend it all.</P>
    <P>I regard this legislation as important and I thank Members for their assistance in passing the Bill as speedily as they have done.  I also wish to thank my officials and the officials of the Seanad for their co-operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce a housing strategy capable of addressing the problems of first-time house buyers, deplores the lack of investment in public sector housing and calls upon the Government to implement as a matter of urgency the Fine Gael proposal to exempt first-time buyers of second hand houses from stamp duty.</P>
      <P>This is a timely motion in view of the increase in house prices.  A recent survey carried out by the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute revealed that house prices had risen by 50 per cent in the last three years and will increase by over 12 per cent in 1998.  Prices have soared to an all time high and have increased by 26 per cent in the past 12 months, with prices for houses and apartments in Dublin outstripping the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Demand is fuelled by potential house buyers being compelled to buy now because they are worried they will be unable to own their own house if they postpone purchasing.  Increases in take home pay following the budget and falling mortgage interest rates have led to recent substantial house price increases.  Already the average price of a modest, second hand artisan dwelling  <Col N="586" /> in the capital is over £100,000.  In the past year prices rose higher than anybody could have forecast, confounding the experts.  At public auctions houses have often been sold for twice the guide price.</P>
    <P>The nature of the boom is underlined by the fact that it is not simply confined to Dublin. House prices have also risen in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  The price of second hand houses grew by over 25 per cent between 1994 and 1996.  A colleague told me a few days ago that in a village outside Dublin a two-bedroomed house on the main street was sold at auction for £250,000.  That gives the House an indication of the enormous increase in house prices.</P>
    <P>Increased take home pay, falling interest rates and the unparallelled willingness of financial institutions to give loan approvals are not the only causes for house price increases.  The extremely favourable demographic trend must also be taken into account.  The age group of 24 to 39 years is the crucial house buying age group and, by virtue of our high birth rate in the early 1970s, people in this age group are flooding the residential property market today.  A recent survey carried out by the Society of Chartered Surveyors indicates that demand for housing in Dublin will outstrip supply well into the millennium. This will increase pressure for more zoning of lands and will force up the prices of houses in the suburbs.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State addressed the House on social housing recently, he said he was aware of the significant shortage of affordable housing and, having regard to the trend in house prices as a consequence, he would appoint consultants to undertake a study of the factors underlying that trend.  The study would involve an analysis of the main factors influencing increases in house prices since 1994, with particular emphasis on the Dublin region.  This study is a waste of money.  We are already aware of the cause of increased house prices &mdash; demand outstrips supply. As a result, modest houses are sold at exorbitant prices.  That trend gives young couples no chance of buying their own homes.</P>
    <P>Another factor generating the current level of house prices is the shortage of zoned serviced land in Dublin.  Many of my fellow councillors have been severely criticised for going against the advice of planners and rezoning land where services were not available.  They were right to zone lands for housing and there is a grave responsibility on Government to provide the necessary finances to service zoned land.  It is not a shortage of land but a shortage of serviced land which is causing the escalation in house prices and the provision of serviced land should be one of the Government's priorities.  A fund has been initiated to assist local authorities to increase the supply of serviced land but, in the current situation, that funding is inadequate.  The construction industry, too, has identified the lack of suitable serviced land for development as a contributing factor to the escalation in house prices.  There is <Col N="587" /> a grave responsibility on Government to provide more serviced land as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Another factor which has not helped housing supply is the punitive rate of stamp duty on second hand houses.  It acts as a disincentive to vendors trading up.  In an attempt to ease the burden on first time buyers of second hand houses, my party has proposed the abolition of stamp duty for the first £100,000 spent on such houses. This concession would save cash strapped first time buyers up to £6,000 on the purchase of their homes.  At present, stamp duty is a massive disincentive to the purchase of a second hand house and is driving young people to live further from urban centres and, probably, their place of work. The removal of stamp duty on second hand houses will stimulate the second hand market and relieve the current enormous demand on new houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider implementing effective measures to encourage the rental of houses.  At present, families are unwilling to rent houses because a landlord can ask them to leave at one month's notice.</P>
    <P>These are some of the issues the Government should address to ease the problems of first time buyers and make housing slightly more affordable for young people.  However, I recently became aware of another practice which affects houses being built outside Dublin and which the Minister of State should ask builders to explain. In some estates houses are built in phases and there can be a price differential of £20,000 between, say, the first and third phase.  Building costs could not have increased by that amount and the cost of land would have been included in the first assessment.  This price hiking does not happen in Dublin.  The Minister of State should address it.</P>
    <P>In addition to the lack of affordable houses there is a short supply of social housing.  My local authority, Dublin Corporation, carried out an assessment of housing needs in 1996.  It revealed that there were 3,000 people on the housing list, 300 senior citizens, 143 homeless families and 500 homeless single persons.  Taken with the 900 applicants in private rented accommodation supported by the Eastern Health Board, it produced a total of approximately 5,000 people on the housing list.  After 1 November 1997 the corporation revised upwards the number of applicants on the list and there are now more than 6,000 applicants on the housing and transfer list.</P>
    <P>This increase has been fuelled by the phenomenal growth in house prices in recent times.  A number of young people on modest incomes bought houses in Dublin over the past number of years.  However, young people today are unable to do so and find themselves on local authority housing lists.  I am sure the same trend has occurred throughout the country.  For example, 60 to 70 points are required to obtain a modest one bedroom flat in Dublin.  Dublin Corporation also finds itself in difficulty in that when it will provide <Col N="588" /> the 700 extra units in the house building programme over the next number of years it will have run out of building land and will then be unable to provide further housing.  Our only hope will be with the Dublin Docklands Authority.</P>
    <P>We pride ourselves on being a nation of owner occupiers but, unfortunately, this has become something of a myth.  While we enjoy the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy there are disadvantages. We appear to be developing a compensation culture and our roads are more clogged with cars.  Above all, the huge increases in property prices means that average house prices cost £50,000 more than the person on an average wage can normally borrow.  There is an obligation on the Government to provide a mechanism to ensure that the price of new houses will remain within the reach of young married couples.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirím fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Teach arís agus tá súil agam go mbeidh díospóireacht maith againn.  I second the motion.  This is an important resolution.  There is nothing more basic than the provision of decent accommodation for oneself and one's family. There are two categories involved &mdash; those who can buy their own homes and those who must rely on the State to provide them.  I am concerned at the outset with those who are trying to have a family, build their lives and make the best of what they have.</P>
      <P>Speculation in the market is one of the reasons why prices have increased so much.  The value of building land is rocketing.  It is out of control in County Louth, County Dublin and elsewhere and is putting the capacity of people to buy or build their own homes beyond their reach.</P>
      <P>The Government must be seen to act on this matter.  Land banks which are under the remit of local authorities should be made available at a reduced price to those who wish to build their own homes.  Couples with under a certain income should qualify for a site from a serviced land bank at a knock down price equivalent to or less than what the local authority paid for it.  This would assist them in building their homes.</P>
      <P>The question of rezoning applies to councillors and local authorities who are working on development plans.  While it is desirable to continue to rezone areas where there will be a need for future development, there should be no windfall gain to the owners.  We should either tax them or fix the price at which the land can or will be sold to the unfortunate person who wants to build a home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a society we have values and aspirations. We should do everything to assist young people to buy or build their own homes.  Some years ago builders were encouraged to build what were known as starter homes.  The shell of the house was constructed and the occupier was expected to finish the job.  However, a radical approach is now required.  Couples face the reality that if they buy their own home both of them will work for most <Col N="589" /> of their lives.  That is not something which every couple wishes and it is not desirable that it should be a necessity.</P>
    <P>Because of the current levels of interest rates, it has never been cheaper to borrow.  However, ten years ago, interest rates were twice their present levels.  People are borrowing more today because of the increases in house prices.  When interest rates increase, as will inevitably be the case over the period of any mortgage, couples who have borrowed to the hilt will be crucified. This is will arise in three or four years.</P>
    <P>I recently heard it proposed on national radio that the housing density limit in built up areas should be increased from eight to ten houses to the acre to ten to 12 houses.  While I cannot speak for Dublin city, this would be a retrograde step. If smaller houses in greater numbers are built, whether private or public, the amenity values of the area will be decreased and will reduce the potential quality of life to which the occupiers of such houses are entitled.  We should adhere to current regulations on the number of houses per acre that can be built.  Indeed, we should keep the density as low as possible to enable occupiers fully enjoy their amenities.</P>
    <P>Every county councillor and Senator is active in the area of public housing.  We can never build enough houses.  A continuous building programme is required.  Following the birth of their first child, young families in Drogheda wait at least three years before they get a local authority house.  In the meantime their community welfare officer will assist them with the rent of their accommodation.  The amount of money spent on rental subsidy in the past two years in Counties Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan has increased from £2.2 million to £3.3 million.</P>
    <P>I understand &mdash; the Minister of State can correct me &mdash; that approximately £60 million per annum is spent on subsidising rents nationally. Large sums are spent on subsidising people on the housing list when more could be invested in the building of houses.  More houses built will mean less spent on rented accommodation resulting in a better quality of life for those involved.  Some of the rented accommodation in County Louth is disgraceful.  It is rat infested, damp and wet and the children are often ill.  We must look at the social problems created by longer local authority waiting lists.</P>
    <P>Many elderly people wish to move out of three bedroomed local authority housing into purpose built OPDs.  Others wish to release the equity of their private homes so they can purchase smaller flats or apartments.  All citizens over the age of 65 who wish to sell their homes to provide funds for their retirement or because of ill-health should receive tax relief and be exempt from stamp duty.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="590" />&ldquo;Seanad Éireann, conscious of the impact of the recent increases in house prices on first time house purchasers, welcomes:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the commissioning by the Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal of a study into the factors underlying the recent house price increases particularly in the Dublin area and likely future developments;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the measures taken by the Government in advance of the results of the study, including the special £15 million fund to assist local authorities service additional land for housebuilding, and the improvements to the terms of the social housing measures announced by the Minister in November last; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the Government's commitment to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary groups and the increased financial provision for these programmes in 1998.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an Seandóir agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  The Fine Gael Party's motion is disingenuous and opportunistic.  I will make specific criticisms and refer to its flaws later.  Members have a shared concern about the impact of recent increases in house prices, particularly on first time purchasers.  I am sure our concerns are shared by the Government.  It is correct that an issue such as the impact of rising house prices is fully teased out and debated.  It is also necessary that appropriate action is taken.  However, it is important to choose our words and proposed solutions carefully. Ill-judged statements, arising from understandable concerns, have the capacity to exacerbate rather than help the situation.  Members of the House and other public representatives should not indulge in knee jerk reactions or proposed remedies which display a lack of understanding or analysis of the real position.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, who has responsibility for housing and urban renewal, to the House.  Members should acknowledge that this is the third occasion on which he has addressed housing matters in the Seanad since his appointment.  The Action Programme for the Millennium emphasises the Government's commitment to the deeply held ideal of many people, home ownership.  We can be proud that Ireland is one of the leading nations in terms of home ownership.  We must strive to preserve and improve this record. Nobody wishes the aspiration of home ownership to be threatened by rising house prices.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has arranged for the carrying out of a major consultancy project to examine the factors giving rise to recent house price increases and assess the likely future developments. It is on this type of planned approach that we are more likely to base the foundations <Col N="591" /> upon which proper remedial decisions can be taken.  We are aware of many of the factors underlying the significant increase in house prices.  The economy is performing extremely well and there is increased demand for accommodation. There is a large increase in employment and in incomes.  Interest rates are low and further reductions are predicted.  In addition, mortgage finance is readily available.  The supply side is responding well to increased demand.  New records for house completions have been set in each of the past three years.  I look forward to the Minister of State's comments on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party motion is opportunistic and lacks credibility, particularly in light of that party's record on stamp duty on housing.  The previous Government's action in increasing stamp duty from 6 per cent to 9 per cent on many houses flies in the face of what that party is now proposing.  Political credibility is involved in this issue.  If parties and politicians say one thing in Government and the contrary in Opposition, it fuels the public's disenchantment and lack of respect for the integrity of politics in general.  This does not help the democratic process.</P>
    <P>The removal of stamp duty is much more likely to benefit vendors than purchasers.  In the past, when housing grants were available, there was a perception that they allowed builders to increase prices.  As a result successive Governments have rolled back from trying to assist first time house purchasers through grant aid.  When in Government the Fine Gael Party introduced the seaside resort scheme.  My perception is that, as a result, house prices in general escaled to unrealistic levels. Houses with less than 1,000 square feet, which probably cost approximately £40,000 to build, are sold for £90,000 or £100,000 giving developers more than 100 per cent profit.  It is an inflationary scheme which has added to the escalating price of houses.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the need to address the requirements of first time purchasers and I accept part of the principle behind the motion.  I am sure the Minister of State and Government will also take it on board.  Interest rates are particularly low at present and, as a previous speaker said, if there are difficulties regarding the implementation of EMU, they could have an adverse effect on the rates.  Economists and commentators predict that there will be a continual stabilisation and probable reduction in interest rates.  However, if they go in the opposite direction, it will be extremely painful for many people.</P>
    <P>One of the issues which could be considered is the reintroduction of full mortgage relief for first time purchasers at their marginal rate of tax rather than at the standard rate.  It is incongruous that there are schemes which involve tax breaks for investors who acquire and rent out section 23 and section 26 properties.  These schemes have been successful in ensuring the provision of good private rented accommodation, but it is inequitable that the same position in terms of tax allowances <Col N="592" /> at marginal rates are not afforded to first time purchasers in particular.  People who have houses often have a capital profit with which to buy their next investment.  However, first time buyers will find it increasingly difficult to purchase a house and this aspect should be examined.</P>
    <P>The role of housing co-operatives should be considered.  It is interesting that people who were highly critical of the rezoning of land in the past are now of the view that the failure to rezone more land is contributing to the escalation of house prices.  A more pro-active role for local authorities in the provision of private serviced sites would be a beneficial initiative in terms of assisting the system.  Perhaps our traditional outlook on the length of mortgages, from ten to 25 years, should change.  For example, in the United States people take out mortages over much longer periods of time and often look to the next generation to complete them.  Perhaps this idea could be investigated.</P>
    <P>The Government's initiatives so far in the housing area have been productive and positive. There is a 19 per cent increase in expenditure on local authority housing this year and a significant increase in capital funding for water and sewerage schemes.  These will assist the sector and I urge the Minister of State to continue these types of initiatives.  I look forward to the publication of the report and a debate on it in the House when substantive suggestions based on proper research can be made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment.  Although there is nothing of merit in the motion, I welcome it in so far as it provides another opportunity for the Seanad to discuss housing.  It is interesting that this is the third debate on this subject in less than three months.  There was no significant debate on this area during the past three years in the other House.</P>
      <P>Housing is a huge issue which must be confronted in a well planned and systematic way.  I am very encouraged by the attitude and approach of the Government since coming into office.  The Minister was right to commission a study in order that future policy initiatives and directions can be based on the best available research and projections. This is the way in which to proceed.  I have seen many half-cocked ideas from political parties on the issue of housing since I joined a local authority in 1979.  For example, the £5,000 grant given to those who handed back their local authority house and moved into the private sector had disastrous consequences on communities in Cork. It was a matter of flying by the seat of one's pants.  As with the motion before the House tonight, it was not examined in terms of its implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the number of initiatives taken by him since his appointment.  I look forward to the report he commissioned. Decisions made in future will at least be based on the best available information.  I welcome the <Col N="593" /> significant increase of 18.9 per cent on monies allocated for housing in 1998 over 1997.  In advance of the findings of the study it is a very good idea to provide £15 million specifically for the provision of serviced land.  The provision of additional resources for An Bord Pleanála and planning was long overdue.  Delays in planning resulted in delays in house building and consequently pushed up costs.</P>
    <P>These are among the measures I welcome and which confirm that the Government is taking the issue of housing very seriously, as it ought to. Like every other citizen, I am very concerned about the direction in which house prices are going.  I do not have the solution to the problem &mdash; if I did I would not be here.  We are in a free market economy and we can only do so much.  I am very concerned that young people are committing more of their income to servicing mortgages than they can carry through over a prolonged period.  I wonder who will suffer? Many young people may be leaving hostages to fortune. I do not know if we have the culture to enable us spread a mortgage over two generations, given the mobility of young workers.  I know many young graduates with high earning power who wish to go abroad for a number of years.  Therefore, while spreading a mortgage over two generations may be an option, I do not see it as a measure to relieve the problems young people are taking upon themselves.  I ask young people to ensure the commitments they take on do not place too great a burden on them or their children or make it impossible for them to afford to have children.  That would be a horrible scenario because a house is a home.  Young people must think through the implications of their decisions.</P>
    <P>There is great merit in the shared ownership scheme as administered by local authorities.  It enables low income families to own their own houses after a given period.  I would like the Minister to examine the possibility of further extending the scheme and providing more resources for it.  It is a guaranteed way in which families on low incomes can own their own houses without inflicting too many wounds on their family budgets.</P>
    <P>A feature of Irish life is the desertion of cities as places in which to live.  There is a huge amount of vacant space over shops in city centres.  One sees lights in every window of first and second floor rooms over shops when travelling at night through Paris and most other European cities because people are living there.  I do not know why we scurry out of shops at 5.30 p.m. and leave the remainder of the building vacant for the rest of the day.  There is great potential in the enormous amount of empty space over shops.  We could tap into it if we designed schemes based, for example, on proper security, as living in a city centre without proper security is not an attractive option.</P>
    <P>There must be many single people such as myself who would be delighted to live in the city <Col N="594" /> centre.  It would enable us walk to the library, have coffee and do all the things people like to do when retired.  It would also mean living in much less space, but units would have to be properly designed and secured.  I would like this issue to be investigated by the Minister.  In Cork there are one or two pilot schemes which are working exceptionally well.  These schemes should be evaluated to see how they could be extended. City centre living is becoming fashionable. Twenty years ago everybody rushed headlong to the suburbs, using up valuable land and funds in servicing land.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that local authorities &mdash; at least the one of which I am a member &mdash; are buying all sorts of vacant sites in order to build in-fill housing schemes.  Local authorities must accelerate the pace at which they buy vacant houses, renovate them and make them available to those looking for housing.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned by the manner in which the rental subsidy scheme administered by the health boards is working.  It is a terribly costly scheme and I am certain it is not yielding good value for public money.  Senator O'Dowd pointed out that £60 million has been spent on it, which is dead money.  The housing stock would be added to if it were used to buy houses.  However, we are adding nothing to the public housing stock by spending this money.  A further concern is the lack of a proper inspectorate or anybody to oversee the quality or value of the scheme.  I ask the Minister to evaluate the scheme and to examine whether the money could give a better return in the context of people earnestly seeking ways and means of addressing the needs of those looking for public housing.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his work.  There is great scope for doing more.  I am uncertain about the answer to the problem of escalating prices &mdash; perhaps it will be taken care of by the market.</P>

      <P>This is the third occasion in as many months that I have addressed the House on major areas of my responsibilities as Minister for Housing and Urban Renewal.  We have had very constructive and well informed debates on housing policy and homelessness.  On one occasion Deputy Quill put down a motion on housing, but only one Fine Gael Senator spoke on it.  There is a renewed interest now because of political events.</P>

The reference in the motion to the lack of investment in public sector housing is equally wide of the mark as is the suggestion that the Government lacks a strategy to address the problems of first time purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I and my Government colleagues are acutely conscious that we inherited the difficulties which rising house prices have caused and are causing <Col N="596" /> for first time purchasers from the outgoing Government.  It was for this reason more than any other that I commissioned the study into the factors underlying recent increases in house prices, with particular reference to the situation in the Dublin area.  I am particularly concerned about the implications for first time buyers, and affordability for house purchasers is among the matters being specifically examined in the study. The results of the study will inform Government decisions in relation to tackling the problems arising from increasing house prices.  I anticipate this study will be concluded by the end of March.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle condemned this study, describing it as a waste of money.  Yet it was the leader of Senator Doyle's party, while Taoiseach, who said that such a study should be undertaken.

      <P>It is difficult for those caught in the bind of rising house prices.  We should work together for a solution and not play petty politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advance of completion of the study, the Government has taken positive action to increase the supply of housing, most notably through the £15m special provision for servicing land and also by significantly increasing the various limits for the voluntary housing and shared ownership schemes.  These initiatives have been referred to already in the debate and Senators will be aware that steps have been taken in this area.  The Government has also acted to reduce delays in the planning system through additional staffing resources and new legislation to increase the number of members of An Bord Pleanála.  As indicated in the amendment to the motion, the Government is working hard across the range of housing issues.  Not only are we committed to a continuing house construction programme by local authorities and voluntary housing groups, but we have significantly boosted investment in <Col N="597" /> this area in 1998.  Contrary to the scurrilous terms of this motion, which states &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann deplores the failure of the Government to produce a housing strategy.  . . &ldquo; the Government acted instantly on coming into office, in sharp contrast to the inactivity of those who went before.</P>
    <P>Few topics have generated as much recent discussion and debate as house prices, which is perfectly understandable.  Housing is one of the most fundamental human needs and the purchase of a house is by far the most significant financial commitment in most people's lifetimes.  That is why I appointed consultants to examine the factors underlying the recent increases in house prices, particularly in the Dublin area.  We should be wary about falling for simplistic and ill-considered ideas like the current suggestions to trick about with stamp duty rates, particularly when the party floating these notions was part of a Government that saw fit to suddenly jack up stamp duty rates from 6 per cent to 9 per cent on certain houses last year.</P>

That has been the subject of a number of recent newspaper articles.</P>

      <P>Like most Senators, I read with great interest last Sunday reactions to Fine Gael's proposals in this regard.  Rarely, if ever, have I seen a proposal to reduce taxes been so comprehensively rubbished by commentators.  Stamp duty is, of course, primarily a matter for the Minister for Finance.  This, however, does not prevent us from having our own views on the subject and I will personally admit to having some sympathy towards prospective purchasers of second hand houses in relation to the costs which stamp duty impose.  However, the Fine Gael proposal is naive and not necessarily the best way forward.  It was quite obvious that there was an absence of real consideration when the proposals were being formulated.</P>
      <P>Some key questions must be asked of Fine Gael.  Is it genuinely concerned about the plight of young house seekers or are we being treated to brazen by-election gimmickry?</P>

      <P>What initiatives did Fine Gael take in Government to halt spiralling house prices? House prices were spiralling when we came into power.  Why did Fine Gael increase stamp duty on certain houses and make thousands of houses inaccessible to young buyers as a result? This sort of half baked proposal gives politics a bad name. It smacks of the worst kind of opportunism, but the voters of Limerick East and Dublin North will not be fooled.  It is extraordinary that a party which left Government last July should now come up with a proposal which is the exact opposite of what they did in Government.  The stamp duty hike was the brainchild of the Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  We all know how Fine Gael was brainwashed by the parties of the Left when in Government.  I hear there are merger talks between Democratic Left and Labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any reasonable person can only form the view that this Government is seeking to confront the problem of rising house prices.</P>
      <P>Abolition of stamp duty on second hand houses purchased by first time buyers has been estimated by the Department of Finance to cost somewhere in the region of £40 million.  One question immediately springs to mind.  If the State were to forgo these funds, would the prospective purchasers benefit or would the vendors? That is a crucial question which Fine Gael ignored in this rushed policy.  The proposals are in stark contrast to the little known but well targeted exemption from stamp duty that is available to shared owners, mentioned by Senator Quill, who purchase second hand houses.  As this scheme is available to persons of limited means, the exemption helps people who need it most and does not distort the market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's priority is to promote conditions conducive to an orderly and healthy housing <Col N="599" /> market.  The consultants' report will help us in doing that, but it cannot be expected to conjure up magic responses to the complex interplay of market forces that determine house prices.  What it should do is bring greater clarity to an issue that has been bedevilled by a deal of misinformation, misguided speculation and sheer hype.  The study will help to inform policy and I and the Government will review all available options in the light of its conclusions.</P>
    <P>The fundamental demand and supply factors in the market are fairly obvious: the number of people seeking houses; the finance they can raise for that purpose and how much it costs them; the supply of houses and how it is distributed relative to demand.  As commentators such as the Central Bank have pointed out, house price increases are a by-product of our recent economic success. However, there are also more intangible forces influencing how the fundamental demand and supply factors interact to determine prices.  The perceptions, views, aims and expectations of buyers, builders and lenders have a major bearing on the decisions that are taken in the market-place. I am concerned that these have in recent times been influenced too much by hype.  We have all seen headlines about prices going through the roof.  The message being given is that one had better get in now or be faced with much higher prices in a year or even six months time.  While prices have risen steeply &mdash; at some locations particularly so &mdash; the last thing we need is the promotion of panic buying.</P>
    <P>Another example of harmful hype is doomsday prophecy about scarcity in the supply of houses and building land.  House buyers are being encouraged to believe that if they do not buy now, at whatever cost, they may lose the chance of ever owning their own home.  The fact is that housing supply is responding well to demand.  We have set new records of housing output in each of the past three years in succession.  Last year 38,842 new dwellings were completed.  This represents an increase of over 80 per cent in output since 1993.  Another record level of output is in prospect for 1998 and the medium term supply outlook is, therefore, positive.</P>
    <P>As regards land for housing, the Government has not waited for the consultants' report.  We gave a commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to developing serviced sites to accelerate the supply of new houses to meet rising demands.  I wrote that into the Government programme. To give effect to this commitment and address concerns about the availability of suitably zoned serviced land, a special fund has been established to assist in the provision of water and sewerage services to open up land for residential development.  The 1998 public capital programme contains a sum of £5 million as the first tranche of a £15 million fund which will be available over the three year period commencing in 1998.</P>
    <P>My Department wrote to local authorities on 11 December 1997 asking them to nominate, by <Col N="600" /> the end of January this year, proposals already with the Department or to submit new proposals for water and sewerage schemes to be partfinanced under the initiative.  I am pleased that a significant number of proposals have been received and are currently being evaluated in my Department.  We expect to be in a position to make an announcement approving proposed schemes under the initiative within the next few weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Schemes will be approved at a rate of 40 per cent of the cost approved by my Department with the balance being provided by local authority contributions, ultimately funded through development levies.  When these contributions are taken into account, a total of £37.5 million will be provided for the delivery of water and sewerage services under the initiative.  In all, this should provide about 37,500 additional sites over and above serviced land already available or in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>As well as the funding provided under this initiative specifically for the purposes of opening up land for residential development, a further £172 million in capital funding has been provided under my Department's water and sewerage services investment programme for 1998.  This funding will continue the ongoing programme of works to increase water and waste water treatment capacity and extend and upgrade water distribution and waste water collection systems. Work is underway this year on major waste water treatment works in locations such as Dundalk, Drogheda and Wexford.  The Dublin Bay project will commence this year and Galway, Cork and Limerick waste water treatment works are due to be completed by the end of 2,000.  Major water schemes are also underway in Dublin and water conservation schemes costing £50 million are underway or due to start in 1998 in 14 locations, including all the major urban areas.  In total, it is estimated that about £885 million will be spent over the 1994 to 1999 period on water and waste water services.  The provision of the funding and the expansion of the investment programme year on year is providing the water and waste water capacity and services to facilitate, among other things, the construction of additional housing.</P>
      <P>We are also working to maximise the use of existing brownfield sites as part of the alternative to unsustainable concreting of green fields.  For example, the Dublin docklands are projected to accommodate an additional 25,000 population. We will be exploring how more people can be given the option of living in quality surroundings closer to the centres they want to access for work and leisure instead of being forced into expensive and unsustainable commuting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further example of misleading information is the suggestion that prices are about to be driven to new heights by plummeting interest rates.  We have had very low mortgage rates, on a sustained <Col N="601" /> basis, for several years.  As regards fixed rate mortgage loans, which now represent 70 per cent of all mortgages taken out, we have already largely converged with Europe.  The mortgage rate for a ten year fixed interest loan in Germany is only fractionally below what is now available here.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also that lending agencies should adhere to prudent lending practices and that they should not succumb to the temptation, in the current highly competitive climate, of departing from their own stated polices or adopting an over aggressive approach to lending, particularly for investment in housing.  There are some indications that high demand for housing as an investment is contributing to price increases and making things more difficult for first time buyers.  Encouraging persons to borrow to buy additional houses can only serve to add further heat to the market as well as the risk that some individuals, blinded by the hope of future appreciation in value, may find themselves over-stretched.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that misinformation is not confined to house prices.  The motion before the House seems to have overlooked the significant increase in funding for social housing in 1998.  The facts do not support the contention that there is a lack of investment in public sector housing.  Investment in the local authority housing programme is at its highest level for years.  A sum of £214 million has been provided for the local authority housing programme this year &mdash; an increase of £34 million or 18.9 per cent on the estimated expenditure for 1997 and an increase of 22.5 per cent on the 1993 provision.  The provision will enable local authorities to meet commitments on their ongoing programmes and to fund a programme of 3,900 new starts or acquisitions in 1998.  The capital provision for the current year is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to local authority housing as the mainstay of the overall response to social housing needs.  All local authorities were notified of their housing programmes for 1998 on the 5 January &mdash; some six weeks earlier than last year.  Local authorities are, therefore, better positioned to prepare and progress their 1998 housing schemes.  My Department will be monitoring progress throughout the year.  If satisfactory progress is not being achieved in any areas, I will be making adjustments to ensure that the full programme is started in 1998.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that the local authority housing programme of the 1990s is fundamentally different in character to that of previous decades. A key policy consideration is to provide housing in a manner which does not contribute to or reinforce social segregation.  Local authorities are now providing housing in small, well designed schemes often on infill sites and without recourse, as in the past, to large estates on greenfield sites at the edges of our cities and towns.  This approach can be crucial in redeveloping rundown areas of our towns and cities and providing a <Col N="602" /> quality environment for residents, especially older or disabled people, in close proximity to shops, churches and other services.</P>
    <P>The local authority housing programme also provides the means to provide housing in rural areas, either in small schemes or on a once off basis where individual circumstances so require to meet the needs of these areas.  This can be a significant factor in maintaining small rural communities and ensuring the viability of local shops, schools etc.  The local authority housing programme is well placed to continue to meet people's need for housing, for good living conditions and to contribute to the improvement of the physical environment of urban and rural areas.</P>
    <P>At the same time as the expanded local authority housing programme, the range of social housing measures has been greatly developed and expanded to meet a variety of housing needs and to increase the options available to those who cannot afford to house themselves from their own resources.  In November last, I announced improvements to the various social housing schemes to help shared owners and other low income house buyers and to enable voluntary housing bodies to meet increased tender prices.  These improvements were strongly welcomed.  I believe they will revitalise voluntary housing activities on behalf of people with special housing needs and low income households. I am also pleased to say that preliminary indications suggest that activity under the shared ownership scheme has increased since last November. I will be monitoring progress under the social housing options on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The local authority programme together with output from the complementary social housing measures, including voluntary housing schemes, shared ownership and vacancies occurring in the existing local authority housing stock will enable some 10,000 households in need to be catered for in 1998.</P>
    <P>A recent development has been the use of the local authority housing programme as a mechanism to regenerate existing housing in major urban areas.  The redevelopment of areas of older housing, mainly flats, experiencing social problems and physical decline, sometimes associated with the nature of the housing itself, is underway in a number of areas.  The most prominent example is Ballymun where the redevelopment of the housing is the focus for the social and economic regeneration of the area as a whole.  Another example is that of Rahoon in Galway where Galway Corporation is working in tandem with a private developer to replace the flats with standard housing with the aim of eliminating long standing social difficulties.  These area based regeneration initiatives are making good use of available capital funding to restore the physical fabric of established areas and support local communities.</P>
    <P>The 1998 provision for local authority housing includes £20 million to get the redevelopment of <Col N="603" /> Ballymun underway.  This is tangible and real evidence of this Government's commitment to improving the housing and economic prospects of an area of Dublin that has regrettably been neglected over the years.  I think it relevant to point out that, while the decision to redevelop Ballymun was made by the previous Government, they provided no funding for this purpose. Like many of the announcements of the last Government, they never provided the wherewithal to ensure these measures could be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>New housing to replace the existing flat complexes will be the key element in an integrated strategic plan for the social and economic regeneration of Ballymun as a whole.  The redevelopment project will transform Ballymun into a vibrant new town capable of contributing to and benefiting from our current economic and social progress.  The aim of the plan is to establish Ballymun as a town which caters for all local needs, attracts public and private investment, provides employment and embodies a better mix of housing in a rejuvenated physical environment. A new company, Ballymun Regeneration Ltd. , has been set up by Dublin Corporation and is currently overseeing the preparation of the strategic plan in consultation with the local community who are represented on the board of the company and who will be involved at all stages in the implementation of the plan.</P>
      <P>It is important to appreciate that investment in existing local authority estates is not confined only to special projects such as Ballymun.  I wish to reiterate the importance that the Government places on the general improvement of standards in the existing stock of some 100,000 local authority dwellings throughout the country.</P>
      <P>We are determined to maintain maximum progress under the remedial works programme which continues to provide practical assistance to local authorities to improve the standard of inadequate housing and assists in the rehabilitation of rundown estates.  The programme enables authorities to carry out major essential improvement works to designated estates.  Over 9,500 dwellings have refurbished to date and £173m has been paid to authorities by my Department.  The 1998 provision for the programme is over £19m and allocations will be notified to authorities shortly. Under the special bathroom programme, £16.5m has been allocated to local authorities that provide bathrooms, toilets or showers in any of their rented dwellings lacking these basic and necessary facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to these funds provided by my Department the authorities themselves are spending some £100m annually on the management and maintenance of their dwellings and <Col N="604" /> have full discretion on how they spend this money in the upkeep of their housing stock.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, therefore, the motion before this House is ill founded in facts and ill conceived in its proposals.</P>

      <P>The Minister has obviously just come from Limerick and is under pressure due to the by-election.  He seems preoccupied with by-elections.  This motion is about a national issue, of no interest to any one constituency more than another.  It is despicable and unfair of the Minister to bring petty politics into this debate. His tactics this evening resembled those of the Deputy Bobby Molloy we knew as a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government in 1977.  His contribution was that of a good old time Fianna Fáil politician.  We thought that once he made his wonderful move to the Progressive Democrats that his thinking had changed dramatically and had become open and progressive.  He has, unfortunately, lost the run of himself again and now that he has fallen into the embrace of Deputy Bertie Ahern and company he is reverting to his old style of political thinking.  He is well supported this evening by his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  They may be anxious to bring him back into the fold.  His speech showed all the signs of a desire to move in that direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy is obviously greatly influenced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey.  I am disappointed that the Minister chose to give a dissertation on his Department's developments in local authority housing and the provision of water and sewerage facilities.  He has merely put on record the work of his predecessor, Deputy Howlin. Nothing in the Minister's speech suggests anything new or different from the work of the previous Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister is particularly critical of the stamp duty element in the motion.  He bases his criticism on reports in the national newspapers.  The Minister is obviously totally convinced by everything he reads in the papers.  If the papers say something is not a good idea then the Minister thinks it is not a good idea.</P>

      <P>Coming from a mixed urban and rural constituency, the Minister must be familiar with the huge degeneration of properties in small towns and villages.  This proposal would make it attractive for a young couple to buy a secondhand house in the middle of a small town or village, regenerate or reconstruct it rather that build a new house which would place extra demands on services and be a cost to the State.  I hope the Minister will give more careful consideration to this element of the proposal.</P>
      <P>Buying a house for the first time involves a major decision and brings major responsibility. Because of the current high cost of houses many young couples find it impossible to buy any sort of house.  They are forced to continue renting for a number of years.  Our proposal is designed to encourage first time buyers to buy second-hand houses.  This would be advantageous to the purchaser and to the environmnent.  I know that the Minister has an affinity with developers and builders but I would ask him to focus on the ordinary people of Ireland who wish to buy houses.  The Minister has mentioned the remarkable number of house purchases in recent years.  Many of these have been purchased by wealthy people who are in a position to pay top dollar and are pricing young people out of the housing market.  This issue must be addressed.</P>

      <P>That increase in stamp duty was not given proper consideration.  I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn when she says that this is not merely a Dublin problem.  My own areas of Bantry, Skibbereen and Schull are affected.  The <Col N="606" /> question must be addressed in a sensible fashion. Reducing stamp duty alone will not solve the problem.  The vendor and not the purchaser would get the benefit of this policy.  I support the Minister's proposal to examine this problem in a sensible and level-headed fashion.  Deputy John Bruton proposes to deal with the question from the top of a bus.  If he came down to ground level he would realise that this knee-jerk solution will not solve the problem.</P>
      <P>The provision of serviced sites would help in small towns.  In west Cork we recently sanctioned 20 serviced sites in Skibbereen, 18 in Bantry and 16 in Schull.  These will provide housing for young couples on low and medium incomes who do not wish to go on a long housing list but build their own houses.  This kind of initiative should be praised.  One third of the 900 people on the housing list in west Cork are single.  These people may be living alone and be on the list for eight to ten years.  They have no future unless single units can be built for them.  I applaud the work done by those caring for the elderly in social housing.</P>
      <P>I do not share the Minister's enthusiasm for the shared ownership scheme.  It is cumbersome and impractical and it is not working well in my local authority region.  Perhaps it should be restructured but the Minister should look again at how it can be operated to benefit the less well off.</P>
      <P>There may be a need for the reintroduction of the essential repairs scheme.  This was a Fine Gael scheme launched in 1983 and I thought it was a great idea.  However, it was not properly thought out.  The initial cost was £9.5 million but within three years the cost had escalated to over £220 million.  The scheme was not income linked so millionaires benefited while those who should have benefited did not.  It should be reintroduced to help those on lower incomes whose homes need repairing.  It should not be available for improving a series of flats.  A builder in Waterford renovated 16 apartments and drew the full grant for each dwelling.  This was an abuse of a scheme the concept of which is correct.  Something must be done about the spiralling cost of houses.  However, this motion is a quick-fix solution which is not properly thought out and I do not commend it.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate.  It is proper that the Opposition tabled such a motion and that facts are aired.  House prices are out of control and I am glad that the Minister has established a commission to investigate the problem. We all have solutions &mdash; build more houses, rezone more land, install more services and so on. However, many young people are able to buy their own homes.  The economy is strong.  Many young people lived in primitive conditions in the past but now they have something to which to look forward.  That is welcome and this is the best country in the world for rehousing young couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to look at the number of houses being built by local authorities.  I am aghast at the stamp duty on second-hand houses.  I visit many villages <Col N="607" /> every week but I do not see many second-hand houses for sale.  If they are for sale, local authorities are anxious to buy them as it is more economical to refurbish them for rehousing tenants.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the reintroduction of the essential repairs grant.  The Minister should examine such a proposal but it should be means tested.  This scheme was introduced in 1983 by a Fine Gael-led Government.  Because it was insufficiently funded, that Government left a bill of £220 million in its wake.  In 1987 the incoming Government spent two or three years paying those who drew money on the scheme.  One cannot introduce schemes without the necessary financial backup.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate but I do not agree with the motion.  The Minister should come back to the House when the commission has reported so we can have a full debate on how to tackle the problem of spiralling house prices.  We all have ideas on how to solve the problem.  Many fat cats are getting fatter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's remarks were entertaining but I take issue with his primary tenet &mdash; his opposition to the principle of first time buyers being exempt from stamp duty.  Many specious arguments have been put forward as to why they should not be exempt.  A vendor will benefit equally whether the house is first or second-hand so that argument does not cut much ice.  However, we should concentrate on the principle. Where there is a shortage of new houses we should be anxious to assist the establishment of a level playing field for young couples trying to buy their first house.  One of the ways of achieving this is to exempt them from stamp duty whether the house is new or second-hand.  The Fine Gael proposal deserves careful examination.  It is not the solution but it could yield some benefits.</P>
      <P>I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the existing stamp duty rates which are totally out of line.  There is no stamp duty on a house worth less than £5,000.  There is 1 per cent duty on houses from £5,001 to £10,000.  I cannot imagine too many houses in that bracket.  Stamp duty is 2 per cent on houses between £10,001 and £15,000. There would not be too many houses in that range either.  Stamp duty is 3 per cent on houses between £15,001 and £25,000.  It is 4 per cent between £25,001 and £50,000 and 5 per cent between £50,001 and £60,000.  The duty is 6 per cent on houses between £60,001 and £150,000. That is a penal rate of stamp duty as this is the threshold rate because the majority of houses cost between £60,001 and £150,000.  The rate for this bracket should be 3 per cent and it should increase to 6 per cent on houses over £150,000. This issue needs to be looked at because the rates were put in place two years ago in the context of the residential property tax when houses were less expensive than they are now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed with the urban renewal designation in terms of its impact.  It has been <Col N="608" /> directed in such a way by the provision of tax incentives that it has exclusively benefited investors, speculators and people with large amounts of money to invest.  The scheme has been operated in such a way as to prevent the local indigenous population, who do not have substantial nest eggs to invest in property, from getting involved in the development of their own area.  This is true throughout Dublin where the landscape has changed but there has been no participation, good, bad or indifferent, by the local population in the housing development in their area.  They could only get involved if they had money or if the Government was prepared to make some concessions in terms of loans.  Since the refurbishment loans introduced in the 1980s were ended, it has been impossible for people without much disposable income to refurbish their property or get involved in areas where huge complexes are being developed.  Outsiders come in who do not participate in the local areas and this has been the experience in Dublin.  They socialise away from where the new flats and complexes are established.  I would like the Minister to examine a much more integrated approach to tax incentives where development is desirable or at least give the option of loans and grants along the lines of what existed before to allow extensions and refurbishment to take place.</P>
    <P>In the centenary of local government, there is much discussion of its reform.  We do not have a single social housing authority.  There is a joint authority in the sense the health boards deal with many emergency cases and homelessness.  This is the time to bring the management of housing under a single authority and the local authority is the correct one for that.</P>
    <P>When we previously discussed the issue of homelessness, I suggested the establishment of a task force similar to that established on drug abuse.  This would mean a Cabinet subcommittee taking responsibility for dealing with the matter. Sharp increases of the order of 25 per cent to 33.33 per cent are expected when Dublin Corporation formally makes available the new figures in 1998 on the extent of the local authority housing lists and homelessness.  This must be examined carefully.</P>
    <P>The last Government put together a budget and proposals for the five year period it expected to be in power.  Nothing similar to that existed and only a few local authority houses were built prior to that Government coming to power in 1992.  Such a plan is needed.  It is not sufficient to say the same number of local authority houses are being built this year.  More are needed because demand is increasing substantially.</P>

It is obvious from the Opposition motion deploring the lack of investment in public sector housing that it was not present some months ago when the Minister announced his increased allocation <Col N="609" /> to local authorities and voluntary groups for house construction.</P>
      <P>The issue of escalating house prices has been raised numerous times in the past months.  A number of us are house hunting and are aware of this.  The problem is how to deal with it.  Quick fix solutions do not work and they often come back to haunt a previous Administration.  There is a payback on this type of solution.

      <P>The motion calls for the exemption from stamp duty of first time buyers of second hand houses. The Minister stated that would cost £40 million. Who would benefit from it? It is certain the purchaser will not benefit.  Anything of this nature is based on supply and demand and that is a fact of life.  I agree there has been an increase of 50 per cent in house prices over the past three years and that is expected to continue.  We can talk all we like but the facts are, there is a booming economy, people are returning from abroad whom we must welcome and the unfortunate aspect for many small rural areas is they are moving to the towns.  That is a fact of life and nothing can be done about it.</P>
      <P>I agree with previous speakers about house reconstruction grants.  Those grants encouraged people living in rural areas to stay there.  Many people live in houses 30 or 40 years old which are passed down from generation to generation.  If people were given a little assistance to reconstruct their houses, they would stay in the local community and many small rural environments would be maintained.  I know there was an increased allocation for essential repairs but it is an area where there is a need for a greater allocation of funds, especially for elderly people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the amendment.  We all appreciate <Col N="610" /> that house prices have escalated and no one doubts that.  However, it is important to counteract that.  Quick fix solutions do not yield results. We all have our views on why house prices are increasing but a consultative study would provide us with factual reasons and we could then deal with the issue in a realistic manner.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the debate in the House this evening, it seems the Minister is not the man I knew when we served together on Galway County Council some years ago or the one I admire as a constituency colleague in Galway West.  The Minister was always a man who formed his own judgments and stood on his own two feet.  However, he appears to have been influenced by responses in local press and journalists' views.  He has held up a number of newspapers in this House this evening but <i>The Galway Advertiser, The Connacht Tribune</i> or <i>The Tuam Herald</i> from his own county were not among them.  I am sad to say we heard a certain amount of hype in this House this evening.</P>
      <P>As it is Ash Wednesday, we may be inclined to think of the Angel Gabriel calling us all forward. The Minister appears to be calling us forward, saying that Fianna Fáil and the Government have brought us all in sight of the promised land.  That is not the case.  The Minister appears to be in a euphoric mood about the current state of the economy and the housing situation in this country. He is the only one in ecstasy in County Galway. Spiralling house prices in Galway city and county are causing huge problems and are exerting huge pressure on people, particularly young couples.</P>
      <P>Any statements which the Minister makes in the local press in Galway should carry an addendum stating that he is carrying on programmes initiated by the previous Government and is glad to do so.  I am very pleased he is carrying on such initiatives.  However, I would remind him of the huge housing backlog which exists in Galway county and city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many people in rural Galway, in areas such as my own, are living in leaking caravans and people seeking houses are queuing at all constituency clinics.  There is a huge scarcity of housing in Galway. The price of building land has increased so much in certain areas that in my parish of Lackagh we are finding it impossible to obtain a site for an extension to the local cemetery.  The Minister should apply himself to controlling the cost of house and site prices and he should seek to bring more local authority housing on stream.  He <Col N="611" /> should also examine planning restrictions in County Galway.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well but it is pointless for him to speak in euphoric terms about the state of the economy as there are still many problems which must be addressed.  Had the previous Government been in office for longer, more initiatives would have been brought on stream. However, it laid the groundwork for the Government and the Minister should respond positively to this very worthwhile motion.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and wish him well in his portfolio.</P>
      <P>I compliment Senator Doyle for tabling this motion and I urge the Minister to accept it and avoid dividing the House.  The motion, which seeks that the first time buyers of second hand houses be exempted from the payment of stamp duty, is very simple.  The Minister's comments in the House this evening lead me to believe he does not understand the motion.  Moreover, I do not think some of the other speakers understand it either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Leonard stated she favoured the reintroduction of grants in rural areas. If this motion were accepted, first time buyers would be enabled to buy second hand houses in rural areas and would help to keep those areas alive.  The Minister and the other speakers seem to concentrate on Ballymun and other urban areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the abolition of stamp duty on second hand houses purchased by first time buyers has been estimated by the Department of Finance to cost in the region of £40 million. How could that be true if the first time buyer is only going to buy one house? Whether that is a new or second house is irrelevant.  A first time buyer buying a new house is not obliged to pay stamp duty.  How was the figure of £40 million arrived at?</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to re-examine this issue.  I welcome his announcements on developments in serviced sites and sewage services as those initiatives are badly needed.  Second hand houses already have the necessary infrastructure such as septic tanks, footpaths, public lights and so on in place.  By accepting the motion, first time buyers would be able to buy houses which already have such services.  The Minister will effectively put more pressure on his own Department as more funding will be required to provide more services to new houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot believe that the Minister does not realise the motion's objective.  Speakers on the far side of the House have spoken about stamp duty being payable on houses costing in excess of £150,000.  No first time buyer could afford to pay that much for a house in the first instance.  There <Col N="612" /> is a great deal of value in the second hand house market for the first time buyer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's approach to his portfolio since taking up office and I welcome the way he has dealt with local authorities on planning, development and housing issues.</P>
      <P>There is some substance in the motion before us.  This evening's debate reminds me of a discussion which took place recently on road carnage. A Senator on this side of the House suggested that if all cars were obliged to drive at 30 miles per hour, nobody would be killed.  That was a reasonable and rational suggestion.  The motion to abolish stamp duty is not as reasonable.  This problem must be examined carefully.  I support the amendment on that basis.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be parochial but in my county the tourist resort scheme has been a major influence on the price of houses in places such as Westport.  A large number of young people have moved to Castlebar as a result of the scheme and the spiralling cost of land and housing.  This matter needs to be examined.  Local authorities are having difficulty purchasing land, not just because of cost but the responsibility of housing everyone. Towns on the periphery of cities can provide serviced housing at a reasonable cost.  Local authorities must look at the overall development of their counties and utilise the serviced resources at their disposal.  They will then build up the infrastructure of their counties and provide reasonably cheap housing, which is what people are concerned about.  Direction should be given to local authorities.</P>
      <P>I welcome that council staff will ascertain what the development plans are.  Progress can be made in tackling the problem of finding suitable serviced sites at a reasonable cost by working with local authorities.  The Minister's instruction to local authorities to set out their housing plans is a positive move in that direction and we will see the fruits of it.</P>
      <P>There were 38,800 housing starts last year which is an enormous commitment and investment of resources in an area of huge demand. The decision of the Department of Environment and Local Government to accept the full financial lendings of building societies and banks was a positive move.  However, in the past, many young people involved in the construction industry provided their own houses in rural areas, got suitable loans from the local authorities and provided much of the infrastructure for young families. There should be some flexibility in that area.  We should cater for young people who do not have suitable incomes to obtain mortgages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the work of the Department in embracing a community approach towards local authority housing.  Voluntary housing groups do great work in providing housing for the disabled, the elderly and the disadvantaged.  There is great local and community interest in working with local authorities. <Col N="613" /> The amendment tabled is worthwhile.  It is important to allow the Minister examine the difficulties. The Government and the Minister will examine the matter properly and fairly and take all aspects into consideration.  Measures will have to be considered which will provide reasonable and fair opportunities to young people who are having difficulties because of a strengthened economy and the accompanying rise in the standard of living.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not happy that Senator Joe Doyle deplores the situation.  He hardly expects the Senator to praise it.  The housing sector is a timebomb waiting to explode. There is a war of attrition and the matter has to be hammered home week in, week out, regardless of who is in Government.  We owe that much to the citizens of this State.  What do we tell the 1,700 people on the housing list of South Dublin County Council? The Department of Environment and Local Government gave them 105 housing starts while 100 applications are submitted each month.  First-time buyers are on that list because they cannot afford to buy a house.</P>
      <P>I remember when housing action groups took to the streets.  I guarantee that unless the Minister moves quickly, that will happen again.  We will then resort to panic building which resulted in Ballymun and areas where people remain marginalised.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister will accept suggestions from a member of a party whose actions he has deplored.  As a member of a local authority, I believe our land density regulations are ridiculous. We could go in excess of ten to an acre in urban areas and the style of housing could be changed to provide larger accommodation in the same space.</P>
      <P>I previously referred to the capital gains tax in the House, when the Minister misunderstood me. I asked that it should be returned to the local authority where the decision to rezone is taken. This would allay the difficulties in providing houses.  Although the Minister said it did not work, the certificate of reasonable value should be reintroduced.  It is unbelievable that a house can increase in price by £30,000 in three months. We are heading towards negative equity.  This nettle must be grasped now, even though it hurts. Otherwise we will be in serious difficulty.</P>
      <P>There should be an examination of the control of rents in the private sector because they are reaching a criminal rate in some areas.  There is no need to be adversarial about this matter, as it is a problem which requires us all to put our heads together to work for the interests of the people.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas for the past 16 years and this is the first time I have been charged with political opportunism or reacting in a knee-jerk fashion.  It saddens me, especially as it concerns housing, which I hold dear to my heart.  It is the <Col N="614" /> responsibility of Oppositions to prompt Government into action to deal with problems in society, which is what this motion does.  We hit a raw nerve, as could be heard from the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>This motion did not come about just because Fine Gael tabled it.  Every day on the Order of Business, Members on both sides of the House ask for Ministers to attend the Seanad to do something about the cost of housing.  That happens continually.</P>
      <P>Newspapers are full of editorials and letters dealing with the cost of housing.  Recently, His Grace, the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr. Connell, stated that the cost of houses in the city had escalated beyond reason and could prove the undoing of normal family life.</P>
      <P>This is particularly so when both partners are struggling from one end of the week to the other to try to meet their mortgage repayments.  In my earlier contribution, I quoted a statement by the Director of Consumer Affairs who said the Minister with responsibility for housing should ask builders to explain why houses built in different phases on the same estate could increase by £20,000 between phases one and three, even though the price of land had not increased.</P>
      <P>In his vindictive reply, the Minister of State did not even mention that issue.  He criticised Fine Gael for having, as he put it, &ldquo;jacked up stamp duty from 6 to 9 per cent on certain houses&rdquo;.  He did not tell the House, however, that they were houses costing over £250,000.</P>

      <P>They might have been big houses, but we do not know.  Houses in my area sell for £1 million or even £2 million and I cannot see any reason why the purchasers should not pay the lawful stamp duty on them.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael wants some relief to be given to people who are buying second hand houses for the first time, including young people who cannot be accommodated on the housing list, but who have some savings and want to buy their own home.  While I accept this approach might not provide the whole answer, such people should not be penalised by having to pay stamp duty.  They should get some relief now that the cost of housing has risen so much.</P>
      <P>If young people starting out in life and trying to put money together to buy a house, heard the Minister of State's speech they would be very disappointed. No wonder young people have no confidence in politicians.  The diatribe the Minister of State gave was unbelievable and unbecoming of any Minister I have every heard in the Seanad.  I am disappointed because there was not one constructive issue in the Minister of State's reply.</P>

    <P>There are four post-primary schools in Swords which are attended by more than 2,000 pupils and there are at least four campuses of primary <Col N="617" /> schools which are attended by an even greater number of children.  There are a number of special classes and classes for children with special needs at primary school level.  However, there are not enough places for them in the post-primary sector.</P>
    <P>These children need a special class to accommodate their needs, which cannot be dealt with in the mainstream classes.  St.  Finians community college is the only post-primary school to have a special class consisting of 17 pupils with special needs from the catchment area.  Any teacher or manager or anybody involved in education will confirm that this number is far too high for a special class.  However, because the scheme at the school is so successful increasing numbers of parents seek places for their children.  There is a mix of first, second, third and fourth year pupils in the class and there is extreme pressure on the school to accept more pupils.  The staff and management consider it unfair that no other school in the area accepts children with special needs.  They have raised this matter with the VEC and the Department of Education and Science but nobody appears to be moving on it.</P>
    <P>There are a number of crucial issues here.  First and foremost, there are children with special needs who need places and a class must be found for them.  Second, there are a number of schools in the vicinity, yet only one provides this service and, for understandable reasons, it considers it should not be the only school providing it.  In a competitive environment it wishes to be seen as inclusive, dealing with children with mixed ability and taking a comprehensive approach to education. It does not want to be labelled.</P>
    <P>In a society which aims to be comprehensive, pluralist, inclusive and integrated in terms of children of different ability, why is it that other classes are not being established for children with special needs? Why can the development of this service not be attached to other schools?</P>
    <P>We all have a responsibility to deal with this matter.  I am not aware of any resistance from the other schools, yet the Department does not appear to be moving on this issue and making contact with schools with the objective of establishing other classes and places for children with special needs.</P>
    <P>If there are 2,200 post-primary pupils in the area, it can be said without a shadow of doubt that approximately 15 per cent of them will require some form of additional help.  This effectively involves 330 pupils and perhaps two-thirds of them can be helped by remedial teachers. However, close to 100 pupils will have special needs.  This is no different from any cross section of the population in any part of the world.  From a total of 2,200 pupils in the area, 17 are receiving special education.  What is happening to the others? They are lost, swallowed and buried in the system.  More places are required and this responsibility should be shared.  What are the Minister's plans and intentions in this regard?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="618" /> What contact has he had with the schools in the area? What is he prepared to do to meet the needs of the school which does not wish to be labelled in a certain way? St.  Finian's wants to play its part in the community and show concern for all its pupils but it also wants to ensure that the responsibility and professional need are met by all the schools in the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé anseo ar cheann an tAire Oideachas agus Eolaíochta.  Tá mé buíoch don Seanadóir O'Toole as ucht au cheist seo a chur ós ár gcomhair.  Tá mé cinnte go ndeacfaidh sé uaim go bhfuil an freagra ball den chás atá déanta aige agus cloisfidh sé sin sa fhreagra seo.</P>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science.  I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it affords me, on behalf of the Minister, an opportunity to inform the House of the provision which is being made to address the requirements of special needs pupils at second level generally and in the Swords area in particular.</P>
      <P>Children with special needs have access to a wide range of special support services which are tailored to meet the variety of special needs which can arise.  In many instances, children with special needs are capable of being catered for in the ordinary school setting with the help, where necessary, of remedial, resource or visiting teachers.  In more serious cases, the needs of the child may be such that placement in a special school or a special class attached to an ordinary school is the most appropriate response.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education and Science makes every effort to ensure that no child with special needs is denied access to an adequate education service.  In May 1990, a resolution on the education of children with special educational needs was adopted unanimously by the EU Council of Ministers of Education.  The salient points in the resolution are as follows: member states agreed to intensify, where necessary, their efforts to integrate or encourage integration of children with disabilities into mainstream schools in all appropriate cases; integration into the mainstream should be considered as a first option in all appropriate cases and the work of special schools should be seen as complementary to the work of ordinary schools.</P>
      <P>References in the resolution to integration &ldquo;in all appropriate cases&rdquo; and that the work of special schools should be seen as &ldquo;complementary to the work of ordinary schools&rdquo; clearly indicate that, while integration is the preferred option, it should not be pursued to the exclusion of arrangements in more specialised settings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Special Education Review Committee was established in 1991 to report and make recommendations on the educational provision for children with special educational needs.  The terms of the EU resolution accord with the views of the Special Education Review Committee, whose <Col N="619" /> report was published in 1993.  The report stated that the committee held&mdash;</P>
    <P>no entrenched doctrinaire position regarding the integration into the ordinary school system of pupils with disabilities and/or special needs. Our philosophy could best be summed up by saying that we favour as much integration as is appropriate and feasible with as little segregation as is necessary.  We therefore envisage a system in which there will be a place for both ordinary and special schools.</P>
    <P>The committee was of the view that&mdash;</P>
    <P>it will be necessary to establish a continuum of services to match the continuum of special needs.  Decisions on the placement of pupils along this continuum must be based on the assessed needs of the pupil, the range of services available, professional advice and the preference of parents.</P>
    <P>Substantial additional resources have been allocated to cater for the requirements of special needs pupils in recent years.  Additional <i>ex-quota</i> remedial posts were allocated to second level schools.  There are now 350 such posts at second level.  In addition to the provision which has been made in the remedial area, additional resource posts have been allocated to cater for the requirements of special needs pupils attending second level schools.  There are 147 resource posts allocated to second level schools in the current school year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the area referred to by Senator O'Toole, a special class has been established in St.  Finian's community college in Swords.  Two resource posts have been allocated to the school to cater for the pupils concerned.  The Minister wishes to compliment the school authorities and staff for their efforts to cater for these pupils.  A further resource post has been allocated to another VEC school in the area to cater for the requirements of special needs pupils attending that school.  The Minister has asked his Department's inspectorate to examine the question of further provision for special needs pupils in the Swords area and it is expected that its report will be submitted shortly.</P>
    <P>The Minister assures the House that he is fully committed to improving the provision in the education area and, in particular, for children with special needs.  There are many competing demands for increased funding in all sectors of education and these demands are considered within the overall budgetary constraints.  The position referred to by the Senator will be kept under review with a view to providing additional supports when resources permit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Whoever wrote the Minister's speech had little appreciation for the difference between remedial and special education.  It is a confused and unsatisfactory response.  I note and welcome the Minister's statement that a report is <Col N="620" /> being prepared.  I will urge the publication of that report and I will press the Minister on his plans in this area.  There is little succour or encouragement in the reply for parents in Swords who have children with special needs but cannot find places for them.  It is also of little help to the school. However, I look forward to the next phase in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter relates to a long standing difficulty which has not reached a successful termination in terms of the provision of a library in the Cabra area.  It is similar to the draining of the Shannon; people have discussed it for years but there appears to be no likelihood of it ever taking place.</P>
      <P>A huge area between Blanchardstown, the Navan Road, Cabra, Oxmantown and Phibsboro has no library service.  It is a major vacuum and in terms of the distribution of branch libraries throughout the city, this is the largest area without a local authority library.  Many years ago the local authority purchased a site at the junction of the Ratoath Road, Navan Road and Old Cabra Road and prepared proposals were agreed, processed and presented to the Department of the Environment.  However, nothing happened.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation drew up a programme of development from 1996 to 2001 as requested by the Department of the Environment.  This programme, which was approved on the first Monday in December 1996 by Dublin City Council, contained specific proposals with regard to Cabra.  It stated that it would be developed as a branch library, which was the initial proposal when the site was purchased, it would be a book storage facility for the city of Dublin for book deposits and it would be a bibliographical and technical processing section for information.  It would serve as a base for the mobile library of the city and provide administrative services for the city library.  The proposed library for Cabra would, therefore, be a joint, major central library for Dublin in conjunction with the proposed Pearse Street development.  The existing library in Pearse Street is due for substantial development at a cost of £2.3 million.  This is not an inordinate sum for the provision of a branch library which would also have major central library facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report in the <i>Irish Independent</i> in December 1997 stated that the Government had sanctioned £2 million for a new library in Blanchardstown, which already has an old library.  At the same time, the development of a library for the first time which would serve as a branch library, an administrative base, a repository and a facilitator of the mobile units has not been approved.  Dublin Corporation had prepared the necessary plans and the project was ready for tendering when, on 5 January 1998, it received a letter from the Department of the Environment and Local Government indicating that the proposal for the new library facility was being considered but that, having regard to the high level of demand for <Col N="621" /> funding for library proposals in general, it was not possible to indicate when the Cabra proposals would be approved.  The proposals for Cabra are central to <i>Dublin Corporation's Public Libraries, Information Service and City Archives: Programme for Development, 1996-2001.</i>  Cabra is the central structural base of that plan and yet the Department is thinking of spending £2 million on a new facility in one area &mdash; we do not grudge them this &mdash; but will not spend £2.3 million on the central tenet of the plan.  This is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It is also unsatisfactory that Cumberland House is leased by the Department of the Environment and Local Government for library services at a cost of £168,000, £84,000 of which is paid annually by the Department.  This would no longer be necessary if the new library, the site for which will not cost a penny and has already been acquired, was built with capital assistance from Dublin Corporation.  The amount granted by the Department would be considerably less than £2.3 million.</P>
    <P>This issue concerns a service which is required by the community and without which people must travel from the Navan Road through Phibsborough and Oxmantown to the Ilac Centre for library services.  This is not acceptable, particularly for the primary and secondary schools for which services are provided by the library in the context of projects, essays and work experience. The issue is also relevant to life long learning.</P>
    <P>The Department has shown no positive response to the development proposals of the local authority which were requested by it and presented almost two years ago.  Almost half the five year period covered by the report is over. Cabra should be the hub of the development according to that report.  It is time we knew the intentions of the Department in the context of the library service.  There should be a phased provision of library services in response to the report and a plan showing how it will be implemented by 2001.  We should start now when finances are relatively, if not considerably, flush.  Money is being found at the drop of a hat for other purposes.</P>
    <P>Earlier we spoke about providing housing for people.  We must also provide learning facilities for them.  Libraries are a very valuable asset in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be here and has asked me to set out the position on the proposed branch library for Cabra.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the core service of libraries is books, the library service has developed far beyond its traditional role and now fulfils an increasingly broad role in the life of communities in general.  The local authority library service employs over 1,300 <Col N="622" /> people in more than 300 branches throughout the country.  It is a service with a long and respected tradition and the library service is seen as being an important community asset.</P>
    <P>Expenditure in 1997 on the public library service by local authorities was estimated to be in excess of £37 million, with a similar amount being allocated for 1998.  In addition, the Department has a capital allocation of £2.76 million to grant aid library developments this year.  As with so many other areas of desirable public expenditure, the demand for library infrastructure far exceeds the funds available.</P>
    <P>One of the projects which is before the Department is for the development at Navan Road, Cabra, of a library, a headquarters for the mobile library service and a technical processing unit, all to be built on a 2.5 acre site.  The project, which was originally submitted in 1991, has evolved in scale and function since that time.  The current proposals date from April 1997 and are linked to a proposal to redevelop and refurbish the Gilbert Library in Pearse Street to include an archives store, branch library and administration section of the library headquarters.  The estimated cost of the Cabra project is £3 million while the cost of the Pearse Street proposal is £2.75 million.  Dublin Corporation has strongly recommended that both projects should proceed in tandem.  The proposals must be seen against a capital allocation for 1998 of £2.76 million and a total value of projects on hand in the Department in excess of £34 million.</P>
    <P>Almost all of the 1998 capital allocation is committed and much of the 1999 capital allocation is also committed to projects at construction or on which work will commence later this year.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, is aware of the merits of the Cabra proposal and has arranged for officials from the Department to meet their counterparts in Dublin Corporation early next month to see how the project might be advanced.  Because of the general difficulty with funding and the complexity of the proposals, the Senator will appreciate that the Minister is not yet in a position to announce a grant for the project. I assure the Senator, however, that every effort will be made to get the project underway as soon as possible.  The Senator will understand that the situation in Cabra is reflected in many other locations around the country.  There is insufficient capital funding available to meet the demand for library infrastructure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The combined cost of the Cabra and Pearse Street projects is £5.75 million.  Some of this would be met by the local authority.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government would not have to fund the entire cost.  The cost is not inordinate and I find it strange that the Minister has said such a capital allocation is difficult to meet.  What is the difficulty with funding? There seems to be no such difficulty in other areas.  While I am glad that a <Col N="623" /> meeting will take place next month with Dublin Corporation, I am not satisfied with the response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that the Minister for Justice, as a matter of urgency, introduced a scheme under section 27 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1960 which will enable the outstanding six day licence holders to obtain seven day licences.  At present there are between 110 and 120 six day licences in the country.  We should examine the whole licensed trade.  It is time the Government addressed this matter with a view to changing the remaining six day licences to seven day licences.  Between 1960 and 1963 the Government introduced a temporary scheme under section 27 of the 1960 Act which allowed publicans with a six day licence to obtain a seven day licence for a fee of £200 made payable to the Revenue  Commissioners.  Approximately 700 licensees availed of this opportunity.  Taking into consideration the very few licences that are left to be extended to seven days, and acknowledging the fact that six day licensees pay the same annual <Col N="624" /> fee as seven day licensees, it is time that the Government addressed this anomaly.</P>
      <P>Most of the six day licensees are small, parttime rural businesses with a limited turnover.  If the Minister agrees to this it will give these publicans the opportunity to extend their trading hours and a chance to reinvest in their businesses.  This will also give them a chance to play a more substantial role in the development of their local economy in small villages and towns.  As a person involved in the licensed business, I believe this would provide these people with an opportunity to improve their well-being and their income.  It is of interest to the licensed trade and the Government should consider it under the Finance Bill with a view to amending the necessary legislation. I thank you for the opportunity of raising this issue.</P>
