      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline her views on the consequences for the travelling public both financial and otherwise of the recent industrial dispute at Dublin Airport.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Walsh of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to reopen the investigation into the Aer Lingus Viscount air crash in the vicinity of Tuskar Rock on 24 April 1968, in light of new evidence becoming available.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure that the terms of reference of the inquiry into allegations of abuse against swimming coaches are adequate to cover the concerns of the victims.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Cosgrave and Walsh as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with deep regret that we learned of the death yesterday evening of an esteemed former Member of this House, Micheál Prendergast.  He was born in Farranfore, County Kerry, and was first elected to the agricultural panel in 1954.  He was successfully re-elected in 1957, 1961, 1965 and 1969 and did not contest the <Col N="1142" /> 1973 elections.  During his time in the Seanad he was vocal on agricultural issues, particularly on matters relating to livestock.  He was an active member of the Irish Live Stock Exporters' and Traders' Association and was its chairman in 1961 and 1969.  He was also a member of the national executive of the Irish livestock trade and was its chairman in 1970.  He was also a member of the Dublin Port and Docks Board since 1960.</P>
      <P>During his long service in public life, Micheál continually pressed the interests of those he represented. He will be greatly missed.  On behalf of the House and Fianna Fáil I extend deepest sympathy to his wife Barbara and his family, Fine Gael and those groups he so ably represented.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The former Senator Prendergast died yesterday in Melbourne, Australia.  He was 77 years old.  I offer my sincere sympathy and that of Fine Gael to his wife Barbara, his son Seán and his daughters Siobhán, Anne-Marie, Caitríona, Ciara, Michelle and Marie-Therese at this sad time in their lives.</P>
      <P>It is many years since Micheál graced the portals of this Chamber.  He was a Member of this House from 1954 to 1974.  Those who remember him will recall his great charisma and humour. His contribution was widespread and was mainly on agricultural matters.  In his maiden speech he spoke about the eradication of bovine TB.  He could not have been a happy man about the way that developed.  Micheál chided the Minister for Agriculture at the time, James Dillon, for saying it would take 20 years to rid the island of the scourge of bovine TB; he said it should be done in ten years.  Neither must have been happy with what transpired subsequently as we still await the eradication of bovine TB many years later.</P>
      <P>Micheál was very committed to the livestock trade and cattle industry.  He was reared in Kilcock, County Kildare, although he was born in Farranfore, County Kerry.  He got his love of land and cattle from his late father, John, and he spent many years in the livestock export business.</P>
      <P>He had many other strings to his bow apart from agriculture.  He was active in the Dublin Port and Docks Board, was chairman and long time committee member of the Irish Live Stock Exporters' and Traders' Association and a council member of the Agricultural Institute, now known as Teagasc, from 1960 to 1963.  He loved horses, had a great interest in rugby and loved to have a pint.  For the past 12 years he lived with Barbara and his family in Melbourne.  On his many visits home he would come into the Members' Bar to have a drink with any of us who was around and catch up with the Irish political scene, in which he always maintained an interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He met his Australian wife Barbara at the Aga Khan Cup in 1959 and they married six months later.  It was an extremely happy marriage and they had a large family.  Barbara was visiting Ireland at the time supporting her great love, the <Col N="1143" /> Australian rugby team.  We will not dwell on the results back in those days either.  It was through her love of rugby and connections with friends who had married here that Micheál and Barbara met.</P>
    <P>We remember a party colleague of great humour and charm.  He was someone people loved to meet on these corridors, even long after his retirement.  He had a great interest in Fine Gael and the democratic system in Ireland and was very proud of his contribution to democracy through his 20 years contribution to the Seanad and as father of this House.  On my behalf and on that of the Fine Gael Party I express my sincere sympathy to Barbara and their children.  Micheál will be brought back to Ireland and will be buried with his parents in the Kilcock graveyard on Saturday week.  May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independents, I would like to be associated with the words of sympathy to the wife and family of the former Senator Prendergast.  Like most other Members, apart from Senator McGowan, I never had the privilege of serving in this House with the former Senator.  I was aware of the great contribution he made at the time and I was privileged to meet him on the many occasions he came back to this House following his emigration to Australia.  He was a great storyteller and great company.  He was calm and understanding and he retained an interest in this House until he died.  On behalf of the Independents, I express our regret at his passing.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I would like to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and the tributes paid to the late Micheál Prendergast, a long serving Senator.  I express my sympathy to his wife, family and his colleagues in Fine Gael at the loss of a person who was evidently a major contributor to Irish life.  Unfortunately, I did not know him but by repute he has left quite a legacy in the agricultural area and the livestock trade where he was a major contributor, in Dublin where his membership of the Dublin Port and Docks Board was a large part of his life for many years and also in the sporting arena.

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join with the Leader and other Members of the House in expressing our sympathy to the wife and family of the late Senator Prendergast and to his colleagues in Fine Gael.  I knew of Micheál Prendergast by reputation through his work in the Agricultural Institute and the Livestock Exporters' and Traders' Association. It is obvious he had a long and distinguished career and that he served his country and this House well.  We mourn his passing.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 1, 2 and 3: item 1 Committee and Final Stages; item 2 to be taken without debate and all Stages of item 3 to be taken immediately after item 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. While I know there is a heavy day's business today, the House and the Leader are agreed that we are facing a scandal on a monumental scale.  It is one which could undermine the entire banking system and it certainly does great harm to confidence in that system.  Will the Leader agree to make time available at some stage today for a series of statements on the events in National Irish Bank?  We are dealing here with fraud and theft on a wide and pervasive scale.  We are dealing with very obvious contempt for the rights of customers.  The House must be assured today that the Government is doing everything it can to get to the bottom of this controversy and put in place all the required mechanisms.  We must be assured also that the Central Bank is doing all it can in the circumstances.  The public needs to be assured that the banking system itself is taking its responsibilities seriously and that it is putting in place independent mechanisms to ensure all of us that the practices that have been unearthed are of a one off nature and are not common to the entire banking system.  For all these reasons I ask the Leader to make time available today for statements on this matter.  I know he will agree that this is a matter that concerns all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that call and I have already raised the matter with the Leader of the House.  It has to be done today.  Money is already moving from banks to mattresses at this stage. We have spent generations trying to convince people of the safety of putting money in banks but there has now been a body blow to the confidence and trust in that system.  It is a bigger issue than NIB.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to hear from the Tánaiste on the current position, outlining exactly what the Government intends to do.  Members should be allowed an opportunity to make brief statements on the matter.  However brief the period for statements might be, the time should be made available today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I support the call for a debate today on the banking system, particularly in relation to National Irish Bank.  The appalling vista, where a bank is <Col N="1145" /> seen to be robbing its customers, has happened. It is certainly a new definition of an Irish bank robber where the action has been taken by the bank itself.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange an early debate at which the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be present?  We must be satisfied about the steps that are being taken. Four inquiries are going on already and an inspector will be coming in, but there has not been a single word about a Garda investigation even though this is a clear case of fraud which has been admitted by the authorities.  We must restore credibility in the banking system at the earliest stage, otherwise we will have a serious crisis.  I fully support the call for a debate on the banking system and, in particular, on National Irish Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Members that it would be desirable to discuss this matter at the earliest opportunity given the scale of the scandal and the potential for damage on a wider level.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment said this morning that all these matters will be investigated very fully and that she expected people would have their interest repaid and would be compensated.  She also suggested that people who were responsible within the bank should be severely dealt with.  The Government is taking action and I am sure that any constructive proposals from the Opposition will be acted upon.</P>
      <P>We also need to discuss the regulatory and licensing aspects from the point of view of the Central Bank.  I expect the Associated Banks will move rapidly to reassure their customers and the wider public that nothing like this has happened in any of the other banks.  That is a matter of some urgency.  I agree we should debate this matter at the earliest opportunity.  I hope we will be able to make contact with the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or other Ministers who might be involved to ensure that somebody will be able to attend the House for such a debate.</P>

      <P>Before I call the next Senator who has offered on the Order of Business, I want to point out that there have been requests from all the party leaders for a debate on the banking system.  I will not allow a debate on this matter on the Order of Business, but I am satisfied that the Leader will give careful consideration to the requests that have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hate to break your ruling so early, a Chathaoirligh, but I have raised this issue in the House twice in the last month &mdash; on the Central Bank Bill and on the day when the largest bank announced the biggest profits ever in the State.  I have a particular interest in the matter.  While time constraints will possibly not allow us to debate the issue fully today, sufficient <Col N="1146" /> time should be given at a later date.  I support the call to investigate the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope we will have a positive reaction from the Leader and that a Minister will come to the House for a debate on this extremely important matter.  It is a serious and worrying day for every bank customer in the country, but particularly for customers of National Irish Bank. It is a bad day for banking but a good one for journalism.  As a former RTÉ journalist, I want to put on the record my great pride in the work that has been done by the RTÉ newsroom and the support given by RTÉ management to the pursuance of this story.  That was particularly so this week when the bank itself attempted a pre-emptive strike to suggest it was being harassed by journalists who were simply asking questions in the public interest, and quite rightly as we now see.  In the past, we have criticised journalists so it is important that when the opportunity arises &mdash; particularly on this occasion, when journalists are acting in the public interest, as they are supposed to do &mdash; we should give them credit.  The most important question that must be raised is the role of the Central Bank.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate at an early date on telephone masts?  I have consistently asked for such a debate.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will receive a deputation concerning the matter today.  Will the Leader arrange for the Minister responsible to answer questions in the House why Esat Digiphone was allowed to enter the secure area of a Garda barracks, erect aerials and cause so much confusion?  The public at large, even those who are not involved, are entitled to be told why this breach of security was necessary.  The public has a right to have their fears allayed.  I am asking for a debate which I have consistently sought here.  I trust the Leader will arrange such a debate, although I realise it is a question of priorities.</P>

      <P>Alarm and dismay were expressed by Members of the Oireachtas and members of <Col N="1147" /> the public that a woman prisoner, with serious psychiatric illness, was detained for three weeks in a padded cell in Mountjoy prison.  I do not know why people were so surprised because year after year the visitors' reports point out the lack of adequate psychiatric services for people with psychiatric illness who are detained in Mountjoy.</P>
      <P>For the past six months I have been asking the Minister for Health and Children to publish the 1996 report of the inspector of mental hospitals.  I also asked the Leader if he could arrange for the report to be published.  I have also tabled a motion to this effect which was supported by the other Independent Senators.  The House should debate the report.  Will the Leader see if anything can be done to bring forward these extraordinarily important reports?  There is little point in us decrying what happens in Mountjoy Prison when it is perfectly obvious the Governor can do nothing due to the lack of facilities within the Central Mental Hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the call for a debate on the banking system.  A few years ago the taxpayers bailed out a bank which invested a great deal of money foolishly abroad.  Since then the bank has made billions of pounds in profits and it has made no effort to pay back the taxpayers. This should form part of our debate on the matter too.  I do not think we could do it in an hour or two.  We would need a day to debate this issue. All the banking institutions are making unreasonable profits at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that I want the debate to be wide enough to encompass the whole banking system and not just the NIB. It should include the building societies, etc., because I am worried about the unreal profits of those organisations.  The people who are paying for that profit are poor working class people trying to pay for mortgages, etc., and ordinary people in business.  It is not right that any institution should be allowed to make such profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Farrell's call for a debate.  I have, as you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader know, called not only in this session but in previous sessions for such a debate. Deputy Batt O'Keeffe has continually called from the Fianna Fáil back benches for a debate on the banking system.</P>
      <P>This is a serious situation.  The banks shift matters around.  They refuse to allow the personal customer to have a proper relationship with the bank manager.  There are masses of dormant accounts where people have died and the banks make no attempt to trace these.  I know of one case in which&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I congratulate RTÉ in exposing the National Irish Bank.  I called here on several occasions for a debate on the sale of State assets, the ICC, the ACC and the TSB, and I would extend that to take in the whole banking set up. I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in this House on the banking system and the sale of the State assets to which I referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader when we might expect some movement on the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, 1998. This is the Bill which will set up the State claims agency responsible for handling personal injury and damages claims made against the State. There have been a number of very serious claims made against the State and I understand the State has agreed to move on this Bill rather speedily. We have not heard anything about it for some months.  I would welcome the opportunity to know when we may handle it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last request from Senator Quinn, I will let the Senator know about that in the morning.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Costello, Dardis, Norris, Bonner, O'Meara and Farrell called for a debate or statements on the crisis which now exists with the National Irish Bank.  The Tánaiste has very kindly agreed to come into the House at 4 p.m. for one hour.  She is in the Dáil from 12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m. and taking Parliamentary Questions until 3.50 p.m..  With the permission of the House, I will allow one hour from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. If the remainder of the business has not concluded by then, it will continue until all Stages of the Bills I ordered earlier are concluded.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan asked for a debate on telephone masts and I have agreed to take this matter. I am delighted to see the Senator has recovered from his illness and is back with us in full health.  I will now allocate time when he is available to make the contribution he has sought to make over the past number of months.</P>
      <P>On Senator Henry's request for a debate on the serious position which she outlined regarding the mental health reports, I am endeavouring to facilitate the Senator as I assured the House previously. I will facilitate the Senator in this at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, on Senator Burke's request for a debate on the ICC, the ACC and the TSB, I have given my word to do this.  I am trying to get time <Col N="1149" /> for the matter.  As the Senator will be aware, there are seven more Bills waiting to come before the House and Ministers are anxious to have them debated here and there is legislation to go through the House before Easter.  Taking all those matters into account, I do not think I will be able to allocate time to this matter until the first or second week after the Easter recess.</P>
    <P>I suggest the allocation of time for the Statements on the bank issue would be five minutes per speaker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 12, before section 3, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Section 15(2) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;or</P>
      <P>(c) in a case where such individual is a widowed person who has not remarried before the commencement of the year and a qualifying child is resident with him or her for the whole or part of the year, at the rates specified in Part 2 of that Table. A qualifying child shall have the same definition as in section 462(1)(a).&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I move this recommendation to speak to the point which is in the amendment but also to allow me some latitude to discuss the point which would have been included in all the amendments tabled in the Lower House by my colleague, Deputy Noonan, and, indeed, on Report Stage by my late colleague, Hugh Coveney.  There is an irony that the first amendment Hugh tabled on Report Stage of this Bill dealt with the treatment of widowed persons with children.  I do not know what we read from that, but it certainly gave me goose bumps last night to find, when I checked over what Hugh had been saying in Dáil on Committee and Report Stages, that this particular amendment was his first amendment on Report Stage.  I am obliged to emphasise strongly to the Minister how we feel in relation to this particular point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read what the Minister said in the Dáil in reply so he need not go over that again if he does <Col N="1150" /> not want to do so.  He may even juggle the words around and make it look different.  I know the Minister has a particular interest in matters relating to the tax treatment of widowed parents one way or another, and I appreciate that.  I know he increased the special allowance from £1,500 to £5,000 and increased the tapering from three to five years.  I appreciate what he has done so I do not need to be told that again because there are many recommendations to get through.  Therefore, I ask him to stick to giving the real reasons for not conceding the point I am making in the recommendation, which proposes that the married double tax bands be applied to widows and widowers with dependent children.</P>
    <P>There is logic in the Minister's concern that if what I am requesting is extended to widowed parents it would have to be extended to the various categories of lone parents, which would result in a much larger financial consideration.  I concede that point.  However, in the first years of sudden widowhood, widows or widowers incur virtually the same expenses as couples in rearing children and maintaining a household.  I ask that the Minister give consideration to the amendment which encompasses the point made by Deputy Noonan and the late Deputy Coveney, namely, that my party would have preferred an increase in tax bands and allowances as a way of putting more money back into people's pockets.  Widows, widowers and other categories of lone parents would obtain greater benefits as a result.</P>
    <P>I have chosen to table this recommendation on its merits rather than tabling three or four to the same principle.  If the Minister could have conceded the point in respect of widening the bands and increasing allowances, widows and widowers would retain more money in their pockets than they will from the 2 per cent reduction in the top and standard rates of tax.  Over 40 per cent of widows and widowers pay tax at the top rate.  As stated on Second Stage, the budget and the Finance Bill have increased the number of people paying tax at the top rate by 20,000.  Many of the widows and widowers about whom I am concerned will be taxed at the top rate, albeit paying tax at a rate of 46 per cent instead of 48 per cent, which is a welcome development.  While it is politically easier to sell a reduction in rate to members of the public, it is much harder to convince them through the media that they will have more money in their pockets as a result of the bands being extended and allowances increased.</P>
    <P>In the future, perhaps, we will look to a marriage of reduction of nominal rates and extended bands and allowances to solve this problem.  I hope the Minister will take that path during his period in office.  We do not know how long he will remain in office because of the many variables involved in the political equation.  However, in view of his favourable disposition in respect of the treatment of widows and widowers, particularly those with dependent children, I wish him well.  I ask him to take the additional step proposed <Col N="1151" /> in the recommendation and extend the double tax band to widows and widowers, particularly those recently or suddenly widowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the recommendation and I understand the reasons for it.  As a local and national representative, I have met widowed people who informed me about the hardships they experience, the trauma of widowhood, the sudden decrease in income in the early years of widowhood, their responsibility to their dependants, the burdens, financial and personal, they shoulder and the fact that they are suddenly placed in a single capacity and transferred to a single tax rate.  It is appropriate that the double tax bands should be applied to widows and widowers, particularly those with dependent children and substantial financial responsibilities, for a lengthy period.</P>
      <P>The Minister will state it is an anomaly that widowed people do not retain the entitlements they received under the tax code as part of a married couple and are effectively treated as single. However, that is not the situation because, as widows, they retain the responsibilities they had when married.  Due to the trauma these people experience in their personal lives &mdash; their income decreases while financial burdens remain the same &mdash; we are not interfering with the type of social policy we want the Finance Bill to put in place.  It must be remembered that the Finance Bill should be oriented towards customers, citizens and people.  If people have a real grievance, it should not be beyond our ability to ameliorate it.  That is what the recommendation seeks to achieve.  I fully support it and I ask that the Minister reconsider his position.</P>

      <P>As Senator Avril Doyle pointed out, I gave this matter considerable attention before the budget, particularly with regard to what action to take in respect of the tax treatment of widows.  I considered a number of options in that regard.  I must declare a personal interest in this matter because my late mother was widowed at a young age and she had to raise three boys of whom, at four and a half years old, I was the eldest.  It has always been my intention that if I was ever in a position to do something substantial for widows I would so do.  I stated that in the Dáil and on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I gave considerable consideration to what I would do in respect of tax allowances for widows. I pondered the concession recommended by Senator Doyle.  However, as she pointed out, and as I stated on Committee Stage, making that concession would inevitably lead to questions regarding what I intended to do about lone parents. Before the budget, I decided to increase the bereavement allowance from £1,500 to £5,000 and taper its payment.  That was a substantial concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> To double the tax bands, as proposed in the recommendation, would lead to a small cost in respect of widows.  If it was solely applied to those with dependent children, the cost would be £2 million in 1998 and £3.3 million in a full year. However, pressure would be exerted to extend this to lone parents the cost of which would be £9.2 million.  Inevitably, pressure would then be exerted to extend these people's entitlements to reliefs on mortgage interest, etc., which would result in considerable costs.  I decided that, in order to avoid substantial costs, the best action to take was to increase the bereavement allowance.</P>
    <P>I am willing to consider this matter before next year's budget.  If I could be satisfied that I could ringfence an extension of the double tax band to widows, I would do so.  However, I gave this matter great consideration because many options were put to me before the budget.  In the end I decided to follow the route I had chosen for the reasons outlined.  I am not in a position to accept the recommendation at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an inevitability about the way this debate is proceeding.  Because of the poignancy of the situation, I will repeat what my colleague, the late Deputy Coveney, said on this point in response to the Minister on 10 March in the Dáil four days before he was suddenly and tragically killed.  I quote:</P>
      <P>The Minister has given eloquent testimony of where his heart lies and I appreciate that. There are similarities between widowed and lone parents but the amendment was to cater for widowed persons.  There are additional traumatic effects of widowhood &mdash; having one's life dashed, sometimes suddenly, and the fact that the surviving spouse might not have been the main breadwinner &mdash; a scenario which does not apply to lone parents.</P>
      <P>It is not only in cases of sudden death that a spouse, who is not the main breadwinner, is left to cater for dependent children or try to run a business of which they may have no knowledge. There is also the fact that married couples have often entered into financial commitments which would be met easily if the two of them were working or if the breadwinner was able to meet them in any event.  However, if a person is widowed suddenly the breadwinner may be gone and financial commitments cannot be met.  As the Minister will be aware, one cannot always immediately extract oneself from financial commitments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be circumstances which apply to widowhood, especially sudden widowhood, which are distinct from those of lone parents.  Lone parents will have a financial structure to meet their circumstances which will have evolved from the time of becoming a parent &mdash; either they will be earning and looking after themselves or the State will be taking care of them.  A widow can suddenly find herself without any livelihood or <Col N="1153" /> means to support dependants or perhaps the means to keep a business going and to meet commitments entered into by her late spouse.  Different circumstances apply.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's point and I recognise what he has done.  However, we do not feel it is enough for the circumstances of widowhood, particularly sudden widowhood.  Although I cannot do so as eloquently as my late colleague Hugh Coveney, I urge the Minister to reconsider the considered points he made and which I support.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 28, column (1), to delete &ldquo;£10,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£10,400&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I propose that the increase in the exemption rate would be raised from £100 to £500 for a single taxpayer moving into the higher tax band.  An increase of £100 is a miserly sum.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Quinn, increased the allowance by £500.  The Minister has reduced the tax rates by 2 per cent but he has allowed more taxpayers to move into the upper rate band and, as a result, with rising inflation, many less well off people will fare worse.  It is a sleight of hand to reduce the top rate from 48 to 46 per cent and to increase the threshold at which a person reaches that band by a miserly £100.  I suggest that it be increased by £500, the increase given by the Minister's predecessor last year.  We should be widening the tax bands so that taxpayers move into them at a higher level.</P>
      <P>The Minister should have done more than he has, particularly given his statements about doing a good deal for the taxpayers by reducing tax levels. There is little sense in reducing the percentage rate unless the bands are widened to remove people from the higher rate.  That is the thrust of this recommendation and such an approach would be of great benefit to a large number of people on low pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello.  No one is opposed to the reduction of rates, but it is a matter of the priority we give to what would best suit an improvement in disposable income for the lower and middle income as distinct from the higher income earners.  Fine Gael, while welcoming the reduction in rates, would give greater priority to widening the bands to keep more people out of the top rate for longer.  If we widened bands and increased personal allowances and exemption limits more people would pay at the standard rate of 24 per cent for longer.  The Minister has increased by up to 20,000 the numbers <Col N="1154" /> who will pay the top rate, albeit at 46 per cent.</P>
      <P>It is much sexier to describe, politically, reductions from 48 to 46 per cent and from 26 to 24 per cent to the taxpayers.  They think it will put more money in their pockets.  However, it is time they woke up to the fact that widening bands and increasing exemption limits and personal allowances will mean more disposable income than a nominal reduction in rates.  We welcome the reduction in rates but it will not put more money in the pockets of the middle and lower income earners and that must be our priority. That is why I support these recommendations and why we pursued similar recommendations in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>The Minister waxed eloquently in his reply on Second Stage and the odd expletive he uttered was omitted from the record.  The Editor of Debates does a great job polishing us up when we lose the run of ourselves.  I welcomed the Minister's contribution and I did not disagree with the thrust of it.  However, it is a matter of priority.  If there is a limited amount of money to return to the taxpayers, what is the best way to do that so that they benefit most?  I want to see the lower and middle income groups have more disposable income and fewer people paying tax at the top rate.  I doubt that the Minister would disagree with that.  However, he has ensured that 20,000 more people will pay tax at the top rate.  If he had widened the band not only would fewer pay the top rate but those who pay it would have to have a higher income.  I support Senator Costello's recommendations.  My criticism centres on the prioritisation of how the money is spent.</P>

      <P>These changes are part of an overall personal tax and employees' PRSI package which will cost over £516 million in a full year.  The Senator's recommendations would increase the standard rate band by a further £400 for a single person and £800 for a married couple at an additional cost of £53 million in a full year. The cost of the personal tax changes already provided for in the Bill, which represents a significant first step in meeting the commitments set out in &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo;, is the most the budgetary situation will allow for this year.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to accept the recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;An Action Plan for the Millennium&rdquo; envisages, among other things, a reduction in tax rates.  The standard rate will fall to 20 per cent and the <Col N="1155" /> higher rate to 42 per cent over five years. If circumstances permit, the top rate will drop further to 40 per cent.  In addition, personal allowances will be increased and the standard rate band will be widened over the five year period of the programme to ensure that 80 per cent of taxpayers do not pay tax at the higher rate.  The budget proposals contained in the Finance Bill are a significant first step in giving effect to that programme.</P>
    <P>It has been said that this budget inappropriately focused on cutting rates rather than bands or allowances and ultimately favoured the rich. As I said in the Dáil, the 2 per cent cut in both the top and standard rates of tax cannot be characterised as a sop to the rich.  Single people on £14,000 per annum are on the top rate and married couples earning £27,000 and over are also on the top rate.  These people are not rich by any stretch of the imagination.  There is a genuine wish on all sides to seek a greater equity in the tax system and a need to ensure all taxpayers pay a fair amount of tax based on their level of income.</P>
    <P>Tax policy is a matter for political choice.  The people ultimately decide through the ballot box how they will be taxed.  The Government has a mandate for the tax proposals in the budget which it received from the electorate last June.  I can hardly be faulted for implementing what was promised in the election and what the people voted for.  I am glad Senator Avril Doyle does not seem to have been as infected by her spell in Government with the Labour Party and Democratic Left as some of her colleagues in the other House.  I pointed out in the Dáil that I did not think my friend, the late Hugh Coveney, had been infected at all but others have been badly infected.</P>

We discussed this matter on Second Stage and I waxed eloquently about this on Committee and Report <Col N="1156" /> Stages in the other House, so I do not propose to go over that ground again.  One of the reasons more people pay the top rate is that there is greater growth in the economy and peoples' incomes are higher.  As I pointed out on Second Stage, the average tax take from the average taxpayer has been reduced substantially as a result of what I have done in the budget.</P>
      <P>Although Senator Doyle made a good speech in this regard, I suspect her heart is not as much in this matter as Deputy Noonan's.  I pointed out on Committee Stage in the other House that Deputies from Limerick have a habit of changing their views over time.  Deputy Noonan seems to have been so affected by his time in Government with Deputies Rabbitte, Quinn and Spring that he had taken this on board hook, line and sinker, but I have not.  I believe Deputy Doyle, or the constituents she represents quite well, have not taken this on board.</P>

He said this is the most the budget will allow this year and that he does not subscribe to the philosophy of doing this by widening the bands.  I am not sure where he stands.  Is he in favour of a package which will reduce the tax rate and widen the bands, or is he simply in favour of a simplistic approach of reducing the tax rate?  It is a question of priority, as Senator Doyle said.  Last year the budget allowed for £500, while this year it allows for £100 only.  We must remember that last year there was not nearly as much money in the kitty.  It is a question of how we spend that money.  Our philosophy is to extend the allowances and widen the bands rather than a simplistic cut, which is very much Progressive Democrat rather than Fianna Fáil policy.</P>

I believe in a combination of allowances, bands and tax rates.  I am convinced that tying nominal rates into tax is a disincentive and have always been of that view.  This should not be a surprise to anybody.</P>
      <P>We put this clearly before the people in the Fianna Fáil manifesto.  As I said on Second Stage, opinion polls conducted during the general election campaign showed that although there was a hostile reception to the Fianna Fáil tax proposals, the people were at all stages more in favour of the Fianna Fáil proposals than those of the other parties.  The general election was held and I have implemented what the people decided.  I have no problem debating this issue with Senator Costello, who comes from a somewhat different political philosophy than I. However, this was democratically decided by the people and I implemented that decision in the budget.  During the period when Deputy Quinn was Minister for Finance he reduced tax rates by 1 per cent only despite the growth in the economy.</P>

I do not mind being tagged as ideological on this matter, but my views on taxation are as well known as my views on many other issues in Irish life.  I do not subscribe to this political dogma which has got recent vintage, particularly over the past five years, that there is one way only to deal with taxation and that is allowances and bands.  I stated clearly, and have done so in the past, it is a combination of the three things.  I fundamentally believe that high nominal rates of taxation are bad for the economy.</P>
      <P>I accept Senator Costello's party hankers for high rates of taxation.  Before I became a Member and in the intervening three years between 1973 to 1977, the Labour-Fine Gael Coalition had a top rate of tax at 77 per cent.  In the period 1982 to 1987, they had a top rate of 62 per cent for most of the time which was reduced to 58 per cent.  I accept the Senator's party, whatever about Deputy Doyle's, likes high rates of taxation, but I do not.</P>

      <P>In page 12, before section 4, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>4.  &mdash;Section 467(1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;spouse&rsquo; in both places where it occurs of &lsquo;or other relative prescribed in that behalf by regulations made by the Minister&rsquo;.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This recommendation has been tabled because of a recommendation by the carer's association, by whom the Minister and every party will have been lobbied.  It is a reasonable recommendation to extend the carer's allowance from the immediate spouse to other close relatives, and the arguments are persuasive.  The Minister has already said he did not have any more money in the budget to extend bands and allowances. However, this is an area in which we could save money by extending the carer's allowance.</P>
      <P>We have a huge ageing population and projections show that as we move into the next millennium the age profile will grow considerably and disproportionately in respect of the working population and pensioners, the non-working population.  Private accommodation costs an enormous amount of money.  There is continuous pressure on hospital accommodation and we all know of the waiting lists for public wards with which no Minister for Health has been able to cope adequately.  There is a difference between home care and institutional care.</P>
      <P>Every argument &mdash; the personal, the humane, the financial and the pragmatic &mdash; as well as all projections for the future, favour us doing something more substantial with the carer's allowance than is being done at present.  I ask the Minister to accept the recommendation with a view to extending the remit of the carer's allowance to close relatives and others prescribed from time to time by the Minister, which is in line with the suggestion of the carers' association, so as to provide better care for the elderly and those who are disabled and unable to care for themselves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the argument made by Senator Costello and I have tabled a recommendation similar to his.  One of the greatest social issues facing this country is the care of incapacitated people, especially the elderly and those who are no longer physically and mentally able to care for themselves.  My recommendation requests the Minister to extend the incapacitated <Col N="1159" /> persons' allowance to the parents, siblings or children of the incapacitated person involved or of the person's spouse.</P>
      <P>The cost of State care, even for geriatrics which does not involve elaborate nursing care, is over £500 per week.  This is just to care for an elderly, bedridden and possibly incontinent person.  The best place for anyone to be cared for is in their own home by their close relatives.  With a little help from a tax incentive, many more elderly people could be cared for in the home, as could many severely incapacitated young people.  Brothers and sisters could be cared for.  Where a couple had reared their children who had then left home and either spouse had a severely incapacitated and possibly elderly brother or sister, they could be cared for in the home at a fraction of the cost to the State if the Minister extended the allowance.  Otherwise, there would be a great cost to the State and the taxpayer if that person were put into institutional care.</P>
      <P>The logic in these recommendations is overwhelming, not to mention the real reason for going this road &mdash; that the right people to care for family members are their nearest and dearest where practicable.  That could happen in many cases if a little help was given to the family doing the caring.  The logic and social reasons behind both recommendations are incontrovertible. However, I am aware that the weight given to recommendations of this House on the Finance Bill are such that we are wasting our sweet breath on the desert air and possibly the Minister's time, as he has much on his plate.  However, a serious point is being made in these recommendations. Would that the Minister could take them on board because I do not believe he disagrees with the principles behind what either I or Senator Costello have said.  I urge the Minister to accept our recommendations.</P>

      <P>I would not like Senator Doyle or anyone else to think I would not take account of what was said in this House.  I have picked up on many suggestions made in the House when listening to the debate on Finance Bills and I have tried to implement those I believe are good. When I was in Opposition I gave commitments to certain areas, such as cross-Border workers and charities, which I honoured, so I keep my word.  I will take on board any good ideas from Senator Doyle or others.  I have a reputation to live up to in that regard; I take on board what people say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These recommendations propose that the allowance granted to an incapacitated person or their spouse in respect of a person employed to take care of the incapacitated person be extended so as to be available to the incapacitated person's parents, siblings or children.  I have a great deal of sympathy for the recommendations tabled by the Senators and there is a commitment in the Government's programme to provide tax relief for those caring for the elderly and incapacitated <Col N="1160" /> in the home.  Arising from this commitment, I announced in the budget that I have set up an interdepartmental working group to examine for the next budget the question of tax reliefs for those caring for family members in the home.  As part of its work, the group has arranged a meeting with the carers' association tomorrow afternoon.</P>
    <P>I want to come up with a targeted relief at a reasonable cost which will complement health and social welfare policy measures in this area.  It is clear an amount of groundwork must be done before it can be decided what form of tax allowance for carers is most appropriate.  The tax system has a number of special personal income tax allowances related to the care of incapacitated or dependent individuals; the dependent relative allowance, medical expenses relief, covenant relief and a carers' allowance under section 467 referred to in the recommendations.  These provisions are very varied and have been developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> way at various times to meet different needs.  I want to fully examine these reliefs and their interaction and I hope to bring forward for the next budget fully considered proposals relating to care in the community.  In the meantime, I cannot accept the recommendations tabled by the Senators.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the Minister and I wish to elaborate on the principle behind the recommendations, to which there are two facets.  One is to encourage families through the tax system to take care of their incapacitated relatives in their own home.  The second point is tax relief in private nursing care, as distinct from letting the State carry the full burden of over £500 per week for the care of an incapacitated person.</P>
      <P>On that latter point, it goes without saying that those who can afford to care for their own relatives should be financially encouraged to care for them in properly regulated private nursing care if they cannot care for them adequately in the home.  Couples paying over £500 per week for proper private nursing care for their elderly mother or father in an advanced state of incapacitation should be recognised in the tax code.  My recommendation made specific recommendations in that area and I urge the Minister to examine that aspect as well as recognising the need for extending the concept of a carer in the home.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 14, before section 6, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;6.&mdash;The Principal Act is hereby amended in Chapter 1 of Part 15 by the insertion of a new section 467A as follows:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;467 A.&mdash;(1) In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;appropriate percentage in relation to a year of assessment&rsquo; means a percentage equal to the standard rate of tax for that year;</P>
      <P>&lsquo;qualifying expenses in relation to an individual&rsquo; means the amount paid by the individual , or if the individual is a married person the individual's spouse, for the care in a private nursing home of the parents of the individual or the individual's spouse.</P>
      <P>&lsquo;private nursing home&rsquo; means any nursing home or other institution approved of for the purposes of this section by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minster for Health and Children.</P>
      <P>(2) Where an individual for a year of assessment proves that in the year of assessment&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) the individual, or</P>
      <P>(b) if the individual is a married person assessed to tax in accordance with section 1017 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, the individual's spouse has made a payment for a specified service, then, the income tax to be charged on the individual if the individual made the payment, or on the individual's spouse, if the individual's spouse made the payment, for the year of assessment, shall be reduced by an amount which is the lesser of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) an amount equal to the appropriate percentage of the full amount of the payment, or</P>
      <P>(ii) an amount not to exceed £2,880, and</P>
      <P>(iii) the amount which reduces that income tax to nil.&rsquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation is related to families who are in a position where it is a struggle to pay for private nursing care for elderly relatives.  I have extended the recommendation to include an amount not greater than £2,880 in the year of relief.  That would cover between £10,000 and £12,000 worth of nursing care in a year.  We need not be pedantic about figures, it is the principle which I want the Minister to accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest social problem facing families who are financially independent is financing the care of their elderly family members.  We should do everything possible in the tax code to encourage <Col N="1162" /> families to make private arrangements for nursing care of their elderly parents.  The alternative for those who are struggling each week to find the money to keep an elderly parent in a nursing home is to revert back to the State to look after that parent at cost of £560 per week.  To recognise in the tax code, through an allowance on the payment made, would be a cost effective way of ensuring that the limited number of State beds for geriatric care are not taken up by the elderly relatives of people who, with a little help, could have them looked after in private nursing care. The logic of this is incontrovertible.</P>
    <P>Many families would like to have their elderly parents looked after in private nursing care and not to load their problem onto the State, but if financially they cannot, they have no option but to let the State take care of their elderly parents. If we could recognise what PAYE workers are doing, and the net cost to the family income after tax of paying for nursing home care with an allowance such as that suggested here, the returns to Exchequer would be tenfold.</P>
    <P>Given the demographics of this country and the ageing population, we will not be able to keep apace with provision of State beds for geriatric care in the years to come.  We show no inclination to put capital into beds for geriatric care at present.</P>
    <P>There has been an explosion of nursing home construction.  Couples who have worked hard all their lives and who are at the most expensive stage of rearing children, putting them through third level education, and who want to pay for private nursing care out of after-tax income for their elderly parents should be recognised through a dependant's allowance and income tax code.</P>
    <P>Given the incontrovertible logic of this for the couples concerned and the Exchequer, because of the money it will save in the long term on capital for geriatric care, I ask the Minister to accede to the principle of the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the recommendation.  It is part of a package seeking to provide a better deal for those people who are incapacitated using the tax code to assist in that process.  The Minister seems to be ruling out any extension of the existing provisions but it is important there is a wider system than leaving people to State care and institutions when the individual is unable to take care of himself and the family cannot either.  There should be an attractive package allowing a relative, as well as a spouse, to receive a carer's allowance towards the cost of taking care of a close relative who is incapacitated in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should use the tax code to encourage assistance for home care and so that someone who is incapacitated is able to afford private nursing.  We have an ageing population and many people are incapacitated.  It presently costs a great deal for State care, care which is not necessarily the best, especially when the close relatives of such people <Col N="1163" /> are anxious to care for an ageing parent or close relative.</P>
    <P>We should be facilitating these people.  The Minister should have a plan in relation to the tax code in this area.  He has plenty of plans for the business and industry area, but he is wanting in respect of the consumer of services.  I ask the Minister again to take on board what we have to say in next year's budget, if he is in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The comments made by both Senators relate as much to the previous recommendations as to this one.  This recommendation is covered by the present tax Acts.</P>
      <P>A general point was made regarding the problems which will arise in nursing care.  I am on the record as recognising these facts and I am concerned about them.  That is why I introduced, as a first step, a tax break for the construction or refurbishment of nursing homes, provided those nursing homes are approved under the relevant Act and approved by the relevant authorities. That was my contribution this year to addressing the long term problem.</P>
      <P>I was asked in this House and in the Dáil where I got the idea to cut capital gains tax.  Many people had lobbied me about that.  I took umbrage at the suggestion that the Minister for Finance cannot come up with his own ideas.  If anyone had looked at what I said about capital gains tax over many years they would not have been the least bit surprised that I reduced it.  The idea I have in the Bill regarding tax breaks for the construction of nursing homes was my own idea.</P>
      <P>As Senators Doyle and Costello mentioned, this is a problem which must be addressed.  The Exchequer will not be in a position to address the demographic problem of an ageing population from its own resources.  We are lucky that the problem here is not as bad as the rest of Europe but over time it will become similar.</P>

      <P>It will.  We should make provision for it now.  If we did not have carers looking after people in their homes the State would not be able to provide the resources to make good the shortfall.  The tax code should encourage people to look after others.  There has been a total change in society over recent years.  I grew up at a time when one member of the family took on the responsibility of looking after elderly parents. Usually it was a daughter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> One can receive tax relief under the existing code for this type of expense.  Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, provides tax relief for health expenses. The cost of maintenance in a nursing home approved by the Department of Health and Children is an allowable health expense for this purpose.  It is possible under existing tax law for an individual to obtain tax relief in two ways in respect of his or her contribution to the maintenance of a parent or parent-in-law in an approved nursing home.  First, the individual may seek to have a parent or parent-in-law accepted as a dependant relative for tax purposes.  In that event the individual may claim tax relief on the cost incurred by him or her in maintaining the dependant relative in an approved nursing home.</P>
    <P>Second, where an individual is unable to claim the dependant relative allowance in respect of a parent or parent-in-law &mdash; for example, where the income of the relative is too high &mdash; the individual may effect a covenant in favour of his or her parent or parent-in-law in an amount which would cover the cost of maintenance in a nursing home.  The individual may obtain tax relief on the amount so covenanted.</P>
    <P>As regards the parent or parent-in-law who receives the covenant, he or she may offset the cost of maintenance in an approved nursing home against his or her income, including income from the covenant.  As existing law adequately covers the situation that Senator Doyle seeks to address, I am not prepared to accept the recommendation. However, her comments will be taken on board and I hope to be in position to make further changes in next year's Finance Act.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 26, before section 16, but in Chapter 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;16.  &mdash;Section 905(2)(b) of the Principal Act is hereby repealed.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation has become more pertinent as a result of events in the banking system. It refers to the need for the Revenue Commissioners to have the power to require anyone with relevant information to supply them with that information.  This is what is stated in section 905 of the Principal Act.  However, section 905(2)(b) states that these powers do not apply in the case of banks.  Instead, under sections 907 and 908, they allow limited bank inspections based on applications to the appeal commissioners and the High Court.  This recommendation would make that section redundant and, if necessary, it should be repealed.  I am proposing that the same powers be extended to the Revenue Commissioners concerning banks as already apply to other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is pertinent because of the crisis in National <Col N="1166" /> Irish Bank in which we have the appalling vista of a bank defrauding its customers.  These are not just allegations, evidence has been produced and the bank has admitted it.  People in the National Irish Bank are petty larcenists.  The Revenue Commissioners are part of the investigation.  There are four bodies involved in this investigation; the National Australia Bank &mdash; the parent company; the Central Bank; the authorised officer established by the Minister under the 1989 legislation; and the Revenue Commissioners.  We are seeking that the Revenue Commissioners have the authority to require and compel anyone with relevant information to supply them with that information. The onus should be on a bank which is aware of wrongdoing or matters of concern to the Revenue Commissioners to supply that information rather than on the Revenue Commissioners to go to the High Court to seek authorisation for limited investigations.</P>
    <P>The events which are the subject of the current controversy in National Irish Bank took place a number of years ago.  However, they were covered up and nothing was done.  No attempt was made to redress the situation by calling in the Garda Síochána, as a fraud had taken place, calling in Revenue Commissioners or restoring the money to those who had been defrauded.  I do not wish to speak only of National Irish Bank but the entire banking system is in crisis if these events can take place in a major national and international bank.  The credibility of all banking institutions is at stake.</P>
    <P>If the Minister felt that this type of amendment was not required when the Bill was passing through the Dáil, the new revelations should focus his mind.  He should revisit the situation. Whatever arguments he had in the past for not giving these powers to the Revenue Commissioners should be reconsidered in the light of recent developments.  The Minister should accept this recommendation and ensure that the provisions of section 905 of the Principal Act, which require people to forward relevant information to the Revenue Commissioners, should be extended to the banking sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 905 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, gives authorised officers of the Revenue Commissioners power to visit business premises for the purpose of conducting an audit or investigation.  The power extends to examination of books and records of the business being carried on at the premises, the search for such books and records and their removal for further examination.  The power does not extend to premises where a banking business is carried on.  In relation to the audit of a professional person, there is a prohibition on access to client files. The prohibition and audit is outlined in section 905(2)(d), not section 905(2)(b) as is suggested in this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These powers were first provided for in the Finance Act, 1976, by the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Richard Ryan, who advised the House <Col N="1167" /> that &ldquo;the exclusion of banking business was done deliberately in order to remove any possibility of a suggestion being made that there was an invasion of the confidential relationship between banker and customer&rdquo;.  Successive Governments have, in general, subscribed to this view.  Nonetheless I acknowledge that, in light of recent events, a serious review of Revenue's powers in relation to banks is required.  As I made clear on a number of occasions, I have asked the Revenue Commissioners and my Department to review the adequacy of Revenue's powers in general following the report of the McCracken tribunal.  I do not rule out new provisions if they are shown to be necessary, for example, a requirement for financial institutions to report to Revenue where they become aware that financial products sold by them may facilitate tax evasion or where funds have been transferred in certain circumstances to or from particular offshore locations.  There may also be new powers for Revenue to access bank accounts where there are reasonable grounds to believe that certain accounts are being or may be used in tax evasion.  Under the current tax code, Revenue can apply to the High Court or the Appeal Commissioners for an order to access the bank account of a named individual.</P>
    <P>Before putting forward proposals, it would be necessary to have all the relevant information from the series of inquires under way.  The Moriarty tribunal is specifically charged with making recommendations in the area of banking supervision, the protection of State revenues and offshore accounts.  Proposals put forward must be carefully considered to ensure they would be effective, could not be circumvented, would not needlessly disrupt the affairs of law abiding citizens and would be proportionate in their effect on the financial sector when measured against the problem to be tackled.  A responsible Government would need as much information as possible by way of answer to these issues before acting. As part of that information gathering process, officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners are visiting the tax administrations of other European countries to establish best practice on the question of balance between bank secrecy and a tax authority's right of access to bank accounts.</P>
    <P>To accept this recommendation at this stage would be premature and irresponsible and I have no intention of being either.  Therefore, I cannot accept the recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said.  He is suggesting it would be intrusive to allow the Revenue Commissioners examine accounts or that it would interfere with the confidential relationship between the banking institution and the clientele.  However, the point at issue is that the bank I mentioned breached that confidential relationship be defrauding clients of money.  The bank, through its own secrecy and <Col N="1168" /> the confidential relationship which has existed, has been in a position to defraud clients because there was no outside body with powers of investigation. If there had been a power of compulsion or a general power whereby the bank was required to reveal all relevant information, the situation which has existed for the past number of years would not have occurred.</P>
      <P>Most of the Minister's reply has been geared towards the question of tax evasion and offshore accounts, which have been the big issues up to now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true, but the issue has extended to other dormant, current and deposit accounts abused by the banks.  Therefore, the recommendation concerns not just offshore accounts or tax evasion but all bank accounts which are open to abuse.  Accounts are now being abused through larceny by the bank without collusion with others or in terms of tax evasion. There is a great onus on the Minister and his response should address the new developments taking place.  His failure to address this issue makes it hard to accept his response.  The recommendation provides a real opportunity to do something about the situation here and now.  The Minister said he will act if new provisions are deemed necessary.</P>
      <P>I congratulate RTÉ on its fine investigative work carried out under duress and threats of legal action by the bank.  The Minister has ample evidence that steps are necessary and there is no need to examine the issue further or to set up a committee or commission of investigation.  He should extend the power which already exists in other areas of business to require people to make relevant information available to Revenue.  The management of banks must carry the burden of responsibility as they have access to much confidential information.  If they cannot be shown to be fair and honest users of that information and relationship, there must be an outside investigative body.  The Revenue Commissioners constitute such a body in other fields and by a stroke of the pen we can ensure they constitute a mechanism whereby the abuses which are occurring, and have occurred in the past, can be dealt with. The Revenue Commissioners would not be disruptive or interfering but would ensure the protection of citizens' bank accounts.</P>

    <P>The Senator has raised the recent revelations regarding National Irish Bank.  The Revenue Commissioners have no power in the context of the allegations concerning that bank.

      <P>&ldquo;16.&mdash;(1) Section 787(8)(a) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion of &lsquo;20 per cent.&rsquo; and the substitution therefore of &lsquo;25 per cent.&rsquo;.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this recommendation is to increase the allowable percentage of relevant earnings that can be invested in pension schemes and to ensure that individuals make adequate pension requirements for the future.  Work patterns have changed considerably and dramatically in recent years.  People no longer retire at 65 and expect to live for three or four more years.  Very few nowadays go into a job in their early twenties and stay in it for 40 years, paying their pension contributions for all that time.  Most people move quite freely and willingly from job to job.  There is mobility in the labour market, particularly for middle income earners and the self-employed. This recommendation asks the Minister to ensure that people can adequately provide for their retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The practice of funding for a maximum pension of two-thirds of one's final salary is no longer feasible.  If people want to retire early they should be able to fund a pension of 100 per cent, or more, of their final salary.  I have read what the Minister said on this matter in the Dáil and I feel <Col N="1170" /> I understand his thinking on these issues.  I cannot understand why he would object to the prudent provision for retirement and for the longer length of time which people will be drawing pensions, because of early retirement and greater longevity.</P>
    <P>I concur with my colleagues in the other House who said that it is not acceptable that a widow should only receive half of her late husband's pension.  The earning spouse, who is usually the husband, should be allowed to provide for his widow at the full rate of pension.  I do not understand the principle that a widow can exist on half the pension which the couple received before her husband's death.  She faces the same expenses and expects the same quality of life.  This recommendation is to promote personal funding of retirement pensions to meet the reality of their pensionable years which people face today.</P>
    <P>Many difficulties are looming in relation to the ability of the State and individuals to fund pension requirements in the future.  Because of this, no brake should be put on allowing individuals personally to fund their own requirements, thereby ensuring they will never become dependent on the State.  I urge the Minister to accept the recommendation.</P>

      <P>The Senator has read what I said in the Dáil and I come from the same starting position as she does.  I have never understood the reason for these rules and I do not understand why one cannot provide for a pension of 100 per cent of one's final salary.  I gave this matter considerable thought and decided to await the final report of the pensions body which will report to the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs very shortly.  I will then have a complete picture.  Senator Doyle will know my thinking on this matter from her reading of what I said in the Dáil and from my discourse with the late Deputy Coveney and Deputy Barrett.  Many of the rules which apply in this area are quite ridiculous.  They may have been introduced to suit insurance companies. The Senator can be assured that I will take action on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 51, before section 26, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;Section 286 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (2):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(3) In respect of any bus used for the carriage of members of the public there shall be <Col N="1171" /> available free depreciation for the purposes of determining what capital allowances are available to a person for any chargeable period.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The recommendation is to allow for free depreciation on buses and to encourage investors and financial institutions to take up the capital cost of providing buses and leasing them at more favourable rates to Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and private bus operators.  The quality of life in our capital city and elsewhere is adversely affected by the ever increasing and uneconomic use of the private car.  The cost of gridlock in our cities in probably inestimable but those who have attempted to estimate it calculate the cost at £1 billion.  If the Minister rejects this recommendation on the basis of cost to the Exchequer I would urge him to look at the fuller picture of the loss to the economy and the Exchequer of this gridlock.  People will not be encouraged to leave their cars at home and use public transport unless its quality is acceptable to the modern commuter. The DART has been a great success.  It is clean, efficient and available when people want it.  It is used to almost maximum capacity at peak times. Dublin Bus is not used to the same extent because the traffic flow does not make this option as efficient as it might be, but more importantly because of the standard of the stock.</P>
    <P>Generally, buses are still substandard.  The quality of the environment for the passenger in the bus is not up to what the modern commuter expects.  One need only look at what happened when modern rail stock was introduced &mdash; people used the railways.  Once the service is efficient and the surroundings are pleasant, people will use public transport.  When one has cold, grotty and dirty stock that battles to keep to timetables because of traffic, people will not switch from cars to buses in sufficient numbers.</P>
    <P>This is a horse and cart situation.  We cannot prevent gridlock until we induce sufficient numbers of the public to use our public transport system, but they will not use that system if the stock is substandard.  I urge the Minister to accept this recommendation, which seeks to reduce the cost to Dublin Bus and private bus operators of replacing, expanding and upgrading their fleets.</P>
    <P>The school bus sector is another area that this provision would help significantly.  This may not be relevant to Dublin, but some of the buses used to bring children to and from rural schools would not pass inspection for cattle transport.  They are dirty, emit exhaust fumes and bellow out blue smoke.  We have very stringent regulations regarding the transport of animals but we are not half as fussy about how children are transported. I have raised this strange anomaly both here and in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This incentive for both public and private sectors to replace bus fleets and, through favourable lease and tax arrangements, to lease buses would alleviate many existing problems.  The Minister understands the principle behind this amendment, <Col N="1172" /> which would be supported by the Dublin Transportation Office and local authority members in Dublin.  The commuting public would be delighted to use bus services in Dublin if there was an efficient, clean and modern stock in which to travel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle's recommendation. This is an imaginative, proactive proposal which seems a win-win situation.  During the Dublin North by-election, electors' top concerns were transport and traffic.  The Minister will be aware of the huge increase in traffic.  A sign of the booming economy has been the difficulties presented by increased car numbers, and we must encourage people to use public transport.</P>
      <P>One way is to provide acceptable public transport, and this is a proactive way of encouraging that.  I presume the Minister has done his sums on this proposal, but it seems an imaginative one that will help the environment and people's quality of life, as well as encouraging better use of the road system.  I recommend that the Minister give this proposal serious consideration.</P>

      <P>I support the recommendation, given that I have lived in Dublin all my life, have been on Dublin City Council for the past 20 years and am a bus user.  There is a serious problem with traffic in Dublin.  The Dublin Transport Initiative is addressing this in a fourfold way: the LUAS, the Liffey tunnel, traffic cells and, most important, quality bus corridors.  When quality bus corridors are introduced, buses will have dedicated routes. If Dublin Bus can provide sufficient buses, the commuter will switch from the car to the bus. However, Dublin Bus will not have the rolling stock to meet the demand when those corridors are introduced and financial assistance must be provided to that body to meet that demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this recommendation. The purpose of the Finance Bill is to enhance and progress public policy, and environmental issues can be addressed by this measure.  People's quality of life can also be improved.  Tax relief on depreciation of value for mechanical vehicles intended for the carriage of large numbers of people would be very desirable.  Individual carriage has led to gridlock and poor quality of life for many people, though the bicycle could be omitted from this assertion.  This provision would encourage more public transport.  The private sector could also get involved in ensuring greater use of buses and discouraging car owners from using their cars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar amendment on Report Stage in the Dáil led to a very interesting debate on transportation in Dublin.  I gave my views on this matter on that occasion.  If I could be convinced that this proposal would do anything to alleviate the transport problem in Dublin <Col N="1173" /> I would accept it.  However, this amendment would do zilch for the transport problem in Dublin and would be a considerable cost to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The recommendation seeks to provide accelerated capital allowances up to 100 per cent in year one for capital expenditure incurred in the provision of buses.  At present, capital expenditure on buses can be written off over five years at the rate of 20 per cent per annum.  Taxis and cars for short term hire are entitled to a rate of 40 per cent.  Since the early 1990s accelerated capital allowances have generally been phased out in a reform of the tax system with the objective of broadening the tax base.  However, prior to these reforms, at no stage were buses entitled to accelerated capital allowances.  To move in this direction would seem to be a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>Accelerated capital allowances for buses would encourage financial institutions to become involved in leasing buses, which would be inevitable. Accelerated capital allowances could not be availed of by CIE or Dublin Bus because of lack of taxable capacity to absorb the allowances.  Financial institutions could avail of the allowances and would benefit substantially.  The consequence would be a reduced tax yield for financial institutions. The provision of extra bus capacity is an alternative to other forms of transport and should not be considered in isolation.</P>
      <P>A broader view needs to be taken of the transportation area as a whole, bearing in mind the future requirements of the various competing elements of the system.  There is no evidence that the lack of accelerated capital allowances is curtailing bus activity.  I cannot accept the recommendation because, as I explained in the other House, I am not convinced that this amendment will achieve anything in the transportation area but rather will result in a considerable cost to the taxpayer by reducing the tax yield from financial institutions.</P>
      <P>If one gives accelerated capital allowances for vehicles, the financial institution will become the owner of the vehicle and technically will lease it to the company at a lower rate because they will get a tax break.  The leasing cost to the company receiving it will be somewhat lower and the tax rate goes to the lessor company.  Dublin Bus or CIE do not have a taxable capacity and it makes no difference to them as they will not avail of the capital allowances.  If they bought the buses directly they would, but that is no good to them because they do not have a taxable activity to set off their capital allowances.</P>

I accept some innovative thinking needs to be done.  I commend Deputy Olivia Mitchell, who proposed this initiative, which shows she is thinking about the transportation problem in Dublin.</P>
      <P>The only loser will be the Exchequer, because of reduced tax from the financial institutions.  I commend Senators and Deputies for applying their minds to this problem.

      <P>This recommendation relates to section 482 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which provides relief from tax in the respect of the cost of repair, maintenance or restoration of approved buildings and gardens which are of significant scientific, historical, architectural or aesthetic interest and to which reasonable access is afforded to the public.  Additional relief was provided in last year's Finance Act for expenditure <Col N="1175" /> up to £5,000 per annum for (a) the repair, maintenance or restoration of the contents of an approved building or garden subject to certain conditions, (b) the installation, maintenance or replacement of a security alarm system or (c) public liability insurance for approved buildings or gardens.</P>
      <P>The Senator proposes to increase this figure of £5,000 to £20,000.  There is no necessity for this increase.

      <P>I do not intend to delay the House on the discussion of this amendment which differs in people's order of priorities.  It is a tragedy we are losing many of our approved houses and gardens.  Given the inordinate cost of preserving this important part of our heritage, we should look at the £5,000 figure again.  I accept the Minister may not be able to increase it to £20,000 in one budget or Finance Bill.  I ask him to at least double the figure to a more realistic £10,000.</P>
      <P>The principle of this amendment and this aspect of our heritage concerns me.  People do not wake up in the morning and think this is a major issue.  However, once these houses and gardens are gone, the finger will be pointed at successive Governments for their neglect of our heritage. There must be realistic incentives to ensure these houses and gardens continue to be lived in and maintained because they are an intrinsic part of our heritage.  I urge the Minister to look at this provision again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in the other House, there is a misconception about this matter.  The problem Senator Doyle referred to was addressed as far back as the Finance Act, 1982, which provided that relief for expenditure on repair and maintenance of a building or garden is not subject to any limit.  Taxpayers receive marginal relief which covers all such expenditure.  The repair and maintenance is fully allowed against a person's tax, but it does not provide for items such as public liability insurance, the installation and maintenance of an alarm system, the contents or the garden, which are annual ongoing costs.  Last year my predecessor, Deputy Quinn, introduced a £5,000 tax break for this kind of expenditure.</P>

      <P>(b) by the substitution of the following subsection for subsection (3):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&lsquo;(3) The farming pollution capital allowances to be made in accordance with subsection (2) in respect of capital <Col N="1177" /> expenditure increased in a chargeable period may, where a person so elects, be any amount not exceeding 100 per cent of that expenditure or £30,000 whichever is the lesser, in respect of one or more years during a writing-down period of 7 years&rsquo;;</P>
    <P>(c) by the insertion of a new subsection after subsection (3):</P>
    <P>&lsquo;(3A) In respect of activities which are the subject of an integrated pollution control licence under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, as respects the first year of the writing-down period referred to in subsection (2) where the capital expenditure was incurred on or after the 6th day of April, 1998 an amount equal to 50 per cent of that expenditure or £100,000 whichever is the lesser.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This recommendation relates to spending in the agriculture and food area and in particular to capital allowances in relation to investment under the dairy hygiene and farmyard pollution regulations, in addition to the matter of capital expenditure on pollution control.  I am reiterating the point, made earlier by my colleagues, that this expenditure by farmers is not voluntary.  They have to find this money regardless of profitability in the year in question.  They do not even have the latitude to wait a few years until they can get the money together.  They must find this money in large measure to comply with EU directives.  It is in all our interests that farmers comply with these directives on health, hygiene and the environment. The Minister should be more generous about how he views capital allowances for investment in this area in order to reflect farmers' actual expenditure.  We are not talking about farmers spending from annual profits &mdash; it is money they have to find, regardless of their income for the year in question.</P>

Now, however, I am being asked by the Senator to increase the allowable qualifying expenditure to £100,000 and to reduce the writing-down period.

      <P>This proposal is to oppose the changes in self-assessment deadlines that were requested by the Institute of Taxation.  In one fell swoop the Minister was going to change the timescale for the deadlines for the self-employed.  In his speech two days ago, the Minister went into some detail about having a change of heart on this matter, even though he will stick by the principle.  He is probably right and will not be opposing it in the same fashion.  Nevertheless, it is difficult for the Institute of Taxation to change deadlines without much prior notice being given.  I am not sure if any consultation took place.  The outburst from the institute, that it was simply impossible for these changes to occur within the deadlines set out by the Minister, seems to be quite genuine. I would like the Minister to clarify the present situation relating to deadlines.</P>

That would be a sensible approach.</P>
      <P>I have subjected this section to a commencement order so it will not take effect until 30 November 1999.  The dates have been brought back by two months and the payment of preliminary tax has been pushed out, but it is subject to a commencement order and cannot come into effect until I sign it.  In the meantime I will have discussions with the accountancy and taxation professions to assess what the full impact of these proposals will be.  In the intervening period I hope to put some meat on the bones of my long held view that we should move the start of the tax year from 6 April to 1 January and put everything on a calendar year basis.  It is one of the goals I set for myself before becoming Minister for Finance.  There is plenty of time for all this to be worked out.  I do not go along with what the Institute of Taxation said.</P>

As I stated on Second Stage, with respect to those learned people, I found the Institute of Taxation's correspondence slightly over the top.  Their hyperbole did not do justice to a reasonable case that could have been made in terms of concerns.  Unlike the Minister, I do not come from an accounting background, but I think most people should be able to get their books in order in the seven months from April to November.  The support of tax practitioners for the self-assessment system is important for the compliant running of the system. It is the single most important step we have taken in relation to our taxation system in recent years.  The Minister's intention to bring the tax year back from April to January will negate the concern enunciated by the Institute of Taxation.

Therefore, we are looking a couple of years down the road.  Would it be reasonable to move the start of the tax year to 1 January and the change of the filing date for self-assessment in the one year so that the point the Institute of Taxation makes reasonably, certainly in terms of the first year's treatment, would be taken care of in one step? Now we may cause logistical problems for tax practitioners for a year or two but they should resolve themselves immediately once the Minister reverts to a 1 January or 4 January start to the tax year.

      <P>The Senator has put her finger on one of the main reasons I subjected this particular section to a commencement order.  As regards my long-term view to come back to a calendar year, I moved on this in this year's Finance Bill because a good amount of notice needs to be given as to my intention.</P>
      <P>There is a group comprising the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners examining this particular problem because, as I pointed out on Second Stage, apart from the logistics for accountants and taxpayers there is a possible financial implication for the State also. Everybody's tax allowances would apply for the calendar year, that is, from 1 January not 6 April &mdash; I gave the historic background of 6 April.  All that must be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Since I have held these views for a long number of years when I became Minister for Finance I tried to put them into effect.  In my discussions in the Department and with the Revenue Commissioners it was felt that, with the year 2000 problem with computers approaching and all that that entails, to announce at the same time a move to a calendar year basis in the year 1999-2000 might have been too much to take on.  The whole machinery could collapse.</P>

      <P>If I am in a position to go to that particular base and have consultations with tax practitioners and others, I envisage that this particular section will never come into effect because it will obviate the particular problems.  As I said on Second Stage, the new dates will be probably more acceptable for both filing dates and preliminary taxes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move recommendation No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 82, before section 55, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;55.&mdash;In determining whether a company is resident in the State for the purposes of the Principal Act, and without prejudice to any other enactment or rule of law whereby a company is deemed to be so resident, any company incorporated in the State pursuant to the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, shall be deemed to be so resident.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This recommendation is intended to eliminate the scope for Irish registered non-resident companies to operate in the manner in which they seem to have been operating.  There has been much concern expressed in recent weeks and months about the vexed issue of Irish registered non-resident companies, how they have operated in this jurisdiction and the controls in their regard.  Indeed, the Minister is on record as saying that we simply do not know how many of them exist because there is no mechanism to register them; there is no mechanism for knowing what they do, from where they come and how they operate.</P>
      <P>There was mention in the media of a figure of 40,000 Irish registered non-resident companies operating in some capacity, largely through the Irish Financial Services Centre.  I am not sure whether that is the case, but the fact is these companies exist and they have used Ireland to avoid paying tax.  Effectively, it would seem to be a tax scam where the tax is not paid in the home jurisdiction nor in this jurisdiction because each jurisdiction believes it is being paid in the other.  This appears to be a foolproof way of evading tax.</P>
      <P>This recommendation ensures that any company incorporated in the State pursuant to the Companies Acts, 1963 to 1990, shall be deemed to be so resident.  This will eliminate the scope for Irish registered non-resident companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a substantial discussion on this amendment in the other House both on Committee and Report Stages.  I made it clear then how I proposed to address the problem of Irish registered non-resident companies which are being used for illegitimate purposes.</P>
      <P>It is an unfortunate fact that once promoters of undesirable companies gain a certificate of incorporation they can use the company for their intended purposes which can be damaging to Ireland's reputation.  It is also a fact that companies can be incorporated here under company law without the necessity to disclose the identity of the real people behind the company.</P>
      <P>This recommendation proposes that a company which is incorporated in the State will be resident here for tax purposes, irrespective of the location of its central management and/or control or, indeed, assets.  The Senator should understand that many Irish incorporated companies which are not tax resident here are used for legitimate purposes.  These company structures are favoured by certain foreign multinationals which have invested here and which make such a vital contribution to the success of the Irish economy.  The Government is committed to finding the right solution to this problem but any solution would have to be one which does not adversely impact on Ireland's attractiveness for foreign direct investment.</P>
      <P>On Committee and Report Stages in the other House Deputy McDowell, who on behalf of the Labour Party moved an amendment on the lines of the Senator's recommendation, acknowledged that the proposal may be too broad an approach. In addition, consideration would have to be given to the question of enforcement of any tax owed by the companies involved.</P>
      <P>As I told the other House, it is my intention to address the issue in a measured and rational way. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Finance will continue to work towards a practical solution from a company law and tax perspective.  I propose to put forward this solution for comment by relevant parties before the Government takes a decision and that remains my position.</P>
      <P>There was a long debate in the other House and I think it was quite useful.  It is a pity it was not covered to a greater extent in the media.  I put on the record how I thought the figure of 40,000 companies came about.  Nobody has contradicted the assertions I made there so I must assume that the initial allegation &mdash; whether or not it is true &mdash; was made in an article in a British tax journal in 1995 which stated out of the blue that there could be 40,000 of these companies in Ireland.  It was repeated in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> but no indication was given regarding how the figure of 40,000 was arrived at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of any contradiction, I am forced to conclude that the figure arose from comments made in an article which appeared in two British tax journals in 1995 and which was attributed <Col N="1183" /> to the same author.  The article was originally published in one journal but its author must have received a higher fee from the second journal to have it reprinted.  The individual in question is a very eminent person and he works for a company registered in the Isle of Man.  In the articles to which I referred, he gave his views in respect of non-resident companies and the situation in the UK.  I suspect the figure that appeared in the recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> originated from that source.</P>
    <P>As stated in the Lower House, I do not know if the figure of 40,000 is correct and I pointed out the downside of accepting the broad, sweeping approach suggested by Senator Costello.  I understand what he is attempting to do but if we adopted his recommendation we would close down the legitimate activity of a number of multinational companies that use this protective technique. As the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, pointed out in the debate on this matter in the Lower House &mdash; which arose from background notes inadvertently supplied with the reply to a parliamentary question &mdash; this is a complex area.  On a number of occasions I stated that we must move forward on three fronts: tax law, company law and, possibly, criminal law.  That remains my position.</P>

      <P>This section relates to capital gains tax.  There are certain areas where the 20 per cent rate the Minister intends to introduce will apply and where the 40 per cent rate will continue to apply.  It is a matter of record that we have not been sympathetic to his attempts to reduce the capital gains rate from 40 per cent to 20 per cent.  Where capital gains tax extends to a private residence, which is intended for investment or speculative purposes rather than residential purposes, we are seeking that a larger proportion should be subject to tax at the higher rate rather than the lower one.  This section, where changes have been made to capital gains, is extremely important because of the ripple effect it will have on society, the disposal of property and the price of houses.  It will turn housing construction into property investment and speculation. Will the Minister respond to our serious concerns in that regard?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Senator's recommendation being ruled out of order because it represents a charge on the people, the Minister for Finance has no responsibility in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section relates to capital gains tax.  I have long held the view that the rate of capital gains tax was too high.  This view is shared by many people concerned with the development of entrepreneurial activity in our country.  To a large extent, capital gains tax is discretionary and it only arises when a person decides, for whatever reason, to dispose of a chargeable asset, whether a business, a shareholding or otherwise.  Consciously or unconsciously, a 40 per cent capital gains tax rate was a significant ingredient in making the decision of whether to make a disposal.  I <Col N="1185" /> am convinced that in many cases people decided not to make a disposal because they were not prepared to pay tax at that level.  This high tax also resulted, for those who could afford them, in the proliferation of avoidance schemes which attempted to circumvent the imposition of the tax.  In some instances individuals chose to emigrate and realise their capital gains abroad.</P>
    <P>The 40 per cent rate interfered excessively with the organic development of our enterprise culture. In reducing the standard rate to 20 per cent, I wish to encourage the owners of existing indigenous businesses to grow to a size and scale necessary to compete successfully in the international marketplace.  I wish to encourage those who have a business idea to &ldquo;go for it&rdquo;, in the knowledge that the rewards of their success will not be unduly diluted by tax.  I also wish to encourage our entrepreneurs to remain at home. Everyone, including the Exchequer, will benefit from this.</P>
    <P>It should be recalled that when capital gains tax was first introduced in 1975 the rate was 26 per cent in contrast to the then highest rate of income tax of 77 per cent.  With regard to the yield, while on a static basis the cost of this new rate to the Exchequer will be £40 million per year, the new lower rate will lead to considerably more disposals which will make up for the shortfall viewed from the static basis.  In the budget I stated that the figure for net cost to the State will be £19 million, possibly from a static basis, which is calculated on the basis that there will be a growth cost of £40 million, a cost of at least £20 million because of increases in activity and there will be a saving of £1 million because of my intention to put in a <i>de minimis</i> exemption of £500.  I have no doubt that the increased activity brought about by this change will lead to a substantial yield to the Exchequer in the future.</P>
    <P>As I stated on Second Stage, if people were familiar with my past comments in respect of capital gains tax they would have been able to predict what I intended to do about it in the budget.  It is obvious that people believe you often say one thing in Opposition and do another on coming to power.  However, my party was often in Government when I made my remarks about capital gains tax.  Therefore, people should not have been surprised that I reduced the rate of capital gains tax in the budget.  I believe this will pay off because I am firmly of the view that it is better to encourage people to be adventurous in implementing their business ideas.  They will not implement those ideas if they believe the State will claw back too much money through tax. That is an unfortunate fact which some people with a certain ideology do not want to recognise. I am not of that view.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this section because, as he stated, in the past we assumed that enterprise would come from outside the country.  Indigenous industry does not have a great record of establishing enterprise.  Capital gains tax was a definite disincentive for those considering establishing and developing businesses.  I was particularly interested by the Minister's statement that the Revenue will benefit from this reduction in taxation.  This is an imaginative effort on the Minister's part to encourage indigenous industry to create enterprise and I believe the Revenue will benefit.</P>

      <P>I do not disagree greatly with what the Minister and Senator Quinn have said. However, there should be a more selective use of capital gains tax in terms of its application because it may fuel inflation, particularly in the property market.  It will bring the investment and speculative sectors into the market fully and they will competing with each other to turn homes into property portfolios.  Reducing capital gains tax will make it easier to buy and sell property.  A selective reduction directed at enterprise and business expansion would be welcome.  However, the reduction proposed could have been more selective.  In the long run this will have a detrimental effect in a number of areas.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;71.&mdash;(1) Section 597 of the Principal Act is hereby amended&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) in subsection (2), by the substitution for paragraphs (f) and (g) of the following paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(f) such of the activities of a body of persons established for the sole purpose of promoting athletic or amateur games or sports as are directed to that purpose,</P>
      <P>(g) farming, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(h) the letting of property where the individual or individuals are charged <Col N="1187" /> under section 75 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to extend roll-over relief to various sectors that do not currently enjoy it, in particular, those providing private rented accommodation.  We do not have to restate the nature of the crisis for first time house buyers in urban areas, Dublin in particular, and the increased demand for private rented accommodation. The sectors named in the recommendation should be treated as other business entities are treated at present.</P>
    <P>This provision is essential to ensure a sufficient supply of quality rented accommodation at affordable rents.  If property owners trade up run down, poorly furnished accommodation for better accommodation and have to pay tax at each stage, rents will increase.  I do not say the Exchequer should be denied the tax.  The principle of roll-over relief is that the tax is deferred until the end of the chain, so to speak, and when the final property is sold and the owner is out of the property leasing business the tax accrues.  The tax should be deferred until this final element in the chain to ensure that the improved accommodation which property owners can provide will be available at affordable rents rather than have tax paid at each point in the chain and the tax passed on by way of increased rents.</P>
    <P>I can pre-empt the Minister's reply.  I know he spoke to the Irish Property Owners Association and he was categoric in his view.  The point is one of equity, particularly given that the Exchequer is not denied the tax.  Its payment would merely be postponed until the final link in the chain of trading in properties.</P>

This would mean that a landlord could sell a rental property and invest the proceeds in a new investment rental property without incurring capital gains tax liability at that time and that the capital gains tax liability would not arise until the new property was disposed of and the proceeds from that sale were not invested in a further property.  The present roll-over relief provisions are targeted primarily at the replacement of trading assets.</P>

      <P>In page 141, line 27, after &ldquo;Schedule 8A&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;or any other area which the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government (which recommendations shall take into consideration an economic plan for the area submitted by a local authority or a company established by a local authority and prepared by the local authority in co-operation with any other groups in the area which are funded by the Exchequer or the European Union and which are charged with promoting economic development in the area, to that Minister in respect of an area identified <Col N="1189" /> by it), by order direct that the area or areas described (being wholly located within the boundaries of the area to which the Economic Plan relates) in the order shall be a qualifying area for the purpose of one or more sections of this Chapter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This recommendation seeks to extend the rural renewal reliefs and to condition them in terms of a strategic plan.  The Minister should accept this recommendation.  I have been concerned for some time about the number of self-help or bottom-up groups working in their own way with their own terms of reference, as it were, without a strategic focus.  They have a great contribution to make above and beyond the sum of their individual contributions.  I refer to the various Leader groups, area partnerships, vocational education committees and local authority development groups.  There is a plethora of different groups in different areas working to individual agendas rather than to a strategic plan.  The Minister should consider this proposal where, if an economic plan for an area was submitted through the local authority or by a company established by the local authority, the provisions he is making to encourage rural renewal would be thereby extended to them.</P>
    <P>I am making a plea out of frustration to try to do something about the self-help organisations which have mushroomed in recent years to ensure we harness, for the benefit of local and rural communities, the best possible outcome from the endeavours, work and investment being made by the national and European Exchequers in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Avril Doyle in this regard.  I spoke earlier in another context about a win win situation.  If ever there was a win win situation, this is clearly one.  The tax incentives and designations for urban areas have succeeded very well.  There has been a real benefit from encouraging investment in urban renewal, whether we look at the International Financial Services or at towns in which there has been a successful experience of investment in urban renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Avril Doyle's recommendation is as effective in attempting to achieve and stimulate economic activity in rural areas.  The objective behind it is to somehow or other stem the decline in the area of rural development.  The population in rural areas is unlikely to increase in the future because it is unlikely that we will encourage enough development into these areas.  Agriculture alone will no longer sustain economic development.  Even if agriculture produces more, it will employ fewer people.  Therefore, the objective of investment in rural areas and in rural development is something we should have high on our agenda.  That objective has not been grasped, given the opportunities available to us. This recommendation allows us to follow through <Col N="1190" /> to rural areas what has been successfully achieved in urban renewal.</P>
    <P>I refer to an example of four local development groups in the Limerick-Cork which have come together with the local authorities to combat rural decline probably what is the worst affected areas of Cork and Limerick.  Those four groups have worked together with the local authority and formed an economic strategy committee and planning group and have developed an economic strategic plan.  This type of activity needs to be encouraged and we must find a way to encourage others to support such a movement.  Those in that area reckon that over £20 million has been invested in urban renewal by those resident in the area because of Government incentives for urban renewal.</P>
    <P>The Minister must give attention to such development.  We heard his response previously and he will say this is a pilot scheme, so let us see how it develops.  He will probably say this may even establish a precedent on which he does not wish to follow through.  This is an area in which we should encourage such development because it will answer all the questions asked and concerns raised previously about the difficulties of such encouragement.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give this recommendation serious consideration.  It is a win win situation and this is an imaginative proposal.  Urban renewal has succeeded and this recommendation provides us with the opportunity to enable rural development to succeed.  As Deputy Avril Doyle said, it co-ordinates all the activities.  If it allows do it yourself self-help groups established in an area to achieve this, then we should act.  For that reason, this recommendation is worthy of consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this worthy recommendation and also support the Government's initiative including this provision in the Finance Bill, 1998.  Our problem is not so much with the principle of the proposal but with the manner in and procedure by which it is proposed to implement it.  My only criticism of the recommendation tabled by Senator Avril Doyle is that qualified rural areas are defined after the drawing up and submission of an economic plan.  I would extend that to include a social plan because we are talking about people and a wide range of issues, but I am sure that is probably included in the general context in which Senator Doyle proposes the recommendation.</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise that while this is relatively new in relation to large areas of rural counties west of the Shannon, we have tax designation for seaside resorts and specified areas.  The essence and success story of tax designation has been the urban areas.  There is much, both good and bad, to be learned from that in that some of the development has been desirable, while some has not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1191" /> Because this was not as planned as it should have been, the Department of the Environment and Local Government now requires integrated area plans.  For tax designation in the future, the local authority is obliged to provide an integrated area plan which covers not only a narrow designation in terms of tax relief, but also the broad repercussions and implications on other areas. Physical, property, educational, health and social climates are taken into account in the plan.  That is the reason such a recommendation is so important.</P>
    <P>A body of information should be put together locally which will inform the best use of tax measures and relief and, indeed, other reliefs and funding which might come from the EU or the Exchequer.  We cannot allow such development to occur in a haphazard fashion and the next two recommendations suggest it is fairly haphazard in terms of location.  There is much to be said for having a responsible group and, ideally, a statutory group like the local authority.  However, other groups have developed and thrived with European and Exchequer money over the years and which have much to give also.</P>
    <P>There will be much pressure to maintain the population along the western seaboard in the future.  With European money drying up for the agricultural sector in future years, we will have to find new methods to at least maintain or increase existing populations.  Already large areas have been denuded of their traditional population. There should be integrated area plans for the entire western seaboard, particularly in areas where problems have been identified and where there is a need for rural development.  I commend this recommendation to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for raising this issue.  This is a pilot scheme and is confined to a specific area which was clearly identified as in serious need of some rejuvenation.  This scheme needs EU approval which has not yet been granted.  The purpose of the recommendation is to enlarge the definition of qualifying rural area for the purposes of reliefs being provided for in the new chapter 8 of Part 10 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, which is introduced by section 77 of the Finance Bill, 1998.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the areas listed in Schedule 8A, that is, all of Counties Leitrim and Longford as well as certain specified areas in Counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo, the recommendation envisages certain other areas which might be recommended to the Minister for Finance by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. This recommendation in turn would have regard to an economic plan for the particular area submitted by a local authority or a company established by a local authority.  It is proposed that the economic plan would be prepared by the local authority in co-operation with certain <Col N="1192" /> Exchequer or EU funded groups in the area charged with promoting economic development in the area.</P>
    <P>The structure proposed in the recommendation for defining qualifying rural areas is akin to that to be used for identifying qualifying areas in the context of the new urban renewal scheme introduced by section 76.  However, there is a crucial difference between the two schemes in that the urban renewal arrangements will apply, subject to conditions, to urban areas countrywide, whereas the rural renewal initiative is a pilot project focused on a limited and specifically defined part of the country &mdash; parts of the upper Shannon region.  To follow the line proposed in the recommendation would result in rural areas in all parts of the country coming within the scope of the new initiative, and this would be incompatible with the proposals for rural renewal as envisaged when the Minister announced the scheme in last December's budget.  At the time he stated clearly the area in which the new arrangements would apply &mdash; the upper Shannon &mdash; and he also pointed out that the introduction of such a scheme would need EU approval.  Preliminary discussions in that regard with the Commission have taken place and the initial response has not been unfavourable.  This was coloured in large measure by the fact that the project was limited in scope and aimed at a disadvantaged region of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt there are other areas which would benefit from this type of incentive package, but the Minister is not in a position to provide for an enlargement or a potential enlargement of the area already earmarked for the scheme.  It goes without saying that, apart from EU considerations, the larger an area designated, the less impact the incentive has.  Its effects become diluted by being spread too widely.  This is a novel project and the Minister must be realistic in what he is attempting to achieve by it &mdash; the renewal and invigoration of parts of the upper Shannon region.  Spreading the scheme over the potentially wide areas which could result from acceptance of the recommendation would not be in keeping with what he hopes the proposals will achieve and he therefore cannot accept the recommendation. It is important to emphasise that this is a pilot scheme and we will have to wait to see how it works.  We still await EU approval for it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of EU approval, is there any indication as to how this proposal is likely to be viewed?  Is there any reason to fear the case made by the Minister for this pilot scheme will not be accepted?  Second, would the Minister not have achieved the same outcome if he had extended the pilot scheme to all parts of rural Ireland but for a limited period only?  The Minister of State may say that there is a finite amount of investment which, if spread too thinly, would not achieve the same results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> The urban renewal scheme was confined to limited areas of one or two towns or cities at the start.  That has been extended slowly but surely and it has been extremely effective.  A different ethos lies behind the rural renewal scheme and it is a different type of investment we are attempting to attract.  I support what the Minister is trying to achieve, but I am not convinced that restricting the scheme to a few parts of the northwest is making the best possible use of this limited scheme.  If it is agreed to by the EU this time, it will not agree to it a second time when we seek an extension.  That is why I would like us to have our foot in the door rather than just pushing it open.  It would ensure the maximum return is achieved from the rural renewal principles upon which this section is based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle.  The question of EU approval is almost a fudge.  The EU would certainly approve of this scheme because it does exactly what the Union wants done &mdash; co-ordinating self-help groups.  One such group was in touch with me: the Ballyhoura development group in County Limerick.  What it has put together is exactly the sort of initiative of which the European Union would approve and which it would encourage and hope to intensify.  It is important the Minister recognises that the initiative he has taken needs to be widened.  I recognise it is a pilot scheme but it could be more successful if it were widened using the recommendations made here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add a few words as I raised this issue on Second Stage.  The Minister stated that this scheme would be examined in future budgets.  I accept it is a pilot scheme and I appreciate that County Leitrim was included in it, as it deserved to be.  The NESC report covered all the western counties which, together with Border counties, ensured we had Objective One status until now, although they possibly fared the worst from it.  Given the reduction in EU funds, I hope the scheme is a success and, if so, that it will be extended to western counties in future Finance Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been informal discussions with the EU, as Senator Doyle is aware from her former ministerial post, and it views this scheme in a not unfavourable light.  A formal presentation must be made and a great deal of work has been done to get to that stage.</P>
      <P>I understand the points Senators make and would make many of them myself if I took the narrow focus of my own area.  What is important is that this is a pilot scheme.  Leitrim was accepted by all Senators and Deputies as a particularly serious case.  It was also the case that the scheme would be viewed more favourably by the EU if it applied around the Border area because it is identified by it, as it is by us, as an area which needs rejuvenation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> It is wrong to suggest, as Senator Quinn does, that these schemes are a matter of course and that there is no doubt about their approval by the EU. That is not the case.  What the Minister has done is correct.  He has chosen a specific area to be targeted and for which one can argue the introduction of such a scheme as this.  It has been clearly signalled and flagged as an innovative pilot scheme, so the EU will understand it in those terms.</P>
    <P>If it is agreed and a certain level of investment takes place, we will observe the cause and effect of that.  If it is shown to successful in the way the Minister and the Government wants, we will then be in a stronger position to request a widening of the scheme as Senators suggested.  As things stand, we are proceeding on that basis but that is not to negate the honesty of the arguments made.</P>

      <P>In page 171, to delete lines 8 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The administrative county of Roscommon.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that Senator Connor specifically asked me to table this recommendation in his name.  He cannot be present as he is at a funeral.</P>
      <P>How were the counties of Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Roscommon and Sligo selected?  Only part of Counties Roscommon and Sligo were selected.  How does the Minister justify leaving out the DEDs in the rest of Roscommon, Sligo and Cavan?  Only by knowing that can we understand why other areas are not included.  I am moving the recommendation that the administrative county of Roscommon be included.  Is there a difference between the administrative county and the entire county?  There can be differences in certain cases.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept that this pilot scheme is not to be extended.  I can think of parts of Mayo and Roscommon which I would have immediately assumed would be included.  We can all pick areas.  It is hard to understand why they are not all included.  In the absence of a clear explanation of the selection procedure we must remain aggrieved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Doyle's views on this matter.  I know the area concerned is the upper Shannon area geographically, but I do no think it can be limited to that as it cuts across many boundaries, administrative boundaries in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> This relates to the earlier discussion of which bodies are best able to deal with an integrated social and economic plan.  The administrative body of the local authority is the ideal body in general because it has the engineers, architects and rural developers within its boundaries.  Some will be included and some will be left out.  All of Counties Longford and Leitrim are included but only parts of Counties Cavan, Roscommon and Sligo.  The part of Sligo in which I was born is included in this area so I clearly come from a disadvantaged area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see it included but I could list many other district electoral divisions in the Sligo adjacent to this area which would deserve the designation for this rejuvenation scheme.</P>
      <P>Because this is a rural development scheme it would be better to limit it to rural areas and that areas such as the county borough of Sligo be left out, but the county council area would be included for administrative purposes.  A mistake has been made by simply looking at an area on the map.  When that area cuts across county boundaries and jurisdictions it will be difficult to operate without setting up another administrative mechanism.  We must recognise the strengths of local authority structures and give them the responsibility of dealing with it.  That is what has happened in the local authority in Dublin, the integrated plans for rejuvenation and tax designation are all being drawn up by its officials.  They have the responsibility for implementing it, they will seek the European funds to complement the funds from the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a fresh look be taken at the administrative side of the matter and at the counties area before this is implemented.  I would like to see the scheme considerably extended in Sligo, where two thirds of the geographical land are left out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased two thirds of County Roscommon were included.  I understand the reasoning behind that as there was a census report showing a massive decrease in population in the section of the county which is included.  The section of the county which is not included experienced a 14 per cent increase in population. It is important that all of County Longford has been included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps some discussion should take place with officials of the council authorities.  There can be problems in implementing this scheme where it would conflict with county development plans. There would be problems with planning applications similar to those in many rural areas.  Some discussion is needed as all of the developments <Col N="1196" /> which take place under this proposal will need planning permission.  Conflict has already arisen in discussions at local authority level.  As a result we may not see the full advantage of the opportunities presented in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government should give an indication to local authorities that it is policy that rural renewal means development, with planning applications being granted and developments allowed.  The opportunity must not be lost due to restrictions implemented by planning officials at local authority level.  This could be one of the major drawbacks to this scheme.  The record will show that there are planning guidelines being implemented which are more suited to the United Kingdom rather than to a rural area with a declining population. While local authority members may make recommendations at planning level, and are responsible for the county development plans, the interpretation of those plans by officials could restrict what is being proposed.  I ask the Government to indicate that it is its wish that development takes place, otherwise there may be a loss.</P>

We have put the best possible scheme in place.  It is a pilot scheme which the Government is hopeful will produce the desired results. If it does so, our hand will be strengthened to look at other areas.</P>

      <P>I move recommendation No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 194, before section 118, to insert the following new section:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;118.&mdash;Any exemption from stamp duty on any instrument transferring by way of conveyance or lease an interest in a new dwelling-house or apartment shall apply to such an instrument relating to premises which were the subject of a previous conveyance or lease provided that the person acquiring the interest on the occasion in question is acquiring an interest in residential premises for the first time and is himself or herself taking up residence in the premises as his or her bona fide principal private residence, and the rates of stamp duty specified in the First Schedule to the Stamp Act, 1891, <Col N="1200" /> as amended by section 117 of and the Eighth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1997, shall not apply to the instrument.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This recommendation proposes that first time buyers of secondhand property be entitled to the same stamp duty relief as first time buyers of new property.  The principle in relation to stamp duty should extend to the buyer rather than the property. If the purchaser is a first time buyer and intends using the property as their private residence rather than for rental or other purposes, they should be entitled to relief from stamp duty whether the property is new or secondhand.  This is a basic principle which has been enunciated on a number of occasions by Senators Joe and Avril Doyle and to which there is no aversion on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>Stamp duty is an onerous burden for a new buyer, rising from 6 per cent to 9 per cent on houses costing between £60,000 to £150,000.  Virtually every home falls into that bracket, be it new or secondhand.  It is time to shift the advantage of tax incentives and exemptions more in favour of the consumer.  To date the advantage of tax relief has been in terms of the property, whether industrial, commercial, rental or a portfolio which can be sold on, and the investor.  The reduction in capital gains tax from 40 per cent to 20 per has meant that a portfolio can be sold much cheaper and more easily.  This has fuelled house prices so that what should be considered homes are now becoming property.  This is a major crisis which has ramifications for quality of life, apart altogether from the implications for inflation and the economic threat to social partnership. This issue has been raised by the social partners on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this recommendation is one small way in which a more level playing pitch can be achieved in relation to the purchase of homes. The issue concerns citizens purchasing homes for their own private use.  They should be given an edge by not having to pay the very substantial stamp duty.  The average price of a home in Dublin is £100,000, a figure which is rising rapidly on a weekly basis.</P>
    <P>There is no reason for not extending stamp duty exemption to secondhand homes.  It would level the playing pitch and would give some succour to couples and young families seeking to buy a house in a hostile market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the comments of Senator Costello, which concur with Fine Gael policy on this issue.  Stamp duty relief for first time buyers should be restricted to owner occupiers to avoid a situation where first time buyers could be purchasing property to set again.  We are trying to help first time buyers in the city &mdash; generally young couples working for good wages well above the industrial average &mdash; who cannot afford to purchase even a modest family house. We want to give them some advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1201" /> The Government commissioned a study on this issue and we await its report, particularly on house prices in Dublin.  The Minister is probably not in a position to accept one measure such as this as, ultimately, a package of measures may be necessary to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a real problem when ideologues such as Senator Ross say that this is an area in which we should interfere in the free market.  The situation must be very bad if Senator Ross and like minded persons agree that the Government should interfere with property prices through regulation or tax incentives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not subscribe to that latter point, but Senator Ross's call underlines the degree of concern that even absolute marketers have over property prices in Dublin.</P>
      <P>We would like stamp duty for first time buyers of secondhand houses to be reduced by £6,000, that is in line with the 6 per cent rate, for owner occupiers.  It should be restricted to owner occupiers as otherwise a clever investor could rent accommodation at a reasonable cost ten miles from the city and set his or her own home for which they received the stamp duty incentive.</P>

      <P>Recently I raised this issue during a Private Members' motion.  At that time I pointed out that a three bedroomed local authority house close to where I live sold for £130,000. Now, three or four weeks later, there is another house for sale in the same estate and the asking price is £170,000.  Prices are escalating on a daily basis.  This is a serious problem for young people and I urge the Government to give whatever relief is possible to first time buyers of secondhand houses, particularly young couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree this is a complex issue and wish to emphasise the Government's concern about it.  The Senators' recommendation is geared at making housing more affordable by granting stamp duty relief to first time buyers of new and secondhand houses.  However, I do not believe that adopting this recommendation will achieve this.  The rising house market is primarily attributable to the lack of supply of houses in the market and the Senators' proposals do not address this fundamental problem.  The effect of these proposals would be to increase the price of houses still further as vendors will say purchasers have more money available to them.  As someone who practised as an auctioneer for many years through the late 1970s and into the 1980s, a period which saw the last boom and subsequent decline, I very much concur with the view that a simple removal of stamp duty will not do anything for the purchaser: <Col N="1202" /> it will simply increase house prices, something experience teaches us.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle was correct when she said that a package of measures is required and that there is no one measure which will provide a solution. Even if this were not the case, prices would still rise due to market forces if the fundamental issue of supply is not addressed.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, has commissioned a study on house price rises and the remit of the consultants is to examine all available information in relation to house price trends, the factors influencing house prices and the implications of changing house price levels.  The Government will then use this information further to develop housing policy.  I do not wish to pre-empt the outcome of this study.</P>

    <P>(2) For the purpose of determining whether this section shall apply to any instrument, the Revenue Commissioners may require the delivery to them, in such form as they may specify, of a statement or statutory declaration by</P>

      <P>&ldquo;by the insertion of the following paragraph in the definition of &lsquo;relevant deposit&rsquo; after paragraph (h):</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(i) in respect of which the person beneficially entitled to any interest has received any compensation payment&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1205" /> I was very surprised to learn that awards to hepatitis C victims by the courts or the tribunal attracted DIRT.  I understand that other compensatory type payments have been exempted from DIRT and my recommendation asks that money awarded to hepatitis C be likewise exempted from DIRT.  I do not think we should add insult to injury and tax the income which accrue to awards when they are put on deposit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this recommendation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>As conceived, and announced in the budget of 1986, DIRT was to be a retention rather than a withholding tax, that is, while the tax deducted could be set off against liability to tax there was to be no repayments, except to companies, and no exemptions, except in the case of certain inter-bank deposits and deposits in the name of non-residents.  In the following Finance Bill this rigid stance was relaxed and charities were exempt from the tax and provision was made for repayment to individuals permanently incapacitated from maintaining themselves and the elderly who would not otherwise have been liable for tax on the basis of their total income including the interest from which DIRT was deducted.  In announcing the relaxation the Minister indicated, on the Second Stage of the Finance Bill:</P>
      <P>The tax, as originally announced was to apply to the deposit interest of all resident depositors.  In granting exemptions to charitable bodies, incapacitated persons and individuals aged 65 and over I feel that the best possible balance has been reached in minimising the extent of genuine hardship while at the same time maximising the yield from the tax.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was published the Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Government have decided to exempt the over 65s and incapacitated persons as these are the categories most likely to be solely dependent on interest for income because of inability to engage in other income earning activities.</P>
      <P>Obviously, there will be a small number of individuals outside these categories who may be able to make a similar case.  Wherever the line is drawn, there is a risk of genuine cases being on the wrong side of it.  Persons with Hepatitis C awards may currently claim repayment of DIRT under the existing provision which I have outlined. In addition, they are totally and permanently incapacitated from maintaining themselves and qualify for exemption in respect of their investment income from the award under section 5 of the Finance Act, 1990.  The total DIRT deducted is refunded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Consideration has been given on a number of occasions since 1986 to increasing the extent of the exemptions from DIRT or extending the categories of persons entitled to refund.  However, it <Col N="1206" /> has not been possible to devise acceptable systems that would not be open to abuse and tax evasion without large scale costly policing.  Any extension of exemptions and refunds would, of course, bite severely into the yield from DIRT, which in 1997 came to £150 million.  It is for this reason that DIRT continues to be deductible from the savings accounts of children and an exemption at source was not granted to the incapacitated and the elderly.  If Senator Doyle's recommendation was accepted it could not, in equity, be confined to persons with Hepatitis C awards but would have to be extended on a more general basis to other hardship cases.  For these reasons Senator Doyle's recommendation is being opposed.</P>
    <P>Recommendation put and declared lost.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 131 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. V. Doyle Mr. V. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 131 provides for a budgetary measure increasing the rate of DIRT on special savings accounts from 15 per cent to 20 per cent.  We have already dealt with the pension provisions in section 16 of the Bill.  We accept that many people, particularly those with voluntary pension, will get a smaller pension than they expected.  These people can only provide an income from the savings which they made throughout their working lives.  These savings are often placed in special savings accounts.  When these accounts were introduced the rate of DIRT was 10 per cent while interest rates were approximately 12 per cent.  DIRT was later increased to 15 per cent and it is now proposed to raise it to 20 per cent.  Meanwhile interest rates have fallen below 5 per cent and are expected to fall even further when we join EMU.  Retired people who rely on income from special savings accounts to supplement their pensions now find that they are having to pay more tax on less revenue.  I hope the Minister can consider giving some relief to people in this age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know what the Senator is saying. An increase from 15 to 20 per cent in the rate of DIRT deductible paid on special savings account is provided for.  Special savings accounts were introduced for individuals in 1993 following the abolition of exchange controls to counteract the threat of capital outflows while preserving DIRT revenues as far as possible.  The interest on special savings accounts attracts a low rate of tax, which satisfies the investor's full tax liability in respect of the interest.  Their introduction was dictated by the failure to reach agreement at EU level on common rules governing the taxation of internationally mobile deposits.  The rate, which was originally set at 10 per cent, was increased in 1995 to 15 per cent.  As the Minister indicated in his budget statement, the Government is aiming for a 20 per cent standard rate of income tax and <Col N="1207" /> it therefore makes sense to move the rate of DIRT on special savings accounts to this rate now.  It also helps to correct the imbalance between the tax treatment of deposit interest and other income.  The new rate still provides a competitive after tax return to Irish depositors on their investments.</P>

      <P>The Senator's point is well made. This Schedule repeals a number of redundant stamp duty provisions, including section 12 of the Finance Bill, 1895.  Section 12 imposes stamp duty charges on certain Acts of the Oireachtas.  In practice, an Act of the Oireachtas which was liable to stamp duty under this section always contained an exemption from the charge.  Many of those exemptions are being repealed in this Schedule.  The Senator lists a number of exemptions from the charge imposed by section 12 which are not contained in the Schedule.  The Minister is aware of the existence of all these exemptions, but due to time constraints it did not prove possible to reach agreement with the various Government Departments involved so that all redundant sections could be repealed in this year's Finance Bill.  Those on which agreement was reached are listed in the Schedule.  I assure the Senator that the others can be repealed in next year's Finance Bill.  The Senator's point is well made and he is correct.</P>

    <Title>Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial, Parliamentary, Judicial and Court Offices (Amendment) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is in two main parts.  First, it fills gaps in the existing legislation about the entitlements of Members of the Oireachtas.  It affords us an opportunity to face up to the ever increasing work in both Houses and to afford recognition to work carried out by those dedicated members of both Houses who perform duties over and above their normal duties as parliamentarians without reward up to now.  This incentive to Members is very important if our plans, now being realised, for setting up a new committee system are to work to optimum effect.  The Bill also updates and clarifies the statutory basis for travel, secretarial and other facilities for Members and the parliamentary parties in so far as they provide services to Members in pursuit of their parliamentary duties.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill contains the necessary enabling powers to deal appropriately with the pension arrangements of judges and court officers in the wake of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Judge McMenamin and to deal with some anomalies in relation to pensions of Ministers and other officeholders.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of allowances for chairpersons of Oireachtas committees in 1994 on the recommendation of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector, there have been substantial changes in the role, functions and number of Oireachtas committees.  There is now a new range of committees whose scope extends to scrutiny of the performance of all Departments.  This change is part of the new reforms which are actually happening across the public service both under the SMI and otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is now a need to recognise the additional burdens being placed on committee members <Col N="1210" /> other than the chairpersons.  For this reason the Bill provides for the introduction of new allowances, not alone to the chairpersons but also to those other Members of committees and the Oireachtas who hold other positions of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, section 4 provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of allowances to the chairpersons and vice-chairpersons of, and whips to, Oireachtas committees. The Bill also provides for the payment of allowances to the chairpersons of sub-committees of Oireachtas committees.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the allocation of an annual amount to the chairpersons of Oireachtas committees. This allocation is intended to assist the committees to carry out their roles by the payment of allowances to the members of the committee in respect of rapporteur or other services which they may provide to the committee.  Only members of committees who do not receive an allowance under sections 3 or 4 may receive such an allowance.</P>
    <P>For similar reasons, that is the recognition of additional burdens, the question of allowances for the holders of certain recognised positions in the Dáil and Seanad also arises.  Accordingly, section 3 provides that the Government may, by order, provide for the payment of allowances to Members of the Oireachtas who hold certain positions carrying special responsibilities in the Dáil and Seanad.  It is proposed that the following positions in the Dáil would attract allowances: the Assistant Government Whip and party whips. The positions in the Seanad, in addition to the Leader of the House, are the Deputy Leader of the House, the Opposition Leaders of the Seanad, and the Government and Opposition Whips in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, the allowances currently payable to the chairpersons of various Oireachtas committees, and the Leader of the House in Seanad Éireann, are pensionable on a <i>pro-rata</i> basis under the Houses of the Oireachtas (Members) pension scheme.  This is an appropriate arrangement and I intend to continue it. Therefore, the various allowances payable under sections 3, 4 and 5 will be pensionable.  The pensionable nature of these allowances means that pension contributions must be deducted and section 10 provides for the making of regulations in that regard.  This will be done on the same basis as applies for the Chairperson's allowances at present.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for a number of technical amendments to clarify what has become present practice in relation to management of facilities for parties in Leinster House.  Specifically, it will abolish the requirement that a deduction be made from the party leaders' allowances when the leader is provided with a car at State expense.  It will also remove any ambiguity about payment of <Col N="1211" /> allowances to Independents and underpin present practice whereby secretarial facilities for qualifying parties are authorised by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Sections 12, 13 and 14 deal with pensions for Ministers, Ministers of State and parliamentary officeholders.  These sections are necessarily rather complex since they must deal with the variety of different situations which can arise. However, there are really only two key changes being made.</P>
    <P>The first of these changes is that pensions for these groups will in future be calculated on the basis of time served, within the normal maximum and minimum limits, whereas hitherto only completed years have reckoned.  This means that a person with four and a half years pensionable service will have a pension based on that service, whereas in the past the pension would be calculated on the basis of only four years.  I am happy to be able to propose this change because the ministerial and officeholders pensions are very unusual in being reckoned on the basis of completed years only.</P>
    <P>The other main issue dealt with in relation to the pensions of officeholders concerns the situation where a person could, out of a total of five years in qualifying offices, have two years of ministerial service and three years of service as Minister of State.  Because he or she did not have enough service to qualify for a ministerial service, such a person would have the same pension as someone who had five years service as a Minister of State and had never served as a Minister.  This seems to me to be anomalous and I am of the view that the service as Minister deserves additional recognition in pension terms.  This Bill would grant that recognition by calculating the relevant pension on the basis of the weighted average of the salaries of the various offices held by the person concerned.  Therefore, where a person has service as a Minister and Minister of State, the salary used for pension calculations will naturally be higher than that used where a person has Minister of State service only.</P>
    <P>In section 9, I am proposing a number of amendments to the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, to reflect current practice and to arrange for an alternative procedure for dealing with arrangements for payment of travelling allowances.  Other technical amendments to the regulating making powers governing Members' travelling expenses in section 18 will facilitate this.</P>
    <P>Some of the existing restrictions on payment of overnight allowances and travelling facilities for Members attending meetings in Leinster House are anomalous in this day and age.  Members will be pleased to hear that, in section 15, I am making provision to extend the number of occasions when an overnight allowance may be paid for accommodation costs arising from attendance at <Col N="1212" /> Leinster House.  Specifically, where Members wish to attend Leinster House for the purpose of using the facilities available in the House on non-sitting days, they will be entitled to claim an overnight allowance for accommodation expenses, subject to a limit of 25 such occasions per year. This will be of benefit to those Members who, heretofore, have been unable to avail of the facilities in Leinster House during recess periods because there was no legislative provision in place to allow for the reimbursement of their accommodation expenses in Dublin.  This measure will, l hope, encourage Members to make fuller use of the facilities available in the House, thus further assisting them in the performance of their parliamentary duties.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses have long argued for improvements in the level of secretarial support available under the existing provisions arguing that they incur substantial additional costs of secretarial help outside Leinster House out of their own pockets.  In response to this request, section 16 provides for an augmentation of the existing provisions for secretarial facilities by introducing a new allowance for this purpose of £5,000 per annum for Deputies and £3,750 per annum for Senators.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions in Part II of the Bill now before the House are of a minor technical nature and I do not propose to go into them in any great detail.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill is intended to achieve two objectives following on the Supreme Court decision in the McMenamin case, which related to the superannuation provisions of judges.  For serving judges and court officers and future appointees to these offices, the rate of retirement lump sum will be increased from one and one-half times pension to a rate which gives a lump sum of up to one and one-half times pay as is the position for most other groups of public servants. It also provides enabling powers to deal appropriately with claims from judges and court officers who retired before 19 December 1996, the date of the Supreme Court decision in the McMenamin case.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the proposals in this Bill are largely of an enabling nature.  They will give the Minister for Finance of the day power to determine the facilities to be made available for Members in pursuit of their parliamentary duties and to recognise the contribution being made by Members who are being given new positions of responsibility.  They also remove some anomalies in relation to certain pension entitlements of former Ministers and officeholders.  I am also availing of the opportunity presented by the Bill to enable the Oireachtas to deal appropriately with pension arrangements for judges and court officers in the wake of the McMenamin judgment.</P>
    <P>When the Bill is signed into law, it is my intention to bring forward, at an early date, proposals for the appropriate Government orders and regulations <Col N="1213" /> to give effect to the changes now being proposed.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming here with this Bill today.  We will be supporting its provisions.  As speakers in the other House stated when contributing to the debate on this Bill, there can be no argument against giving fair and legitimate allowances and expenses to anyone going about their public service duty in either of these Houses, and we should not even quibble about it. That should not even have to be said but apparently it does.  Any Member of this House or the Dáil who is working as one must work today is entitled to proper legitimate expenses plus a proper salary commensurate with the responsibility of the job.  The Bill in no way impacts on salaries &mdash; that is another day's work.  Neither does it negate the need to have a proper salary structure which recognises seniority, responsibility and the commitment which must be given to maintaining a seat in either the Seanad or Dáil today.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill.  I do not intend to deal with its individual provisions because my party will not be opposing them.  I welcome the Bill as a step in the right direction towards ensuring that we continue to attract the right type of people to a career in public representation.  One of my greatest concerns is that the calibre of person needed to continue the ethos of public service prevalent in the State since its foundation will not be attracted to join any of the political parties or stand as independent candidates.  Unless educated people &mdash; be they self-employed or PAYE workers &mdash; can leave good jobs in the private sector, enter the Houses of the Oireachtas to serve anything between one and ten terms and believe they are placing their houses and the future of their spouses and children at risk by opting for a period of public service in the main part of their lives, we will not attract the people we need.</P>
      <P>Taking account of the exigencies of the electoral system, it is estimated that approximately 40 per cent of Deputies lose their seats at elections. I am not sure what percentage of Senators lose their seats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>50 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, 40 per cent of Deputies and 50 per cent of Senators lose their seats at each election.  How will we convince people with education, experience and a contribution to make to leave their careers in the private sector and spend a number of years in either House to ensure the future of our democracy unless they are reasonably rewarded?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who criticise the salaries and expenses politicians receive are often in some of the best paid jobs in the State.  I am sure Members sing from one hymn sheet on this issue.  In the interests of those of us who are committed to a career in the public service and who could earn <Col N="1214" /> more money if we put the same time and energy into a private sector role, I will not apologise on behalf of myself or my party for asking to be reasonably paid and not left out of pocket in terms of expenses.</P>
    <P>I represent a rural constituency and I have a particular empathy with expenses being rurally based.  I also have an empathy with women who wish to serve in the national Parliament, be it the Dáil or Seanad, particularly those with small children, some of whom are present in the Chamber. Most men who opt for public service have someone to take care of the home, if not their wives, it may be their mothers or a partner of some description.  The majority of women who opt for public service, particularly those who are married with young children, are obliged to employ two or three people to carry out the work they would do if they remained at home and to supply the round the clock housekeeping and mothers' help service that is needed to replace a mother who comes to Dublin for two to four days per week while Parliament is in session.  We must attract more people from rural areas and more women to politics.  We cannot make it more difficult to serve in Seanad and Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill relating to judges and court officers and the tidying up measures to which the Minister referred.  I thank for him for proceeding as he has done.  He can rest assured that, in the interests of democracy and ensuring continued commitment from the best, the brightest and those with most to contribute, we will be supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the provisions of which are overdue to some extent.  I applaud the Minister on his involvement in trying to resolve the situation in which public representatives find themselves.  On entering public life, a number of Members walked away from attractive careers in other professions.  If I had remained in my profession, my basic pay would be £8,000 more per year than it is at present.  With regard to allowances, I have run a full-time constituency office from my home since 1989 at my own expense.  These things are not generally known by the public.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister who has addressed a problem which needed to be resolved.  This issue should have been tackled many years ago but it was not.  I am sure I speak for many Members of both Houses when I say that the Gleeson and Buckley reports did not address the profession of politics and did not take account of the commitment people make to political life.  That matter remains to be addressed.  A number of the younger members of my family earn £4,000 to £5,000 more per year than I do.  In that context, equal treatment has not been accorded to those in political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators have slipped down the salary league. At one point, before I entered the House, <Col N="1215" /> Senators salaries were set at 75 per cent of those of Deputies but that is no longer the case.  I am pleased the Minister attempted to address this problem on the basis of the allowance.  In the future, 75 per cent of the amount granted to Deputies in respect of office accommodation will be given to Senators.  I urge him to keep this in mind when dealing with the salaries of elected people.</P>
    <P>People make a voluntary decision to enter public life but that does not mean they should remain paupers.  Anyone involved in public life recognises that stresses and strains are placed not only on elected representatives but also on their families because of the irregular hours they are obliged to keep.  The Minister has addressed a matter which required resolution.  I hope he will not take his eye off the ball in respect of the salaries of public representatives because it is time consideration was given to that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as what I hope will be a phased attempt to improve the position, salaries, allowances and conditions of elected public representatives.  When teachers receive a pay increase or farmers obtain additional money, no one applauds.  Members of both Houses wonder why they are criticised but no one outside is happy when elected public representatives receive additional money.  It was wrong of the newspapers to state that the Government voted itself an increase.  It did not do so.  The Government merely implemented a conclusion that was reached through a proper process whereby claims were lodged, considered and reviewed.</P>
      <P>In 1992, I made representations on behalf of this House to the Gleeson review committee and the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, which were precisely in line with the issues dealt with in the Bill.  At that time, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges of the Seanad tried hard to encourage movement in this direction but that was not deemed possible.  I compliment the Minister for making that move today, which is a move in the right direction.</P>
      <P>Public representatives are grossly underpaid. There is a need for a top to bottom assessment of their pay and conditions which should begin with the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.  I do not believe the current review body on higher remuneration can do the job adequately.  I accept that it hears cases and comes up with responses and results but it is not appropriate to assess the work being done by Members of both Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process by which we gain increases in salary, as opposed to the provisions in the Bill, should be given careful consideration by the Minister.  Once established properly, wages and salaries paid to Members should be linked to national agreements.  We should not have to go cap in hand to anyone.  We should get the increases automatically like everyone else and at <Col N="1216" /> the same time as everyone else in synchronisation with the social partners.  That is the easiest way out of it and we should do that in future.  It would also allow for reviews which are provided for under the national agreements.</P>
    <P>The report of the review body makes specific reference to the relationship between a ministerial salary and a secretary-general's salary.  The way in which it is written is quite tongue in cheek. I talked to some of the departmental officials about it.  It lacks a logical conclusion when one looks at the range of secretaries-general's salaries and relates them to the Ministers.  A relationship needs to be maintained.  I do not agree with the proposal that the Taoiseach should be paid merely 25 per cent more than the Minister.  The Taoiseach should be paid 25 per cent more than the highest paid secretary-general.</P>
    <P>The salaries of Senators and Deputies should be closely connected &mdash; a Senator's salary should be 75 per cent that of a Deputy and a Deputy's salary should be linked to a principal officer in the Department of Finance.  If that link were established once and for all we would not have a row every year and a series of newspaper headlines &mdash; the first when we lodge a claim, the second when it is heard by the review body, the third when the body reports, the fourth when the Government makes a decision and the fifth when the money is paid.  People have the impression that we have had a five fold increase.  We handle our business badly and we should tie up these loose ends.  There should be openness and transparency and we should conduct our claims like any other group of professionals.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister who, like previous Ministers &mdash; Mr. Boland and Mr. Haughey &mdash; grasped this nettle, and with some style.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party supports this Bill.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that the present review mechanism for allowances and salaries is unsatisfactory.  It is time to put it on a proper footing so that we have a mechanism to reflect the work done.  Our claims should be dealt with properly to remove the impression that we receive excessive payments.  We should be tied into the national wage agreements so that we are not seen to vote money to ourselves, which is how our arrangements are presented by the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been generous in his consultations with all parties and that is why there is all-party agreement on the Bill.  I am glad the Minister has not forgotten the Seanad because we have been the poor relation in the past when it came to expenses.  Many Senators are full-time public representatives &mdash; I am among them. When the survey was carried out for the last review over 50 per cent of Senators were in this category; in the past there was a small number of full-time Senators.  Full-time Senators earn far less than they might earn if they remained in their original employment.  That is so in my case.  We <Col N="1217" /> should consider the nature of the job, the work done and the remuneration given.</P>
    <P>Our allowances and pay are totally accountable, subject as they are to scrutiny.  We are at present complying with the requirements of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  The media keeps the public well informed of issues regarding politicians' remuneration, although they are not often accurate in their presentation of the information.</P>
    <P>I am pleased there is provision for an extra secretarial allowance.  Senators have expenses for constituency secretarial and research work which is done outside the existing secretarial allowance and that work has been funded by the individual Senators to date.  The contribution now being provided will be most welcome.</P>
    <P>We discussed a national minimum wage last night and emphasis was put on the urgency of addressing the plight the low paid in occupations with no minimum wage.  I hope we can show the same urgency to ensure that those at the bottom end of the scale get a fair wage for their work. We have complained for many years that we have not been paid appropriately for the amount and quality of work we do as legislators.</P>
    <P>We should think in terms of a staff association for the Oireachtas so that we might have a representative structure to deal with pay and conditions. We spend time cribbing about such matters so we should have a representative structure to deal with them satisfactorily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their welcome for the Bill.  Ministers for Finance are not used to being praised by any group, whether colleagues in Government, the Opposition or any other group.  I am grateful for the Members' kind words.  I consulted widely on this issue.  Over the last ten years or so the scrutiny visited on politicians has been intense &mdash; some of it justified, but much of the comment has been ignorant and ill-informed.  This has created a mood that we are all on the make, so to speak, which has led to Members feeling that their task was becoming impossible.  I agree with Senator Avril Doyle that it will become increasingly difficult to get people to go forward for public office; certainly, they will not go forward for the money.</P>
      <P>Whatever one's profession, whether shopkeeper, farmer, factory worker or civil servant, one likes think that others would have respect for it.  In recent years politicians have come to be regarded as the dregs of humanity thanks to their portrayal to the public.  This has made many feel that the job is no longer worth it.  It is necessary for wrongdoing in public life to be sorted out and I do not object to scrutiny.  However, the hype associated with some events has led many people to believe that this profession is not as it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I discussed this issue over 12 months ago with a politician who retired by choice at the last election. He was not in my party but was a good <Col N="1218" /> friend and was respected in the Oireachtas.  We had similar views and agreed that we had seen the best days in the Oireachtas.  He said he would not like to be starting his political career again and he had been in the House for a long time.</P>
    <P>The reason I made that point was that when the Buckley Commission reported, that build up had occurred and the miserly and miserable increase offered to TDs and Senators sent everyone around the bend.  I have no difficulty with independent bodies carrying out reviews. However, because we were so thankful to the individual concerned, I availed of the opportunity not long after that at a banquet at which I was the guest speaker to thank him for the increase to TDs.  I am sure he applied the same rates of pay to his own organisation.</P>
    <P>As Senator O'Toole mentioned, we were blamed on at least five occasions for it.  As he said, and as Deputy Rabbitte said yesterday, when TDs and Senators got together on a subcommittee and made the submission which was inadvertently leaked to the newspapers, people perceived we had got that increase and we then got blamed for what we did not get.  When the report came out, it led to a considerable amount of angst among Deputies.</P>
    <P>I take on board what Senators said about a matter which was not addressed relating to salaries. The next independent review will start on 1 January 1999 and I will make some decisions in advance of that date.  There is merit in some of the ideas put forward here.  With the exception of the last review, for whatever reason, I was on the subcommittee of each review as far back as Devlin when I was on the subcommittee with Tom Fitzpatrick from Cavan and Paddy Lawlor and Barry Desmond.  The Devlin Commission was followed by Gleeson.</P>
    <P>Politicians have always resisted being linked to any grade in the Civil Service because they regard their job as unique.  That was our traditional thinking on the matter, but I accept what Senator O'Toole said.  Perhaps it is now time to move forward and link up with some grade.  I remember the principal objection to us being linked to any grade was that we regarded our job as unlike any other.  The scales mentioned here and which Senator O'Toole and Senator Costello said about being tied into the social partnership agreement has some merit and will be considered.</P>
    <P>As another Senator said, we are not trying to do anything underhand.  We are the most accountable organisation in the country.  Any Member may ask a question and if the media asks, we can tell them exactly what each Member receives and what the costs will be.  We are both accountable and transparent.  As I said earlier, I will sign into law orders and regulations in respect of this Bill when it is enacted.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

      <P>Section 17 relates to secretarial allowances, an innovation which is welcome.  The Minister will be aware that as part of that innovation we have recently been brought into the computer age.  However, a difficulty has arisen in that the Department of Finance has yet to sanction Internet access for Members in rural areas, which is an expense that is not justifiable.  I ask the Department of Finance to please accelerate Internet access which already operates in this House.  All Members and their secretaries have access to the Internet in their offices.  We now have access to computer technology in our homes.  I suggest the Department is dragging its feet in this area and it is talking about tendering out to the private sector so that we would have to pay for this service.  It is not fair that we should have to pay for such a service in this day and age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Miss Harney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the House but I am not pleased to be here to discuss this subject.  I had intended being present yesterday evening to discuss Senator Costello's motion on a minimum wage.  I apologise for my failure to attend but it was because of a Government meeting called for 6.30 p.m. I understand the National Minimum Wage Commission will report next week and, when it does, I will be delighted to return to the House to discuss the report after a period of time for its consideration has elapsed.</P>
      <P>The report last night on RTÉ's 6 o'clock news contained the most damning allegations ever made against an Irish clearing bank. The fact that National Irish Bank has confirmed the substance of the allegations made by RTÉ is shocking.  Most people will be amazed to hear that the bank took money from its customers, that it concealed that fact from them and that it failed to repay the money. People will be shocked to know that it happened eight or nine years ago.  It is worth reading into the record the statement made last night by National Irish Bank.  It began by saying that the incidents referred to go back many years and do not reflect current practices.  It states that they were practised:</P>
      <P>. in a small number of branches and in a limited number of accounts.  It occurred in the late 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
      <P>We accept that customers affected by the unauthorised practice were not advised of it and were not offered recompense at that time. The Bank regrets this.  NIB will seek to identify such accounts and undertakes to reimburse any customers so affected.</P>
      <P>Most people will be very cynical of a bank which became aware eight or nine years ago that money was being taken from its clients in some of its branches, which concealed this fact, which made no effort to repay the money in question and which issued a very limp apology only after these facts became public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks command enormous trust in this economy. When people place their money in a licensed bank they expect it to be safe.  It is important we have trust in the banking system. The allegations are seriously damaging for the banking industry, for industry generally and for the international reputation of Ireland.  It is fair to say that we have successfully marketed the <Col N="1221" /> International Financial Services Centre on the basis that Ireland is a very good place for a bank or financial institution to operate in.  It is a serious state of affairs when the trust between a bank and its customers breaks down.</P>
    <P>When we became aware in January of the allegations surrounding the management of National Irish Bank's insurance policies, we wrote to the bank, received a response and referred that response to the Attorney General for advice and subsequently to independent senior counsel.  That became available on 10 March and it advised a certain course of action.  I wish to outline to the House how we dealt with these issues.</P>
    <P>When the insurance matter became public, we were advised in the first instance that since the Department did not have the information in our possession, we had in the interests of natural justice to write to the bank and ask it for information. Following its response, the legal advice was that we could either write again to obtain further information or we could appoint an authorised officer under the Insurance Acts.  We chose the latter and he was appointed last Monday.  The delay in his appointment from 10 to 19 March is accounted for because I was in the United States and the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, who was handling this matter, does not yet have the power devolved to him to sign or to approve the signing of a warrant for the appointment of an authorised officer.  That officer went to the bank on Monday.</P>
    <P>Last night, when we became aware of the new allegations, which was the first time we became aware the bank was taking money from its customers, that it did not acknowledge the fact and that it made no attempt to repay the money in question, the Government had an emergency meeting, which is very unusual and is an unprecedented step.  However, we knew that what was evolving and emerging was serious not just for National Irish Bank and its customers but also potentially for the banking industry in Ireland and for the image of the country.  We sought legal advice about the best way forward.  We discussed the possibility of asking the Director of Consumer Affairs to carry out an investigation because he has responsibility for bank charges since 1996.  He is now carrying out that investigation and he met with a banking representative this morning.</P>
    <P>We also explored the possibility of petitioning the High Court under section 8 of the Companies Act to appoint an inspector to investigate what was happening in National Irish Bank.  The advice as regards the appointment of an inspector is significant. An inspector has been appointed on only two previous occasions and the appointment has never been sought without a preliminary inquiry first being carried out by an authorised officer. The advice was that we had to be sure we had documentation and facts in our possession which would justify to a court the appointment of an inspector under section 8 of the Companies Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> It was not until later last night, when National Irish Bank confirmed that the allegations were substantially correct, that we knew we had facts in our possession which had been confirmed and which may warrant the appointment of an inspector.</P>
    <P>Throughout the day officials of my Department have been meeting with the Attorney General and with independent senior counsel to prepare the case to apply to the High Court for the appointment of either a single inspector or a team.  It may well be and it is my preference that there should be more than one person because both a person with competency in accounting and one with competency in the law are needed.  We are preparing that case but I am not certain whether it will be ready this evening.  It could be tomorrow but I hope it will be no later than that. As I have been in the other House since 12.30 p.m., I have not had an opportunity to meet with the team since early this morning.  I hope to do that shortly after I leave here.</P>
    <P>In addition, I understand the Garda Fraud Squad has opened an office to receive complaints from members of the public with a view to carrying out a Garda investigation.  I believe that is appropriate.</P>
    <P>The nature of the inquiry, of which I hope the court will approve, must include who knew about these practices, who condoned them, who ignored them, who supervised them and at what level of the bank were they known.  Why was no effort made to identify the customers involved and repay the money?  I would like to know if any disciplinary action was taken against any bank officials on foot of these practices.  I would also like to know the role of the internal and external auditors.  These are issues which we can refer to the accounting profession because they must concern any professional body.</P>
    <P>We also want the court to examine whether the inspector can cover the insurance issue.  Suffice to say we want an inquiry which is as broad as possible, which gets at the truth and which in no way seeks to minimise what happened because this is very serious.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of inquiries under the Companies Act.  There were two section 8 inquiries, one cost £1.2 million and the other cost £220,000 but neither led to prosecutions.  There have been section 14 inquiries, such as the inquiry into Telecom Éireann, which cost £800,000, and again there were no prosecutions.  As far as I can influence matters, because the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has powers to initiate prosecutions in a limited number of cases, and if it is the case on foot of the inspector's report that alleged wrongdoing can be established against an individual or individuals, no matter who they are, it will be my intention to use the powers available to me in the Companies Acts.  It is also my intention to refer the report to any other authority.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1223" /> Under the Companies Acts the High Court can make a restitution order to ensure the customers of National Irish Bank who have been treated so badly are compensated.  I hope the court will consider doing that.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for this opportunity to make this statement.  I have not been very comprehensive, I may have left things out but I will be delighted to take questions about this matter as it so important.  This is my tenth inquiry into banks and other institutions in eight months, which is probably a record.  I have had to tread carefully because, when I sought to appoint an authorised officer to a different bank in January, that bank succeeded in getting an injunction to stop me and succeeded in delaying the case in the courts.  It was only when it saw the evidence and affidavits that it pulled back and agreed to co-operate with the inquiry.</P>
    <P>Since I initiated inquiries late last year, not a week has gone by but I received a letter from some of the leading lawyers in the State.  We must tread carefully, follow the procedures and take the best legal advice if we are to be successful and that is what we intend to do.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is carrying out its own inquiry.  It is an independent regulatory authority who monitors and licenses banks in this State.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners, another independent body, are carrying out their own inquiry in relation to tax evasion.</P>
    <P>My responsibilities are related to company law, National Irish Bank is a limited company and therefore the powers available to me will be fully used if the court approves the petition which we will make as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for coming in today at such short notice, both to make a statement and to take questions.  It is important that this matter which shocked us all last night is aired in these Houses today.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was very much to the point.  She raised a series of questions to which we all want answers.  She may find the easier part of her job is over.  Asking the questions is the easy part.  The difficult part, and the part on which she and the political system will be judged, is getting answers to the questions she raised here today.</P>
      <P>We need to be cautious at the beginning of an exercise like this.  One of the facts of life is that people do not like banks.  No matter how much money banks spend trying to promote their image, there is always a sense of their being a legitimate target.  It is important that we do not let prejudices get in the way in this debate but instead concentrate on establishing the facts.</P>
      <P>There are many decent people working in National Irish Bank, people who will feel themselves tarnished by the things the bank has done, things of which they were unaware and in which they had no part.  Confidence in the banking system is a key element in our economy and the way our society works.  Unwarranted attacks on the banking system which may prove to be wide of the mark will do no one any good.</P>
      <P>We face one of the most serious situations in banking history.  At stake is the credibility and integrity of one of our major banks.  Over-shadowing that are serious question marks about our entire banking system.  If this sort of thing is happening in one bank, how does the public know it is not happening in other banks?  That is a question which is to the fore in the minds of people today, many of whom will not have had the friendliest of relationships with the banks. Who will they believe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>NIB faces two very serious charges.  The most immediate is the charge made public yesterday. On that there has been effectively a plea of guilty, but this is not enough.  Even though there has been a mild expression of repentance and a promise of some unspecified restitution, that will not go far enough.  What is needed is a full, independent and effective inquiry into all the circumstances, with early publication of the findings and <Col N="1225" /> a determination that those who are culpable will pay.  We need to know whether we are dealing with the misdeeds of a small number of bank employees striving to maximise profits and meet targets set by the banks themselves.  Pressures of this kind may lead people to take shortcuts or to get involved in sharp practice.</P>
    <P>It is possible that what has happened was inherent in the culture of this bank or part of a wider banking culture which has grown up in this country.  This is a hungry bank.  It prides itself on being a player rather than a gentleman in the old sense in banking.  It set out to shake up the larger established banks.  Perhaps there was no harm in that.  It brought with it practices from its antecedent, the Midland Bank, practices which were found to be less than desirable in Britain.  It brought from its parent company an aggressive Australian approach.  We need to know if this has become part of the culture which brought us to the situation we are in today.</P>
    <P>We need to know how this happened.  That is the reassurance this House and the public want from the Minster.  We need to be assured that the Central Bank, so long a sleeping partner in this, will have a hands-on approach that there will be more reality in its approach as our chief regulatory body.  We also have to know that the taxpayer will not be lumbered with a major bill, that we, the innocent partners, do not pick up the tab for another expensive investigation.</P>
    <P>A second charge hanging over National Irish Bank is that it engaged in illegal offshore tax evasion schemes.  This has been denied.  However, given the credibility of NIB, this is an investigation which must be actively prosecuted.  I would like the Minister to outline what steps she and her Department have taken to establish the veracity or otherwise of the charges made by RTÉ.</P>
    <P>What has happened to NIB has damaged all Irish banks.  Banks can and do behave like bullies at times.  They abuse their position of strength. They now have a major credibility problem.  It is important that the public has some independent monitoring system with teeth which shows that banks can be investigated in the public interest and ensures that what is happening now will never happen again.  I thank the Minister for taking questions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for agreeing to extend the time for this debate to 5.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment her and the Government on the swift action taken on this matter.  The Cabinet met in emergency session yesterday and the Minister has had a hands on approach all day.  The fact that she is in the House this evening shows her concern to deal with this matter in the Upper House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with much of Senator Manning's comments. Last week I spoke about banks in this <Col N="1226" /> House and I was quite critical of bank charges and referral fees.  Little did I think that a far more serious situation lay beneath the surface.  This case involves larceny from its customers accounts by NIB.  This is a serious situation and it brings the credibility of the banking system into question. People may not like banks but they generally trust them for advice with their savings and when they take out loans.  They believe that their bank will give them the best deal.  The public will be very sceptical today when it discovers that one of the major banks was robbing funds from some of its customers.</P>
    <P>I know the staff of the NIB in Athlone and I have nothing but the height of praise for them. They are the finest of people.  However, what are we to make of a bank which, from the top down, allows this type of practice to occur?  I hope that the Minister pursues the questions of who made the decisions, who allowed this to take place, who knew about it and who ignored it?  Heads should roll over this matter because the credibility of the banking system has been put at stake.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank is the relevant licensing authority.  It must now consider whether NIB is entitled to have a licence.  Someone did a job on NIB's audits over the past ten to 15 years, both internally and externally.  How could these audits be ratified by a professional body, given the information that is now available?  Someone has to answer for the fact that money was stolen from customers.  I do not know if there has been a cover up, but it was a poor audit which prevented this information from surfacing.  Nothing like this would be missed in a local authority audit.</P>
    <P>Will National Irish Bank lose its licence if it is found to have abused it?  Has the Central Bank the power to remove or revoke its licence if it can say that &ldquo;Following an investigation we have proof that this bank acted improperly on a large scale&rdquo;?  The full weight of State authorities should come down on this bank &mdash; the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Central Bank and a hands on approach by Government.  An investigation of NIB alone will not be sufficient for credibility to be restored to the banking system.  More will have to be done in relation to the entire banking system if people's confidence is to be restored.  We also need to re-establish Irish banking's good name abroad.  Investigations and answers are needed.  Tough decisions will have to be taken in the case of wrongdoings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for her clear and rapid action.  However, the greatest compliments must go to the RTÉ journalists, without whom we would not have uncovered this appalling situation.  What appears to have happened is that amounts were inappropriately extracted from personal and business accounts. This was discovered and accepted by senior officials.  However, no explanation was given, customers were not informed, no apology was given <Col N="1227" /> and, apparently, the chief executive was prepared to stand over this practice.  In other words, the bank at the highest level was prepared to profit from fraudulent conversion.  That is an extraordinary comment on the ethics of banking.  I note, wryly, that when the Buckley review went through bankers presumed to tell this House that they were worth the same approximately as a secretary in a multinational, speaking from a position in which they had many multiples of this kind of money.</P>
      <P>Serious questions now arise with regard to other bank practices.  We are all solicited by banks to alter from the old fashioned way of paying bills and debts in favour of standing orders with variable clauses and direct debits which can be varied by the bank.  What security can the average citizen have that by handing over such power to a bank we are not taking a dangerous step if the bank is prepared to remove money from an account?  Look at the language used in NIB internal memorandum:</P>
      <P>It was noted that interest charges were increased without legitimate reason or customers' knowledge on 20 accounts in November 1989 and 33 accounts in February 1990. The above practice could lead to loss to the bank through customer dispute, litigation or adverse publicity.</P>
      <P>Remedial action required: Interest amendments may only be made to correct bank errors.  The practice of &lsquo;loading&rsquo; interest in this manner must be discontinued.</P>
      <P>Response by branch management: We note that as and from now only bank errors can be corrected using interest amendment sheets. While we only loaded interest rates for customers who were very demanding, we were certain that we were safe in applying additional interest charges.  No queries ever came back from customers whose interest was loaded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What kind of language is this?  What kind of attitude does it display?  NIB only added charges to customers who were very demanding.  What does this mean?  Does it mean people with overdrafts? What did they demand?  They demanded money. They did not do so with menaces or with firearms. It is about time that banks realise what they are &mdash; they are shops which sell money.  People buy money and banks are in the market to sell money. It is a customer's right to be demanding and not to be illicitly penalised for so doing.  It is time that the citizens of this country made this clear.  Most of the customers involved had overdrafts.  The most vulnerable sections of the community were penalised most and I gather the amounts are enormous.  This raises the question of ethics in the financial industry, and I hope the scrutiny will be extended to include, for example, insurance <Col N="1228" /> companies.  I have no doubt that the same bullyingattitudes and unscrupulous and unethical approaches to customers exist throughout all financial institutions and we should examine them as carefully as possible.</P>
    <P>Gone are the days when banks were customer friendly.  Cheques are no longer returned &mdash; it is a long time since they have been.  This is unhelpful in reconciling our accounts.  We are told it is our responsibility to make such checks as the banks will make mistakes and decisions against our interests as personal customers.  This is completely unacceptable.  I also notice that it is the consistent practice of banks to prevent customers from developing a personal relationship with their manager.  Accounts are moved every six months from one person to another.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on her speedy action but urge her to extend the scope of inquiries to encompass all financial institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for this, her second time to come before the House.  Previously she attended a debate on Seagate.  It is a measure of her respect for the House that she has agreed to come before it and of her concern for the gravity of this issue.</P>
      <P>Very serious allegations have been made against NIB which are a matter of major worry. However, more worrying is the fact that the substance of those allegations has been accepted by the bank.  It gives a new meaning to the phrase &ldquo;a blank cheque&rdquo;, as the bank seems to have written itself a blank cheque.  The charges made on RTÉ in last night's news bulletin are not just damaging to National Irish Bank: they are damaging for the entire Irish banking industry and for the image of Ireland as a place of stable and responsible banking.  The Tánaiste referred to trust and confidence, which are basic to the operation of banks in a democracy, where they play an important role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the allegations be thoroughly and comprehensively investigated and that all the machinery of State is mobilised to ensure the truth is uncovered.  I am glad the Government, and particularly the Minister has moved quickly and decisively on this matter.  At the request of the Government the Garda Fraud Squad has opened an office to deal with complaints from the public in relation to their dealings with NIB.  The Minister has also asked the Director of Consumer Affairs to ensure proper procedures are adhered to by the banking system and that customers are not being ripped off.  She has also requested RTÉ to provide her Department with the information they have in relation to these matters.  Most importantly, she is prepared to go to the High Court to seek the appointment of an inspector to go into NIB under section 8 of the Companies Act.  I do not see how anybody could complain about the speed and <Col N="1229" /> decisiveness with which the Government has responded to these revelations.</P>
    <P>I echo some of the points made regarding the regulatory and licensing functions of the Central Bank and the need to examine them.  Before the Finance Committee of the Houses the bank indicated that its role is very restricted.  We know that revenue issues are a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and that there are other issues which are not within the bank's competence. However, I echo the point made by Senator Finneran regarding the conditions of the licence and possible breaches of them.  I hope the Central Bank will not operate a culture of voluntary blindness, a term used in relation to other matters concerning the Department of Agriculture and Food.</P>
    <P>A special Government meeting was convened last night within an hour of the allegations being broadcast by RTÉ and within 24 hours we are well advanced in the appointment of an inspector. Such an appointment is essential.  A court appointed inspector will have the necessary legal powers to conduct a thorough investigation, publish findings and make recommendations regarding appropriate action.  It is vital that such an inquiry does not, like many others, run into the sand.  If the inspector finds evidence of wrongdoing, those responsible must be named and face the full rigours of the law.  If I or any Member were to rob a bank we know what would happen. However, what happens if a bank robs a customer? The same law should apply to each case.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the statement issued by National Australia Bank, the holding company of National Irish Bank.  It states that &ldquo;The issues which have been highlighted in the past 24 hours about our subsidiary, National Irish Bank, relate to matters which occurred many years ago and do not reflect the current operations of the bank&rdquo;.  I do not think this is an acceptable statement.  It seems to ask what the fuss is about in the context of an admission having been made and to suggest that the bank has nothing to apologise about.  The statement continues by outlining the huge assets &mdash; amounting to £100 billion &mdash; of NIB.  There is an inference here that we are meant to be awed by such a statement.  Finally, the press release says that &ldquo;All deposits in National Irish Bank are safe and no depositor need have any cause to be concerned&rdquo;. Nobody has suggested otherwise.  I note the press release was issued by a very prominent public relations company.  The statement contains no apology to the account holders whose trust was abused by NIB.  It should have contained a clear indication that action would be taken against the managerial personnel involved.</P>
    <P>The Government has recognised the seriousness of the situation and it would be a great pity if NIB did not do the same.  The other banks should move to allay fears among the wider community or their borrowers regarding their own operations.  <Col N="1230" /> We must have confidence in the banking system.  Trust is the essence of the system.  There are many fine bankers who conduct themselves properly, but a culture of greed should not be allowed pervade this or any other industry.</P>

      <P>I welcome the speed with which this problem has been attacked by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, but this is in marked contrast to a motion I tabled on budget day concerning an investigation of the banks.  The Department concerned strongly resisted the motion.  For a long time many of us have been concerned about the activities of banks in general.  They are a real problem as they constitute a large cartel with almost identical charges. They are very reluctant to undercut each other. If they do so they speak the same language. Banks are part of the culture of nod and wink which exists among large monopolies in other countries.</P>
      <P>There is a case to be made not only for sending an inspector into this bank, but to establish an open forum, be it a tribunal or public inquiry, to investigate the activities of banks.  There are too many consumer stories about being bullied and overcharged.  When <i>The Sunday Independent</i> runs stories about banks, the response from the public is devastating.  There is a greater response from people who are discontent over their treatment by banks than to any other issue in the public arena.  Everybody has a gripe against their bank as they feel it is an unequal relationship and that they are being exploited by a cartel against which they have very little redress.</P>
      <P>Banks have had to apologise over a number of issues, including advertising incorrect interest rates, omitting APRs and confusing charges and fees but they do not always apologise when they should.  I predict that this will not be the only case of this sort which comes to light in the near future.  I have no doubt that National Irish Bank is not the only bank which is overcharging its customers and failing to notify them.  I do not mean to be sensationalist but I am sure there are many more similar cases in other banks.  It is part of the culture of banks to treat their customers like cattle who do not know what is going on and who do not matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remedy applied in this case leaves us with serious cause for concern.  Senator Finneran raised the question of the role of the Central Bank.  I do not understand how banks are allowed to state, at the bottom of customers' statements, that surcharges are applied in the bank.  Customers cannot find out what their surcharges are without going to a great deal of trouble.  It should be compulsory for every customer of every bank to be told exactly what surcharges he or she is incurring.  Customers receive a quarterly statement of fees and charges but this does not include surcharges.  These are small surcharges of interest which add up to huge amounts to the bank, about <Col N="1231" /> which the customer can only find out with great difficulty.  This is a great lack, not alone in the body politic but, in the Central Bank itself.</P>
    <P>The detail of what happened in this case is very specific and is perhaps not known to the Minister but I shall be particularly interested to hear it. The fraud was perpetrated in individual branches against individual customers.  It is very sinister to realise that certain customers were selected and others omitted.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look at the whole banking system.  I do not wish to undermine confidence in the financial services or in the banking system as a whole but we must be seen to be transparent or confidence will be undermined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House and congratulate her and the Government on the speed with which they have dealt with this very serious matter.  I speak as a customer of National Irish Bank and an accountant who deals with bank statements every day.  Very serious allegations have been made against one of the four main clearing banks.  Last week we heard allegations concerning the financial services of the bank that they were defrauding the tax man; now we hear the allegation that they are defrauding their customers.</P>
      <P>This problem originated with the introduction of bank charges.  Prior to that banks survived on interest charges.  I have raised the issue of bank charges twice in the past month &mdash; on the day that Allied Irish Bank announced record profits and during the debate on the Central Bank Bill. I raised, particularly, the abnormal and extraordinary referral charges which are being levied on customers.  When these are queried, customers are told they are done by the computer.  I believe nobody has the capacity to check interest charges and there has been no investigation of the collossal level of interest charges on credit card accounts.  I know that credit card charges are a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs but bank customers often do not realise they are being overcharged because they do not have the capacity to calculate interest charges.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear that the Garda Fraud Squad is to investigate this matter.  If an individual steals money he is liable to end up in jail.  At some time in the future a bank robber may justifiably claim that he is merely trying to retrieve his money. Someone in National Irish Bank must be held accountable for this fraud.</P>
      <P>It is indicated that at least four branches are involved.  The activities of the internal auditors and their reports to their superiors must be queried. If they reported correctly, why was no action taken?  External auditors merely investigate the internal auditors' reports because it is impossible for an external auditor to check everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> I am convinced that all banks are involved. There is such a variety of bank charges and interest charges that there is room for this sort of activity.  I have always been dealt with very fairly by the officials of National Irish Bank.  Many fine people work there and I do not believe that officials at branch level are to blame.  Some years ago a branch of NIB was investigated in connection with a major fraud in the fishing industry.  I wonder how the present problem did not come to light at that stage.</P>
    <P>I congratulate RTÉ but I wonder if this is an example of investigative journalism or merely of disgruntled employees giving information.  Many questions remain to be answered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House and thank her for her promise to return for the debate on the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission.  The report will be available in the next few days so it will not be long before we welcome her again.</P>
      <P>I congratulate RTÉ not merely on a fine piece of investigative journalism but also for standing up to intimidation &mdash; and legal intimidation at that.  Pressure was put on RTÉ by the National Irish Bank to drop the investigation.  We are faced with a case of theft.  It is the lowest of the low to find a bank with its hand in the till, stealing from small investors.  This is GUBU land.  It is almost the worst scandal imaginable to have a bank robbery taking place from within.  We will have to look at our definition of bank robbery if these institutions abuse the confidence placed in them by the public.  We will certainly become a laughing stock abroad and this blow to our credibility will not help foreign investment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>This outright larceny has been admitted by the bank because it had no choice.  There has been a deliberate cover up and no attempt made to rectify the matter.  The money was kept and no redress was made.  The Government should seek to change the name of this bank.  The name &ldquo;National Irish Bank&rdquo; gives the impression of State bank status and thus that a State bank is responsible for this crime.  National Irish Bank is a subsidiary of the National Australian Bank and is largely the old Northern Bank.  To give it the incorrect status of a national bank must be questioned. Its attitude towards trade union recognition for its staff must also be questioned, as must the fact that it was one of the front runners for the purchase of the ICC and TSB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also examine the regulatory system. Should this bank retain its licence?  If a bank admits blatant corruption in its confidential dealings with its clients it should not be entitled to retain its licence and, if it does, severe strictures and conditions should apply.  What is the Central Bank's role?  Has it monitored this area carefully enough?  The Central Bank has instituted its own investigation, which is one of many inquiries <Col N="1233" /> which have now begun, but it may have been at fault in not being aware of what was happening given its regulatory function regarding banking activities.</P>
    <P>There are several inquiries into this matter being conducted by the National Australian Bank, the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister's authorised officer.  I am disappointed that the authorised officer has only begun to work in the last week while other inquiries have been afoot for some time.  The Minister is also to appoint an inspector, which is disappointing given that the bank has come out with its hands up and admitted wrongdoing.  Surely there was evidence enough to go to the High Court earlier without waiting for the present <i>fait accompli.</i> It must now be a matter of form to go to the High Court, because it cannot refuse the application to appoint an inspector when there is an admission from the bank.  Are the terms of reference of the investigator to extend beyond the present admission to the alleged CNMI offshore scam?  Will the Garda investigation extend to that area?</P>
    <P>Senators have mentioned regulation of the banking area.  We must ensure that the banking system is above reproach, but it will be a long time before small savers feel comfortable about putting their earnings into banks.  We must reassure people, and the best way to do that is to institute an inquiry and develop reliable regulatory mechanisms.</P>

      <P>Debates on tribunals, inquiries and payments to politicians have struck me as showing how hard it is to see where the perception of politics and finance in the State is going. I remember when the National Australian Bank bought the Northern Bank.  It was seen as a welcome development that would bring in competition. I also remember when Allied Irish Bank and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland had to be bailed out by the State.</P>
      <P>All financial institutions should be called in by the Government and the interests of the people should be put before them and the accountancy firms that work for them.  These institutions should give an undertaking to cover the cost to the State of setting up an inspectorate to put their houses in order.  They are very profitable organisations and are responsible for this problem with the financial credibility of the State.  I welcome the Minister's interest in dealing with this quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a need to look at the regulation of financial institutions because the public is not happy with them, and with good reason.  It <Col N="1234" /> is very easy to structure one's profits in a certain way with computerisation but protection must be in place.  I am concerned that the Director of Consumer Affairs may not have the necessary resources to carry out this investigation.  This is a vast area and profits are calculated daily.  Existing structures mean substantial attention must be paid to bringing in proper regulation, and I hope the inspection will be thorough.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well.  It is necessary to deal with this matter in the best interests of our banking and financial services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on her action.  This is an interesting case.  When the prisoners in Mountjoy Jail are surveyed, great play is made of the districts they come from &mdash; deprived areas in the inner city, etc.  I often say I know where the prisoners come from but I am not so sure where the criminals come from.  The criminals seem to hold very interesting positions and I hope some of those involved in the most appalling wrongdoing are prosecuted and brought before the courts.  We have a funny attitude towards white collar crime.  I visit Mountjoy jail frequently where I have never seen anyone, apart from one woman, imprisoned for white collar crime.  This debacle should allow us to look seriously at that.</P>
      <P>The Minister should suggest to everyone with a bank account that they look at their last statement, as I did.  The first item on mine was a direct debit of 19p.  I do not have any direct debits as I do not like them.  I went into the bank where they looked it up on their computer and said I was right.  I asked whether money had been taken from my account and they said they could not tell me because it is automated.  I asked them to find out and whether it would cost me money to do so, which is important to ask.  The next interesting charge was £4.80 for lodging £1,000 in notes.  I was pleased about this even though I have never lodged £1,000 in notes in my life.  That was also a mistake. I transferred £1,000 from my current account to my savings account where I am saving to pay for my £7,000 medical insurance by July. The £4.80 was then taken off.  There was then a 29p charge for cash withdrawals, even though I cannot use the hole-in-the-wall machines, as I explained to them before.  I do not even have a PIN number.  By this stage, the very nice girl who was dealing with me had taken me away from the counter to a side area.  I asked her would she mind getting a statement of my entire service charges for the past year so we could go through them all &mdash; privately, if necessary.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that I could find that many errors in those few lines detailing a miserable current account, it might be a good idea if everyone looked through their statements.  I know someone who saved £54 in the last quarter and who expects to save £28 this quarter.  It seems to be more widespread than we think.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be unpopular for defending banks.  However, I have dealt with Allied Irish Banks for about 40 years and I have never had any problems with them.  It is unfair to paint all banks into a corner because there were a couple of rogue bank managers in Carrick-on-Shannon, Carndonagh and other places.  I do not condemn the National Irish Bank either, because from what I heard in the past couple of days there are many decent managers there who have not indulged in this practice.</P>
      <P>This matter is being hyped by the media.  It is grossly unfair to condemn Allied Irish Banks, the Bank of Ireland, the Ulster Bank and others. Unfortunately, there is a great deal of pressure on bank managers in small branches around the country to produce good results.  They are inclined to do things they should not without the consent of headquarters.</P>
      <P>We should be realistic about this.  I have dealt with banks for a number of years and I have never come across this type of incident before.  I am not saying it did not happen in certain areas. However, the incidents are isolated.  We should not condemn the banking system as a whole because of what happened in a few branches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to address the point raised by Senator Bohan.  No one is condemning the entire banking system.  However, confidence in it has taken a battering, not only because of the revelations of the past 24 hours but because of a series of problems in recent months.  We have seen the saga of non-residential offshore accounts and the allegations about certain Ansbacher accounts.  There were also queries about the irregularities concerning the clerical and medical insurance offshore system operated by National Irish Bank.  They have now been caught with their fingers in the till literally pilfering from their customers' accounts, in limited areas and only in certain banks.  However, the entire banking system is taking a battering because of the lack of confidence projected because of allegation heaped on allegation in recent months.</P>
      <P>This is a serious matter because the security of our banking system is a major tenet of any democracy.  When I first heard the latest revelations yesterday, I thought it smacked of a banana republic.  One wonders what on earth is going on.  As we sit at the top table in Europe with the 11 countries who will be part of EMU next January, I wonder about the international reputation of Irish financial services and the security of the smallest customer's account in the smallest rural branch of any of the four clearing banks.  Many questions need to be answered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know there is no major problem with the security of our banking system.  However, the confidence of the individual who has a small account will be battered.  It is not so long ago that money was kept in shoe boxes under the bed.  It took a great deal of persuasion, particularly of <Col N="1236" /> the elderly, for people not to keep money in their house and to trust the banking system because of the personal security risks.  As Senator Manning said, we must be balanced and responsible in our approach to this.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House as I am sure she had a busy day and there is a heap of work on her desk to which she must attend.  Does she have any evidence of similar practices in other banks?  Will her inspector or inspectorate &mdash; whichever it will be under the relevant section of the Companies Act &mdash; have the power to look at banks other than the National Irish Bank to see how widespread this practice of arbitrary increasing of interest rates on customer accounts is?</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, I have reason to believe this practice is more widespread than in the National Irish Bank.  I do not wish to give personal examples.  I wish I could say to Senator Bohan and those who believe we are being too hard on the banks that I agree with them.  I do not.  I have general confidence in our banking system.  We should not overdramatise.  However, we should not minimise the importance of the problem we are facing.  For a long time many people felt there was an abuse of power in their relationship with banks.  This is a breach of trust between the small customer who does not have an accountant to check the books and the bank manager.</P>
    <P>What are the implications for the credibility of our banking system because of these latest revelations? They are compounded by other unsavoury revelations in recent months about practices in our financial institutions.  Will there be repercussions for our reputation internationally, particularly with the approach of EMU?  What about the response of the EMI as our Central Bank negotiate the move to a single currency?  Will the Minister ensure the National Irish Bank will pay for any charges incurred in the investigation?</P>

      <P>It is important that this discussion is balanced and we do not indulge any prejudices. We should be restrained and I am happy to await the outcome of the investigation which the Minister has initiated.  This will allow us to debate the facts.  I have no doubt that if people are culpable they will be brought to account for any wrongdoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to investigate the issue of dormant accounts.  Many elderly people die without having close relatives and there is a suspicion that large sums of money have been retained by the banks simply because the next of kin or other beneficiaries were never identified. It would be a major scandal if no effort was made by the banks to contact them.  There should be an onus on the banks to disclose that information to some public body.  In the event of efforts having been made to contact next of kin or other beneficiaries, <Col N="1237" /> that money should certainly not remain with the banks.</P>

She is to be commended for the speed of her response and that of her Government colleagues.  However, I hope her speed will be matched by effectiveness in terms of what she plans to do.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers referred to the need for balanced debate but it is time to call a spade a spade. I switched on the news at 6 o'clock yesterday and heard that a bank had admitted to theft, but had only done so when evidence was presented by journalists.  When caught with its hand in the cookie jar, the bank's arrogant attitude was breathtaking.  Not only has the bank shown a disregard for its customers but it has also shown a disregard for the law of the land.</P>
      <P>A number of years ago a senior official in one of our major clearing banks discovered this was happening, yet did nothing about it.  The internal audit reports of the National Irish Bank discovered that certain branches around the country were engaging in a deliberately structured and well thought out policy of taking money from customers' accounts.  When senior officials of the bank were presented with this evidence they did nothing about it.  There also appears to be certain evidence that the bank engaged in a cover up. Now that this has emerged, the bank has not even apologised.  It said it would give the money back, but that is not good enough.  As far as I know, not a single head has rolled within the bank.  In fact, there is evidence that some people were actually promoted because of the fine performance of the branches involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This disregard for the law of the land is absolutely breathtaking, as is the arrogance displayed by the bank.  As Senator Henry said, people have been jailed for failing to pay a TV licence, yet we now know that a bank has engaged in deliberate <Col N="1238" /> law breaking.  That amounts to corruption, but we do not know how widespread it is.  We would like to think that only the evidence which has emerged so far is the extent of the fraud, but we have no way of knowing if that is the case.  There is much public fear and concern that this may be only the tip of the iceberg.</P>
    <P>I have had similar experiences to Senator Henry in dealing with bank charges but I always put them down to inefficiency or ineffectiveness. Now, however, I am beginning to wonder if sleight-of-hand was involved.  I am sure every bank customer in the country, particularly those in the National Irish Bank, are wondering the same.  Public concern must be met soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the appointment of a High Court inspector but at this point we have no way of knowing if she will be successful in her attempt to have such an inspector appointed.  As the Minister pointed out, however, inspectors appointed in the past have produced reports but no prosecutions have taken place.  If the Minister does not succeed in getting an inspector appointed, what does she plan to do?  There must be an independent inquiry.  What exactly is the role of the Central Bank in relation to acting as a consumer watchdog?  Who is protecting the interests of the ordinary customers and consumers?</P>
    <P>I heard the Director of Consumer Affairs speaking about this matter but it seems he does not have extensive powers in this regard.  I always thought the Central Bank was the regulatory body, but did it receive the internal audit reports? If so, the Central Bank certainly did not act upon them.  That, in itself, raises a serious question, particularly considering the bank's former inaction on Ansbacher.</P>

      <Col N="1239" /> In 1985, when this House discussed a report on small businesses, one Senator referred to banks as legalised robbers.  He pointed out much of what we are investigating today.  Public representatives have raised many points over the years that were not acted upon by Ministers, yet when the media digs these facts up years later, we are all on our feet.  This could have been prevented. It was not for the lack of Members of this House making the facts known at the time.</P>

      <P>Certainly.  I thank Senators for their comments and for the constructive manner in which everyone has approached the debate.  I compliment Senator Farrell, in particular, for being of the view that I am not fading away.  I have spent 20 years trying to fade away without any great success.</P>
      <P>When the allegations in relation to the management of NIB's insurance operation came to public attention we wrote to National Irish Bank in the first instance, which we were obliged to do by our lawyers in the interests of natural justice, and asked a number of questions.  NIB responded a few days later.  After that response we sought advice from the Attorney General, who in turn sought advice from an independent senior counsel. That advice became available on 10 March. It was to the effect that we could seek further information from National Irish Bank, that there was not enough information to recommend a particular course of action and certainly not to recommend an authorised officer or an inspector under the Companies Act.  Two courses of action were open to us.  The first is to write to the bank again to seek further information.  However, if we did and further information was forthcoming, one cannot self-incriminate and any information which might come through that vehicle could not be subsequently used in any prosecution against National Irish Bank.  Therefore, we decided not to take that route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other advice was to appoint an authorised officer under the Insurance Acts and that is what we did last Monday.  The delay between 10 March and last Monday was because I was in the US and Minister Treacy, who was handling this matter, <Col N="1240" /> has not yet had the power to sign warrants devolved in relation to the Insurance Acts.</P>
    <P>There is an uncertainty in relation to the legal advice.  It is not certain whether the promoters of these products or the people who availed of the products promoted are guilty of an offence.  Legal opinion is divided on that matter.  That being the case and section 8 of the Companies Act being a provision of last resort, a strong view was put forward that unless we had information, as the Act states, suggesting that there are circumstances in being that a company was either defrauding its creditors or the creditors of another person or acting unlawfully or involved in fraud, then one could not successfully apply to the court to have an inspector appointed.  That is why it has taken until National Irish Bank confirmed the substance of the RTÉ allegations of last night before we could move along that route.  The lawyers are currently preparing the case and we hope to go to the court in a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>With regard to another question which was raised, it is our intention to apply for the costs to be reimbursed.  I do not believe the taxpayers should have to foot the bill for these investigations as they had to do on so many other occasions.</P>

      <P>We may or may not be successful. I want to answer Senators' points rather than have them raised again.  The report will not be my report.  When the inspectors make a report they make it to the court.  By virtue of being a court report, it will be a public document in any event. Thereafter, it is for the court to make certain recommendations on foot of that report.  Once the inspectorate or inspector is appointed, the Minister has no further involvement.</P>
      <P>If, as Senator O'Meara said, we fail to get an inspector appointed, I must admit I do not know what we will do.  In terms of the existing law, I do not believe there is anything we can do under the Companies Acts because that is the strongest position.  We probably could have a section 19 authorised officer appointed but that would be a private report.  I am working on the assumption and the strong legal advice that, given the admission by National Irish Bank, our petition will be successful.</P>

      <P>Hopefully, there are none. Ireland's international reputation is impeccable in this area.  It has taken a long number of years to build that good reputation and, as I said earlier, the International Financial Services Centre is very successful for that among other reasons, one of which is tax reasons.  I have confidence in our banking system.</P>
      <P>I hope this is an isolated case and it is right that we take it in perspective.  We have no evidence that this has happened in any other bank.  Until we have such evidence, we could not extend the scope of the inspectorate to any other institution. One must have circumstances which suggest, as I said, that there was fraud, wrongdoing or unlawful acts.  If those circumstances do not exist, one cannot act on a hunch.  I know we all have strong views about our bank from time to time &mdash; I was taken with Senator Henry's inquiries, and I might engage in some of them also.</P>
      <P>It is important that we have confidence in our banking institution.  It is the foundation on which our economy is built.  Economies in which financial institutions do not command public and international confidence are not very successful.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Manning and others who signalled out the staff at National Irish Banks.  I have no doubt the vast majority of the staff who work for National Irish Bank are as embarrassed and ashamed of what happened as the rest of the public.  It is important to bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>As much doubt has been raised in the contributions here, is the Minister satisfied with consumer protection for customers of financial institutions like banks?  Clearly, banks take an attitude towards their customers which is unlike any that exists for other services in the commercial market.</P>
      <P>Is she satisfied that there is a true open competitive market in banking in Ireland?  What of the attitude of the banks in the sense that, as Senator Ross stated, they form a cartel rigging charges?  Often there is criticism that interest rates are far too high and much of it has nothing to do with the directions of the Central Bank but with what is fixed by the banks acting in consort with each other.  In that way a true competitive market does not exist in what is a free market.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend to ask the Central Bank authorities if they have received any of the reports referred to in media reports about this particular incident?  If they received any of those auditors' reports, why did they not act?  If not, is there a need to look at whether they or somebody else &mdash; for instance, the Director of Consumer Affairs &mdash; should be getting those reports?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Connor, the new powers which the Director of Consumer <Col N="1242" /> Affairs received in the Consumer Credit Act, 1996, are quite extensive.  We are currently examining the law to see whether or not the Director can carry out Inquiries retrospectively beyond the time he received those powers.  Section 4 of that Act gives the Director wide powers to carry out an investigation into anything of public interest. However, a different section of the Act states that the Director's powers relate only to bank charges. There seems to be a conflict and we are trying to resolve that to see can the Director look into the loading of interest, etc.  .</P>
      <P>My predecessor amended substantially the Competition Act to establish a directorate of competition and to give that person enforcement powers.  Indeed, on some occasions Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas have complained to me that that enforcement power is being used too aggressively.  I do not know if they have ever looked at the banks, but they certainly have enormous independent powers to ensure there is competition in the domestic market in banking and all other areas of activity.  Perhaps there is a case for the enforcement authority, which is the Competition Authority, and the person who has responsibility for enforcing the law to take action in this regard, but that is an independent function of the authority.</P>
      <P>It is the case that the Central Bank would be made aware of any internal audits.  However, the Central Bank is completely independent in the way in which it carries out its functions.  It is precluded by virtue of that independence from bringing any information which comes into its possession to any other authority except breaches of exchange control regulations, which it brings to the attention of the Minister for Finance.  I understand that in relation to its monitoring, regulatory and licensing roles it must not be interfered with and cannot bring to the attention of the Government, the Minister for Finance or any other Minister any information it receives in that capacity. That was confirmed to me last night when I spoke to the Governor of the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance stated in the other House this afternoon, when the Director of Consumer Affairs concludes his inquiry into bank charges in general it may be necessary to amend the current monitoring régime.  If that is the case, we should be prepared to do that because it is important that we have an effective regime.  I do not believe ordinary citizens are able to enforce the law against a major institution and they require the State to enforce it on their behalf.  If internal audits had drawn the attention of the Central Bank to these matters a number of years ago, I believe the onus would have been on the Central Bank to ensure that the customers were told and the money was paid back.  If its powers are lacking in that regard, we need to examine that.</P>

      <P>The inspectorate cannot apply to all banks unless the Minister making the petition knows of circumstances which suggest that this was happening in other banks.  A hunch, telephone calls or reports from journalists are not enough.  I must have in my possession sufficient information to convince the court that there was fraudulent activity or circumstances suggesting fraudulent activity or unlawful acts.  As I do not have such information, the investigation must be restricted to National Irish Bank.  I hope the petition will be successful and that the inspectors can proceed with their work as soon as possible.  We will then be able to reassure the public and re-establish confidence in our financial institutions.</P>
      <P>The NIB is one of four clearing banks.  These allegations are unprecedented and are being taken seriously.  Things will be all the better for this inquiry.  During the deliberations of the beef tribunal, some people took the view that it was damaging to the beef industry to have an inquiry into alleged wrongdoing.  People also take that view in respect of the banking institutions but I take the opposite view.  Those sectors and industries and the country will be damaged further if the Government and the authorities are not seen to act to ensure that the law is properly and fairly enforced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter arises from the disruption that occurred during an industrial dispute <Col N="1244" /> at Dublin Airport three weeks ago.  The events surrounding this dispute were regrettable.  I do not intend to deal with the whys and wherefors of this issue, but I hope there will be a satisfactory resolution of the problem.  I was affected by the dispute because I flew out of the airport on the Saturday morning on a Ryanair flight but I could not return that evening.  I was obliged to stay overnight and I returned by boat on the following day.</P>
      <P>Ryanair is a successful airline.  If it had not arrived on the scene people would be obliged to pay more to fly.  Ryanair upped the ante and began to compete with the national airline which had previously followed a policy of fly with us or row your own boat.  However, some of Ryanair's actions do not go hand in hand with its being a customer friendly organisation.  I hope the Minister of State will relate my comments to the relevant authorities.  Not everyone affected by the disruptions at the airport three weeks ago wants to take legal action.  I have no wish to be unrealistic or to go over the top, but some people were upset because they were not dealt with fairly.</P>
      <P>On the Saturday in question a Ryanair official distributed a document to passengers &mdash; it was probably intended for staff &mdash; which I will now read into the record:</P>
      <P Just="Center">POLICY &mdash; (Thorough Knowledge of) Delays/Disruptions Outside the Direct Control of Ryanair</P>
      <P>e.g. Weather, Airport Closure, Air Traffic Control, Industrial Action reactionary as a consequence of any of the above</P>
      <P>1.  Delays/Disruptions Outbound</P>
      <P>Ryanair will provide assistance in terms of Information only.  (We will however, continue to do everything within our ability to operate the intended flights to schedule).</P>
      <P>Passengers will NOT be given Meal Vouchers, Accommodation or Transport.  (It should be emphasised that we take full responsibility for delays of our own making.  However, as this delay, diversion, cancellation was due to factors outside our control, we are not in a position to accept liability).</P>
      <P>It is clear that the company is basically saying that customers are on their own &mdash; they may have Ryanair tickets but the company does not care about them.  Nothing stretches the imagination more than to believe that Ryanair had nothing to do with what was happening at the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incumbent on the Minister of State &mdash; I am not being critical of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or anyone else involved in this matter &mdash; in the interests of common sense, courtesy, etc., to inform the body charged with investigating this matter that Ryanair has a duty to its customers.  I know people who were staying in another European capital who <Col N="1245" /> could not return on an Aer Lingus flight on the Saturday night but they were put up in a hotel. However, Ryanair informed its customers that they were on their own, that the company had no responsibility, that they should find their own way home and that something might happen the following day.  That is not acceptable and Ryanair, among others, has much to answer for.</P>
    <P>Ryanair might be a successful and profitable company but it has a duty to its customers.  I do not know how many people were affected by the dispute but I am sure the number is quantifiable. Ryanair, a company which has made millions of pounds, cannot simply wash its hands of this matter. I hope the Minister will pass on my comments so that they are taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for sharing time.  Ryanair represents the sad story of a great little airline pioneering against the monopoly of the national airline, being successful, breaking the monopoly and becoming an arrogant private company in its own right.  Senator Cosgrave's experience is proof that this company has become too big for its boots.  It is not the only story of this sort that I have heard about Ryanair.</P>
      <P>When it was established, Ryanair was welcomed and was seen as a company that championed the consumer and took on a semi-State body which was overcharging, overstaffed and non-commercial.  It was seen as one of the bright lights of Irish industry and entrepreneurship. Where has it gone wrong?  As Senator Cosgrave indicated, it has gone wrong in its treatment of its customers and its workers.</P>
      <P>I have come across many examples of the airline treating its customers in a cavalier fashion. It issued pamphlets which were, to say the least, misleading and it had hidden charges which it was forced to reveal.  A £2 charge for credit card bookings was an example &mdash; people arrived at the airport to find they had to pay this extra charge because they had booked by credit card.  To give Ryanair its due, it adjusted this as a result of complaints. However, it did not advertise the charge and did not let it customers know about it in advance.</P>
      <P>Ryanair falls down in two areas.  First in its treatment of its customers and second in its treatment of its workforce.  The recent incidents at Dublin Airport show an arrogance on the part of the employers that make even champions of the free market blush.  The decision to treat 39 employees in an uncivilised and unacceptable manner given the present economic and employment climate, is deeply regrettable.  Ryanair did not need to take such a macho &ldquo;supercapitalist&rdquo; stance in not recognising the union.  All it had to do was to allow 39 people to be represented by a SIPTU official.  However, to make such an issue of the matter was to flaunt its superior and bullying attitude to its American investors and the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1246" /> This approach was regrettable because an unnecessary confrontation has taken place for which the fault lies with Ryanair.  It is a great pity that a good company which has been so successful is doing so much damage to itself, its image and to the spirit of free enterprise by the sort of incident Senator Cosgrave has outlined and by its general attitude to its customers and staff.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Cosgrave and Ross for raising this issue.  This debate is about the financial and other consequences for the travelling public that resulted from the recent closure of Dublin Airport.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment wishes me to say that she has the greatest sympathy for people who were inconvenienced and may have suffered loss as a result of the escalation of the dispute at Dublin Airport earlier this month.</P>
      <P>It was to my mind a needless, wasteful and destructive event.  All involved should by now have reflected on the defective judgment exercised in bringing matters to such a ridiculous pass. The Government cannot control completely how people behave towards each other in their roles as employers, employees or trade union sympathisers. It should be evident that the senseless results of the action that closed Dublin Airport on 7 and 8 March is a condemnation of the role they played in the events.  Parties to the dispute should reflect on that before they utter further threats or ultimata.</P>
      <P>Senators will appreciate that beyond this the Minister is constrained in commenting on the particular or individual actions or impacts of the dispute. The inquiry team is looking into such matters and will report as soon as possible.  The complexity of the situation that pertained is not assisting the speed of the inquiry.  However, everyone will join in asking that all in a position to do so should give every assistance in expediting the inquiry.  I will be as interested to see the inquiry's conclusions with respect to the conduct of disputes as I am to hear the Senator's constructive views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to those seeking to travel who suffered as a result of the disruption, I am constrained from making specific comments as I understand that they may have recourse to redress through the courts.  However, I can refer Senators to the annual reports of the Director of Consumer Affairs for 1995 and 1996.  He examined the general conditions of carriage under which consumers travel when they buy an airline ticket.  He examined a number of these conditions, which are by and large the same or similar for other airlines.  He acknowledged that due to circumstances beyond the airline's control there will be occasions when airlines may have to delay or cancel flights.  Consequently, he has no difficulty with the terms which provide for this <Col N="1247" /> situation.  Senators who wish to discuss issues to do with how airlines deal with their passengers during such a dispute should be aware that it is not a matter for the Minister.  Although she has no mandate in this regard, she will be happy to bring the comments and ideas expressed to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise, especially with regard to the treatment of customers and workers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to reopen the investigation into the crash of the Aer Lingus Viscount in the vicinity of the Tuskar Rock on 24 March 1968, particularly in the light of new evidence that has become available.  On that Sunday morning the St. Phelim on flight EI 712 left Cork headed for London.  The pilot was Barney O'Beirne, who spent his early years in New Ross.  One of the passengers on the plane was a Mr. D.P. Walls who had managed Albatros Fertilisers, a main industry in New Ross.  They were just two of the 61 passengers and crew who lost their lives.</P>
      <P>The crash was investigated at the time and the report of the investigation was inconclusive.  The last message from the airplane, which had been flying at 17,000 feet, indicated that it was spinning and falling rapidly at 12,000 feet.  Officially, the cause of the disaster is unknown and various questions have arisen over the intervening 30 years as to whether it was due to malfunction, another aircraft or an event which caused the airplane to take diversionary action.  There is a suggestion that there may have been an inherent failure in the Viscount and that the tailplane may have become dislodged when it took rapid diversionary action.</P>
      <P>There is also a question as to whether the airplane was shot down by a missile?  Suspicion as to this latter cause has fallen on the Aberporth missile firing station in Dyfed in Wales.  The target range used unmanned drone target aircraft at which to target missiles.  The British Ministry of Defence has always claimed that Aberporth was closed on the day in question.</P>
      <P>There is a body of opinion which says that after a lapse of 30 years there is no need to reopen the investigation.  However, that displays a disregard for those who were bereaved and who have sought consistently to find out the cause of the crash.  It also displays a disregard for air traffic safety because by not identifying the cause we may not take steps to prevent a repetition of the incident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Compelling new evidence has been brought to light through good investigative journalism.  Compliments were paid earlier to the journalism which has brought the National Irish Bank saga to public attention and this case is another <Col N="1248" /> example of good investigative journalism.  It deserves to be complimented and it contrasts with other more cynical efforts.  Mr. John Gilbert, a former chief petty officer on the British Navy frigate <i>Penelope</i> has said recovered wreckage was brought to Britain.  He has publicly affirmed that this took place.  That was not previously admitted and was not, I understand, available to the original investigator.</P>
    <P>It was also highlighted that the British Navy patrolled the area of the crash for the first 48 hours.  Not only did it control the area, but it also turned away other salvage and search vessels approaching the area.  Any wreckage which was subsequently found was discovered in the area from which the vessels had been turned away initially.  There was a report of wreckage being recovered near Bannow, which now appears may have come from a drone target aircraft, given the shape and colour of the pieces recovered.  There are further reports, which would not have been available at the time, of Territorial Army activity at Aberporth on that day, including either an artillery or gunnery unit, and that they left very hurriedly.</P>
    <P>Two years ago it emerged that there had been technical problems at Aberporth which had not been highlighted before.  The technical problems were of a nature which at least provides circumstantial evidence as to a possible cause, which was that missiles were failing to lock on to their targets. That would a recipe for hitting other targets which they did not intend to hit.  Today, I was told by somebody who had a relative working at Baldonnel that he consistently stated during his lifetime that the wreckage which came to Baldonnel seemed to indicate the plane had been shot down and that was likely to be the main cause of the accident.  The log books of two British Navy vessels in the area of the crash at the time and attached to Aberporth are missing and have never been produced.  The same applies to log books from Aberporth itself.</P>
    <P>When we combine the new evidence with the failure to provide information, it raises a compelling case for a further investigation 30 years later to try once and for all to find the root cause so as to put the matter to rest.  These compelling reasons to reopen the case should also include a search for the truth.  If politics or Government is about anything, it is about the search for the truth.  There have been allegations in the past, unfounded or otherwise, that some collusion may have taken place, certainly on the British side and maybe even in conjunction with the Irish Government, in the failure to identify a cause.  Another compelling reason is the public interest.  The truth and the public interest are at stake, not to mention the Government's duty to care for its citizens. I hope the matters which have come to light recently on the 30th anniversary of the crash will be considered by the Minister with a view to a <Col N="1249" /> preliminary investigation to establish whether a fuller inquiry is merited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Walsh for raising this matter.  I am sure he is aware of the thorough investigation carried out by the then Department of Transport and Power into this tragic accident, the report of which was published in 1970.</P>
      <P>I will begin by quoting the final conclusion of the report: &ldquo;There is not enough evidence available on which to reach a conclusion of reasonable probability as to the initial cause of this accident&rdquo;. I will now turn to the Senator's question. If by new evidence he is referring to recent television and newspaper articles regarding the possible involvement of another aircraft, missile or airborne object, then I advise him that essentially none of this is new.</P>
      <P>I specifically refer the Senator to the section of the report where such a possibility is discussed. The report states:</P>
      <P>. that while Viscount EI-AOM was in normal cruising flight at 17,000&rsquo; and within 6 minutes of reaching Strumble Head, another aircraft, which could have been a manned or unmanned aeroplane or a missile, passed in close proximity, possibly even colliding with the tail of the Viscount, causing an upset which led to a manoeuvre which was either a spin or a spiral dive from which the Viscount was recovered in a disabled condition, to fly thereafter for approximately 10 minutes over the sea before control was finally lost.</P>
      <P>The other aircraft could have been the one seen over Fethard-on-Sea, and might have fallen in the sea near the Saltee Islands.</P>
      <P>In considering this very speculative theory, attention must be given to a number of matters which discount its credibility.</P>
      <P>These include the fact that no aircraft, civil or military, manned or unmanned, were reported, or known to have been in the area at the relevant times, nor was any aircraft other than EI-AOM reported missing on that day.</P>
      <P>The missile and target ranges on the Welsh coast are closed on Sundays, and were known to be inoperative on Sunday 24 March 1968.</P>
      <P>No aircraft carriers were operating in the area.</P>
      <P>The altitude of 17,000&rsquo; at which EI-AOM was cruising is considered unlikely to be used by military aircraft.</P>
      <P>The manoeuvre of recovering a loaded Viscount aeroplane from a spin or a spiral dive would require a very remarkable feat of airmanship on the part of the pilots.  In fact there is only one known cases in which this was effectively accomplished during a test flight by expert test pilots.  Even in that case, the airframe suffered some distortion of the tail unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> It is difficult to account for the lack of communications during the presumed 10 minutes before the final catastrophe.  The aircraft may have been too low for V.H.F. communication with ground stations, but if there were transmissions they should have been picked up by other aircraft.</P>
    <P>On account of these matters, the hypothesis must remain in the realm of speculation and on present evidence cannot be given a higher status than a remote possibility.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention to this report and to the detailed appendices to it which have, since its publication, been available for inspection by interested parties.  The appendices, numbering in excess of 150 pages, give details of: the search and recovery operation; transcripts of tape recordings of radio exchanges between the Viscount St. Phelim and the air traffic control services of Cork, Shannon and London; meteorological data; investigation of the recovered wreckage, including the airframe, engines and propellers; investigation of auto pilot; summary of witness statements, maps of witnesses locations and photographs.</P>
    <P>These records, which have been available since 1970 in what is now the Department of Public Enterprise, illustrate the great lengths to which the officials of the Department at the time went to establish the cause of this accident.  It is important to make clear that the purpose of aircraft accident investigation, which like all international aviation activity is governed by the International Civil Aviation Convention, ICAO, specifically Annex 13 to the convention, is to try to establish the cause of the accident in order to prevent a similar accident or a reoccurrence.  It is not the purpose of the investigation to establish blame or liability.  A large passenger aircraft accident is an international evident by its very nature and, consequently, several states may have rights and obligations, that is, the state of manufacture and the state of registry.</P>
    <P>In the case of St. Phelim, Ireland as the state of operator and of registry was responsible under international convention for holding an investigation and publishing a report, which was done. In carrying out this obligation, help in the search phase of the operation was given by the UK in accordance with international convention.  At the time, our Navy had three corvettes and one only was at sea off Donegal at the time of the accident. As soon as possible, she assumed the role of co-ordinator. The salvage operation was Ireland's responsibility under international convention. This operation was conducted with the assistance of ships of the Royal Navy, which were considered at the time to present the best, if not the only possibility of locating and recovering the wreckage.  This regrettably took a long time. Unfortunately, the fuselage of the aircraft, which may have been of considerable help in establishing <Col N="1251" /> the cause of the accident, was not recovered intact.  The wreckage lay in a depression on the seabed at a depth of 42 fathoms, with the surrounding area at a depth of 39 fathoms, which is over 250 feet.  Recovery of the wreckage was a difficult and dangerous task.</P>
    <P>The Senator will recall the publicity surrounding the recent fatal accident of TWA 800 off the coast of Long Island.  Despite the sophistication of present day technology and an estimated expenditure of $125 million, the investigation has not established the cause of the accident in which over 200 people lost their lives.</P>
    <P>The Department has consistently done all that was possible to establish the cause of the loss of the Viscount and, more importantly, the tragic loss of 61 lives 30 years ago.  On behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise, I offer my sympathy to the families of the victims of this tragedy and to the colleagues of the Aer Lingus crew.  It is always unsatisfactory when an accident investigation <Col N="1252" /> fails to establish clearly the cause of the accident.  I appreciate that it is particularly difficult for the families and friends of the victims of such an accident to come to terms with their loss. The Department has always examined any new information as it became available.  It did so on several occasions since 1970, including the examination of target aircraft dredged up in 1974 and 1978.  However, there was nothing found which could positively be linked to the loss of the St. Phelim.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Public Enterprise is willing to republish the report of the investigation and its appendices and to make copies of these documents available in the Oireachtas Library. However, in the absence of new evidence, she is not persuaded to reopen the investigation.  Should new evidence become available, the Minister, like her predecessors, would be more than willing to have such evidence examined.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 6 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 27 March 1998.</P>
