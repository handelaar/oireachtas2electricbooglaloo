      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position regarding funding for the new Tallaght Hospital.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Norris as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate John Hume and David Trimble on winning the Nobel Peace Prize.  It is a fitting tribute to two courageous politicians who have taken tremendous risks in their search for lasting peace. It has to be seen as a major encouragement to the peace process and to all those who brought about its creation.</P>
      <P>John Hume has given all his political life to the pursuit of peace and to the building of a new society in Northern Ireland.  This recognition has long been earned.  David Trimble deserves great credit for the leadership he has given to the Unionist community and for his valuable contribution to the peace process.  I hope such well deserved recognition will encourage all parties involved to continue to strive for a full and lasting peace.</P>
      <P>Probably the most prestigious prize in the world today, the Nobel Peace Prize, is a reminder that we are all involved in the ongoing road to peace and stability.  It is a clear and powerful statement of support by the international community for the peace process.  The world is watching with admiration and it is willing us all on.  We must continue to work together to overcome the remaining obstacles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party we are happy to be associated with this vote of congratulation <Col N="1150" /> to the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.  In the case of John Hume it is a recognition of a lifetime of consistent dedication to the principles of democracy and reconciliation.  Never, even in the darkest days of rejection, has the SDLP or John Hume wavered one iota from their commitment to a peaceful democratic resolution of our problems.  Over all these years John Hume has held a vision of what might be, of how this island might be shared between the peoples on it.  The Nobel Peace Prize is a just vindication and recognition of what he has been doing over this period.</P>
      <P>David Trimble has come only lately to leadership. He has come a very long way in facing up to, as John Hume did, and persuading many of his people to accept difficult and unpalatable truths about the nature of the situation in Northern Ireland.  He has shown great courage, consistency and constancy over the past number of years since he became leader.  It is everybody's hope that the recognition he has achieved will prove important in persuading those on the Unionist side who still have doubts to follow his leadership.</P>
      <P>There are many others who should be associated with this prize.  As John Hume said, this was not a prize for two people.  There are many others who should be associated with it &mdash; Séamus Mallon, Ken Maginnis and others who, over the years, have fought for the same principle.  There is also the Alliance Party and the hundreds, if not thousands, of community workers who have, in an unglamorous way, sought to build bridges in their communities.  It is especially appropriate that we should remember today our colleague, Gordon Wilson, who by his testimony at Ennis-killen moved the world and did an enormous amount of good in assisting the process of reconciliation. We honour those who have consistently sought and fought over the years to uphold the principles of democracy, peace and reconciliation. That is what the Nobel Peace Prize is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.  John Hume is a man in comparison to whom most of us seem insignificant in terms of commitment and conviction.  It is undoubtedly true that David Trimble has provided an extraordinary degree of leadership.</P>
      <P>However, the Nobel Peace Prize might have been more generously awarded to all the signatories of the British-Irish Agreement who have in their own way, big or small, from the two main parties to the Women's Coalition, struggled to build a new society.  People approached it from different positions and angles.  When John Hume began his most recent pursuit of peace, the initiation of dialogue with Sinn Féin, he was a far from popular figure in this House or in the media. The person who responded to that was one of the signatories to the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a great believer in inclusiveness and in recognising those who take risks for peace, regardless of from where they come.  People from all backgrounds in Northern Ireland have taken <Col N="1151" /> risks and have suffered for peace.  A more appropriate symbol of the hoped for transformation of Northern Ireland would have been a Nobel Peace Prize which included the two people who won and also those who contributed to the process, for example, the signatories to the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I join with the tributes paid and offer my congratulations to both John Hume and David Trimble. John Hume is undoubtedly the towering figure in Northern Ireland in leadership terms and has been so for the past 30 years.  No one can be in any doubt about his contribution or leadership and the initiatives he took.  He is a man of vision who was not afraid to develop his ideas and take the necessary steps, for example, his courageous dialogue with Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin which everyone opposed.  He has shown enormous leadership qualities.</P>
      <P>David Trimble, who comes from a very different background, has shown tremendous and courageous leadership over the past number of years. His inclusion in the Nobel Peace Prize is a case of looking to the future, as much for the leadership it is hoped he will continue to give in the years to come as for the leadership he has shown over the past years.</P>
      <P>I congratulate both for espousing peace and democracy as the only way forward to reconciliation and a permanent solution in Northern Ireland.  I congratulate all those who are equally deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize, be they national leaders, such as the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, or President Clinton, or the various groups, such as the Alliance Party, the Women's Coalition, David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson. They all played their part and must be congratulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>All of us would agree that the award of this year's Nobel Peace Prize to John Hume and David Trimble is well merited. However, both we and they would say that it reflects the efforts of a great number of people over many years who espoused constitutional politics as the way forward.  They rejected violence and were single minded in their determination.</P>
      <P>The award does no more than recognise the contribution that has been made by so many people over that period.  John Hume has been so single minded and consistent in his approach and his leadership over 30 years or more that one can only stand in admiration.  It is true to say that he, more than anybody, brought the people to Stormont to begin the process which led to the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Trimble was one of the main instruments in securing that agreement and in bringing the majority of the Unionist population with him to a point where all sides could agree to a peaceful <Col N="1152" /> way forward.  For that reason the award is well merited.</P>
    <P>It is also appropriate for us to remember the contribution that Members of this House made to the peace process.  Significant contributions were made by Séamus Mallon and the late Gordon Wilson.  Their testimony has been an important and lasting element in constitutional politics on both sides of the Border, ensuring that peace is the only way forward.  We hope the award of the Nobel Prize will give all political leaders in Northern Ireland, Great Britain and the Republic the courage to carry on to secure the lasting peace we all desire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate two men who are the recipients of what is probably the greatest prize in the world. I concur entirely with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the House, Senator Cassidy, the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Manning, and all the other speakers.</P>
      <P>John Hume has been consistent but, all the more so, he has the right to be proud, as have the people of Derry.  He has brought another great prize to that city.  Derry is the only city in western Europe that has two Nobel prize winners in its midst.</P>
      <P>With his usual caution, Mr. Trimble said he hoped the prize was not premature.  I hope likewise, but I do not think it is.  The people of the world have endorsed the people of Ireland who said yes.  To that extent it has to be an enormous endorsement and encouragement to those who are trying so hard at present to bring peace and accord among the people of this island.</P>

  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Order of" RHead="Business">
    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 11, motion No. 23.  Item 11, motion No. 23, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If not previously concluded, item 1 will resume at 8 p.m. I propose 15 minutes for the principal spokespersons and ten minutes for all other Senators. Senators may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to.  Could the Leader inform the House of the Government's intentions on a White Paper or legislation dealing with mental health?  Last week the Leader undertook to come back to me with an indication of the Government's intentions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Leader know the Government's mind on the question of General Pinochet?  This arises in part from the present discussions of the International War Crimes Tribunals Bill.  General Pinochet has been protected until now from facing <Col N="1153" /> the charges he deserves to face of widespread murder, torture and abuse of human rights.  He is now in a position where two European powers are involved in possibly bringing him to trial and I hope the Irish Government will support any efforts to bring this man to face the charges he should have faced a long time ago.</P>
    <P>May I draw the attention of the Leader of the House to the report of the Free Legal Aid Board, published today, which indicates the crisis and the delays at present being caused by the lack of adequate funding and staffing in this area?  There is a serious problem and I have tabled a motion to address it.  I ask the Leader to amend tomorrow's Order of Business so it may be discussed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point made by Senator Manning.  Ten years ago this month I organised a trip to Chile for two Members of this House and two Members of the other House. When we arrived at passport control our diplomatic passports were not recognised by the man who is this week crying foul because his diplomatic immunity is being questioned.  It is a long road which does not have a turning and it is time for us to say as a nation that if it is right to extradite people after 15 years, and if it is right to investigate Ansbacher accounts after 15 years &mdash; and it is &mdash; then it is surely right to investigate mass murderers after ten years.  This man has blood on his hands and I would like to see his comfortable and expensive hospital bed exchanged for a less than comfortable prison cell.</P>
      <P>I saw what that man did.  He stands in the tradition of Pol Pot, Hitler, Stalin, Ceaucescu and Milosevic.  I would like the Irish Government to make clear its support for the Spanish in this matter. I would like the Leader of the House to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come in and clarify the Irish Government's attitude.  It has been too silent on this issue.</P>
      <P>Without wanting to appear truculent I am far from happy with the Leader's response today.  I would like to register my disappointment that once again the Order of Business carries no mention of the Shannon River Council Bill.  I see the Leader smiling.  Last week he gave a commitment that he would look at it.  I would like to hear a response.  I know the Leader is embarrassed by the position of his party and his Government colleagues but it is time to clear the air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps I am losing my memory but I thought we agreed last week that we would have a debate on the banks.  That is not taking place this week. I spent a great deal of time preparing my contribution for today to find it was all wasted.  I was then told by my colleague, Senator Costello, who raised the issue, that it was his understanding that the debate would take place next week.  If that was the case, I would have been able to use the material I prepared.  I now find that the Government, without any consultation, is taking a holiday after the by-election and the House is not meeting at all next week.  This is in spite of the fact that the Leader also gave me a commitment <Col N="1154" /> to have a full debate on education immediately after the by-election.  I do not know what is going on.  The Independent Members would like to be able to prepare their contributions to debates and I would like an explanation for the issues I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I associate myself with the remarks made by Senators Manning and O'Toole in relation to General Pinochet.  It is appropriate that this House discussed the International War Crimes Tribunal Bill last week and that it is going before the other House, but there has been a deafening silence from our own Government on where we stand on this issue.  I would have expected widespread condemnation at this time of the possibility of diplomatic immunity being granted to a person responsible for genocide in his own country.  The Leader must convey to the Cabinet, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach the need to make Ireland's stand on these issues clear to the international community.</P>
      <P>It was my understanding that we would have a debate on the banks next week.  I am unhappy to discover that the House will not meet next week. I do not see why a week's recess is necessary now. Much legislation is due to come before the House and even if the Dáil goes into recess the Seanad should sit and deal with pressing matters.  The Committee on Public Accounts has been discussing the current banking scandal but this House has said nothing on the matter.  It is not acceptable that this House should wait another week before debating this issue while the whole country is discussing it.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader inform the House if any legislation is planned to deal with planning and the rezoning of land?  Because of the current housing crisis councillors in urban areas are being placed under enormous pressure to rezone land.  Such rezoning is inevitable despite the objections of councillors.  Obscene profits are being made by speculators who bought this land at agricultural prices.  Legislation is required to deal with this problem.  A debate in this House would help tease out the enormous problem of how to address the housing crisis without facilitating speculators who bought land near every major urban area in the country and are now making enormous profits.  We must not stand idly by while this is allowed to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks concerning former President Pinochet.  I suggest that Members who may not be familiar with the sorry history of Mr. Pinochet's rule in Chile should view the movie <i>Missing</i> which stars Jack Lemmon.  This will give them some flavour of what life under the Pinochet régime was like for innocent citizens of Chile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also ask that the House condemn the murder of a number of journalists in the Kosovo region in recent weeks.  Yesterday the Serbian Parliament passed a bill which will severely restrict the independent media in that part of the world from <Col N="1155" /> reporting the military activities of President Milosevich and his army of thugs.  In the context of the request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House to clarify Ireland's position in relation to former President Pinochet, the Leader might suggest that the Minister avail himself of the opportunity to give the House an up to date report on Kosovo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot pre-empt the debate at this stage.  You have requested a debate and have made a number of points in support of your request.  I cannot allow you to discuss the matter further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader may not feel he has sufficient ammunition when he makes his request to the Minister.  The media are carrying reports that 50 members of the Defence Forces will shortly go to the region as part of the OCSC delegation on verification.  Irish lives could be at risk; therefore, we have a very real interest in what is happening there.  That is the main reason the Minister should come to the House to discuss this matter.  I appreciate your ruling, a Chathaoirligh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try not to test either your latitude or longitude, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
      <P>Nobody should be under an illusion about the attitude of this side of the House to what took place in Chile under the Pinochet regime and nobody can condone what took place.  However, it would be wrong to intervene in the legal process in the UK where proceedings might be initiated and from where Spain is seeking Pinochet's extradition. It is a separate aspect of the matter, although we condemn what took place in Chile.</P>
      <P>It is important to debate matters relating to the banks but such matters will come to the House by way of legislation.  As I understand it the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Finance are bringing forward proposals for a regulatory system for the banks separate from that in place at present which will give rise to legislation.  With regard to the case under examination by the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General may be given additional powers which may also require legislation.  In that event the House will have an appropriate opportunity to debate the issues.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request to have the Minister for Foreign Affairs come to the House.  Will the Leader ask the Government to consider providing financial support to those in Nigeria who suffered in the terrible fire there?  We may wonder how people were caught up in such disaster but the fact that Nigerians must queue for 15 or more hours to get petrol may lead us to understand why they rushed to get the petrol gushing from a pipe.  Having experienced the trauma and tragedy of the explosion in Omagh we must have an understanding of the horrific events in Nigeria. The House should send its support to these people and the Government should send financial aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with interest reports in the newspapers of what was called a &ldquo;Pretty Polly clinic&rdquo; held in Dublin yesterday.  I remind the House that the former Pretty Polly factory in Killarney remains vacant despite the Tánaiste's assurance at the beginning of the year that a replacement industry would be in place by Easter. Will the Leader of the House come back to me on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Cox said about Nigeria.  We should remember the malign role of Shell in Nigeria.  When a delegation from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs sought permission to go there the chairman of the committee, Deputy O'Malley, was advised not to apply to the Nigerian Government but to Shell. It is strange that a major international company should control the issue of visas to distinguished politicians.</P>
      <P>With regard to General Pinochet, I share strongly the satisfaction expressed that this criminal is at last on the first step towards justice. However, we must be careful with regard to the accusations against him.  I note that the newspapers have indicated that he may be arraigned on charges of the arrest, torture, murder and genocide of 94 Spanish citizens.  That is an abuse of the term &ldquo;genocide&rdquo;.  Murder is what is involved; genocide is the specific, clear desire to annihilate an entire race.  We must be clear about the terms.</P>
      <P>I hope there will be a debate on the banks.  I know legislation may be necessary but any such debate must take into account the role of the Revenue Commissioners.  Immediately after a news broadcast in which the principal item was the role of the Revenue being questioned as it apparently let off a major banking interest with a fraction of what it should have paid, there was an advertisement directed at the ordinary PAYE earner saying if they do not submit their forms on a certain date, they have to pay everything they owe, plus interest and penalties.  If this applies to the ordinary little people, as we inherently call them, who pay taxes, why should it not also apply to the great institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Government considering legislation to deal with gazumping which is happening repeatedly? <Col N="1157" /> The building industry needs to be looked at.  More scaffolding collapsed in D'Olier Street and a worker was injured.  We have already raised that matter in this House.</P>
    <P>In the light of remarks made in the press and by informed legal sources in the aftermath of certain recent murder cases, has the Government any plans to look at the notion of diminished responsibility as a defence against murder?  It was indicated in court that a legislative amendment is overdue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to come to the House to debate setting up a book town in Ireland?  This would be an attractive phenomenon for Ireland, especially given our culture and history.  One town which would be suitable for this purpose is Listowel in my own County Kerry, which has a great history.  There are many book towns in European countries and it would be an excellent attraction for the many Irish emigrants living in Australia, America and elsewhere.</P>

That is why our system is superior to the one he imposed on a country with a 150 year old democratic tradition.  I am delighted and I hope our Government will say it believes all those accused of committing murder should be given a fair trial, and no Government in the free world should attempt to prevent that.  People against whom there are legitimate and serious accusations should be brought to trial and the US, in particular, should not use its clout to stop this.</P>
      <P>Two building workers are in jail this afternoon. Whatever the merits or demerits of the case people will draw the conclusion that when building workers complain about being forced by subcontractors to break the law they go to jail, and will observe that many people are not in jail for bigger crimes, bigger evasions of tax and more serious offences.  The House should re-examine what it means to be equal before the law in our society and we could do with a serious debate about what equality means in Ireland, because for most people it no longer exists.  There are two Irelands, one of ordinary people who are compelled to observe the law, the other of people who are allowed to negotiate the law.</P>
      <P>On a more mundane matter, will the Leader inquire from the Government and Dublin Corporation whether proposals for two separate deregulations will become law?  I had the extraordinary experience of standing for almost 15 minutes outside Heuston Station, on a morning with no bad weather, no bad traffic, and no taxis. Why will people in this city not deal with that problem decisively and immediately?  The second issue, arising from the spectacular prices paid for pubs in Dublin, is whether the Government still intends to introduce full deregulation in the issuing of licences for public houses, particularly in Dublin, because one suspects that those buying pubs know something about the future which the rest of us do not know.  I would like a reassurance that there is no drawing back from the recommendation of the Competition Authority.</P>

      <P>I also call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House, but on a different issue to that raised by other speakers.  It is nearly six months since the peace agreement was put in place but progress to date has been slow, particularly on the formation of the Northern Ireland Executive.  We were assured at the <Col N="1159" /> time that the Executive would be in place by the end of October and I echo the Taoiseach's hope that it be in place within a matter of days.  This is a delicate time in Northern Ireland and now more than ever great leadership is called for, so I ask the First and Deputy First Ministers to do everything possible to establish the Executive.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the two winners of the Nobel Peace Prize.  Senator Haughey mentioned it was a great tribute to County Derry to have two Nobel Prize winners, and I congratulate St. Columb's College in Derry, which may be the only school in the world with two Nobel Prize winners.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position on cervical smear testing throughout the country?  A major problem has arisen; certain health boards have a screening procedure but because of a lack of staff there is a 12 month wait for smear tests. This is a serious matter for women who are worried about cancer.  The health boards say women should have the smear test carried out by their local GP but many women have inhibitions about going to male doctors for this, and in some areas there are not enough female doctors to whom male GPs can refer patients.  This is causing major problems for women in terms of the delays in obtaining the results of cervical smear tests from the laboratories in Galway.  In some cases it takes up to six months to obtain these results.  That is not acceptable given that the Department of Health and Children has stated that women must be smear tested regularly.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Mooney, Cox, Haughey, Costello, Dardis and Norris expressed serious concerns about General Pinochet.  I will communicate their views to the Minister.

Tá sár-iarracht ar siúl againn leis an stráitéis seo agus tá an plean sin á chur os comhair an tSeanaid tráthnóna agam.</P>
    <P>There has been increasing public and political concern about road safety.  That concern has highlighted a number of especially tragic accidents resulting in multiple deaths which have occurred in recent months.  In overall terms, our road safety performance has improved considerably over the past 20 years.  In 1978, 628 people died in road accidents in this country, 472 died in 1997.  That reduction was achieved against a background of significant increases in both miles travelled and vehicle numbers.  However, a worrying trend has been established in recent years which has seen a rise in road deaths in each of the past three years.  In response to that, the Government has published a Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002.  More than 26,000 people have died on Irish roads this century, more than 355 in this year alone.  This first ever national road safety strategy is intended to address this unacceptable social problem urgently and systematically.</P>
    <P>The strategy was prepared by the High Level Group on Road Safety, under my direction, arising out of a commitment by the Government in October 1997 to tackle the terrible tragedy of road accidents in Ireland.  The strategy brings a more systematic and focused approach to the management of road safety in Ireland.  For the first time, the Government's road safety policies and objectives are outlined in a detailed and comprehensive manner in one single document.</P>
    <P>Within five years, the Government wants to reduce deaths and serious injuries from road accidents by at least 20 per cent.  If we succeed &mdash; and the Government and the road safety agencies are determined that we should &mdash; 172 lives will be saved in the year 2002 compared to a business as usual scenario.</P>
    <P>The strategy aligns itself with road safety plans from other countries in recognising that the modification of human behaviour in the three key areas of speeding, alcohol use and seat belt wearing holds the greatest and most immediate potential for realising road safety gains.  The strategy therefore proposes a concerted effort in these areas to achieve the targets set.</P>
    <P>Higher speed reduces the time available to avoid collision and makes the impact in a collision more severe.  A reduction in average traffic speeds can result in a consequent reduction in accident frequency.  Given the scale of speed limit <Col N="1162" /> exceedances being recorded by the NRA on the inter-urban network there is clearly scope for considerable reduction of vehicle speeds.  The Government's policy is therefore to secure a much higher level of compliance with existing speed limits.  The strategy target is to reduce, within its five year timeframe, present levels of excessive speeding by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Measures proposed to achieve this target include greater use of automated speed detection systems, both mobile and fixed, by the gardaí. These systems will significantly increase the rate of detection and sanction in relation to excessive and inappropriate speeding.  Just as importantly, their deployment will help to change the mindset of drivers so that detection of speed limit exceedances is perceived as a probability rather than a mere possibility.</P>
    <P>Traffic calming measures will continue to be implemented on national routes by the NRA and in urban areas by local authorities.  Traffic calming aims at reducing vehicle speeds by self-enforcing traffic engineering methods.  They can both physically restrict speed and encourage driving at lower speeds.  Speed reductions of the order of 20 per cent have been achieved as a result of the installation of such schemes and consequent reductions in accidents are confidently expected.</P>
    <P>The aim of continued media awareness and education campaigns led by the National Safety Council will be to create universal social disapproval of excessive and inappropriate speeding and to highlight the risks of this behaviour.</P>
    <P>Despite the perceived improvement in behaviour in relation to drink driving it is conservatively estimated that in Ireland alcohol is the primary cause of 25 per cent of all road accidents. The strategy sets out an extensive analysis of the alcohol factor in accidents on Irish roads and sets a target of reducing by at least 25 per cent, the number of fatal road accidents &mdash; commonly drink related &mdash; occurring during the hours of darkness.</P>
    <P>A number of new counter measures are proposed to tackle the alcohol factor in road accidents. These include the introduction and extension countrywide, beginning in 1999, of evidential breath testing; possible selective application of random breath testing; possible wider availability of information from coroners' reports about the blood alcohol level of road accident victims and media campaigns aimed at achieving the same high level of social non-acceptance of drink driving on a year round basis as has been achieved for the Christmas period.</P>
    <P>The use of evidential breath testing is already common in many European countries.  What it involves is that a person suspected of drink driving may be required to provide a breath sample instead of the traditional blood or urine sample. The breath sample will be analysed by an automated or calibrated appliance located in the Garda station.  The system provides for speedier processing than is provided for currently and <Col N="1163" /> should permit an increase in the number of proceedings against drink driving offenders.</P>
    <P>The road safety strategy commits the Government to consider the possibility of the introduction of random breath testing.  At present road traffic legislation requires a member of the Garda to have formed an opinion that a driver may have consumed alcohol.  That requirement would need to be removed in order to facilitate the introduction of random breath testing.  However, the use of such a system on an unqualified basis is not envisaged within the life span of the strategy, and the question of its application on a selective basis will be examined.</P>
    <P>The third area of focus in the strategy is the wearing of seat belts.  While seat belt wearing does not prevent accidents, it is highly effective in eliminating fatalities and reducing serious injuries in low speed crashes in particular.  Current wearing rates in Ireland, at an estimated low of 55 per cent, identify scope for an improvement in behaviour which could result in saving 30 lives annually when the strategy target of an 85 per cent wearing rate by car users is achieved.</P>
    <P>Measures in support of this target will include extension of on-the-spot fines for failure to wear a seat belt and publicity measures to give particular emphasis to the need to use seat belts on short as well as long trips, and also to ensure the wearing of seat belts by rear seat passengers.  While these key target areas and the countermeasures proposed will give us the greatest immediate return, the strategy also proposes a range of other measures to complement these and to further improve road safety in Ireland in the longer term. These include improved road safety education programmes for primary and second level school-children; the introduction, in 1999, of roadworthiness testing for cars and the introduction of a written theory test for first time applicants for provisional driving licences.</P>
    <P>Certain cross-cutting issues, vital to the effective implementation of all or most of the specific measures which I have already described, are also addressed in the strategy.  The enforcement process will be enhanced by major upgrading of Garda and other IT systems relevant to enforcement; extension of fines on-the-spot to non-wearing of seat belts and other offences and refinement and updating, as necessary, of the legal framework for the processing of offences and the development of a penalty points system for driving offences.</P>
    <P>It is a key principle of the strategy that improved technologies should be used wherever possible to improve road safety.  This covers matters such as speed detection equipment, IT systems and the application of telematics towards traffic and vehicle safety.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for road safety is spread over a wide number of agencies at both national and local levels.  Good multi-agency co-operation is, therefore, essential for effective road safety and for the successful implementation of the strategy. <Col N="1164" /> Achieving the strategy's ambitious targets will place heavy demands on the implementing agencies &mdash; the Garda, the National Roads Authority, the National Safety Council, local authorities and others &mdash; but all support the new strategy and are strongly committed to delivering on it.</P>
    <P>If responsibility for the strategy is seen to rest only with Government and public agencies, then it will fail.  The strategy needs wider public, political and media support.  Surveys have shown that the Irish public have a high level of concern about road safety and are generally supportive of action to improve it.  We need that concern and support to be maintained so that, under the co-ordination of the strategy, all will play their part in making Ireland's roads safer.</P>
    <P>The time has come to adopt a more pro-active and precautionary approach to road safety in Ireland.  The requirements of efficient transport and the convenience of our social lives cannot be allowed to dominate road safety policy as, to some extent, they may have done in the past.  We need to relate road safety to wider issues of health and security so that the various restrictions and disciplines imposed by road traffic regulations are seen as contributing positively to a safer Irish society.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to the implementation of the new road safety strategy and to making a reality of better road safety in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Tá an Gaeilge go flúirseach aige.  All he said was very interesting.</P>
      <P>I want to deal with the &ldquo;National Road Needs Study&rdquo; of the National Roads Authority.  This is a major report.  In a map on page 86 entitled &ldquo;Final Report: Future Road Types&rdquo;, it is evident that there are major deficiencies in the recommendations contained therein, the most glaring of which concerns the much needed western road corridor.  The proposed route by-passes County Kerry altogether.  I am glad to see my colleague, Senator Dan Kiely, sitting opposite.  No doubt this is a subject to which he will wish to refer. One can imagine what by-passing County Kerry will do and how it will greatly hinder the development of the region.</P>
      <P>I note that the South-West Regional Authority has pointed out that the Government could save £80 million if it improved road links between Waterford, Cork and Limerick with an improved road to Tralee.  The NRA wants to upgrade roads between Galway, County Mayo, County Clare and Rosslare via Limerick.  This would inflict a severe blow on County Kerry in terms of tourism and trade losses.  Surely County Kerry is peripheral enough without by-passing it and cutting it off altogether.  We are being shoved off the end of the map here.  I am getting very worried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we were talking about Objective One status.  One does not want to rely on big supports but, from what we have been reading, it would seem that perhaps the proposed measures are discriminatory. I hope that will be corrected.  I will <Col N="1165" /> be watching closely the moves and views of Minister O'Donoghue and of the Deputy who has a foot just outside or inside the Cabinet door, Deputy Healy-Rae, in that regard because they have both gone on the record about the need for County Kerry to be included in the Objective One group.</P>
    <P>Transport links are vital in terms of getting people to and from County Kerry which, outside of Dublin, was designated some years ago as a major centre of tourism growth.  With all that is happening I am getting worried about the status of that formerly declared goal.  It is seriously in doubt.  It is obvious that the road from Limerick to Tralee needs improvement and that road from Ballyvourney to Cork should be improved to the standard of the Killarney-Ballyvourney road. This is a fine road but trying to get off it is difficult, as Senator Quill would know because she must take part of that route and turn left at that junction which goes to the now famous village from whence she came.  To have a road &mdash; between Ballyvourney and Ballymakeery and the Halfway House &mdash; in the largest county in Ireland, that is Cork, in such an appalling condition is nothing short of a disgrace.</P>
    <P>It is also essential that the national primary road between Killarney and Tralee be upgraded. It is very disappointing to note also that, in what is called the south-west road corridor on another map in the report, the road stops at Limerick on one side of the fork and Cork at the other and, apart from what is entitled a strategic corridor link from Limerick to Tralee, it does not properly reach into the most south-westerly county.</P>
    <P>I would strongly suggest that what are indicated as corridor links from Limerick to Tralee and through Killarney to Cork be upgraded and made an integral part of the proposed western road corridor.  It is difficult to understand the tardiness of the NRA regarding the proposed future road types for such important national secondary routes as Killarney-Mallow where, again on the map on page 86 of the report, the National Road Needs Study states simply that it will be the existing road and that no upgrading is required. Nobody who has to use the road would believe that.  This is a major gateway to County Kerry from Rosslare and other parts of the country and it is in extremely poor condition.  The Minister need not take my word for that: he can take the word of the redoubtable Deputy Jackie Healy-Rae &mdash; Senator Dan Kiely will corroborate this &mdash; who has often referred to this subject in common with myself and others at meetings of Kerry County Council.  This road is full of twists and bad and dangerous bends.</P>
    <P>The road from Tralee to Dingle is indicated in the report as a reduced two lane route and there is no mention of the Killarney to Dingle road. The Ring of Kerry, a famous route, is also indicated as a reduced two lane route.  Some of this route, such as the road to Dingle, is also indicated as an existing road where no upgrading is required.  Who is to believe that?  It is like the <Col N="1166" /> fairy tales of Ireland.  The assessment of this road is a huge blunder given the level of traffic &mdash; articulated lorries and heavy coaches &mdash; which these routes carry of necessity in servicing the tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will vote for all the money I can get.  I note the positive aspects of the speech by the Minister of State.  Motoring taxes now account for one seventh of all revenue.  Car sales have reached a new record and are expected to reach 145,000 this year, which will further push up the amount of motor tax paid.  It is estimated that £2.2 billion will come from motorists and related services this year.  It is predicted that car sales next year will be 140,000.  There is no sign of a let up in the car population.</P>
      <P>Given the overall inadequacy of our roads, a serious problem arises from the growth in car numbers.  There has been insufficient investment in the provision of extra roads and in the improvement of the existing roads structure. According to the Garda National Traffic Policy Bureau, over 330 people have died so far this year.  The bureau has analysed the causes and has found that in 129 cases speed was the cause and alcohol was a contributory factor in 57 cases.  The remainder were caused by a variety of factors, including dangerous or careless driving, driver negligence, cyclist negligence, pedestrian inattention, hit and run and weather conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bureau has definite views on how to cut the human cost of what has been termed the culture of complacency among Irish drivers, which was evidenced from a survey published recently by the PMPA, in which more than 50 per cent of drivers admitted to speeding and other illegal driving practices, with males under 30 years of <Col N="1167" /> age being the worst offenders.  The bureau believes that two measures can significantly reduce road deaths: the introduction of a system of penalty points for road traffic offences and on-the-spot fines for failure to wear seat belts.  It found that just 53 per cent of drivers wear front seat belts and many less wear rear seat belts. Speeding is apparently the big killer followed by pedestrian inattention.  Drink and speeding are primarily the young person's problem due to inexperience.</P>
    <P>As a society we must seriously try to get the message to the young driver, especially the young male driver, to end this macho culture surrounding speeding.  The goal must be to make speeding as socially unacceptable as drink driving.  If this could be achieved surely there would be a marked decrease in the number of road deaths. Other measures which could be more usefully adopted would include more speed cameras and a written test for driving licence applicants.</P>
    <P>Dr. David Lillis, president of the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, recently stated his belief that many road traffic accidents are the result of more than 330,000 unqualified drivers using the roads.  A recent survey of road accident statistics at University College Hospital, Galway, found that over 40 per cent of those involved are aged between 17 and 26 years.  Dr. Lillis advocates a five point strategy to reduce road carnage. Unqualified drivers must be accompanied by qualified drivers until they have passed their driving test, newly qualified drivers should be restricted to driving up to a certain speed for a specified period after qualification, written tests should accompany the practical driving test and the testing process should be speeded up.  In addition, road quality must be improved and a public education campaign introduced.</P>
    <P>The Driving Instructor Register of Ireland, which is concerned with the standard of training of drivers, yesterday called for a review of the driving test and of how provisional driving licences are allocated, noting that 24 per cent of drivers are currently on provisional licences only. These matters need urgent attention.  Furthermore, the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Pat Byrne, has urged the introduction of random breath testing of motorists and a penalty points system for road traffic offences.</P>
    <P>If these measures are introduced we will achieve a marked reduction in the number of road deaths.  Mr. Byrne has also said that random breath testing would give gardaí greater flexibility, while the points system leading to possible disqualification by the courts following successive offences, would also be helpful.  The chief executive of the Guardian PMPA Group, Mr. Gerard Healy, said that his group remains concerned at the increasing number of deaths and serious accidents on the roads.  He went on to say that the problem can only be resolved by a change in poor driving habits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1168" /> When launching the strategy &ldquo;The Road to Safety&rdquo;, which is aimed at reducing road deaths by targeting behaviour, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said that 40 per cent of cars and heavy vehicles on Irish roads breach the speed limits.  It is a frightful experience to be confronted on a narrow, winding, twisting road by an articulated lorry which is almost certainly breaching the speed limit.  This happened to me recently on the road between Mallow and Kildorrery, which provides a main corridor in the centre of the country and is in an appalling condition.</P>
    <P>Alcohol is still a major factor in road accidents and the rate of seat belt wearing is well below international best practice.  I wish to address a few other matters, but as my time has expired I will be happy to hear the views of my colleagues.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit. Tá ceangal láidir idir timpistí bóithre and feabhsuithe ar na mbóthar náisiúnta.  I welcome these reports.  The &ldquo;National Road Needs Study&rdquo; and the Government's strategy for road safety are interlinked.  Road safety and road improvement are related.  While we can attribute driver behaviour patterns, or perhaps their failure, the number of accidents on the roads, undoubtedly the condition of some of our roads and of the overall network are also a significant contributory factor.</P>
      <P>Since 90 per cent of all traffic &mdash; 89 per cent of goods vehicles and 96 per cent of passenger vehicles &mdash; use the main roads it is important that considerable investment is made in them.  Criticism could be made of the lack of realistic forward planning in the past.  The thinking was too short term and the condition of many roads reflects that today.  The study and the corresponding programme have a 20 year vision of improvements and a heavy investment will be made in that period &mdash; estimated at £6 billion with annual maintenance costs for national roads in excess of £35 million.  Those are significant amounts by any standards.</P>
      <P>However, the 20 year time frame may be insufficient. On examining continental motorways, the conclusion may be drawn that a 50 or 60 year horizon would be more appropriate.  Many German autobahns were constructed in the 1930s and have stood the test of time because of good forward planning.  We need to do likewise.  As a peripheral trading country much of whose produce is exported it is important the distribution systems from and within the State are at competitive levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a significant payback for investment in road infrastructure.  There is a saving on time, the wear and tear of vehicles, depreciation and the cost of fuel.  All these are imported costs, so investment in roads contributes to an improvement in the balance of payments.  Many imported second hand cars come from countries with a better road infrastructure and, consequently, are in much better condition and are of much higher <Col N="1169" /> value than domestic vehicles of a similar age which have suffered greater wear and tear.</P>
    <P>When I was involved with the Irish Road Haulage Association we repeatedly requested a system of motorways for the country.  It is 15 or 16 years since we met the then Minister for the Environment to whom we articulated a programme of motorways between the major population centres of Dublin, Belfast and Cork.  The opportunities presented at the time were unfortunately not seized.  Had they been, the heavy investment required now would not be needed and the deficiencies in the network not nearly as evident.  It would also have contributed to the overall economic development of the country. The return on investment in the Naas by-pass, the first section of motorway to be constructed in the country, was about 15 per cent per annum.  That is a significant return, so there is a significant payback to the State and its economy on investment in road infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Significant employment is generated in the construction of roads.  When we put our case there was high unemployment.  Thankfully, that position has improved.  Labour accounts for up to 30 per cent of the construction costs of a motorway and the proportion increases the smaller the road.  This means road building assists in employment creation and is one of the ongoing benefits of the investment.</P>
    <P>While the 20 year programme is good, it must be fully implemented and accelerated if possible. With the future reductions in Cohesion and Structural Funds, it is important the State makes the commitment to continuing the road programme at a faster rate than heretofore.  There will be a need to attract other sources of finance, one of which will be private.  I do not understand why the successful pilot schemes of the East Link and West Link bridges were not built upon.  Both involved private investment, with a return to investors over a 30 to 35 year period and the infrastructure eventually being handed over to the State for future use.  That is a blueprint for future progress.  However, many other countries have embarked on this in a more aggressive and progressive manner.  It is an area which should be examined.  Considering the amount of money available in pension funds and elsewhere for investment in the stock market and tax break schemes, such as holiday resorts, investment in much needed infrastructure, such as roads and sanitary services, in the form of a scheme which would give investors a return would be a good way of directing that available finance.</P>
    <P>Demographic changes will place an increasing strain on the existing network.  We heard figures of a 60 per cent increase in car registrations over the next decade which will certainly add to traffic congestion, especially near the capital and other locations.  Regarding the planning of the network, there must be an available source of expertise, if not here then certainly in Europe, where there have been sophisticated road networks for decades, which can eliminate the mistakes in road <Col N="1170" /> development.  The M50 has been of tremendous benefit to traffic flows around the city but the slipways were congested almost as they were built.  This illustrates that someone was not doing their homework.  Such mistakes can ill afford to be made and they should not be repeated.</P>
    <P>I use the roundabout at the Red Cow Inn coming to and from Dublin, but the road network leads to a bottleneck.  The traffic lights were erected as an afterthought when it was found the roundabout did not work.  People should be held to account for such costly mistakes but, above all, lessons should be learned so that these mistakes are not repeated.  While flyovers, which are commonplace elsewhere, may involve an extra capital expenditure, they are far better than delays which add to the maintenance cost of cars in terms of excessive braking and fuel consumption.  Furthermore, an important safety feature is involved in that the inclination for people delayed for prolonged periods at such junctions is to make up for lost time on the open road.  This contributes to some of the inexcusable speeding on our roads and we should be conscious of that.  Efforts should be made to have the traffic flowing freely as it is in our economic and safety interests to do so.</P>
    <P>I notice in the plan that the N30, linking Enniscorthy and New Ross, is scheduled for improvement in the next phase with the section from Enniscorthy to Clonroche earmarked.  There is another equally deficient seven or eight mile stretch on the New Ross side of Clonroche.  If that is an example of failure in other areas of the network &mdash; I am citing that because I am particularly familiar with it &mdash; I would be worried if areas like that are being left out.  The worst possible thing to do is to improve sections of a road to a high standard and have traffic flowing into a funnel where accidents are waiting to happen.  I hope those areas will be examined.  While I welcome much of what is in the NRA report, those types of mistakes should not be incorporated into the plan.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement under EU legislation to provide lorry parks for heavy articulated trucks because of the restriction on driving hours.  This is in the interests of safety and the environment. I am aware of the difficulties in this regard because I have been involved in one such area with a person who is seeking planning permission for a lorry park.  The situation has also arisen elsewhere in the country, for example, in Roscrea. For some strange reason, however, while lorry parks are specified in EU regulations, it is nearly impossible to get planning permission on main road arteries for such parks, unless there is an existing entrance.  This is something the NRA should examine.  There is a need to ensure that facilities which are an aid to safety and driver discipline are made available, but not on a restricted basis as is happening at present.  In my own county, somebody is keen to develop such a facility but they have had difficulty in finding a <Col N="1171" /> location.  It has been suggested that if one goes off the route on to some of the by-roads, one could obtain permission but that approach seems neither sensible nor logical.</P>
    <P>The single greatest cause of death to people under the age of 45 is road accidents.  That is a startling situation.  I welcome the Minister's initiative on this report.  A sustainable road safety policy was overdue and it is to be welcomed.  The challenge to us is to improve driver confidence and behaviour.  Senator Coghlan mentioned young drivers.  I am inclined to believe that, whatever about young drivers, driving improves with experience.  It is like any facet of life; in time, whether by design or chance, one will improve from experience and driving is no exception.</P>
    <P>We could introduce a system under which drivers who pass their tests would qualify as improver drivers for a few years.  If they were involved in an accident or infringement during that two year period they would be required to repeat the driving test.  Other safety procedures could be built in to focus people's attention on the fact that when one passes the driving test it does not necessarily give one the experience to respond quickly to potential accidents.  With experience it is often an automatic reflex action.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's comments with regard to tackling speeding.  The automated speed detection systems will certainly be a deterrent.  We should concentrate on enforcement.  Whether we are driving at 50, 100 or 150 miles per hour, the chances of being stopped for speeding are probably less than 10 per cent.  If one breaks the driving law in the United States, however, the chance of being caught is 70 per cent.  If we can apply that type of enforcement level, people will respond to being caught.  That will lead to a reduction in speed patterns and alcohol related driving incidents. Evidential breath testing will contribute towards improving matters in that area.  However, if enforcement is not obvious or at a higher level than now, we will not see such improvements.</P>
    <P>We discussed local government reform at a sub-committee meeting this morning.  Given the crime detection and investigation duties of the Garda Síochána, special traffic rangers under the aegis of local authorities would be welcome.</P>
    <P>It is an alarming statistic that only 55 per cent of drivers comply with seat belt regulations.  That is very low.  Enforcement is the key to achieving greater compliance.  Greater enforcement is required if the target of reducing road deaths by 20 per cent over the next five years is to be achiveved. Everybody should take responsibility for their own safety as well as having regard for the safety of others.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to harp on a theme about which I feel strongly, the establishment of the National Roads Authority &mdash; a body that is neither accountable nor elected.  I could never understand why responsibility for national routes was not left to local government.  One can argue <Col N="1172" /> that local government looks after only its own little patch.  However, it should have been possible to establish some kind of authority in which local government played a major part, on a regional or sub-regional basis.  A large question mark hangs over some of the ways in which the National Roads Authority has carried out its work.  The previous speaker mentioned the Red Cow junction where four lanes of traffic go into two.  But for the fact that the local authority installed traffic lights to regulate the traffic, there would be nothing but chaos there.  That demonstrates the Authority's remit is so limited that when it comes to local authority areas there is no gel between them.</P>
      <P>The same is true of other areas throughout the country, although I do not wish to be too parochial. I am sorry that the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is not here.  In its statement, the National Roads Authority mentioned our peripheral position as regards Europe and the need for strong infrastructures so that commercial and industrial traffic can have easy access to ports and airports.  When one looks at the map, however, one notes the authority has forgotten about that aspect when talking about Ireland alone.  Galway Corporation and Galway County Council applied for funding to have a particular road upgraded to a national primary route.  The purpose of that funding was to ensure factories and industry in the Gaeltacht area of south Connemara, which we all agree is a fairly deprived area, could avail of an infrastructure which is not failing.  Nobody would want to establish industries there if they could not travel to Galway, Dublin or Shannon rapidly.  If the Minister of State looks at the map, he will note there is not even a road shown from Galway along the south Connemara coast.  There is no intention of upgrading it, even to a wide two-lane road with hard shoulders.  I would have thought if the criterion of Ireland being on the periphery applies in terms of Europe, it should also apply to the west because of its peripherality.</P>
      <P>Other speakers mentioned areas they believe have been left out.  Local government should have been given a say in the matter because it is aware of the needs of the community and the local area.</P>
      <P>The report provides projected figures for vehicle traffic to the year 2035 when, it states, saturation point will be reached.  I do not know how the Authority worked out that date.  One has only to look at the roads out of Dublin, Galway and Limerick early in the morning and in the afternoon to see that saturation already exists. The Authority's projection for traffic saturation by the year 2035 is already out of date; it will occur by 2015.  The demands for the proposed infrastructure, which I believe should be reviewed, will require more than £6,000 million.  I do not know where that money will come from or the priorities it will create, but I would like the Government to tell us where the money will be found.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Molloy, is not in the House to hear this because in his opening <Col N="1173" /> statement he mentioned that more than 355 people have been killed on our roads this year. The first report on local radio in Galway this morning was of another death in a road accident. &ldquo;Another statistic&rdquo; some might say, but that is what worries me.  It has almost a drip effect &mdash; people switch off when they hear about it.  If the carnage were accumulated into one day, such as Enniskillen or Omagh, I do not wish to denigrate what happened in those places &mdash; the world would be talking about it.  It is an extraordinary number of deaths, more than one person every day.  Between now and Christmas, if we project those figures, more than 100 people will be killed on the roads.</P>
    <P>If we can do anything to save even one of those lives, we must do it.  Some of the ideas suggested today are very worthwhile.  The suggestions put forward by Dr. Lillis in Galway are worth implementing, particularly those regarding drivers who hold provisional licences not being allowed on the road unless accompanied by someone with a full licence.  Today a small family saloon of less than 1,000 cc is capable of doing up to and more than 100 miles per hour.  It is not built to do that speed.  If it hit a wall, it is so small and light the impact would cause terrible damage. Even those small cars are dangerous and for a person driving without experience they are a weapon. We should insert a provision in legislation stating that no provisionally licensed driver should drive without a fully licensed experienced passenger beside him or her.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Walsh that people who commit offences should not only lose their licences but should be made go back to school. That is what happens in the United States, where they must do written and driving tests to ensure they are capable and have sufficient knowledge of the road.  They have to attend school for a number of weeks and prove they did the course. The cost is carried by the person who committed the offence.</P>
    <P>The Government's aims in regard to speed controls are very laudable, but the controls are imposed in a periodic and sporadic manner.  At Christmas time there is a huge increase in advertising about the dangers of drinking and driving. That should be spread throughout the year.  I am, however, cautious about carrying out random tests on people who may not have given an indication to the gardaí that they have committed an offence.  That is open to abuse.</P>
    <P>The traffic calming measures are excellent. They slow down traffic on its way into towns. Recently I was leaving a town where there were four traffic calming islands and I was astonished to see a car overtake.  It was unable to return to its own lane and had to stay on the wrong side of the road for three quarters of a mile as a result. Traffic calming is signposted for people travelling into towns but it should also be signposted for those leaving such towns.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to many people about our speed limits.  The speed limit on a dual carriageway is <Col N="1174" /> 60 miles per hour.  People say a car is capable of travelling at 70 miles an hour with greater safety than it was in days of yore.  Most cars have antilock braking systems, side impact bars and other safety fittings and their road holding ability is much better.  We should review the speed limits on dual carriageways and that review should be extended to county roads.  A peculiar situation exists whereby one can travel at 60 miles per hour on a dual carriageway but there are so many corners on some county roads that tavelling at 60 miles an hour would make one a danger to everyone else on the road.</P>
    <P>Perhaps people on the Continent obey speed limits to a greater extent than we do, but there the speed limit can decrease from 60 to 40 miles per hour and then increase to 60 miles per hour over a short distance.  We do not have provision for that on county roads or when major roads suddenly narrow.</P>
    <P>I concur with some of the proposals made today, but the penalties for drink driving and dangerous and reckless driving should be extended.  Perhaps people should be disqualified completely if they are caught twice.  The fines may be welcome as another form of taxation, but a person in business can write off a fine of £50 one day and do the same thing the following day. There is a possibility that insurance companies could be brought in and the fine doubled or trebled by virtue of the fact that once the person has been caught once or twice, their insurance will increase, but the fines should be reviewed and made so substantial that they are meaningful.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for listening.  I hope that whatever action is taken between now and Christmas, and in the future, will save as many lives as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt, to the House and acknowledge the Minister's appearance earlier to present Government strategy on road safety.  That was his third visit to this House in 12 months.  That is a measure of the importance he attaches to road safety.  The fact that he was invited here by Members three times in the last 12 months is further confirmation of the importance Senators attach to road safety and of our deep concern at the number of road deaths and accidents which take place in this State year after year.</P>
      <P>We heard today that the number of road deaths so far this year is 357.  We are still only in the tenth month of the year.  I do not have figures for the number of serious road accidents but they are very substantial and should also be taken into account when talking about road accidents.  In County Cork, 43 people have been killed in road accidents already this year.  That is an extraordinary loss of life by any standards.  As Senator Coogan said, if that carnage had occurred in one day or in one place, there would be a huge outcry. Because it happens incrementally and over a geographical spread, there is not the same intensity of public revulsion about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1175" /> The statistics are frightening, but we should look behind them.  There are few people in this Chamber who do not know some family which has been stricken by the loss of a member slaughtered in a road accident.  Earlier this afternoon Senator Coghlan mentioned the road to Killarney. The last time I travelled that road was to the burial of two young people in that town who were killed in a car crash at midday one Sunday as they made their way from Dublin to Kerry, two young men in their prime, ripe with youth and energy, driving down to play a match for their local club. The anguish of their families and friends was one of the saddest experiences of my life.  The parents of one of these young men were friends of my family.  This young man, Tom Beckett, of whom we were all so proud, died at the start of his life. Similar stories can be told in towns and villages throughout the country.  While the public return to their everyday lives, the families of victims of traffic accidents never forget their grief.  Their anguish cannot be described.  A huge onus is placed on those of us who make public policy to strengthen our efforts to reduce the number of deaths on our roads.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on the document he has introduced outlining the Government's priorities and the provisions the Government plans to make to reduce the number of road deaths and to reinforce road safety.  I compliment him on his development of this comprehensive strategy in the short time he has been in office.  It is important that we take a comprehensive approach because, despite the best efforts of bodies such as the National Safety Council, the Garda Síochana who have introduced many operational programmes, the National Roads Authority and the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the number of road deaths is far too high.  There is great merit in putting in place this integrated and comprehensive strategy for road safety so that all agencies act in unison and focus their efforts on a common and co-ordinated set of priorities.  This co-ordinated approach will lead to a more intensified and sustained programme not just at Christmas but every day of the year.  The heightened effort of this strategic national approach will generate a greater level of support from the general public and the public must support road safety programmes if they are to succeed.</P>
    <P>The biggest single factor in the prevention of road accidents is the attitude, the expertise and the experience of the driver.  Approximately 1.4 million people hold full driving licences and approximately 337,000 hold provisional licences; this represents 24 per cent of all licence holders and it is far too high.  Efforts must be made to reduce that figure.  To do that we must take a fresh look at upgrading the driving test, improving pre-test driving training and putting an appeal system in place so that people who fail the driving test can reapply for the test very quickly.  I am aware that too often our schools are expected to <Col N="1176" /> provide solutions to our problems.  However, schools are pivotal in inculcating attitudes and in forming character and we must look to our schools to improve the attitude of young people to driver education.  This can be done by including safe driving modules in transition year programmes.</P>
    <P>All driving schools must be of a uniformly high standard.  We all know of people with no qualifications who have used their redundancy money, for example, to set up driving schools.  That is not acceptable.  A basic standard of proficiency for every person who sets up a driving school or who gives driving instruction must be laid down.  All private driving schools must be registered so that a uniform standard of driving instruction can be established.  We must provide in-service courses for driving instructors.  Very often young people are prepared for the technical aspects of passing the driving test but not enough emphasis is placed on road safety and responsible driving.  It is a great privilege to hold a driving licence and a sense of this privilege must be part of a young driver's training.  Driving schools must teach not only technical driving skills but a proper attitude to road safety, courtesy to other road users and a sense of responsibility.  If we ensure that this happens we will create a new generation of responsible drivers.  We must take a serious look at the standards of driving schools and instructors. Instructors who are not properly trained must be taken off the road.</P>
    <P>A person who fails a driving test should not be permitted to drive home from the test centre and continue driving without a supervising driver. This indicates a recklessness in our attitude to the importance of driving education and it must be stamped out.  The older generation has given a bad example to young drivers.  As a nation we are careless drivers and we must solve that.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to introduce the penalty points system.  A £50 penalty is as nothing to young high earners &mdash; it is about what they might spend on a night out during the week.  Somebody said to me recently that when they were young £50 was the deposit on a house.  However, young drivers will pay a £50 penalty as a matter of course.  It is not a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Legislation must be brought forward to enable the introduction of a penalty points system.  It should be based on the best features of such systems as administered elsewhere.  Its introduction would be a praiseworthy act which would enhance road safety and help to eliminate the appalling level of carnage on the roads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with Senator Quill's assessment of the road safety problems. However, one of the features of the Seanad is that nobody takes the slightest heed of what is said.  I hope some of the Senator's points will be taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In October last year 18 people were killed on the roads in an eight day period.  There was a debate on road safety in the House at that time. <Col N="1177" /> There was also a top level meeting under the chairmanship of an assistant secretary in the Department of the Environment and Local Government which included representatives from the National Safety Council, the Departments of the Environment and Local Government and Justice Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the National Roads Authority and the Irish Insurance Federation.  A decision was taken to prepare a co-ordinated national strategy for road safety for consideration by the Government.  That national strategy has now been published and I welcome it.  It contains many features which, if implemented, would reduce the carnage on our roads.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, enforcement seems to be a problem with the law.  We are well aware of the causes of accidents &mdash; excessive speed, drink driving, defective vehicles and drivers who lack experience.  These factors contribute to road accidents. However, the level of enforcement for non-compliance with the law is very low.  Last week I was driving on a national primary route on which there was a speed check in place.  I knew about the speed check three miles before I came to it because its presence was signalled by two or three oncoming drivers.  The traffic passed by the check at the appropriate speed.  Such enforcement is useless and is a waste of Garda time.  We must examine such factors and change them if we are to make an impact on the carnage on the roads.</P>
    <P>There is also an obligation on the Judiciary. Some courts impose heavy fines and disqualifications for periods up to six months for excessive speeding.  This is a welcome approach and it will contribute to a reduction in speeding.  Heavy articulated vehicles have a speed limit of 50 miles per hour, yet how many of them observe that limit?  There should also be a speed governor on the engine of heavy vehicles to prevent them exceeding the speed limit but on most trucks these inhibitors are disconnected.  It is rare, if ever, that there is a prosecution for a disconnected inhibitor on an articulated vehicle.  These issues must be addressed if we are to reduce the injuries and deaths on the roads.</P>
    <P>We must welcome the promotional work done by the National Safety Authority and the research done by Beaumont Hospital into the age categories of the drivers involved in road accidents. The coroner in north County Mayo is heading a national campaign to reduce drink driving. He has started a national organisation called Dóthain which is growing and advocates drink free driving.  However, although drink is a factor in road accidents, it is not the main cause.  About 25 per cent of road accidents are attributed to drink driving.  Lowering the drink driving limit may prove unproductive if it is not enforced because if they can do so with impunity people will continue to drink and drive.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to a matter in which I am particularly interested &mdash; the education and training of young drivers.  She mentioned the <Col N="1178" /> transition year in school and it is a great idea because at that stage young people are only two years from being entitled to hold a driving licence and they could come to understand the dangers of driving.  She also referred to the technical qualifications needed.</P>
    <P>More than technical qualifications or a knowledge of the rules of the road are needed to produce safe drivers.  I recently spoke with two young drivers about the serious wet road conditions and the dangers of aqua planing at high speed.  Neither had heard of aqua planing.  This kind of knowledge needs to be inculcated in the minds of young people at an early age.  Transition year or the final year of secondary school provide an ideal opportunity to teach road safety.  This would contribute to a greater understanding of cars and a greater knowledge of the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>The driving instructor register needs to be updated.  Some driving instructors with the minimum knowledge and experience are teaching. There are 137,000 provisional licence holders on the road, an appalling statistic.  This must be tackled.  Provisional licence holders should not be allowed on the road, even with an experienced driver who can only intercept an accident at a late stage.  There should be greater control of provisional licence holders.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to refer to the National Roads Authority, except to say that the only road I am concerned with is the national primary route from Longford to Ballina.  We tried for years to get it upgraded to national primary status, which was achieved.  However, all the road has is a new title.  We are waiting for funding for the N26 and the N7 from Longford to Ballina.  I hope the authority is listening.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment the Government on introducing the road safety strategy, a timely and meaningful measure. There has been a public outcry about the number of road deaths.  Twenty one years ago 628 people were killed on our roads compared to 472 last year and 357 to date this year, including the person killed today.  There have been huge improvements in our roads and the quality of cars over the years.  However, death on our roads is a serious problem which must be tackled.  I compliment the Government on its moves to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree that provisional licence holders should not be allowed to drive.  When I was younger I applied for a provisional licence in a different country.  I was entitled to drive and I then got my test.  To get a provisional licence here, one just has to fill in a form and pay the fee. In other countries, one must pass written, audiovisual and eye tests to get a provisional licence. On the day of the test there are no rules of the road examination, which takes off the pressure. There is no doubt that people get nervous driving in a car with a stranger.  They are often worried about what questions they will be asked on the rules of the road and that can distract them when <Col N="1179" /> doing their driving test.  I am glad the Government is introducing a written examination.</P>
    <P>More road safety education in schools is also important.  I compliment primary school teachers on the way they control children going home from school, helping them to cross the road, etc., and the emphasis they put on road safety. However, second level students cross roads wherever they want and ignore the cars which are legally entitled to be on the road.  The onus is put on the driver to avoid them and if they are hooted at they look at the driver in disgust wondering what they did that was wrong.  Second level students will have to be made more conscious of drivers and the rules of the road.</P>
    <P>There are many good drivers in this country because they are used to driving on winding roads.  However, a great deal needs to be done. There are better quality cars on the road and many are built for speed.  No one really knows the legal speed limit.  The legal speed limit was reduced from 60 miles per hour to 55 when there was a petrol shortage.  I do not think it was ever restored to 60 miles per hour.  There is a 70 miles per hour limit on some motorways.  There should be a uniform speed limit.  Perhaps there should be a limit of 55 miles per hour on county roads and a limit of 60, 65 or 70 miles per hour on dual carriageways.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous number of new cars on the road.  As I said, 628 people were killed 21 years ago.  There is twice, if not three times, the number of cars on the road today than there were 21 years ago.  Every home has two, three or four cars.  The husband needs a car to go to work, the housewife needs a run-around to do the shopping and the young people also need a car to go to work because there is no public transport.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about the decline of the rail network.  The loss of rail lines was a retrograde step.  An extra effort should have been made to maintain our rail network.  I welcome the new rail proposals for Dublin, which should have been introduced some time ago.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the National Roads Authority later as I am critical of some of their proposals for the next 21 years.  The Government should look at upgrading the road network, including the possibility of private investment and toll charges to finance the construction of new roads.  Despite Cohesion and Structural Funds and the extra money in the national purse, we cannot update our roads fast enough to keep pace with our development.  The NRA programme has good ideas but it is developing the country in one direction only.  Even the western roadway through Galway and Limerick goes across to Rosslare and cuts off a huge part of the south-west.  If one wants to see how the country will develop in the next 21 years all one has to do is look at the main road arteries in the NRA's programme, because industry will follow those roads as sure as night follows day.  I am utterly disgusted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> Senator Coghlan spoke about his disappointment at the exclusion of roads in south Kerry, such as the road from Mallow to Killarney. However, he supported the adoption of this report at last Monday's meeting of Kerry County Council, when I put down an amendment to oppose it because not one penny is to be spent on the N69 between Tarbert and Listowel.  That is the main road into the county from Limerick and from Clare via the Tarbert ferry.  It is disgraceful that the document states no upgrading is required on that road.  It was the first secondary road in the county but it is being ignored and it is disintegrating.  Large stretches of land were purchased for road widening and the removal of bends, fences were removed, but grass is now growing there and the road will receive no funding for the next 21 years.  Also, Listowel town needs a by-pass because traffic is being held up every day, even on Sundays when people go to Mass, but that is not provided for either.  Where will the money needed here be spent?  About £6 billion will be spent on the western alliance road in the next 21 years.  Someone asked where that money would come from &mdash; the taxpayers will provide it because they pay for everything.</P>
    <P>There is an imbalance in the programme.  Parts of it are excellent and one must recognise the growth areas which it identifies, such as the major cities of Dublin, Galway, Waterford, Cork and Limerick but one does not need to be Einstein to recognise where the major growth will occur in the next few years.  However, if we consider the equality of our citizens under our Constitution, people living in peripheral areas are entitled to the same facilities as those in big cities which have taxi and bus services.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister and compliment the Government for its efforts to curb speed and solve the problems on our roads. When thinking about improving our roads we cannot forget safety, traffic, the quality of life or the environment.  We are discussing this issue because of public concern about the huge number of traffic accidents in the last year.  The accident in Arklow was particularly horrific &mdash; it happened because the driver fell asleep.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Roads have become the dominant mode of internal transport in Ireland &mdash; 89 per cent of freight traffic and 90 per cent of passenger traffic is carried by road &mdash; so we must have a strategy for improving road safety.  Before we can do that, however, we must study the psychology of human behaviour to discover why we travel at high speed on our roads; to answer that one need only look at the economic costs of delays.  On &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; we hear about traffic delays all over Ireland, not just Dublin, and it can take up to three hours to get into the centre of Dublin from the outskirts.  The problem then arises when people try to make up time to catch an aeroplane or a boat.  We must tackle the problem at the root &mdash; we can introduce measures for speeding but we must look into why people speed.  If I have to <Col N="1181" /> catch a plane and I am delayed for an hour en route, I will try to make up time.  All of us could be guilty of an offence in those circumstances, so it is a problem for all of us.  It is not just a matter of introducing measures to curb speeding.  We must go back further than that.</P>
    <P>What kind of people have accidents?  Why does it happen to them?  There is a learning curve for all of us.  Are they unemployed, like the joyriders, for example?  In the case of joyriders we must look at education and the unemployment rate, and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform must be involved so that we can introduce a co-ordinated policy.</P>
    <P>A truck driver, on the other hand, may have to catch a boat and make up time; he may be driving through the night and fall asleep.  The employer has a responsibility to ensure that drivers have enough time, after leaving their place of employment, to reach their destination, and he must take into account congestion on the road, hold-ups due to road improvements, etc.  I doubt whether hauliers consider this when their drivers leave &mdash; they may calculate that it takes three and a half hours to get from Cork to Dublin, but that is only if there are no hold ups from traffic, road improvements, or perhaps a funeral through a town which could delay them for an hour.  Do hauliers take all that into account before requiring drivers to reach a destination in a given time?  We should remember this because these are the reasons people speed or fall asleep behind the wheel of a car, causing accidents.  As I said, we must look at human behaviour and examine what one does when under pressure.  Personnel departments should assess this.  The Department and the NRA are introducing a strategy, which I welcome, but it is designed to curb things so they will not happen again.  The public, employers, schools and parents, particularly those with children of 18 or 19 years of age whom they allow to drive their cars, must also become involved in solving this problem. Parents of the young people to whom I refer have a responsibility to ensure that their children show respect for the vehicles they drive and the public at large.</P>
    <P>This is an issue of great importance.  I am glad that measures are being introduced to stop people speeding in their cars.  I welcome the introduction of new breathalyser tests which will speed up the process of identifying those who drink and drive.  Having said that, if I go out at night I do not drive because there is a likelihood that I may be breathalysed but I then have no way to travel home because I cannot get a taxi.  It is a vicious circle.  My car is very important to me and, at present, it is the only viable mode of transport I can use at night.  This is a matter of concern to working people who may wish to have a quiet drink at the end of their working day because they cannot get a taxi from their home to their destination and <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>I travelled to Cork last week.  I telephoned for a taxi at 10.30 a.m. and asked to be collected at <Col N="1182" /> 12.30 p.m. so that I could catch the 1.30 p.m. train. No one arrived to collect me.  I accept that I have digressed but my point re-emphasises the fact that I would welcome the introduction of an improved public transport system.  If the NRA strategy included an integrated approach to public transport, this would provide another mechanism to reduce road traffic accidents.  Members will have to forgive me but I tend to get carried away when discussing this issue.</P>

      <P>The NRA describes itself as the body with sole responsibility for assessing national primary routes.  Local authorities are responsible for secondary routes.  When do the two meet?  The only occasion on which the NRA is mentioned at meetings of my local authority is when members are informed that the organisation has issued a statement.  When construction of major routes such as the M50 is under discussion at local authority meetings, I would like to see NRA representatives in attendance and not merely have county managers reiterate what that organisation has stated.  I want to be in contact with those who make decisions which affect my local authority area.  In the future, when construction of national primary routes, which will have an impact in terms of speeding and traffic management &mdash; this should take the form of an integrated approach between the NRA and local authorities &mdash; is under discussion, representatives of the NRA should visit local authority areas to discuss the relevant issues.</P>
      <P>I welcome the involvement of the Garda and our schools in road safety campaigns.  However, it must be stressed that a co-ordinated approach is needed.  I welcome the introduction of this strategy.  The key to its success rests on the pillars of implementation and enforcement but it will only succeed if adequate investment and support personnel are made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate.  As the Minister of State indicated, this is a serious issue, particularly when one considers the number of people killed on our roads.  Road traffic accidents are the most common cause of accidental deaths.  Too many people are being killed on the roads daily. As Senator Coogan stated, last night a person was killed in a road traffic accident in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When will people realise that the killing and carnage on our roads must stop?  As individuals it is vitally important that we take responsibility for our safety and realise that this is our problem. Until everyone who gets behind the wheel of a car realises this, we will not save the lives we are committed to save in the next five years.  When a person sits behind the steering wheel of their car and turns on the ignition, it is essential that they realise that they are in charge of an instrument which could kill them or a number of other people on the road.  It is important that people <Col N="1183" /> recognise the fact that they could easily be responsible for a road traffic accident.</P>
    <P>When setting out on a journey, people must set aside enough time to allow them to reach their destination in comfort.  Speeding has been identified as a major factor in the cause of road traffic accidents.  However, people speed because they are in a hurry to reach their destination &mdash; perhaps they were detained ten minutes before setting out on their journey.  We do not set aside adequate time to make a journey.  In the past, people could drive from Galway to Dublin in two and a half hours.  The journey now takes three hours and that can only be achieved by driving at the maximum speed limit, and sometimes beyond it.  We must change the culture where if people are behind time, they try to catch up later in the day.</P>
    <P>We must also rid the country of the culture of drinking and driving.  I accept that this culture has changed in recent years but that culture has not been brought to an end.  When one considers the number of people charged with drink driving offences, it is obvious that people continue to consume up to six alcoholic drinks and then drive. Some people are convinced that they can drive better when under the influence of alcohol.  When will these idiots realise they might kill not only themselves but also many innocent people?</P>
    <P>I turn now to people who drive without wearing safety belts.  Statistics prove that wearing safety belts can save the lives of people travelling in the front and rear of vehicles.  Most modern cars have rear passenger seat safety belts but they are not used.  I cannot understand how parents can allow their children to sit in the front seats of their cars, not to mention allowing them to do so without wearing a safety belt.  It is vitally important to realise that it is easy to put on a safety belt because, in the event of an accident, this could save a life.</P>
    <P>With regard to pedestrians and cyclists, there are those who cycle at night without using bicycle lamps or reflective safety equipment.  If one is driving along roads in rural areas &mdash; sometimes it even happens in urban areas &mdash; it is often difficult to see people walking or cycling.  I often wonder whether any of the students in Galway have lights for their bicycles because it is impossible to see them on dark winter nights.  They do not seem to realise that they could be killed even if they were only brushed by a car.  Road safety is our responsibility.  We have better roads and cars which will protect us to a certain extent but if we do not take responsibility for our safety, people will continue to be killed, injured or maimed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this debate involves consideration of the work of the NRA in conjunction with road safety because the two go hand in hand. The NRA is responsible for providing safe roads. In doing so and in investing money in road development throughout the country, a good road infrastructure has come into being. However, because this has been done in a piecemeal <Col N="1184" /> way in certain areas, people speed along good stretches of road before encountering a dangerous section in respect of which funding for improvements has not yet been granted.</P>
    <P>A straight stretch of the N84 road from Galway to Headford has almost become a race track; a series of very sharp bends follows and this is very dangerous.  Recently there have been accidents on that road and people have been killed.  It is vitally important that the NRA, in association with the local authorities, looks at how it develops roads.  I know this is happening but it needs to happen more.  Putting in a stretch of new road that feeds into a series of bends is not the answer.  It only leads to more danger and to people taking chances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the strategy document the Government has put together.  This is the first time this has happened and it is an indication of the Government's commitment to dealing with this issue in a pro-active manner.  It addresses the issues of safety and attitude. This is the first time we have looked at the attitude of drivers and realised that unless we change their behaviour and our behaviour we will not make the necessary changes and achieve our target.  We need to make national roads safer. The NRA has the job of introducing remedial measures and working with the local authorities.</P>
    <P>The traffic calming measures one sees on entering many towns and villages along main roads are certainly having an effect.  Someone might be driving, listening to the radio and concentrating on driving without taking too much notice of speed signs.  However, attention is now drawn to the signs and if a driver does not slow down it is because he is reckless not because he has not seen them.</P>
    <P>The strategy document has recognised that the solution to the carnage on the roads, to ensuring our safety and to all driving more safely from A to B without being in an accident is multi-disciplinary. The Department of Health and Children is involved as we can save money by reducing the number of traffic accidents and deaths; the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is involved because it must make and implement the laws; the Department of Finance is involved as it must provide the resources to implement the measures; the Department of the Environment and Local Government is also involved because it is within its remit that the roads are improved and the NRA reports to it and the Department of Education and Science is involved as it is vital that we consider education. We should educate young people so that when they turn 17 years of age and apply for a provisional driver's licence, they will realise what is involved in driving a car and that there is a possibility that they might kill someone on the road. They need to learn how to drive properly and safely.</P>
    <P>An attitude exists that &ldquo;it will never happen to me&rdquo;.  However, all too often, it happens to us or to our sisters, brothers, mothers or fathers.  Until <Col N="1185" /> we realise that it could happen and that every time we get into a car it is likely to happen, we will not change anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, on his assiduity in pursuing this issue and for coming before the Seanad to listen to its deliberations and opinions on this issue.  It is unfortunate that this has probably been the most debated issue in the Seanad over the past few years.  Requests for a debate on this issue arise regularly.  This debate on road safety and the NRA report is the first major debate in this term.</P>
      <P>The reason this topic is before us again is the unfortunate deaths and injuries which continue on our roads unabated.  The last time the Minister was before the Seanad he announced various provisions and strategies which he was introducing and one might have expected some improvement as a result.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his approach in that the High Level Group on Road Safety working under his direction came up with the Strategy for Road Safety 1998-2002.  The approach is an overall plan which will be put in motion and monitored over the years to see whether it is effective.</P>
      <P>The present situation is alarming.  Almost every day there are news reports of further carnage and deaths on the roads.  There are a variety of reasons explaining Ireland's high level of road fatalities and we have gone over them repeatedly. I am sure there is a variety of reasons none of the measures has so far been effective.  The Minister said more people died on the roads in the 1970s than in the 1990s.  That may be the case, but in the 1990s the numbers are increasing annually and the situation will be as bad in the early years of the next millennium unless the corrective measures proposed, or other measures, are put in place.</P>
      <P>I wish to mention a couple of points.  In relation to recent deaths, there still seems to be a culture within the prosecution system and the Judiciary of not treating drunk driving as a serious criminal offence.  During the past few weeks we have discussed the culture in financial institutions in relation to tax evasion, fraud and white collar crime which the institutions are facilitating by offshore accounts, etc.  There is an equally insidious culture in the ranks of those in charge of dealing with the crime of drunk driving and related issues.  It is almost a white collar crime.  There is a nod and a wink and hail fellow well met and everybody has a few too many sometimes attitude which has percolated through the system so that when someone commits a serious crime by driving a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol and causing a fatality or serious injury, a hefty sentence is seldom handed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every day we hear judges talk about exemplary sentences being handed down.  Not long ago an exemplary sentence of nine years was handed down to a young heroin addict in her early twenties <Col N="1186" /> for larceny of a handbag.  The judge insisted he was imposing the serious sentence of nine years for exemplary purposes to ensure the public was well aware of the consequences of such dangerous, nefarious activities as stealing a handbag. He talked of how the tourism industry could be damaged and that people could lose their keys and suffer many problems as a result.  Yet, on the same day, a six month prison sentence for drunk driving resulting in a fatality was quashed.  No matter what one's views are on drug addiction or larceny there is no comparison between that and the incident which the judge believed did not merit a prison sentence.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the matter is the fact that there is no effective sanction in place for even the greatest offences that end in the loss of human life.  The Minister would be well served if he asked the Judiciary to consider setting up guidelines on sentencing in relation to this matter.  He could ask the Judiciary to compile an approach using their own code of conduct, that would reflect the enormity of the offences that come before them and that this would then be seen by the public to be a serious attempt to deal with the offence.  Until that is done people will continue to think they can get into their cars after a night's drinking, go to another pub as happened in this instance and assume nothing will happen to them. These people do not realise that their senses are greatly diminished by the amount of alcohol they have consumed.  Until the same proportion of people are imprisoned for that crime as are being imprisoned for crimes of larceny, drug addiction, etc., I do not think any of the other avenues we have explored will be effective.</P>
    <P>While we all know that the DPP is an independent officer who prosecutes criminal offences, nevertheless, a lot depends on the way an offence is prosecuted.  Where a fatality occurs, if a case is presented to a judge as a careless driving offence then clearly we are signalling that that is all it is. Instead it should be treated as an offence that caused death and the person who was behind the wheel is ultimately responsible.  There is a huge difference between murder, homicide and careless driving.  The DPP has to also look at the manner in which offences of this nature are being prosecuted because that will be reflected in the way they are dealt with by the courts and, in turn, how the sanctions are imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals are very laudable. However, I am not sure from his presentation at what stage the process is or if the strategy has locked into place at this point as it is a strategy for the period 1998-2002.  I also do not know if there is any assessment, whether he intends to have a six month or annual assessment of the effectiveness of the strategy or if at that point he would be in a position to inform us whether elements of the strategy are effective and if we have reduced the number of fatalities and injuries on our roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the strategy presented by the Minister but I am very disappointed that we still have <Col N="1187" /> not initiated any successful measures at this time. I will look forward to seeing how the strategy operates.  On the next occasion the Minister visits this House I hope we will not be discussing the increasing curve of road accidents and carnage on our roads but rather its downward spiral, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that this debate is centred almost exclusively on road safety yet the wording of the debate refers to the report of the National Roads Authority and I prepared my contribution on that basis.  The Minister is not to blame for this.  He was obviously misinformed but I want to put on the record my very strenuous objections to the manner in which this debate has taken place.  I know it has not prevented Members from both sides of the House from making contributions on both issues but unfortunately the Minister's brief relates to only one aspect of this debate, and that is speeding.  I will take the matter up with the relevant people. This is also no reflection on the Leas-Chathaoirleach.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding that it would be churlish of me not to reiterate the positive comments that have been made on both sides of the House in relation to the Minister's statements.  They are to be welcomed.  The Minister is to be complimented on the ongoing role he plays in this regard.  Road safety is an important aspect of our lives.  Sadly it has had the most serious consequences for many families throughout the country.  Speeding has now become an unacceptable fact of Irish life and it is obvious that the Government has to address this issue in so far as it can.  As the Minister's colleague in Government said on radio some weeks ago, you cannot legislate for people's behaviour and Governments can only go so far.</P>
      <P>In that regard there are a number of aspects that I would like to put to the Minister.  I am sure he will have already addressed some of them, or will most likely be addressing them.  However, I am curious to know if there are any statistics relating to the number of fatal or non-fatal accidents on a road network breakdown.  These figures are normally based on a national level.  In the public domain there does not seem to be any breakdown as to whether these accidents are taking place, for example, on national primary routes with dual carriageways relative to roads which would be of national secondary, regional or county road standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I belong to the school of thought that would suggest that Garda resources are already stretched to the limit which is part of the difficulty in identifying this problem.  I question the efficacy of having two or three gardaí sitting in a patrol car on the Portlaoise bypass.  This bypass, as was stated in the media some weeks ago, compared to similar road networks in Europe does not have a high level of fatalities or accidents. The anecdotal evidence suggests that most of these accidents take place on roads that are clearly not adequate for modern day traffic, be <Col N="1188" /> that the motor car or an articulated truck.  In that respect it might be helpful if statistics were based on road networks rather than on a nationwide basis.  Perhaps these statistics are available but are not being broadcast in case those who are already driving fast on these roads are encouraged to drive even faster on the basis that statistically they have less chance of being killed, knocked down or injured.</P>
    <P>In the context of the spread of resources, my perception would be that many accidents are happening on minor roads at particular times of the day and night, and especially at weekends.  Sadly there seems to be an increase in the number of fatalities among young people who are going to or leaving public houses or discos at the weekend. Some of the most horrific accidents &mdash; especially in the midlands &mdash; over the past couple of months were primarily the result of people travelling on roads after late night entertainment.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that at last a date has been given for the introduction of road testing, road worthiness tests, or MOTs as they are known in Britain. I have failed to understand why successive Administrations have not grasped this nettle.  Is it because the motor trade who would seem to be benefiting, have been objecting for some reason? Has it been an administrative foul up?</P>
    <P>If one looks at the background to many of the fatal and non-fatal accidents on our roads one will find that there are a number of aspects to these statistics other than speeding.  For example, I would suggest that among the contributory factors would be driving vehicles which are not roadworthy &mdash; for example cars with uneven headlights.  How many times has one been blasted not just by a high beam but by two lights, one of which is stronger than the other?  I am sure that is illegal.  Rear lights, if one or both are not working, are another danger.  The most irritating and potentially dangerous practice of many drivers on Irish roads is the persistent use of rear fog lamps, which were manufactured for countries where there is heavy fog.  Ireland does not experience heavy fog.  The Minister, like me, would be familiar with the midlands where there is a tradition of fog at certain times of the year which descends and then passes.  Yet people persist in using rear fog lamps on clear nights this is a hazard.  The glare is such that one finds it almost impossible to see beyond the car in front and yet there does not seem to be any attempt to educate drivers about their use.</P>
    <P>This brings me to education.  It appears that because of the rapid and significant improvements in the road network over the past number of years, the introduction of more dual carriageways, the introduction of traffic calming measures, the introduction of lanes for traffic control and box junctions due to the high level of traffic in towns and the resulting gridlock, there are many drivers who have no knowledge of how to respond to these traffic realities.  When I was growing up around the time the motorways were introduced in the UK in the 1960s the then Minister's <Col N="1189" /> opposite numbers in Britain embarked on a national media campaign to educate drivers. That was basic and obviously important.  It used actuality; it used moving graphics rather than real people, although in some cases it used real people and real vehicles, but the message being put across was how to use lanes and box junctions, etc.  For example, there was a great slogan, &ldquo;When out at night wear white at night&rdquo;.  All these things seemed to be helpful in the context of education, yet we do not seem to have embarked on a similar operation in Ireland.  Does the Minister have any views on that?  Is there within his Department a budget which might be more efficiently used to harness the modern media than leaflets or advertisements in the newspapers &mdash; I am talking about radio and especially television &mdash; to help to educate many drivers drive properly?</P>
    <P>There seems to be a perceptible lack of road skill among drivers.  I wonder whether this might have something to do with the fact that in 1979-80 the then Minister for the Environment, because of public outcry over the huge backlog in applications for driving licences, introduced an amnesty granting licences to thousands of drivers who had not passed a test.  That happened almost a generation ago &mdash; it is 18 years ago &mdash; but people who were 18 years of age at that time are now in their mid-30s.  When one considers the level of accidents, I wonder whether that has been a contributing factor.  It is to those people and others who have not passed the regulatory test that this campaign could be addressed.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the courts are dealing with road rage.  What sort of society are we breeding? We seem to be developing an irritating impatience for even the most minor infractions on the road.  Even where motorists are trying to be helpful one will find that somebody will blow their horn to get them to move out of the way or they will stick up two fingers, or one finger, depending on which particular television programme they have been watching.  In that way they generate hostility on the road.  Once there is hostility behind the wheel one's actions are questionable in any given situation where one needs complete concentration.</P>
    <P>On the 30 mile per hour speed limit, this may seem like an unusual suggestion but, as the Minister will be aware, all the mileage signs are metric, with the exception of the speed limits.  Continental drivers who are used to kilometres see all the national primary routes and, increasingly, the secondary and non-national routes using the metric system, but the towns and villages use the imperial system.  Does the Department intend changing this?</P>
    <P>I would welcome a debate on the National Roads Authority and its report because there are serious questions to be raised about the prioritising of many of the national networks.  It seems that this was done by computer rather than personnel going into the country and looking at the real needs of the various regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> Some weeks ago I wrote to the NRA following on advertisements in the national newspapers seeking tenders for the provision of new road signs.  Would the Minister ensure that whoever gets the tender checks the correct spelling of the various towns and villages across the country? There is nothing as annoying as seeing the village of Keadue in County Roscommon spelt &ldquo;Keadew&rdquo;. That is just one of a number of examples from the north-west region and I am sure the same is true of many other parts of the country. All that is required to get it right is a little research.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  Like Senator Mooney, I want to comment briefly on the National Road Needs Study because it is important.</P>
      <P>The Senators have been thorough and eloquent this afternoon and I will not go over a great deal of what was said.  One area which I do not think was addressed was the acceptance of the enormous increase in heavy vehicle traffic which the report envisages.  An increase of 170 per cent by the year 2015 would be horrific.  We must take into account that more modern methods of transport of goods are envisaged.  Indeed, the Taoiseach opened a centralised distribution depot for Supervalu in Cork the other day and centralised distribution is being considered by other large firms also.  We must look carefully at this area because there is a huge difference between transport and logistics.  Logistics are really what we must promote rather than just transporting goods, perhaps in a very ineffective manner, around the countryside.  I was delighted to see that a conference on logistics will be held tomorrow at Malahide which I hope to attend.  It is good to see such forward thinking is taking place in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Dublin Institute of Technology on setting up the National Institute for Transport and Logistics because it is extremely important that we, who have been described as having archaic freight transport facilities, try to introduce the most modern methods for the transport of goods.  This has an enormous effect not just on the amount of traffic on the roads but on what happens to the roads themselves and the enormous amount of money which must be spent on the maintenance of roads which were never built for the heavy traffic they must carry now.  I am thinking of the smaller roads where one meets huge freight trucks which traverse bridges, which were built 100 years ago and cannot withstand the weight of these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The heavy vehicle area is one at which we should look carefully because the projected increases contained in this study could not possibly be sustainable.  We should apply more modern methods of transport while admitting that most of it will have to be on the roads because the rail network is so small.  I understand the cost implications of having to take freight for part of a journey by rail and then put it into smaller <Col N="1191" /> trucks to bring it by road, for the remainder of the journey.</P>
    <P>Developments in road freight must be considered very carefully.  Strong objections have been raised in towns and suburbs near large supermarket complexes or shopping centres about the difficulties created by the number of deliveries that have to be made to various stores. A small retail shop could get up to 150 deliveries a week, which causes great difficulties for shops located in small country towns.  Suburbs can be blocked by the amount of deliveries being made to large supermarkets.</P>
    <P>We must examine the logistics of the situation and not just envisage an increase in freight traffic. As a very small country we will not be able to handle it.  We must consider if there can be a more rational and sensible method of freight transport, even if it is by road.  I welcome the fact that conferences are at last being held to address this topic.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to say something original at this late stage of the debate, especially after so many speakers have made worthwhile contributions.  I welcome the speech by the Minister of State and the strategy for road safety, which is both positive and worthwhile.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the terrible carnage on our roads in recent years, especially in recent months. Every parish in the country has been affected and a number of families in every parish have been touched by the loss of loved ones.  We have seen far too many guards of honour by national school children and local GAA club members for people who have lost their lives.</P>
      <P>While accidents on the roads can never be eliminated, we would fail in our duty if we did not do our utmost to ensure they are radically reduced.  I do not agree with the use of the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; for some of the recent carnage.  If a driver travels on a national primary or country road at 90 or 100 miles per hour and fails to negotiate the first bend I would prefer, without being offensive, to use the word &ldquo;suicide&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;accident&rdquo;.  Likewise if a person chooses to drive at high speed in an irresponsible and careless manner and happens to collide with a third party the word &ldquo;accident&rdquo; is not proper in that context. In some cases terms such as murder and man-slaughter spring to mind.  I an pleased that charges have been brought against people who had behaved very irresponsibly on the roads in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From visiting rural or urban areas we are all aware of the increase in car ownership.  Up to five or six years ago there was only one &mdash; perhaps even more &mdash; parked in most driveways, but <Col N="1192" /> nowadays most households have three or four cars parked in their driveways.  That is prosperity and people are entitled to it, but it leads to much higher volumes of traffic on the roads.  This, coupled with the dramatic improvements on a number of roads, especially the national primary routes, has made us all guilty of breaking the speed limit from time to time.</P>
    <P>The attitude of drivers is most important. Young drivers have been labelled unfairly to a certain extent.  Inexperience is more of a problem than age.  Senator Dan Kiely mentioned how easy it was for young and inexperienced drivers to obtain provisional licences and use them to drive without supervision.  In some cases this can lead to tragedy.  The attitude of drivers will have to change.  They must become more responsible. When we get into our vehicles we have responsibility for our own lives, the lives of our passengers, other road users and third parties.  Many of us fail to acknowledge this.</P>
    <P>Lack of enforcement is a difficulty.  We should consider the option of local authorities policing our routes, especially the national primary routes where the majority of serious and fatal accidents occur.  Local authorities deal with traffic and traffic issues in our towns and cities and Garda resources are stretched to the limit.  The Minister and his Department should consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>With regard to the NRA report, I am pleased the N69, especially from Limerick to Foynes, has been earmarked for future funding.  The quicker it is provided the better because we are all aware of the dire need to upgrade this road, which serves the port of Foynes and is of huge economic benefit to County Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is on a threadmill.  It is racing to keep up with the growth in traffic and the increase in car ownership. The Celtic tiger has spawned an exponential growth in traffic over the last few years.  For example, less than four years ago the M50 Blanchardstown interchange was opened, which eased traffic flow through Blanchardstown and around the Navan Road area.  However, radio reports in the morning regularly advise of at least a three mile tail back on the Meath side of the interchange due to the growth in traffic and housing developments on the fringes of Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is often forgotten that national roads go through cities, including Dublin.  I live on the Navan Road, which is a national primary route. The director of traffic for Dublin is installing quality bus corridors, bicycle lanes and sequential traffic lights on roads which have been in existence since the time of Tara, more than 5,000 years ago.  At my end of the city, the roads have not been widened much over that period, yet we are attempting to put more than a gallon into a pint bottle.  Traffic has now slowed to such an extent that it is possible to walk across the road in safety without fear of being run over because it would be a miracle if the cars managed to go faster than five miles per hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> When assessing a crash it is necessary to take into account the road, the driver and the car. Modern cars are small, overpowered and under braked.  They are not safe for travelling at high speeds.  It is ludicrous, if not dangerous to travel at 60 miles per hour on a country road.  A person travelling at that speed on most roads is not driving but aiming the car.</P>
    <P>The construction of roads can take up to 20 years from conception to delivery.  Roads, traffic management and other related matters were debated by Dublin Corporation in the past but little was done due to many factors, such as lack of money, the democratic right of people to oppose or question everything and the demand in urban areas for traffic calming.  The net effect of this was to put more traffic on national primary routes in and out of the city.  A balance must be struck but I do not know where.  The dialogue between the National Roads Authority and local authorities has not been as effective as it could be.</P>
    <P>On a parochial note, I noticed the toll plaza for the new port tunnel will have ten lanes.  A similar number was installed on the West Link bridge and it proved inadequate.  This should be reexamined before everything is set in stone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Regarding Senator Mooney's remarks about the subject of the debate, the title refers to traffic accidents.  My office was informed the debate was about road safety.  I was pleased to hear that because of the recent publication of the Government's road safety strategy.  Senators will recall in the last debate on road safety I mentioned the strategy was being devised and that I would be glad to return to the Seanad when it was published. Some Senators took the reference in the motion to the National Roads Authority report to mean it was the subject matter, although it did not refer to any specific report.  We consequently travelled the highways and byways of Ireland and were told about necessary by-passes and upgradings. That is the subject of a separate debate and I am sure my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, will be pleased to attend that debate in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Road safety is extremely important.  We can all recall from the last debate the friends, relations or other people we knew who lost their lives in tragic and senseless road accidents which should never have happened.  Road safety relates to a large degree to the attitude of people using roads, be they drivers, cyclists or pedestrians.  The Government is responsible for initiating a high profile road safety promotion and for ensuring the design of roads is to the maximum possible safety standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there is a plethora of legislation geared towards road safety to minimise the possibility of accidents, the key factor is changing the attitude <Col N="1194" /> of the driver, cyclist or pedestrian.  The failure of road users to comply with restrictions imposed on them must be eliminated.  The level of compliance with speed limits is deplorable.  I am sure none of us could say we have never exceeded a speed limit, have never driven having taken a drink or have always worn seatbelts.  These are disciplines we have not applied to ourselves and that must change.  If it does not, we will continue to suffer the horror of the loss of family members or grieve at other people's loss.  This change can be achieved because it has been done in other areas and countries.  Those of us who have travelled abroad have been very impressed with the higher standard of compliance with requirements placed on road users.</P>
    <P>Enforcement is a critical factor.  The Garda is participating in the high level group and has stepped up enforcement of road traffic regulations. Under the national road safety strategy there will continue to be a much higher level of enforcement and this will become more evident. The benefit of modern technology will be used which will greatly assist the Garda in processing information made available to it through information technology.  Automated speed limit controls and other devices will give it more knowledge more quickly and help bring prosecutions to court more quickly.  It is not a question of money because greater enforcement will result in a greater flow of revenue to the State from fines. This will have to be persisted with until people's attitudes are fundamentally changed.  While statistics suggest it is a hopeless task, I do not believe it is.  I know from debates and public reaction that there is strong support for greater enforcement in this area.  That is understandable considering the possible results.</P>
    <P>The number of miles travelled and the number of vehicles on our roads have increased beyond expectation.  As was said during the debate, the National Roads Authority and road planners designed roads for a certain capacity and, in some cases, ten years of the expected timeframe has already been exceeded.  This sets at naught the benefit from the increased investment in roads over the past ten years.  Therefore, the investment must be stepped up.  We must concentrate on road safety and the battle to sell the message must continue. The best hope of changing the culture is with the younger generation and the National Roads Authority and the National Safety Council, which have a major role to play in promoting road safety on behalf of the Government, are devising new road safety packages for use by teachers for the benefit of pupils in schools.  The message must be relayed at every level but it must hit home to young people if improvement in performance on the roads is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>The targets in the road safety strategy are very ambitious given the increase in road mileage and the number of vehicles, but they can be achieved. Studies carried out by the high level group show these levels of improvement and the reductions in <Col N="1195" /> accidents and deaths have been achieved in other countries where a strategy approach was adopted. It is to be hoped that, with the goodwill of the travelling public and road users, the ambitious targets can be achieved.</P>

    <Title>Compensation Claims: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann exhorts the Government to take effective steps to counter the compensation culture which is seriously damaging employment, economic activity and the capacity of Local Authorities and Voluntary Bodies to discharge their duties and, in particular, to bring forward effective proposals:</P>
      <P>(1) to discourage fraudulent claims;</P>
      <P>(2) to provide for more realistic duties of care for landowners, employers and owners of premises in respect of liability to the public and employees;</P>
      <P>(3) to safeguard defendants from nuisance and trivial claims; and</P>
      <P>(4) to provide a framework for the calculation of damages.</P>
      <P>Ireland has received many plaudits in recent times for its rapid economic growth and the decade of cohesive social partnership which has helped to achieve that growth.  As we move relentlessly towards an income <i>per capita</i> that surpasses many of our fellow member states in the European Union, and the problems that will bring, there is every reason for us to be proud of our performance as a small open economy on the periphery of Europe.  There is one record, however, which I, and no doubt all Senators, would prefer was not ours, that civil actions for injury account for the largest number of claims and the highest settlement figures in Europe.  We are in a league of our own when it comes to claims.  The so-called compensation culture is alive and well.  It is bleeding local authorities, businesses, voluntary organisations and taxpayers dry.</P>
      <P>Invariably, the first item on the agenda of annual general meetings and estimate meetings of local authorities is the question of public liability insurance costs.  The normal cut and thrust of public administration and community activity is infected with the malaise which shows no sign of abating.  Only last week we were treated to the latest manifestation of this culture &mdash; a man, who admittedly suffered horrific injuries in a car crash, received an out of court settlement of £100,000 having sued two publicans in County Cork for contributing to his accident.  Such a settlement could spawn hundreds of others.  Who knows what encouragement it may give to others of a compensatory state of mind in due course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The blame game has become endemic in our society.  In some quarters, taking responsibility <Col N="1196" /> for one's own actions is fast becoming a thing of the past.  Ireland may have the second lowest number of work place accidents in Europe, but employers here face the highest rate of insurance claims, totalling £400 million a year.  In the United Kingdom, 44 per cent more accidents are recorded in the workplace, but figures show that Irish workers are twice as likely to claim compensation as their UK counterparts.  The average claim in Ireland is almost two and a half times higher than in the United Kingdom.  Average claim costs per employee here are £116, while the UK figure is £32.  A sample survey of insurance costs carried out by IBEC showed that costs for small Irish enterprises were three times higher than in the United Kingdom, twice as high as those in Denmark and seven times as high as the Netherlands.  I concur with IBEC's view that a large proportion of the claims are exaggerated, opportunistic and spurious.</P>
    <P>As we all know, the problem is rife within the local authorities on which we serve.  The claims department of Dublin Corporation anticipates that it will have paid out £20 million in costs in the three year period up to the end of this year. While personal injury claims account for only 30 per cent of the number of claims made, the costs awarded generally amount to 60 or 70 per cent of what is paid out every year.  This means that the cost of personal injury claims to Dublin Corporation over the last three years will be in the region of £15 million by the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that last year Dublin Corporation on occasion received no more than a week or ten days notice of court hearings, leaving little time for adequate and proper preparation.  Ironically, this difficulty arose due to the appointment of extra judges, legislation passed by the Oireachtas in respect of that &mdash; which is to be welcomed &mdash; and a greater number of court sittings to deal with cases.  This helped to clear a backlog of claims, but it did not bring any better news to Dublin Corporation concerning compensation costs.</P>
    <P>In mentioning these statistics, I am not suggesting that all the claims were fraudulent.  I have no doubt many of them were genuine.  However, let us take the recent evidence presented by Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Limited, the company which handles public liability insurance on behalf of councils and health boards.  It is that company's belief that one in five claims have a fraudulent element.  At any one time the company could be dealing with as many as 10,000 such actions.  The most disturbing news is that, far from levelling off, the claims are increasing by 5 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Let us also remind ourselves of some of the cases that have had a successful outcome for litigants and ask ourselves about their merit.  In Sligo, a drunken cyclist who rode into a pothole as he tried to balance fish and chips on the handle bars of his bike won his claim against Sligo Corporation and was awarded approximately £5,000. In another case in the north-west, a man who, <Col N="1197" /> while drunk, went through the warning tapes surrounding road works and was injured, received approximately £12,000.  In Donegal, a person has lodged a claim against the county council, most of which relates to emotional distress caused by the council trimming back a hedge.  The recent controversy surrounding Army deafness cases has led to a surge of similar claims for industrial deafness. It seems a vast reservoir of original thinking is going into the search for new compensation possibilities.  Plaintiffs are not acting in isolation.</P>
    <P>Many lawyers are happy to steer them in the right direction, to outline to them the full vista of financial opportunity which a day in court can present.  Medical practitioners are also playing their role, clearly co-conspirators in some cases. I note the observations of the former Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, earlier this year, that bogus plaintiffs are getting what he described as a &ldquo;lift off&rdquo; for bogus claims from medical practitioners. GPs were referring patients to specialists to get them out of their hair, and indeed these referrals may arise from the fear on the general practitioner's part that if they do not do so they may be sued themselves.  Mr. Whelehan concluded that if there was wholesale abuse of personal injury claims, it was on the back of &ldquo;bad practice by doctors operating in a semi-political sly way rather than squaring up to the client&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I welcome the initiative taken by the Government in banning solicitors from advertising for personal injury claims.  That legislation is at present going through the House.  The outlawing of advertising by solicitors in inappropriate locations such as doctors' surgeries is wholly welcome. The time has come to stop the rot once and for all.  As Members of the Oireachtas we must seek to create new conditions in which the culture of compensation can no longer flourish. We can talk all day about the immorality of the situation and the lack of integrity and honesty which is so prevalent in this rush to claim that we have a duty to act decisively to ensure that it is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>That is why my party, the Progressive Democrats Party, believes there is much merit in the establishment of a personal injury compensation board to cater for all claims of this nature.  There are models in other countries which can be looked at.  It would be quicker, more efficient and, most important, would represent better value to the taxpayer.  Let us not forget that it is the taxpayer who ultimately pays the price for the compensation culture.  Traditionally taxes have been collected to fund general services for the benefit of all.  Increasingly in recent times they have become insurance premia to meet the multimillion pound flood of compensation claims.  In the context of recent revelations about alleged corporate tax evasion, it is time to put the ordinary taxpayer first and put a stop to the gallop of those who are unscrupulously ripping off this State.  With rights come attendant responsibilities, yet increasingly responsibilities are taking second <Col N="1198" /> place to people claiming and exercising their rights to an unwarranted degree.</P>
    <P>There have been improvements in legislation. One example is landowners' liability.  There is now a distinction between invitees and trespassers and the duty of care which is attendant upon landowners.  There are rights and responsibilities and people must take personal responsibility for their actions.</P>
    <P>In the case of Army deafness, new claims are arriving at a rate of 50 per week.  There are now 13,600 claims outstanding.  Of those, 1,900 have been settled with a bill of £54 million, £42 million of which went to the claimants while £12 million went in legal fees.  One wonders about a system in which such a high proportion of the costs go to the legal profession.  People who have legitimate claims are entitled to have them vindicated and dealt with but it can hardly be the case that all of the 13,600 claims which arise in the case of Army deafness are genuine claims which should be settled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion. As a member of Cork Corporation I have watched with dismay as year after year the cost to the City of Cork of public liability insurance and personal injury claims has continued on an upward curve.  In the last decade some crucial projects in the city have been seriously underfunded or grossly delayed because so much of the annual budget had to be set aside to deal with the flood of personal injury claims.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that not all claims are bogus but too many are.  We were told recently that 20 per cent of claims to health boards are bogus.  In a debate in this House last week on an amendment to the Solicitors Bill, Senator Henry outlined in detail the cost of increased insurance premia as it now hits practitioners in the medical field trying to survive in this era of compensation culture. The reality is that cost is passed on to all of us and it hits our pockets by way of increased premia for our voluntary health contributions and hits the State in increased costs.  At the end of the day we carry that cost.</P>
      <P>The problem is not exclusive to Cork Corporation. Many voluntary and sporting groups in the region have had to face the headache of snowballing public liability insurance costs and some have had their activities severely curtailed as a result.  In 1995 Cork Corporation paid out £2.2 million in claims; in 1996 the figure was up to £2.5 million and last year it was just under £3 million. This figure could well be surpassed by the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disturbing to note that the cost to Cork of personal injury claims represents a startling 15 per cent of all the city's income from rates.  Of all claims, 80 per cent arise from alleged injuries suffered from broken footpaths, potholes or water stopcocks protruding from holes.  The largest single pay out came five years ago when a woman who claimed to have injured her back <Col N="1199" /> after tripping and falling on a broken footpath was awarded £200,000 by the courts.</P>
    <P>We also have the problem of serial claimants. One woman was recently exposed as having claimed three times to have fallen on the same hole on a broken footpath and she came away a winner on two occasions.  It is true to say that in recent times the corporation is enjoying some measure of success in breaking a fraud ring which was operating in the city but it is still trying to hold back what appears to be an unstoppable tide.</P>
    <P>The question of personal responsibility no longer applies and an unholy trinity of plaintiffs, lawyers and physicians is eating away at the coffers of Cork Corporation, health boards and local authorities up and down the State.  As Senator Dardis said, we have a thriving compensation claims industry which provides handsome rewards for the tallest of tales.  While some end up laughing all the way to the bank, it is the taxpayer who foots the bill.</P>
    <P>This claims culture is a sickness in our society. At a time of unprecedented material well being we should be concerned at the moral deficiency which drives and fuels that culture.  Everything is fair game when it comes to a claim.  Slips and falls have taken on life threatening proportions.  Let us not be in any doubt as to the real victims &mdash; the old for whom proper provision for care cannot be made; young people for whom sufficient pre-school and early school provision cannot be made; those with disabilities who desperately need greater State assistance to enable them to live more independently and the young children whose families do not have the means to send them to pre-school and for whom the State cannot cater because of tight finances.  Every pound awarded to a plaintiff in a spurious claim against a public body is a pound less spent on the areas of greatest need in our society.  Taxpayers who vote and give their money give it in the belief that better public services are being provided for the community.</P>
    <P>The money paid out in a single claim by Cork Corporation could be used to open a branch library or equip a number of shelves in children's libraries.  We are prevented from providing essential services by the insidious onset of the compensation culture.  Every pound awarded to a plaintiff in a spurious claim is a pound less for good and constructive projects.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Progressive Democrats in Government to seek immediate change.  A working party is currently drafting proposals to address the issue.  We have built up a huge bank of information on this subject and we can look at the experience of other countries.  Initiatives have taken place in recent years primarily in the enactment of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995, and I welcome the recent move to ban solicitors' advertisements for personal injury claims.  However, evidence suggests that the cost to the State of the compensation culture continues to rise inexorably. <Col N="1200" /> Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Limited, which is the mutual insurance for health boards and local authorities, has already been alluded to by my colleague, Senator Dardis.  This afternoon it provided me with the latest depressing news on the shape of settled claims costs since 1993.  In that year the figure was £14.6 million and in 1998 the cost is already £21.5 million and rising. The total cost of settled claims in the period 1993 to 1998 is just under £135 million and every week I meet voluntary groups begging on their knees for pennies who could do wonders with a fraction of that money.  I acknowledge that the needs of genuine claimants must be met but it is up to the Oireachtas, through the introduction of new legislation, to get rid of this festering sore in our society.</P>
    <P>We hear much of the increasing number of groups for whom the Celtic tiger means nothing. By confronting the compensation culture head on we can put to better use some of the millions of pounds paid out in bogus claims.  This Government faces many challenges but few rank higher than this.  We need a new system which will discourage fraudulent claims, safeguard defendants from nuisance and trivial claims and provide a proper framework for the calculation of damages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;condemns the Government for its failure to take effective steps to counter the compensation culture which is seriously damaging employment, economic activity and the capacity of Local Authorities and Voluntary Bodies to discharge their duties and, in particular, condemns the Government for its tardiness in bringing forward effective proposals:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1) to discharge fraudulent claims;</P>
      <P>(2) to provide for more realistic duties of care for landowners, employers and owners of premises in respect of liability to the public and employees;</P>
      <P>(3) to safeguard defendants from nuisance and trivial claims; and</P>
      <P>(4) to provide a framework for the calculation of damages.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and trust that following this debate he will come forward with effective and sufficient proposals to address this matter.  I agree with what has been outlined by Senators Quill and Dardis.  The compensation culture is a huge and growing problem.  Insurance costs for businesses and local authorities have long been a subject of great concern.  These costs impact on competitiveness when they are passed on to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very taken by the Deloitte and Touche report on the economic evaluation of insurance costs in Ireland.  That study was a root and branch <Col N="1201" /> analytical examination of insurance cost levels in Ireland compared with other relevant economies, the cost penalty which higher insurance costs impose on the business sector, the source of higher costs in Ireland and the need for appropriate and realistic measures to reduce the burden of insurance costs on business in Ireland.  The review required an extensive consultative process with insurers, the social partners, trade bodies, relevant Government organisations and the legal professions.  The report concluded with a list of recommendations, many of which could have been usefully adopted but so far as I am aware nothing has been done about them.  Equally, at a meeting on 8 October 1996 the Government considered an <i>aide memoire</i> submitted by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The Government noted the report I have just mentioned and agreed to the establishment of a working group.  The working group produced a very interesting document and useful proposals but again nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Two essential measures must be taken to counteract suspect claims against local authorities and other bodies.  First, the statute of limitations must be amended so that claims against local authorities must be taken within six months of the injured party becoming aware of a cause of action.  This amendment would leave local authorities in the position they enjoyed prior to the passing of the Public Authorities (Judicial Proceedings) Act, 1954.  It would reflect the particular exposure of local authorities given their wide ranging statutory responsibilities as the roads authority.  Second, there must be an increase in the prosecution of cases which have been found to be fraudulent by the courts.  We have often heard judges' comments but I am aware of only a small number of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I looked through the <i>Golden Pages</i> this afternoon and noted some of the headlines in the many full page solicitors' advertisements.  They include phrases such as &ldquo;accident cases&rdquo;, &ldquo;accident claims&rdquo;, &ldquo;personal injury demands personal attention&rdquo;, &ldquo;accidental injury &mdash; successful outcome&rdquo;, &ldquo;personal injury law is our business&rdquo;, &ldquo;we deal exclusively with personal injury claims&rdquo;, &ldquo;injured in an accident &mdash; most of our cases are settled out of court&rdquo;, &ldquo;no win, no fee&rdquo;, &ldquo;for accident compensation claims&rdquo;, and &ldquo;claim in confidence&rdquo;. I respectfully submit that this style of advertising is excessive and I hope this matter will be discussed tomorrow when we debate the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998.</P>
    <P>The Law Society and the Bar Council do not publish tables of costs for personal injury cases in Ireland and the Taxing Master's office does not keep records of personal injuries cases separately from other civil and criminal cases.  The Bar Council says that barristers' brief fees for both sides represent approximately 2 per cent of the value of damages or 5 per cent if the case goes to a hearing with additional costs where applicable for consultancy and advice on proofs.  In addition to solicitors' and barristers' fees, payments are <Col N="1202" /> made to expert witnesses.  The Fair Trade Commission Report for 1990 noted that while legal costs averaged 24.6 per cent of the value of total outlay, they amounted to nearly 40 per cent for smaller claims.  That is borne out by information supplied by other sources.</P>
    <P>The long lead times for settlements in personal injury cases in the courts adds significantly to the legal costs.  This is another matter that should be addressed.  The method of charging is governed by the Solicitors Remuneration Council Order, 1986, which lists seven criteria of which time expended is the last.  Other factors include complexity, the amount of money involved, importance to the client, the skill involved, the number of documents and the place where the business is transacted.</P>
    <P>The Deloitte and Touche report notes many factors which lead to the increase in the costs of personal injury claims, among them are special damages, including the provision for medical expenses past and future, general damage awards being a multiple of special damages awards and the growth of special damages over the period 1985-94.  Legal costs increase with the rising value of compensation for special and general damages and the numbers and types of specialist expert witnesses have increased greatly in recent years &mdash; there was a Supreme Court ruling that those witnesses are entitled to their costs.  The report outlines three pages of recommendations, many of which are genuinely worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State has this matter in mind and I would be interested to hear his views.  Unfortunately, the compensation culture is alive and well.</P>

      <P>There is a growing compensation culture, something which any fair minded individual would decry.  It seriously damages employment and economic activity and is damaging to the work of local authorities and voluntary bodies. Many speakers have highlighted the cost to the State of this compensation culture.  The level of damages paid by insurers in personal injury cases has been calculated at £410 million per annum.</P>
      <P>A person with a genuine case is entitled to compensation but too many people are taking a chance and trying to get easy money.  However, matters are changing and the Government strongly supports the discouragement of fraudulent claims.  Our local authorities and voluntary bodies are moving in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In one case a Dublin man who was awarded £21,000 in a personal injury claim against Dublin Corporation subsequently pleaded to perjury and was ordered to repay the money by the High Court.  In a recent case in Galway in which a claim was brought against Galway Corporation, the plaintiff was found to have been making an unfounded claim.  The plaintiff was fined £4,000 and ordered to pay her own and Galway Corporation's costs.  With such cases we see the action <Col N="1203" /> which is necessary to discourage fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are working together more effectively with the aid of information technology and more structured procedures to fight such cases by identifying quickly the cases which are fraudulent.  With the backing of the Government and the courts they will be able to remove the opportunities for people to make fraudulent claims.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the case in Cork which came to light recently involving the publicans which was settled out of court.  It is appalling to see insurance companies taking the easy way out by settling court cases rather than allowing them go to court.  I had recent personal experience of this in an accident case.  I believed I was in the right but my insurance company refused to fight the case.  I took a civil action for damages to my car and I was vindicated because the judge found in my favour.  Had the case been left with the insurance company it would have split liability 50:50, I would have lost my no claims bonus and the other party would have been able to make a claim for personal injury.</P>
    <P>It is important that there be a framework for calculating damages which can be used by juries or judges to minimise the large differences in awards made for similar injuries in different areas.  We must provide a framework for the calculation of damages.</P>
    <P>It is also important that the local authorities take great care in carrying out works.  The sites should be tidied up at night and those working on the sites should be aware of the dangers posed to people by the works.  There is an onus on local authorities to train their staff to ensure that as many risks as possible are eliminated.  However, it is impossible to eliminate all the risks all the time.  Galway County Council, for example, has responsibility for a large administrative area and it cannot possibly be responsible for every road and footpath.  There is a duty of care on everybody who uses the roads and green spaces to look after themselves.</P>
    <P>Children have lost out due to the compensation culture.  Many towns used to have playgrounds with roundabouts, swings and slides.  However, many local authorities have removed the mechanical play equipment because of the claims which have been taken against them.  Insurance companies required that playgrounds be inspected two to three times a day which is an impossibility. Local authorities had to remove the equipment to remove the risk.  However, the children have lost out.  This is an indication of how the compensation culture can affect the core of our society.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and I commend the Progressive Democrat Senators for putting it before the House.  I am sure the Minister of State will outline the actions which the Government will take to tackle the compensation culture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to put on record our distaste for <Col N="1204" /> what Senator Cox referred to as a growing menace. I compliment Senator Dardis and Senator Quill on their initiative in tabling the motion.  The compensation disease is not unique to Ireland &mdash; the madness is international.  If one wants to find out about malicious injury claims &mdash; the bizarre, unusual, extreme and downright cheeky &mdash; the Internet is the place to surf, if one has it.</P>
      <P>If one thought Ireland has a major dose of this disease, it is a country on the other side of the world which holds the unenviable record.  Australia, where &ldquo;no worries&rdquo; might be the unofficial motto, has become one of the fastest growing markets for law suits and compensation claims.  A study shows that Australian workers are costing employers millions of dollars in claims for mental stress.  I am concerned that in quoting some of these examples I will put ideas into the minds of those who are part of this compensation culture. Although they seem to have tried, and been successful at, every trick in the book, there are always new angles to this insidious practice.</P>
      <P>It seems that councils in Australia are protesting at a recent High Court ruling which appears to widen municipal liabilities, which is a major concern here.  A court ruled that a local council in Victoria was to blame for a chip shop fire because, although it issued a warning that the shop's fireplace was dangerous and should be repaired, it had not returned to make sure the work had been done.</P>
      <P>It gets better.  In Britain, a car thief has been granted legal aid to sue a local authority.  The 15 year old is claiming about £2,000 from Devon County Council for an incident in which he lost the little finger of his left hand.  He was 13 years old when he was held at the council's unit in Exeter after repeatedly taking cars without consent. He cannot be named for legal reasons, but he was recently arrested having absconded several times in the previous three months.  His mother said: &ldquo;On one occasion my son lost his temper and they put him in a cell and slammed the door on him, shutting it on his hand and taking his finger off&rdquo;.  I know some people would suggest that perhaps they should have taken off more than his finger, but I do not want to sound like a right-wing fascist.  One must at least acknowledge the pain the young man must have suffered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in Britain, High Court bailiffs have threatened to seize and sell off the Lord Mayor of Birmingham's chain of office and ceremonial mace because the city council did not pay compensation to a former employee.  The bailiffs were compiling an inventory of assets which could be seized to pay the £167,000 debt.  Council officials said the bailiffs priced the mayoral chain and mace, works of art, computers and other office equipment that could be sold.  They left only after Mr. Roger Burton, the Labour controlled council's finance director, signed a cheque.  A local councillor said it was the ultimate day of shame for a council that had become extremely lax at paying its bills.  However, it was the result of a mix-up in the accounts department and they have <Col N="1205" /> taken steps to ensure such an embarrassing episode does not happen again.  Senator Doyle can rest easy in the Mansion House.  Hopefully, the finance section of Dublin Corporation will cough up as, sadly, it has done in a number of cases and the mayoral chain will not be put at risk.</P>
    <P>Another case that is giving rise to concern here relates to the increasing desire of local authorities, particularly in large urban centres, to slow down traffic on &ldquo;rat runs&rdquo; in residential areas. An article headlined &ldquo;Bumps give motorists the hump&rdquo; described how motorists in Britain are claiming against local authorities for providing road humps.  Taxi and bus drivers have attempted to sue local authorities for back injuries they claim are caused by passing over the ramps.</P>
    <P>A recent payout of £35 to a man in Harringay in north London is believed to be the first of its kind.  His Volkswagen Polo was damaged by one of 35 road humps the council installed in streets around Archway Road, Highgate.  I was particularly interested in this case as I lived in Archway Road for several years when it was a nice leafy suburb.  The council has admitted that the 27 humps are in breach of Department of Transport regulations as they are too high.</P>
    <P>Road humps have been recently installed near where I stay in Dublin, in Serpentine Avenue in Ballsbridge, which seem to be exceptionally high. They are so close together that one would be better off walking from one end of the avenue to the other.  I do not know the purpose of the exercise because I do not believe traffic using the road travelled at a particularly fast speed.  However, somebody in the corporation decided to put them down.  I hope there will not be a rash of hump compensation claims as a result.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Library for providing most of this information.  As someone who represents the Library in this House, I take this opportunity to acknowledge the excellent work of my colleagues in the Library Association of Ireland, particularly in the House where many Members avail of the Library's services.  I raise these cases to add to the increasing and correctly vociferous opposition of right thinking people to the compensation culture.  John Healy, the western journalist, wrote a book called <i>Nobody Shouted Stop.</i>  It is time we shouted stop to this culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister should talk to those in the insurance industry, on whom he has been keeping a close eye for other reasons in the past 12 months.  It seems that below a certain amount of money, insurance companies are more inclined to settle rather than fight cases.  I will not embarrass the people involved, but I know of at least two spurious claims made in my local authority area. They were settled by the insurance company and the legal representatives of the plaintiff without the input of the local authority members.  There <Col N="1206" /> is a case to be answered and insurance companies should think twice before settling claims.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that local authorities are at last beginning to pool information.  Perhaps the Minister of State, given his responsibility for technology, can ensure that local authorities can interface with each other.  This should be done forthwith so they can immediately identify those who are obviously draining the system dry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I have had strong feelings about the compensation culture for a long time.  Who makes money from compensation? It is seldom the claimants.  In many cases, they go to a solicitor who advertises the A to Z on how to get money and if the claimants are short a few pounds, the solicitor will tell them to sign a letter and go to the bank to draw out money.  The claimants will then sign a letter giving authority to the solicitor to pay the bank when the claim comes through.  The bank gives out the money, the claimant spends it and the day the claim comes through the solicitor takes his or her expenses and pays the bank.  Very often there is not a bob left for the claimant.  Barristers, doctors, lawyers, consultants and experts make the money.</P>
      <P>Many cases are not settled before they go to court because claimants are advised they will get more money if they go to court.  However, on the day of the court hearing, the barristers run like sheep in a storm, hither and thither, advising clients to settle, because they do not have time to take all their cases.  They do not settle the day before because if a case is settled in court they will receive their fees.  This is a huge racket.</P>
      <P>In a recent case a taxi driver received £20,000, but there was an attempt to defraud up to £180,000 &mdash; a solicitor and a doctor were conspiring to produce the necessary documentation.  I congratulate the gardaí for checking out the case and bringing the man who received the money to court, but the judge ordered that the names of the doctor and the lawyer should not be read out. These were professionals who conspired to defraud and the judge defended them.  Should that be done in a court of law?  Surely they should have been exposed and brought before the court for fraudulent evidence and documentation.  Why were they not?  Was it because they wore the same school tie, they were friends or were from the privileged class?  Workers have gone to jail today over a simple issue but these two professionals did not, even though they specialised in giving documentation to prove that people were injured in car accidents, when in some cases they were not even passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time we introduced legislation in this area. In Rome the streets and sidewalks are cobbled, and there are huge holes, but no one makes a claim.  People here must take personal responsibility and it is time to draw a line between where that ends and public responsibility begins.  This has wider implications.  Local authorities would have far more money to spend on roads, water and sewerage if they did not have to spend millions <Col N="1207" /> on compensation cases.  The awards are only part of the bill, engineers have to survey accident scenes, make reports and give evidence in court.</P>
    <P>Insurance companies have played a big role in the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo; because they let it be known they will settle any case under £10,000 without difficulty.  Solicitors are telling people to make their cases and they will get money without going to court.  It is like winning the lottery or getting money from America.  All a person has to do is tell a lawyer that he or she fell and has a sore ankle.  One solicitor told me he did not know why people went to Lourdes because there were more miraculous cures in courthouses than ever happened there.  We see this every day of the week. People go into court on crutches and with neck collars, but a week later they are in the disco as if they came back from Tír na nÓg.</P>
    <P>It is high time people spoke out because it is ordinary punters who have to pay.  Some young people cannot get car insurance and the latest trend is to blame young men for all the accidents. Some of them may be responsible, but a higher percentage of older people are to blame.  I am annoyed at how young people are being targeted because there are many good youngsters.  They are being blamed for everything, including drugs, when only a small percentage of them are involved in that.  It is popular and fashionable to make outlandish statements about them.  The reason young people cannot get insurance is that older people are robbing the kitty by making false claims.</P>
    <P>When I was in the garage business in the sixties, the first thing people did after an accident was thank God no one was injured.  A garda would tell those involved they would both be summonsed if they did not settle the case between them, and it was done without courts or compensation.  In the fifties I bought my first car for £25 and taxed and insured it for £20, but no one could do that now.  People must take the veils from their eyes and speak out, particularly the youth because they are the real sufferers.  If they have to pay up to £2,000 for insurance now, what will they pay in a few years' time?</P>
    <P>It is time a few rules were introduced.  No one should receive a big lump sum in compensation. A person who is badly injured should receive money to cope with the disability and a weekly amount of compensation for life, which should be assessed and raised with inflation, but not a lump sum of £1 million.  Whiplash awards should be abolished.  Headrests were put into cars to get rid of it.  Spurious claims should be punished.  In a recent case, a man who received a spurious award of £20,000 had to pay back only £5,000 because he said that was all he could afford.  Who met the rest of the bill?  We must come to grips with the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo; and I appeal to the Minister to introduce stern rules and regulations to put an end to it, because it is destroying the country and destroying lives, particularly for young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the content of the motion and, in part, the amendment, the compensation culture is rampant.  When we refer to this culture we must recognise that there are people who have been injured, maimed or crippled whose claims are genuine.  On this week's &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; a person who stated that he represented the insurance companies asserted that quite a number of claims are settled out of court because the insurance companies believe that is the way it should be, in other words, if these claims went to court they would be lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong that an insurance company should settle out of court without giving notice to the insured person or organisation.  Such settlements point the finger at that person or organisation and states that they were guilty of negligence in some shape or form.  That type of behaviour on the part of an <Col N="1209" /> insurance company proves that the insured person is guilty of negligence and was at fault without that person having the opportunity to put their case in court.  That is wrong.  Every claim should go before the courts and both sides of the story should be heard.  Senator Coghlan and I serve on a committee &mdash; I cannot name it for obvious reasons &mdash; which was sued for damages and the insurance company involved wanted to settle out of court.  That meant that the committee was responsible and that it was negligent; that was wrong.</P>
    <P>As other speakers stated, recent newspaper reports regarding the number of claims being brought against local authorities are unbelievable. I accept that these may be small claims but should county councils be held responsible for potholes, stones on the road, trees that fall down during storms or for people who fall over and twist their ankles?</P>
    <P>Members would be amazed at the level of compensation paid out in respect of trivial claims that reach the courts.  When a claim goes to court, the fees charged by people who are called in as expert witnesses by insurance companies and by judges are enormous.  I read a newspaper article yesterday which stated that if a judge believes a person is an expert in a particular field that person will be called as a witness to give his or her view on the rights or wrongs of a case.  Doctors, architects and members of other professions, who are supposed to be experts, are often called into court as witnesses.  I accept that they may be experts but the cost involved in bringing three such witnesses into court for one day would amount to over £1,000.  That is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry disagrees but how can a doctor called on as an expert witness attest to a person's fitness prior to or their level of pain after an accident? It must be established whether a person's level of pain, deafness, etc., existed before an accident.  When the House debated hearing impairment claims in the Army a number of months ago I stated that I suffer from deafness, a fact of which Members are aware.  I have no hearing in my left ear and I am obliged to use headphones to hear other Members' contributions clearly.  What my colleagues may not know is that I was a member of the FCÁ.  I fired many shots and heard many loud noises and I could put in a claim for damages.  However, as I stated when the debate on hearing impairment took place, neither my mother nor my sister were members of the FCÁ but suffered with the same hearing problem. It would be easy for me to concoct a claim for compensation.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.  I hope that the aspirations it contains will be implemented by the Government in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">

      <P>I remind Senator Fitzgerald that a doctor cannot initiate a claim by a plaintiff, who must approach a solicitor before anything can be written about them.

      <P>As with the Seanad, Senator Fitzgerald is keeping a close eye on the courts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the recent development whereby expert witness reports are exchanged before cases come to court because unusual evidence cannot be sprung upon a person on the day of a hearing. I agree that there are difficulties in respect of doctors' reports, which are supposed to be objective. As I stated on Second Stage of the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, some doctors favour working on behalf of insurance companies while others work for plaintiffs.  Doctors must be objective and they do not know the state of health of a plaintiff before they appear in court.</P>
      <P>I agree with the last part of the motion which refers to providing a framework for the calculation of damages.  I have only ever had to go to court as an expert witness, but if one visits the courts it is astonishing to see the lack of notice given to scientific evidence.  If the plaintiff and his wife seem to be decent people, this often weighs more than scientific facts and measurements.  I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, had time to read any deafness cases carefully but this was particularly striking in some of them.  I took a lot of notice of what was said in the Green Book and everything possible was done to go along with accepted international practice. However much seemed to hinge on the judge's opinion of the plaintiff and perhaps the statement by the plaintiff's wife about his hearing difficulty rather than objective audiometer tests.  That is rather depressing.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, I said that doctors in Ireland were four times more likely to be sued than doctors in the United Kingdom.  Also the damages awarded here for similar injuries are approximately four times as high, and not just compared to the United Kingdom.  On a European scale we grant very high damages, particularly for pain and suffering.  In many countries pain and suffering are not taken into account.  It is important that we address this.  There is a wide disparity between awards by different judges.  In the deafness cases they vary from about £3,500 to £80,000 for what appears &mdash; from a distance, I was not at the court cases &mdash; to be the same type of injury.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald pointed out that he is deaf. We are all getting deafer.  As one gets older, one gets deafer.  When the aging process is taken into account, awards for deafness could be astronomical. People could be awarded damages for something which happens naturally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People thought that with juries no longer assessing damages and judges making awards, the <Col N="1211" /> awards would be lower, but they are not.  I wish the media would report the number of cases which fail and those which win small awards because this is important.  Cases which win huge awards are reported and people are inclined to think it is a soft way of getting money.  If one has a genuine case it is not.  If someone has had a serious injury an adversarial case in court is very hard on him.</P>

      <P>I was delighted to hear Senator Tom Fitzgerald say there was not much difference between the motion and the amendment. There is a difference &mdash; it is slightly different to exhort on one hand and condemn on the other. However I feel I could support both the motion and the amendment.  Seanad Éireann could exhort the Government to take effective steps and as a preliminary to that it might be no harm to condemn the Government for not having done so already.  There is a slight logical connection which the Government side might take on board and incorporate into the motion.  The motion and the amendment are not incompatible.</P>
      <P>A compensation culture exists.  Earlier we discussed the carnage on the roads and road safety but there is also a drink driving culture.  On the Order of Business we discussed the issue of the banks.  There is a white collar crime culture too. In an insidious fashion a blind eye is turned towards certain types of behaviour and activity. Compensation has pervaded the country, as has drunk driving and the manner with which it is dealt.  White collar crime in financial institutions has been allowed without any effective sanctions. We have cultures in this country which are perhaps part of what we are and the manner in which we have developed as a society.  Many sacred cows have not been questioned.  We have allowed such things to infiltrate and permeate the life and institutions of our society.</P>
      <P>We were told that juries were the problem in personal injury claims as they were granting enormous damages and that when they were abolished the problem would be solved.  They were abolished but nothing happened.  The same level of damages is being handed out by judges as in the past.  Perhaps it comes down to issuing sentencing guidelines for judges, which we touched on earlier.  Having abolished juries we did not provide a structure, framework or guidelines for the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>I am glad the last part of the motion and the amendment provide a framework for the calculation of damages.  The Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, has attempted to do this in relation to the Army deafness claims.  I hope he is successful in providing a rational framework and structure for different types and categories.  I believe he is.  We must do that for the Judiciary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas the Judiciary must be aware of the context in which they operate when they hand out sentences which seem to be out of line with other offences.  A minor larceny offence received an enormous prison sentence and a sentence <Col N="1212" /> relating to a fatality resulting from drink driving was quashed.  All this should be addressed.  If it had been addressed when the jury system were abolished, perhaps we would have more to show now.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to Dublin Corporation and quoted the huge sum spent annually on compensation claims.  There is no doubt this is causing a major problem for local authorities.  However there is another side.  As in the Army deafness cases, there is a duty of care and there are cases of negligence.  The Army deafness cases would not have occurred if there had not been major negligence on the part of the authorities over many decades.  We must balance this before we cut loose on those seeking compensation.</P>
    <P>There are some very valid claims for compensation. On any day in Dublin there is a street being dug up by a local public utility.  There are currently 14 Telecom companies in Ireland and all of them are looking to install equipment in ducts and pipes under pavements.  Many subcontractors operate and, as far as I can gather in dealing with many residents' complaints, they are not made aware of local authority by-laws on permitted hours of work and noise levels.  However the main problem is that after the street is dug up, tarmacadam is used to repair the pavement.  This means there is a concrete pavement with lumpy and bumpy tarmacadam which results in pools of water and hazards.  A person walking on a street, particularly in the winter and at night could very easily trip and seriously injure themselves.  This situation is getting worse as there are more utilities digging up the streets now than there were ten years ago and that could mean that the number of compensation claims will also increase.  I do not see why any utility which has finished digging up a street, even if it is the local authority, cannot immediately put in place a covering or surface to the same standard that was in place prior to the street being dug up.  This should be part of the work of any utility.  If one team is digging up a road, that team or a follow-up team should replace the surface.  This would reduce a very large proportion of compensation claims taken against local authorities.</P>
    <P>Local authorities also suffer a lot.  For example, we have had to close down virtually all the play centres or playgrounds in Dublin because we cannot allow children to play there as Dublin corporation is not in a position to provide sufficient staff to undertake the supervisory role that would satisfy insurance claims which amount to huge sums.  Ten or 11 playgrounds in the city are now closed and children living in those areas are unable to use them because we cannot insure them.  Everyone in terms of the community at large is losing out because this is happening and it behoves us to take steps to improve the situation.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Progressive Democratics Party has tabled this motion and I hope it is taken on board.  I understand there is work afoot in relation to the matter.  I support the amendment but I would like to put more emphasis on the proactive side.  In other words, we <Col N="1213" /> should try to get our house in order in relation to this matter; we can condemn doctors, lawyers, consultants, experts, insurance people, etc.  until the cows come home, but measures need to be taken and we are the people who should be taking the initiative to ensure that proper measures are put in place.</P>

      <P>Tá mé lánsásta an deis seo a bheith agam freagra oifigúil a thabhairt ar an rún an-tábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful for the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the important issues being discussed this evening.  While some of these issues are outside my remit, which covers insurance costs, I propose to respond in some measure to the wider issues raised.</P>
      <P>The system of compensation for personal injury which we operate in Ireland could be described as reflecting a &ldquo;claim and blame&rdquo; culture. It is grounded in the law of tort which entitles the individual to seek monetary compensation for damage to person or property caused by the acts of another and has been validated by the courts' recognition of the constitutional right of the individual to bodily integrity.  This compensation system is underpinned by the capacity of the insurance industry to indemnify tortfeasors against liability for damage and personal injury over a wide spectrum including employers, occupiers, producers, motorists and the professions.</P>
      <P>Given the adversarial nature of the tort system, the cost of establishing or contesting claims is high, particularly in terms of legal costs and the expenses of expert witnesses.  The high settlement costs of claims are reflected in the levels of premiums being charged by the insurance industry. Successive Governments have sought to contain the rising cost of insurance premiums while recognising that, for prudential reasons, insurers must be free to set their premium rates based on their claims experience in order to ensure that the projected level of future claims costs can be met.</P>
      <P>In 1995, a major indepth consultancy study by Deloitte and Touche of insurance costs in Ireland was commissioned by my Department to identify the key factors contributing to high insurance costs, to evaluate their economic impact and to make recommendations aimed at reducing these costs.  The consultants' 1996 report found that the main contributory factors in rising premium costs were the high legal costs component of small claim settlements, the faster rate of medical cost inflation and the high level of general damages awards relative to special damages in smaller claims.  The consultants also found, based on a survey of about 500 small and medium size enterprises, that the economic impact of high employers and public liability premiums fell on small firms which were categorised, in general, by insurers as high risk in not having sophisticated risk management systems in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the consultants' report and recommendations, a special working group was established under the aegis of my Department with <Col N="1214" /> two substantive terms of reference &mdash; first, to advise on the establishment of a personal injuries tribunal and, second, to examine alternative systems of personal injury compensation in operation in other jurisdictions.  The special working group completed the first part of its remit and recommended a structure for a voluntary mediation system for occupational injuries which could be operated within the reformed courts system. The working group is currently proceeding with the second phase of its remit.  Given the wideranging and detailed nature of the examination of alternative compensation systems I will expect the special working group's report in mid-1999. However, I would caution in advance against the expectation that no-fault systems in operation elsewhere offer a more cost effective alternative to our own insurance based compensation system. There is a wide variation in no-fault systems with the State operated welfare based system in New Zealand at one extreme and the mix of no-fault and tort systems in operation in some States of the USA at the other.  A social welfare approach to compensating accident victims for loss of income, medical expenses, etc., could generate a dependency culture and increase the claims burden on the State as has been the experience in New Zealand.  On the other hand, the experience in the United States has been that the no-fault monetary compensation threshold has been diluted by litigants' stratagems to enable them to pursue their claims in tort.</P>
    <P>There is no single quick-fix solution to the matters raised by the Senators this evening.  As a society we should examine our own values with regard to our expectations of what we regard as adequate levels of compensation as accident victims and what we are prepared to pay as motorists, employers, etc.  in terms of insurance premiums to meet those levels of compensation.  The general public, the insurance industry, the legal profession, trade unions as well as employers, employees and their representative organisations all have a role to play in tackling the many problems of high claims costs.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments, including the present Government, have endeavoured to address these issues through a variety of measures, both legislative and administrative, including the establishment of the Health and Safety Authority, road traffic legislation dealing with drink driving and various other road safety enforcement issues, increase in jurisdiction of the courts for adjudicating claims, the enactment of the Courts and Courts Officers Act and the enactment of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>At a public gathering and press conference held in Dublin in June of this year I was delighted to formally launch the voluntary code adopted by the Initiative on Workplace Safety Group established in May 1996.  Under the chairmanship of IBEC, the group represents the key players in the area of accident prevention and claims mitigation and includes representatives from my Department, ICTU, the Health and Safety Authority <Col N="1215" /> and IBEC.  I understand that regional launches of the code are to begin in Cork tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The group has developed some of the themes referred to in the Deloitte and Touche report in the areas of accident prevention, responsibility for health and safety issues, training and a special approach for SMEs.  The group has adopted a twin-track approach &mdash; health and safety and accident prevention, on the one hand, and the compensation process on the other hand.</P>
    <P>The code of practice has been agreed between IBEC and ICTU and has the support of the Irish Insurance Federation.  The proposed code provides for agreement between employers and employees on actions without prejudice in the event of an accident occurring in the workplace. It is proposed, for example, that all necessary fees/medical costs be borne by the employer whose best endeavours will be pursued to find an internal settlement among the parties without recourse to the courts.  The object is to have in place a set of agreed steps to be followed through by agreement where injury or accidents occur in the workplace.  This approach, by working from management to shop floor level, will inculcate a new partnership approach to health and safety in the workplace and provide a fruitful climate for voluntary mediation of claims.</P>
    <P>In relation to local authorities and semi-State bodies, reduced public liability insurance costs have been achieved through a combination of safety training, reform of work practices and vigorous challenging of dubious claims.  I want to salute many local authorities throughout the country which have appointed key officials to deal on a permanent basis with dubious claims.  This has helped reduce insurance premia.  I congratulate everybody involved in this initiative which I hope will be extended to all local authorities.</P>
    <P>I understand that strenuous efforts have been made on the part of Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Company and the local authorities themselves in identifying potential accident zones and by aggressive defence of claims in court. Special units in, for example, Cork Corporation have managed to wipe out &ldquo;fraud rings&rdquo; and have generally made it more difficult for the fraudsters.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry itself has established Insurance Link, a claims matching computer database which helps insurers identify possible fraudulent claims.  Details of claims are entered into the system and a programme is run to identify any &ldquo;matches&rdquo;&mdash; for example, if the claimant has made multiple claims or if there are any similarities between claims.  While matches do not necessarily imply that fraud has taken place, they will alert the insurer to take a closer look at the claims involved.  All claims involving personal injury in motor accidents, employer's and public liability insurance, as well as written-off vehicles, household, personal accident and travel insurance are run through the Insurance Link system.</P>
    <P>Insurance Link has been in operation since 1990 and it is estimated that in the first six years of operation, it netted participating insurance <Col N="1216" /> companies over £1.34 million in savings.  The number of cases under investigation has been steadily rising.  In the period to the end of March 1996, there were 563 cases under investigation as a result of the Insurance Link system.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the position of proprietors of recreational and tourist facilities, landowners and owners of premises was strengthened by the enactment in July 1995 by the Oireachtas of the Occupiers Liability Act, 1995. The Act obliges the occupier to take reasonable precautions for the safety of recreational users and visitors.  The provisions of the Act address many of the concerns of those engaged in tourism and in the admittance of the public to their premises. It lessens their potential exposure to public liability claims by modifying the previous onerous common law duty of care owed to visitors, recreational users and trespassers.  It is expected that this legislation will, in the course of time, have a downward impact on the cost of claims and on liability premiums.  In drawing up the Bill, a wide consultative process was engaged in at the time by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Indeed, members of the farming community had a particular input into its provisions and I understand that it was found possible to accommodate many of their concerns.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the provision of a statutory framework for the calculation of damages has recently been effected in relation to Army deafness claims.  This particular framework is the Green Book system of measuring hearing loss which was drawn up by a committee of experts.  As Senators will also be aware, the application of the Green Book principles in the determination of damages awards in any particular case is regarded by the Judiciary as a matter for the courts.  I would also point out that, in the Deloitte and Touche report on insurance costs, the consultants recommended that the Judiciary should be respectfully requested to draw up guidelines for general damages awards in personal injury cases which would be appropriate in the context of Irish tradition and case law.</P>
    <P>The Senators will know that much controversy and debate surrounds the question of advertising by solicitors in respect of personal injury compensation. The Law Society has modified its rules in that regard and, as Senators will recall, my Government colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, introduced the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998, in this House recently.  The Bill, which I understand has the support of the Law Society, provides a clear statutory framework which will ensure that solicitors' advertising will be balanced while, at the same time, geared towards informing the public of the range of services provided by the profession.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the Senators for giving me, as Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for Commerce, with responsibility for insurance, the opportunity to address key issues affecting the level of compensation claims <Col N="1217" /> cost and to apprise the House of the progress being made in my area in seeking to reduce the burden of insurance costs on our growing national economy.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I established a revamped Motor Insurance Advisory Body of 17 members taken from the motor insurance area, the insurance area itself and the legal area to see what we can do to reach a consensus on how we can achieve a reasonable, rational and practical application of costing of premia for young drivers in particular and to see if we can reduce the cost of those premia for all motorists across the country. It is a reflection on society that today there are 50,000 people driving without insurance cover and that they cost on average £25 million per annum to the nation, to the people who pay insurance and to the taxpayer.  This affects the bona fide genuine decent people who pay their insurance premia on time, accept their loadings if there are loadings and make their contribution. As a result of all that, the insurance companies make their contribution to creating the fund which creates the Motor Insurance Advisory Board.  This is indicative of the society in which we live.  It is a bad reflection on us.  We, as public representatives and Members of the national Parliament, must ensure that we work together and give leadership and that we have a collective attitude that we abhor this type of situation.</P>
    <P>The Government has set up a committee involving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, the Minister for Finance, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and me to work together with our officials to ensure that all agencies and organs of the State operate with unity of purpose, that the laws are implemented and that we minimise and eliminate the possibility of people who are operating outside the law.  These people are making a major contribution to the disastrous situation which imposes such a terrible burden on society in general, individual citizens and decent consumers who pay their way.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to have had this opportunity to speak on this important topic.  I congratulate Senator Dardis for tabling this motion and I thank all who spoke so sincerely and openly on this important, difficult and complex area.  Ireland is a small open economy with a small population and a small revenue base.  Unless there are strict parameters and criteria within which we all behave as individuals within society, then the cost of living in this society will be greater than at present.  We, as public representatives, must create the legislative structure by way of primary and secondary legislation which will make all of us better citizens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for dealing with the motion, for the proposals which he brought before the House and for the enunciation of the measures which have been introduced over recent years.  I also thank all who contributed to the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a general consensus among Members that this culture exists, that it must be <Col N="1218" /> dealt with and that it is for the Oireachtas to find ways of dealing with it.  The Minister made a good point at the end of his speech when he spoke of the defects in society.  Many of the problems we experience in this area are because of the defects of modern society.  It is for the law to deal with those defects, and making laws is our job.</P>
    <P>Another important point made by Senator Costello, was that nobody denies that people who have had serious injuries and who genuinely have been hurt, should be compensated.  Nobody would say otherwise.</P>
    <P>One of the characteristics of modern society is that people are prepared to go to court and lie; 30 or 40 years ago that would have been incomprehensible. Certainly, people of our parents' generation could not even contemplate somebody being prepared to lie under oath, but it is evident that now some citizens are prepared to lie under oath.</P>
    <P>We have come up with quite a few good practical recommendations; Senator Coghlan made several.  The amendment of the statute of limitations could be looked at as could the setting up of a personal injuries compensation.  The whole presentation of fraudulent cases and the resistance which needs to be applied in that area requires examination.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties perceived in many quarters is that the courts or the insurance industry are a soft touch.  That is part of the fundamental problem here.  The Minister of State alluded to cases where local authorities have taken on expert officials to deal with dubious claims.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of employing private detectives.  A publican in my local town had a claim from somebody who alleged he fell down the stairs and injured himself.  The publican employed a private detective who found the claimant playing football, which put paid to the claim.  More of that could be done.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, the published tables of costs and fees payable to expert witnesses in the Four Courts, need to be considered.  Instinctively each group defends itself.  Account must be taken of the fact that there are good and bad doctors, lawyers, politicians and judges.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox made a good point about the responsibilities of insurance companies.  Settling because of the financial benefit in so doing and ignoring the moral imperative in contesting a case is regrettable.  Senator Farrell also spoke a lot of common sense; he always does.</P>
    <P>There are establishments at work, for example in law and politics, which tend to be self-protecting and not to see the mote in their own eye. There is also a culture of greed in certain quarters, which it is our duty as legislators to resist.  I welcome the remarks by the Minister of State on the special working group and I look forward to its report.</P>
    <P>The Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995, was a major step forward.  As a landowner I can confirm that it greatly clarified matters.  The position of trespassers who trip over a harrow in the corner of a field has changed fundamentally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1219" /> It is unfortunate that sporting bodies are totally restricted by the level of claims which are made. I am a trustee of an angling club and a rugby club. At each AGM I must ask to see the insurance policy because if it is not in order there is a contingent liability on the trustees of the club.  It is unfortunate that should be the case.  Of course there is a duty of care on clubs, who have a responsibility to look after their members and visitors to their grounds or if they are fishing on their waters.  However, it is wrong that individuals who are prepared to become involved in a voluntary organisation might find themselves having to bear significant costs because of their voluntary efforts.</P>
    <P>I have raised the matter of playgrounds several times at meetings of Kildare County Council. Senator Cox and Senator Costello also alluded to this.  It is wrong that local authorities, who want to provide playground facilities for children, especially in disadvantaged areas, are unable to do so because there may be a very significant public liability claim against them.  Something needs to be done urgently about this.</P>
    <P>The question of feasance and non-feasance can arise when people who are public spirited enough to try to improve their locality by, for example, making an effort to repair a pothole outside their gate or adjacent to their property, find themselves liable.  That is crazy and something needs to be done about it.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and I look forward to initiatives which will help to alleviate this problem.  When we next look at this matter I hope progress will have been made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I address myself through the Minister's representative to the Minister because, while I do not dispute the intellectual calibre of the Minister of State, I would like if this material would be made directly available to the Minister.</P>
      <P>As in all new enterprises there are difficulties.</P>
      <P>In September 1997 a board meeting of the Adelaide Hospital was told there would be a ten year bedding down period for the whole hospital. That indicates they realised they were to some extent moving into uncharted territory.  The same happened disastrously, in some ways financially, with the Channel Tunnel which went into enormous overruns which complicated the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been overruns in the Adelaide Hospital.  However, a question I would address to the Minister is whether these overruns were due to folly in budgetary procedures by the hospital <Col N="1220" /> or because it was underfunded from the beginning. Even at the moment when we welcomed the commitment and support of the Government to the hospital I was supplied with detailed figures which suggested there was a strong possibility that there would be underfunding.  I predicted we would be back in this House looking for extra funding before the project was under way much further.</P>
    <P>There was an allocation this year of £57 million. The requested budgetary requirement is £67 million so there is a clear shortfall here.  The anticipated overrun for the year carries various estimates, from £8 million to £15 million to £20 million.  The reasons for these are multiple.  The three clearest are, first, the fact that the cost of moving was greater than anticipated.  This is a common feature of this kind of operation; second, there were commissioning costs attaching to the hospital, and, third, there were sums for additional equipment.  The first two are non recurrent items of expenditure and they have been incurred.  That is an important point.  It is necessary that the hospital be in a position to discharge its debt and liabilities in these areas.</P>
    <P>The expense of running the new hospital has proved to be much greater than running the three base hospitals, and will continue to be so.  Its operational costs are higher.  When I discovered this it struck me at first as rather curious because the lay person would assume that if one amalgamates three separate units into one large unit one gets greater efficiency, greater concentration of resources and one does not need duplication of expensive plant and equipment.  One would also assume there was an economic argument to indicate it should be less expensive to run such an institution.  Apparently this is not the case and it is something which Deloitte and Touche will presumably investigate.  It will be very useful to find out if they can give further specific reasons for this, although I understand that some of the reasons are increased security, the ward structures and so on.</P>
    <P>The practical experience of this merger indicates that the attempted merger in the early 1960s between Trinity College and UCD might have also been rather problematical.  It was presented as a cost cutting exercise.  Now, with this sophisticated move, it is being learned that it is not always the case that merging smaller institutions into a larger one saves money.</P>
    <P>The hospital now has a different and huge catchment area.  I hope the Minister of State can assure the House that the instructions to Deloitte and Touche are not merely to whip the Adelaide Hospital into line.  Reading the answer to the question tabled by Deputy Shatter in the Dáil, it appears the Minister examined the situation and told them to cut their cloth to suit their measure. They were to keep within the budget regardless and were to revise operational plans accordingly. I am not sure this is a good idea.  We should keep an open mind as to the cause of the overrun.  Was it underfunding, management error or a combination of the two?  I assume the exercise of Deloitte and Touche will determine this.  It is <Col N="1221" /> important its report be made available to the hospital and to the House.  Will the Minister give an undertaking this will happen?</P>
    <P>A previous report was commissioned by the Minister and Mr. Leslie Buckley and Mr. Tom McCarthy were sent to the hospital earlier this year before it opened to examine the situation.  I presume the Department received the report, so can it be made available?  Is it true that the suggestions, of which I have been apprised, are favourable to the hospital budgetary position? The bottom line is that the hospital must be strongly supported and must continue to function.</P>
    <P>There is apprehension.  In a letter dated Wednesday, 21 October 1998, in the newsletter of the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, <i>Pulses,</i> Mrs. Rosemary French, chairman of the hospital, indicated she was aware there were rumours circulating and wanted to put people's minds at rest.  She said:</P>
    <P>Figures in recent newspaper reports regarding how much money the Hospital needs are not official figures.  The exact figure has yet to be determined.  [This presumably is part of the exercise of Deloitte and Touche.  ]</P>
    <P>As you know, before we opened, many costs arose in preparing this Hospital for patients and for staff.  Also, closing and moving the base hospitals to Tallaght was a huge task, and not least in financial terms.  In addition, running costs are higher here than they were between the three base hospitals because it is a larger site with bigger cleaning, security, etc., bills.</P>
    <P>I believe the expense to be justified and I hope to have time later to put on record the strongly positive attitudes of both medical staff and patients to the high standards of facilities, to the fact that it is wheelchair friendly and to the existence of ordinary human aspects, such as the intrusion of sunlight into a room.  People do not feel they are in a corner.  Every room has its view. There is a garden which can be enjoyed by people, even though they are ill.  Although they are expensive, they are well worth having and will certainly make patients feel better.  Mrs. French further stated:</P>
    <P>These costs are being examined and allocated to either the Hospital or to the Tallaght Hospital Planning Board.  When it has been decided who should pay each of these costs, we will then know the extent of any over-spend by the Hospital.</P>
    <P>The Adelaide has the site in Peter Street and questions have been asked whether this should be realised to make good the shortfall.  That is an understandable view of the Minister's but I understand it was already examined and undertakings given that it would not happen.  It is important the Adelaide, having realised the value of the site, should have it as a contingency fund to continue to upgrade the medical services of the hospital.  Otherwise, there will be an absolute dependency later on the Department.  Mrs. French further stated:</P>
    <P>Deloitte &amp; Touche are reviewing the <Col N="1222" /> Hospital's financial situation with a facilitation group from our Hospital and the Department of Health &amp; Children.  We expect their report by the end of next week.  Three of our Board members, Cllr Gerry Brady, Mr Salters Sterling and Prof David McConnell, are representing the Hospital.</P>
    <P>Gerry Brady was a colleague in the Lower House; I know Salters Sterling from Trinity.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Times</i> of 23 October 1996, concern was already being expressed about facilities, that there may be a reduction in the number of beds and that there may be a little cheese paring.  Indicating the type of problems experienced in the move, the headline in the <i>Irish Times</i> of 2 June 1998 read &ldquo;Senior doctors may seek £700,000 for Tallaght move&rdquo; because of inroads into their consultancy base, etc.  Not only anaesthetists, surgeons and other high earners but also some of the other staff put in claims for disturbance money for movement, etc.  There were the usual teething troubles: rooms were built to an incorrect design and operating theatres had to be demolished and rebuilt.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to put on record the positive side I mentioned earlier.  Another headline in the series of articles read: &ldquo;Move from &rsquo;black hole of Calcutta&rsquo; is popular&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>Dr Des O'Neill was succinct in his description of the ward where he used to treat elderly patients before the move to Tallaght Hospital. &ldquo;It was like the black hole of Calcutta,&rdquo; he said of the ward in the Meath Hospital.</P>
    <P>Speaking of the new conditions, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is phenomenally better.  There is more space, it is brighter, the therapy rooms are wonderful and the garden is already a big hit with the patients,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was well worth spending the money to give citizens who are ill, unwell or feeling miserable a lift by giving them decent surroundings.</P>
    <P>Although these are large sums of money and one cannot always assume the Celtic tiger will have a back strong enough to carry the demands placed upon it, as always with such big projects, there is a spin-off for the local community, which is a second positive aspect.  Tallaght has traditionally appeared or been presented as a depressed area although it is a beautiful location.</P>

      <P>I am temporarily bereft of words. It is worthwhile noting that up to 2,000 jobs will be created through the hospital in the Tallaght area.  That is important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking into account that hospitals such as St. James's, have operating budgets of £67 million, the requirements of the Adelaide are reasonable and I hope the Minister looks upon them favourably. The most important thing is that the hospital should be assisted to function in the interests of citizens in its new role of serving this huge catchment area. <Col N="1223" /></P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital decided in November last year that it would open the new hospital at Tallaght on 21 June this year.  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, was glad when the board of management informed him of this, and due allowance was made for the move in finalising the determination of the hospital's revenue funding for 1998.</P>
      <P>In addition to the capital funding to cover the building, equipment and information technology needs of the new hospital, the Department provided funds in recent years to the base hospitals involved in the transfer to Tallaght to allow them prepare in advance for the move.  This year's revenue determination to the hospital is £53.659 million, which includes an additional £5.9 million on the funding given to the base hospitals for their non-Tallaght related activity in 1997.  The hospital has received Exchequer funding of £8.7 million since 1996 to facilitate the opening at Tallaght on 21 June.  In addition to the £53.659 million stated above, £3.7 million has been provided to the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, the bulk of which is related to the Adelaide and Meath Hospital, Dublin, incorporating the National Children's Hospital.  This brings the total to £57.4 million revenue funding for the year.</P>
      <P>As the Senator will understand, some of the funding is provided on the basis of a six month cost as the move to Tallaght only took place half way through the year. The hospital was not expected to fund any of the industrial relations costs associated with the move to Tallaght from the above amount of £57.4 million.  Additional funding of £2 million was also provided by the Department for this, as has been alluded to already by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware of the level of support provided by the Department in recent years, both financial and non-financial, which the Department and other health agencies in Dublin gave to the move to Tallaght.  I wish to state on the record again the Minister, Deputy Cowen's, appreciation of the support given by the Eastern Health Board, the other major acute Dublin hospitals, the Tallaght Hospital board and the trade unions.  He is particularly grateful for the enormous effort made by the staff of the hospital at all levels to ensure the smooth and safe transfer of patients and services to the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the board of management of the hospital confirmed to the Department that there are difficulties facing it with regard to its budget. These difficulties are of a much greater degree <Col N="1224" /> than it had envisaged when it submitted its service plan in April of this year.</P>
    <P>It is vital to note that the original financial plan submitted by the hospital to the Department in January, almost two months after the allocation was notified to it, gave no indication whatsoever of severe financial difficulties.  At that stage, the hospital's budget indicated a potential overspend of approximately £900,000 and the hospital management undertook to take the necessary corrective action.</P>
    <P>The hospital reported a major deficit of £2.4 million in its revenue costs for the month of July alone this year and it is projecting that a significant element of this will be recurring for the remainder of the year.</P>
    <P>The Minister is extremely concerned at the degree of the hospital's projected deficit for 1998, which has been presented, and the reasons given for the overrun.  With the agreement of the board of management, he initiated a review to be carried out by consultants Deloitte and Touche. They were able to commence their work very quickly and they plan that the review will be completed within three to four weeks.</P>
    <P>This review is concerned with the arrangements for service planning and budgetary matters. I am glad to say that the hospital is co-operating fully with the review and the Minister will make available the report and any recommendations to the board of management of the hospital, as has been requested by the Senator.</P>
    <P>The Department will have further discussions regarding this serious situation which has developed with the hospital's board of management when the Deloitte and Touche report comes to hand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I have a strong feeling that there is no point in budgeting on an historical basis.  The hospital needs a rolling budget.  I hope Deloitte and Touche will not be confined simply to investigating a very narrow area but that they will look at the appropriateness of the budgetary parameters set by the Minister as well as looking at the reality of the situation.  The hospital is still not fully functional; even at this expense, only seven out of 12 theatres are working.  There were 11 in the old hospital.  Perhaps the Minister of State will consider those points.</P>
