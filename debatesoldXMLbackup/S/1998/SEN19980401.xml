      <P>I have notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to request the British Government to restore parity of esteem between the degrees awarded by the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians in the United Kingdom and in Ireland, in view of the efforts being made by the Government to establish North-South and east-west bodies on these islands, with health being one of the designated areas.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 1, 2, 3 and item 16, motion 19.  All Stages of item 1 to be taken today, with a debate on items 2 and 3 to be taken in conjunction with the Second Stage of item 1.  The contributions of spokespersons on item 1 not to exceed 30 minutes, all other Senators 15 minutes, and Senators may share time.  Item 16, motion 19, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and business to be interrupted from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Item 5, which will be debated tomorrow, includes statements on the importance of the Santer proposals for Irish agriculture, etc., could not come at a more opportune time because these proposals were discussed by the Council of Ministers yesterday.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Walsh, informed the Council of the Irish position on those proposals.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Agriculture to be present in this House for the debate tomorrow?  Since last September we have had a lot debate on the agriculture and food industry here.  Unfortunately, we have only <Col N="1346" /> had a paucity of the Minister for Agriculture's and Food's time in terms of his attendance during these debates.  I would like if the Minister could attend when this debate starts tomorrow and, hopefully, be here when the debate finishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Independent group also agrees with the Order of Business.  I am glad there is a tentative provision of 30 minutes for the first speaker.  I would prefer an open ended debate on the Amsterdam Treaty because it is such a significant item.  At the same time the time allocation is as much as can be expected in the circumstances. I am sure people would not have abused an open ended debate if it had been granted.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the North?  I know this is a sensitive time but in the absence of such a debate will the Leader communicate, what I am sure is the sense of this House, the grave unease felt as a result of the UN report on police harassment of lawyers in the North.  It would be useful if a message was sent to Government that this House is deeply concerned about the issue.  I am also extremely worried by the implication that a distinguished lawyer, Mr. Pat Finucane, was set up and murdered with the assistance of some degree of official connivance. This is extremely worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to a notice in today's newspapers by the National Irish Bank that they have set up a freephone helpline for their customers.  I wonder, in the light of what has been happening in the last few weeks, if this is an April Fool's joke.</P>
      <P>On item No. 7 on the Order Paper is a motion for an independent assessment of the health affects of microwave transmitters.  This matter has also been raised by members on the Government side. There are daily reports in the newspapers of groups protesting about the siting of particular masts.  We seem to have apposite information in relation to new developments and their effects on health.  Perhaps the Leader of the House would permit us to have a debate on this &mdash; either by taking this motion or introducing one of his own &mdash; in an effort to quell people's fears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the statement made yesterday by Minister of State O'Dea that extra funding is to be provided for literacy provision. This is a vital provision which comes at a time when the problem of literacy has surfaced.  I ask the Leader to impress upon the Minister for Education and Science in the context of the Education Bill &mdash; and in an effort to make the Government's commitment more meaningful &mdash; the necessity to make funding available to all vocational education committees to employ a full-time literacy organiser.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating the Minister for Agriculture and Food on his very firm stand at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels <Col N="1347" /> regarding the proposed reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I was pleased that the IFA and the Minister are at one.  At least 12 months was wasted the last time with protestation and conflict between then Commissioner MacSharry and the IFA.  That was a terrible waste of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>It now seems that the National Irish Bank is not the only bank that has questions to answer to its customers.  The revelations made over the last couple of days would indicate that all other banks have a case to answer.  Will the Leader inquire as to whether the Director of Consumer Affairs could place an advertisement in the newspapers inviting submissions from the public on this matter.  This could be agreed with the relevant Minister.  We could then tease out what exactly has taken place, what overcharges have been made over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the Leader's concern and the geographical affect of radon on his constituency is it intended that we will have a debate on the issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on various funding schemes?  Farmers are concerned about their future.  A vast area of Border counties and the west have different funding allocations and these have been taken up by people who are not entitled to them.  That concern is highlighted by the fact that there is to be a review committee.  I do not wish to criticise the review committee but there is not one publicly elected representative from Europe on it; it is made up of civil servants.  I have no disrespect for or quibble with the efficiency of civil servants. This is a matter of concern to the public, who should be involved and represented.  I hope the Leader can arrange for an examination of the structures of the review committee to include an input from the public.  I hope the Leader can arrange for the Tánaiste to come to this House to discuss this matter and try to allay our fears in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader responded to a question raised by me yesterday in relation to the financial institutions saying we would have a debate on the matter after the Easter recess.  In the light of further revelations last night about the attitude of the major banks such as NIB to the regulatory or non-regulatory role of the Central Bank, I think it is imperative that we have this debate prior to the Easter recess.  I ask the Leader to communicate our views to the Minister for Finance and seek his attendance in the House to discuss <Col N="1348" /> this very important matter which affects the entire credibility of the whole banking system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Leader decided when we will have a debate &mdash; or more properly a question and answer type discussion like we had last week which worked extremely well in relation to the NIB situation &mdash; on the multimillion pound Year 2000 computer compliance problem and the implications for the public and Civil Service?  This is a very serious issue.  I realise an interdepartmental committee has been set up but we need to be reassured that we are on top of this problem, that we know the full extent of it and the plan the Government has to resolve it.  I ask the Leader &mdash; I know he has agreed to this in principle &mdash; if he could give an indication of when we will have a worthwhile discussion to tease out this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader consider holding a debate on road traffic in view of the fact that so many accidents are occurring?  Very tough laws have been introduced in this area and 90 per cent of motorists who are decent people are being unfairly persecuted and prosecuted.  I worry that more of these tough laws will be introduced unless we speak up about them.  Discussion is ongoing in relation to learner drivers.  How many learner drivers are involved in accidents?  Very often they are more careful than people who have passed their tests.  This matter needs to be teased out and we must look into how important driving tests are.  How many eight or ten year old cars are involved in accidents?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a move afoot to introduce more laws to completely cripple motorists. We should have a debate on what we think are the causes of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Norris made the point that this House should be very concerned about abuses of civil rights not just in the North of Ireland but elsewhere.  He is quite right.  He also made an important point in relation to the sensitivity of the negotiations at present.  For that reason I do not think it appropriate for us to have a debate now.  All we can do in the context of what is happening in the talks is to wish the Taoiseach well in his discussions this evening with the British Minister and hope they will be fruitful. We hope the proposals being put forward by the Chairman, Senator Mitchell, will find wide approval within the various groups represented and that that, in turn, will lead to a settlement. We must be encouraged by the fact that an opinion poll undertaken by one of the newspapers in Belfast has indicated a large level of support for an agreed settlement.  Even where there might not be universal support among the <Col N="1349" /> parties for that settlement, there was still an indication that there is a majority level of support for one.  We should be encouraged by that and the parties to the talks should bear that in mind in their discussions over the coming days.  We wish them well.</P>

      <P>Senators Connor and Finneran raised item 5 on the Order Paper for tomorrow, it was at the request from the Minister for Agriculture and Food that we will have this debate.  I agree with Senator Connor that it is timely.  I hope he will be able to attend as I had previously arranged the debate for yesterday but because he had to be elsewhere, I postponed it until tomorrow.</P>
      <P>I join Senators Norris and Dardis in wishing the Taoiseach well in the talks tonight and tomorrow and hope and pray there will be a settlement on the island once and for all.  I hope the Taoiseach will come into the House at the earliest opportunity for a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In relation to Senator Costello's call for a debate on the crisis in banking, I gave an assurance yesterday to Senators Manning and Doyle that there would be a discussion on the year 2000 bug and its consequences on the first sitting day after the Easter recess and, if possible, the question and answer session Senator Doyle has requested.  In response to Senator Costello's further call for a debate on telephone masts, I gave an assurance yesterday that this request would be facilitated at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh made a strong call for VEC funding for literacy programmes and I will pass on that request to the Minister for Education and Science.</P>
      <P>Senators Gallagher and Finneran made their views clear regarding the banking crisis and Mr. Fagan's position in relation to consumer affairs.  I will pass those views on to the Minister to see if progress can be made.</P>
      <P>Senator Coogan called for a debate on radon. I will make time available for such a debate.  As the Senator knows, it cannot be debated before the Easter recess, but as next Wednesday is the Fine Gael Party Private Members' time, perhaps he could arrange something with his party leader. If that is agreed we will debate it before the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan called for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the House to debate the various review committees which are being set up, particularly those without public representatives.  I will see what I can do to have time left aside for this.</P>
      <P>After Easter we will have the debate on road traffic which Senator Farrell requested.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <P>Is cúis áthais dom é an Bille seo a phlé os comhair an tSeanaid ar an ocáid tál hábhachtach seo.</P>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address Seanad Éireann on the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998.  I propose to deal first with the Bill which, in practice, involves setting out a number of the salient features of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  That done, I propose to draw the attention of the House to certain other aspects of the Treaty which I consider of particular importance and interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional amendment proposed in this Bill will permit the State to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam.  It will also make clear that the State is explicitly authorised, subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, to exercise the options and discretions provided by or under the three Articles and two Protocols to the Treaty which are named in the proposed new Article 29.4.6 of the Constitution.  In brief, Article 1.11 covers police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters, Article 2.5 allows for &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; under normal Community business, known as the First Pillar, and Article 2.15 inserts a new Title IIIa into the EC Treaty and covers visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons.  The second Protocol sets out how the Schengen arrangements are to be integrated into the framework of the European Union.  <i>Inter alia,</i> it provides that Ireland or the United Kingdom or both countries &mdash; who have not signed up to the Schengen agreements &mdash; may at any time request to take part in some or all of Schengen.  The Council will decide on such a request.  The fourth Protocol establishes the position of the State in relation to Article 2.15. Ireland and the UK are exempt from the provisions of the new Title IIIa as long as they maintain the common travel area arrangements, <Col N="1351" /> although they may either together or individually participate in the adoption of specific measures. Ireland has stated in a Declaration to the Final Act that it intends to exercise its right to take part in the adoption of measures under Title IIIa to the maximum extent compatible with maintenance of the common travel area.</P>
    <P>Article 1.11 of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for the replacement of Title VI of the Maastricht Treaty by a new restructured Title VI or Third Pillar, which will be concerned exclusively with provisions on police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  The new restructured Third Pillar has three Articles under which options may be exercised by any member state. These options or discretions enable a member state first to adopt a convention established by the Council &mdash; once they have been adopted by at least a majority of the member states such conventions shall come into force for those member states; secondly to agree to accept the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to give preliminary rulings at the request of national courts on points of Community law relating to a wide range of makers adopted under the Third Pillar.  Within this option there are two sub-options, namely, states may decide whether any of their courts or tribunals may request preliminary rulings or whether only courts and tribunals of final instance may do so.  Third it enables a member state to join in the new provision in the Third Pillar for closer co-operation among at least a majority of member states.</P>
    <P>With regard to Article 2.15 and the second and fourth Protocols, all of which relate to free movement of persons, Ireland secured a number of opt-outs, with the possibility of opting in on certain conditions. This is an ideal arrangement.  Our right to preserve the common travel area with the United Kingdom is confirmed, but we and the United Kingdom may also request to participate in any actions at the level of the Union where we consider it to be in our interests to do so.  The possibility for this State to opt into actions under Article 2.15 and the second and fourth Protocols having been expressly negotiated, it is in the Government's view appropriate that the State be given the power to avail itself of these options.</P>
    <P>Ireland and the UK do not participate in the Schengen co-operation system, which has developed outside the EC/EU Treaty framework. For the 13 member states which are involved, and for all new member states in the future, the Treaty of Amsterdam will bring Schengen into the EC/EU Treaty framework.  The Schengen <i>acquis</i> consists of a comprehensive series of measures aimed at the gradual abolition of checks on persons crossing internal borders between participating states.  These measures are in the following areas: the harmonisation of visa and asylum policies; police and security co-operation; the harmonisation of provisions on weapons and <Col N="1352" /> ammunition; judicial co-operation; the development of common information systems in relation to entry; the granting of visas, and police co-operation.</P>
    <P>Under the second Protocol, Ireland and the UK will not be bound by what has already been agreed in Schengen.  We will be able, however, on certain conditions to opt in at any time to some or all of Schengen and take part in any new proposals to build further on it.  Schengen deals with a range of issues such as borders, immigration controls and policing which overlap with the provisions of the new Title IIIa on visas, asylum, immigration and other policies related to free movement of persons.  Other areas of Schengen co-operation will be dealt with in the new Third Pillar.</P>
    <P>Article 2.5 of the Treaty of Amsterdam will add general provisions to the European Community Treaty which will allow a group of member states less than the full membership to use the Union's institutions to develop &ldquo;closer co-operation&rdquo; between themselves under the First Pillar.  To ensure that the introduction of general &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; provisions would not, over time, damage the coherence and solidarity of the Union, the Treaty defines a tight framework of rules to govern the circumstances in which flexibility provisions may be invoked.  The rules specify that the exercise of closer co-operation should aim at furthering the objectives of the Union, respect the principles of the Treaties and the single institutional framework of the Union, only be used as a last resort, concern at least a majority of states, not affect the <i>acquis communautaire,</i> be open to all member states and comply with the specific additional criteria applicable to closer co-operation in the First and Third Pillars.  Beyond these general rules, explicit limitations apply to the exercise of closer co-operation in the First Pillar.</P>
    <P>From what I have said about the specific Articles and Protocols, it will be clear that they concern matters which are important to the citizen and which could impact directly on him or her.  It is the Government's view that should it wish in the future to take up the options in question, it should first lay a proposal in this regard before the Dáil and Seanad.  I am pleased that the Government's proposal in this sense, which is intended to enhance democratic accountability, has met with considerable and widespread support.</P>
    <P>Since the signing of the Treaty of Amsterdam in October of last year, the text has been made available to all Members of the Oireachtas.  The Treaty has been the subject of a comprehensive Government White Paper, a summary of which was also produced in Irish and in English.  Given that published material about the Treaty is widely available at this point, I do not propose to rehearse exhaustively the main provisions of the Treaty.  The House will agree that they are extensive and touch upon a wide range of concerns of direct relevance to the citizen.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1353" /> I wish to explain the ways in which the Treaty of Amsterdam will benefit the citizen and improve the effectiveness, accessibility and democratic accountability in the EU.  These are issues which were an important part of the backdrop to the Inter-Governmental Conference which negotiated the Treaty.  I shall also outline the Treaty provisions aimed at a more effective and coherent external policy.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam shows that debate within and between the member states of the European Union is increasingly focused upon real issues of personal rights and freedoms as well as economic wellbeing.  EU citizens are entitled to have a voice in the direction taken by the Union and to have the work of their Ministers in Council and of their other elected representatives relate directly to their daily lives.  In this regard I pay tribute to the previous coalition Government for bringing us to this point.  It behaved honourably in relation to the production of the Treaty through its involvement in the Inter-Governmental Conference and broad participation in the negotiations. The coalition is now in Opposition but it continues in a decent and responsible way to support the Treaty.</P>
    <P>In this decade it became common to speak of a &ldquo;democratic deficit&rdquo; within the EU.  The implication of this phrase was that a great deal more had to be done to enhance the Union's legitimacy in the eyes of individual citizens.  Clearly, democratic legitimacy is both a <i>sine qua non</i> of the development of the Union's institutions and the ultimate guarantee of their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is a positive step towards a more accessible and clearly responsive EU.  Parliamentary involvement at all levels in scrutinising and debating EU legislation and other proposals for the Union's development was a clear winner at Amsterdam.  The powers of the European Parliament have been indisputably enhanced.  The European Parliament will now be a real and substantial &ldquo;co-legislator&rdquo; with the Council in an extensive range of areas.  This expanded role, together with the proposed simplification of the &ldquo;co-decision&rdquo; procedure itself, will significantly enhance the effectiveness of the dialogue between the Council and the Parliament. In addition, the quality and extent of European Parliament input, first into the Reflection Group and later into the Inter-Governmental Conference, contributed to a widespread appreciation of its actual and potential role, whence the favourable outcome.</P>
    <P>In terms of the maturing of the European Union's system of ensuring democratic input and accountability, one notable feature of the Amsterdam Treaty is that the European Parliament is not the only democratic body to emerge with an enhanced role.  National Parliaments have always had a part to play within the Union in holding the Governments of the member states responsible and accountable at national level. Nevertheless, concerns were evident throughout the Inter-Governmental Conference that better <Col N="1354" /> recognition should be secured for the importance of the role of national Parliaments.  The Treaty of Amsterdam achieves this in two principal ways: by improving the information flow to national Parliaments and by enhancing the role of COSAC, which brings together representatives of the European Affairs committees of national Parliaments.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators are Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs.  They will be aware that under the new Treaty, COSAC may make any contribution it deems appropriate for the attention of the institutions of the Union.  The Treaty also stipulates that COSAC has a particular role to play in making a contribution on matters relating to the application of the principle of subsidiarity, to initiatives in the area of freedom, security and justice which might have a direct bearing on the rights and freedoms of individuals and to questions regarding fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam is unique among EU Treaties in that, from the start, the aim of the negotiation was to place the European citizen at the centre of its provisions.  The White Paper which was published by the Government in January includes a most thorough account of the specific initiatives in the Treaty which are aimed at addressing the concerns and aspirations of the citizen.  Under this heading I wish to focus on a number of these areas, namely, the principles on which the Union is founded, employment and social policy, measures to combat discrimination, environment, consumer policies and public health and transparency.</P>
    <P>The Treaty will reaffirm the principles on which the European Union is founded &mdash; liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  It will make respect for these principles a condition which must be met by any state which applies to join the Union.  Unemployment is a major concern of Governments and citizens across the EU, where 18 million people, close to 11 per cent of the workforce, are unemployed.  The average unemployment rate in the Union among young people is now over 20 per cent.  This is an issue of such importance that a special summit meeting was held in Luxembourg last November devoted solely to the challenge which unemployment poses to our societies.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam creates a new Title in the EC Treaty dealing with the question of employment, which will directly follow, and will be an appropriate complement to, the Title in the EC Treaty which deals with economic and monetary union.  Under the provisions of the new Title, member states are now to regard promoting employment as a matter of common concern and they are to co-ordinate their action in regard to it in the Council.  The objective of a high level of employment is now to be taken into consideration in all other Community policies.</P>
    <P>With regard to social policy, the breach which had opened up in the Union since Maastricht, <Col N="1355" /> when the UK would not accept the Social Chapter, has been healed.  It has been cured.  This will allow for the further development of a single social policy throughout the Union.  The Treaty also provides that for the first time there will be an explicit legal basis in the EC Treaty for action by the Council to deal with social exclusion by means of incentive measures.  The agreement to do this arose from a proposal made and pressed by Ireland during the negotiations.  Importantly, unanimity will not be necessary for the adoption of such measures.</P>
    <P>The Treaty of Amsterdam incorporates a provision which empowers the Council to adopt measures to combat discrimination on the grounds of sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation.  The Treaty provisions designed to ensure respect for the principle of equality between men and women are strengthened.</P>
    <P>With regard to the environment, the concept of balanced and sustainable development will now be highlighted.  This concept was approved by the World Environment and Development Summit in Rio in 1992.  A reference to achieving balanced and sustainable development will be added to the EU's objectives as outlined in Article B of the EU Treaty.  The EC Treaty will also be amended to incorporate the concept.  Should a member state wish to maintain or introduce national provisions in relation to the environment which are stricter than in other member states, they may do so subject to Commission approval that they are not an obstacle to the Single Market.</P>
    <P>Consumer protection has rightly become a major concern in the member states and at the level of the Union.  With the increased level of trade in goods and services which the Single Market is bringing about, concerns were expressed at the Intergovernmental Conference about the corresponding need to improve the rights of the consumer. The provisions of the EC Treaty are to be strengthened with a greater focus on consumer rights including the right to information.  There will also be a specific requirement to take consumer protection concerns into account in implementing all other Community policies and activities.</P>
    <P>In the related field of public health the new Treaty will add provisions to the EC Treaty which allow the Community to set safety standards for human organs and blood derivatives.  It also permits the Community to take public health measures against animal and plant diseases. However, with a view to accountability, the Treaty will recognise that fundamental responsibility for health services and medical care will remain at member state level.</P>
    <P>The EU's power to combat crime, particularly crimes such as terrorism, trafficking in persons, offences against children and illicit trafficking in drugs and arms, will be significantly strengthened. Primary responsibility for action in pursuit of criminals will remain with national police forces.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> New provisions are now to be added to the EC Treaty which will ensure a higher degree of transparency by means of greater openness and more access to documents of the main institutions.  A new article in the EC Treaty provides that any citizen of the EU or any person or legal entity residing in it shall have a right of access to the European Parliament, Council and Commission documents subject to principles and conditions to be defined.  In this regard a new provision will also be added to the EC Treaty which will allow any citizen to write to any of the Community institutions or bodies in one of the Treaty languages, which include Irish, and expect that any reply received will be in the same language.</P>
    <P>A major area of work of the Intergovernmental Conference related to the external policy of the EU.  The Maastricht Treaty of 1992 established the Common Foreign and Security Policy at a time of profound and rapid change in international life as the Cold War came to an end. However, conflicts in former Yugoslavia, in parts of the former Soviet Union and in areas of Africa have been evidence of a continuing instability in international affairs.  Accordingly, the EU members agreed at the Intergovernmental Conference that the CFSP should be made more effective, coherent and visible.  Decision making procedures have been improved with a view to enabling the EU to act more rapidly and effectively on the international stage.  As at present, a member state cannot ultimately be outvoted where important national interests are involved. There will be improved planning and secretariat support for the Presidency of the day and the Council.</P>
    <P>The EU is founded on principles of democracy and human rights.  The CFSP provisions of the new Treaty reflect the concern of citizens that the EU should enhance its contribution to international peace and security commensurate with its economic strength and its political responsibilities. Ireland's tradition of a principled, constructive and engaged foreign policy finds strong expression through our involvement in CFSP, which enables us to join with our EU partners in pursuit of the goal of international peace and justice.</P>
    <P>In a positive response to the new crises and challenges of the post Cold War world and in light of a joint proposal made by Sweden and Finland, which was supported by Ireland, the Petersberg tasks of peacekeeping, humanitarian actions and crisis management have been included in the Treaty.  These tasks will be carried out by the Western European Union at the initiative of the EU.  The EU member states who are not members of any military alliance &mdash; Ireland, Finland, Sweden and Austria &mdash; will be entitled to participate in these missions on a case by case basis if they so wish.  The inclusion of the Petersberg tasks is in line with our long-standing record of contributing to UN peacekeeping operations. It responds to the new situation where the UN is increasingly mandating regional organisations <Col N="1357" /> to undertake peacekeeping and crisis management tasks.  In this regard I wish to pay tribute to the Defence Forces and to express my deep appreciation of their enormous commitment to peacekeeping.  They have been heroic and patriotic and in many instances their members have laid down their lives in the interests of international peace.</P>
    <P>The Treaty provides for the progressive framing of a common defence policy which will be structured around the development of the EUWEU relationship, already established in the Maastricht Treaty, with particular focus on the Petersberg tasks.  Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unaffected by the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  As was the case in the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam explicitly states that the EU's policy shall not prejudice &ldquo;the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;. This reference was inserted into the Maastricht Treaty to take account of Ireland's particular policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Like the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Amsterdam evokes the concept of a future EU common defence only as a possibility, not as an agreed objective of the EU.  Neither an EU common defence nor the integration of the Western European Union into the EU are objectives in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  They remain mere possibilities and are subject to a number of locks: first, they would require a consensus decision in the European Council, where Ireland has a veto; second, even if the European Council were to take such a decision this would be subject to adoption by each member state in accordance with its own national requirements; third, the Government has given a commitment that a referendum would be held if the issue should arise for decision in the future and I reiterate that commitment; and, fourth, an EU common defence would require substantial Treaty revisions and a further Intergovernmental Conference, in which each member state has a veto and these substantial Treaty revisions would have to be put to the people in a referendum.  Far from representing a threat to Ireland's policy of military neutrality, the EU is a response to the new challenges of the post Cold War world.  Ireland should play a full part in this endeavour.</P>
    <P>As I have said on previous occasions, the Treaty of Amsterdam is a good deal for Europe, Ireland and for the citizen.  It strengthens and amplifies the impact of integration and co-operation for the citizen in direct and meaningful ways.  The Treaty seeks to complement rights already in existence in member states with provisions at EU level which will bring added value for the EU citizen.  I accept that many of the useful provisions of the Treaty can appear to lack glamour, but I believe their worth will be amply demonstrated in years to come.  I strongly recommend that citizens should familiarise themselves with the main points of the Treaty of Amsterdam and I predict that the beneficial effect of the <Col N="1358" /> Treaty's provisions, taken cumulatively, will be evident to all after the Treaty has come into force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  We are delighted that a referendum will be held shortly on the Treaty of Amsterdam, which is important for Europe.  It is particularly important for the EU to become more closely integrated and that greater co-operation would exist between member states.  We have awaited this debate for some time; when we discussed the Maastricht Treaty it was hoped that a referendum on these matters would have been held in 1996.</P>
      <P>Irish citizens must be fully informed and advised about what is involved.  It is repeatedly said in this Chamber and elsewhere that the advantages and terms of the Amsterdam Treaty are discussed in great detail within restricted organisations but the public is ignorant of it.  If I were the Minister I would not be complacent about the public's attitude to the Treaty.  Some people are advancing spurious arguments and a more pro-active approach should be taken to counteract them.  More recently the arguments have turned to a number of items addressed by the Minister today but this debate will only receive a limited amount of publicity.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks there have been discussions about EMU, the strength of the pound, future inflation and agricultural prices.  All these issues could have an impact on how people vote on the Amsterdam Treaty; they are not directly related to the Treaty but could negatively affect people's thinking.  These arguments should be tackled head on.  As a result of court cases there are legal restrictions on putting views across and engaging in publicity but, nonetheless, the Government should set up an active campaign.</P>
      <P>This is an important Treaty because it affects everyone.  One might have hoped it would be much stronger in certain policy areas.  Its preparation coincided with discussions on EMU and a view existed in Europe that a strong economic basis was required first so EMU should take precedence &mdash; if a weakened Treaty was the result that did not matter because it could be strengthened later.  That is what has happened.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Schengen agreement does not apply to Ireland.  This is a consequence of the attitude adopted by the UK &mdash; our common travel area with the UK remains in place at the expense of Schengen.  I understand the logistics and that 70 per cent of people travelling out of Ireland go to the UK.</P>
      <P>I was hoping the Minister would stay because he knows how much I appreciate his presence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>One is tempted to torment the Minister on some occasions, that is the nature of the game.</P>
      <P>As I said, I am disappointed that the Schengen agreement will apply to 13 member states but not to Ireland.  It will be difficult to explain to the Irish public why we will still have to show passports when entering Europe &mdash; many people thought this was settled years ago but they will still have to do it after the Amsterdam Treaty is passed.  The reasons for this should be clearly explained to the electorate.</P>
      <P>I understand to a certain degree why the British wished to maintain passport control at certain ports and the same applies to the rest of Europe. We have a security problem with the Six Counties but an alternative should have been found to opting out of Schengen completely with the possibility of joining at a later date.  There was a similar problem with the Maastricht Treaty when the British opted out of the Social Chapter.  It may not be wise to allow member states such an option because it does not help us achieve greater partnership, unity or co-ordination.  I hope this matter will be reviewed at an early date by the British and Irish Governments.  A proper peace process for Northern Ireland may be put in place shortly &mdash; with a possible referendum here &mdash; and that may help the adoption of the Schengen agreement.</P>
      <P>There has been much discussion of the danger of a united police force across Europe &mdash; specifically there was scaremongering about the police in Northern Ireland coming south without any restrictions following the adoption of this Treaty. That is dangerous and spurious propaganda so this aspect should be brought into focus.  In the United States, if the police follow someone they cannot cross their state border; at that point it is up to police from the other state to follow the suspect.  A similar situation would arise in Europe.</P>
      <P>What is important, however, is that the Treaty provides that the police can co-ordinate, co-operate and exchange information on a far closer basis &mdash; in a sense they are bound to do so.  There is a serious crime problem across Europe, particularly in relation to drugs.  Ireland has been used as a landing site for drugs which have subsequently been ferried or flown elsewhere.  Greater co-operation through Interpol is necessary to pursue European and world drug barons.  Under the Treaty the gardaí are in a position to use and exchange information far more freely.  This cannot but be successful and anything which will fight crime across borders and enable such co-operation must be welcomed, because it is for the general good of the citizens of Europe.  The spurious arguments against it must be quickly dismissed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another issue which causes concern is neutrality; this has been discussed in this House and in various committees for many years.  We should examine our conscience about this.  Where in the Statute Book or in the Constitution is it written <Col N="1360" /> in stone that Ireland should remain neutral?  This policy was adopted because of the overall political circumstances and local domestic considerations at a particular time.  It was called into play once and has never really arisen since but we talk a lot about it.  We also talk a lot about the difference between peacekeeping and peace enforcement. I was interested to note how the Minister conveniently did not mentioned the term &ldquo;peace-enforcing&rdquo; but repeatedly mentioned peacekeeping. Our exemplary record in that area has been highly commended within the United Nations. However, we have had to introduce legislation in the House to proceed to peace enforcement exercises, which we have undertaken twice.  I had hoped the Treaty would be stronger in taking this issue on.  If we are part of the European Union surely we should play a full part and not stand back from any section of it.  We cannot take the <i>a la carte</i> menu, leaving certain items aside.</P>

      <P>Senator Norris would be the very first Member of the House to stand in gracious outrage if major attacks and injustices were being perpetrated across the world on various minorities.  He would be crying to the high heavens as to why the European Union was not doing something positive about them.  We found it had not been doing something positive about these issues because it does not have the legal mechanism under which to act.  The EU's various Treaties do not contain the powers to deal effectively with situations such as occurred in the former Yugoslavia, including Kosovo province, and in Algeria.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris would be the first to castigate the EU for not taking positive action.  He and others with a shilly shallying approach to this issue should decide what they really want.  If they want positive action to deal with these situations then the institutions must be empowered to take such action.  To date the European Union has not been empowered to take that action as effectively as it should.  Unfortunately, this Treaty does not give the EU that power either.  Although it goes part of the way towards strengthening our foreign and security policy, it does not give the EU the final co-ordinating power to take action as a force. This is a defect of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1361" /> The question of neutrality has been brought up.  Until now we did not have anything written into our Constitution relating to neutrality.  If the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified we will, in fact, have written into our Constitution for the first time our position on neutrality.  As things stand, if the Government decided to join the Western European Union or to become part of a European army before 22 May, there would be no difficulty in doing so.  After the Amsterdam Treaty, however, if Article J.7 has to be changed there will first have to be an intergovernmental conference followed by a meeting of the Council of Ministers, whose decision on the matter must be unanimous.  In addition, because the issue of neutrality will be written into the Constitution by virtue of the Amsterdam Treaty, we will have to have a referendum.  All parties have repeatedly made a commitment to such a referendum if we want to go that step further.  We have not done it now but, hopefully, we will do it sometime in the future.  After the year 2000 our children will be asked to vote on this important issue which has not been as seriously addressed in the Treaty as it should be.  Some people are trying to scaremonger about it but the reality is that there will have to be a referendum in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Treaty is commendable in the way it deals with environmental issues. It attempts to recognise the problem and bring about a co-ordinated approach to sustainable environmental development in Europe.  As citizens of Ireland and of Europe we must ensure that the country we leave after us can sustain our successors.  We must avoid damaging the environment to a degree where people cannot continue to live in it.  As industries develop, particularly in the agricultural sector, the environment must be treated seriously.  The Treaty accepts that point and does something about it.  I am delighted with the level of co-operation and co-ordination as well as the monitoring policy incorporated in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Treaty's position on minorities is also welcome. For years, in common with other EU member states, we have aspired to promote equality between men and women as well as for minorities, particularly the disabled.  Yesterday, President McAleese referred to the fact that increasingly a more hardened approach is being adopted towards itinerants.  That is very unfortunate. There is a danger that that kind of thinking can increase, particularly at a time of great affluence. It might be difficult for some sectors in our community to accept minorities, but as public representatives we have a responsibility to take a leading role in the interests of minorities, whether they are refugees or itinerants in Ennis, Dublin or any other part of the country.</P>

      <P>Sorry, travellers.  I beg the Senator's pardon, I am not politically correct.  The term has moved through so many different forms, but the Senator knows what I mean.  These attitudes should not be allowed to surface because all people are meant to be treated equally and our Constitution recognises that fact.</P>
      <P>We are obliged by the Constitution to recognise that fact nationally and, within the Treaty, we will further accept to recognise and respond to that position.  No minority should be discriminated against, although they can be subject to positive discrimination so they become equal within their communities and society generally. That is a welcome feature of the Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Treaty also addresses the unemployment problem by establishing a partnership between members states and agencies to tackle unemployment. The advisory body to be established under the Treaty will have two members from each member state dealing with employment issues.  I hope the advisory body will address the question of the long-term unemployed in Europe and in Ireland in particular.  It is a specific problem that requires special consideration.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Flood, sat with me on the National Economic and Social Forum, which presented a report on the long-term unemployed. Thankfully, both the present Government and its predecessor have put in place some of the report's recommendations.  I hope the Treaty will continue to further the cause of the long-term unemployed.  The expertise that will be exchanged between the various agencies and member state Governments will be put to good use when we are dealing with them.</P>
      <P>I had hoped the Treaty would deal with the institutions in a more positive fashion.  That has not been done.  However, I am pleased that the European Parliament, the only institution that is directly elected, is to be given additional powers in conjunction with the Council of Ministers regarding police decisions and a variety of other matters.  It is very important that the Parliament is given proper teeth and recognition as a democratic and directly elected institution.  I hope it will continue to strengthen because the strength of Europe will depend on the strength of the voice of the people, which is to be heard within the Parliament and not necessarily the Council of Ministers or the Commission.</P>
      <P>The future of the EU Commission and the number of commissioners per member state was debated.  I am pleased that we will continue to have a commissioner because it is very important that all member states, regardless of their size, have a commissioner to represent their interests within the Commission.  We should continue to fight for this.  The allocation of commissioners should not be based on the size or economic strength of member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the European Court of Justice has been strengthened and has been given a greater involvement in issues of asylum, immigration and judicial co-operation on civil and <Col N="1363" /> criminal matters.  It is equally important that the sovereignty of our courts regarding issues arising in our national territory has been re-established.</P>
    <P>The Bill is straightforward.  It outlines the terms of the Treaty, which is welcome and commendable. The question to be put before the public needs to be as straightforward and uncomplicated as possible.  When the campaign gets underway it is very important that there be clear argument on the issues and that they be properly and honestly addressed.  There is a dearth of ignorance about the Treaty among the electorate.  Only a small handful of people are aware of what it entails.</P>
    <P>The Treaty may be less tangible than some previous Treaties, such as the Single European Act or the Maastricht Treaty, and the public may take the view that it has less application, although the opposite is the case.  In view of this, the issues raised by the Treaty could have a negative impact on voters.  The Government and any of the parties who support it should take nothing for granted.  There is a need for a vociferous campaign between now and 22 May.</P>

      <P>It has been mentioned that the debate has not been taken up in the public arena.  In view of this I am disgusted that, despite the address to the House by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, no member of the press is in attendance.

      <P>That would not be hard.  At a time when Europe is expanding we have set in motion another tranche of a process that started with the Treaty of Rome in 1957 and developed by the Single European Act of 1985 and the Maastricht Treaty of 1991.  This Treaty gives us the opportunity to bond together as Europeans in a genuine manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are huge problems associated with the EU and the expansion of Europe.  As the Minister remarked, the average unemployment rate <Col N="1364" /> throughout the EU is 11 per cent, while, unfortunately, 20 per cent of the unemployed are young people.  Although it is categorically stated in the Treaty that the EU will co-ordinate employment incentives throughout the Union, unemployment will rise because of the situation in nations which will become members within the next four to five years.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years, Europe has been unsuccessful in addressing its unemployment problem on a Europe wide basis.  Although there has been an unprecedented increase in employment in this country &mdash; the numbers at work have never been higher &mdash; the same situation does not apply throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Many take the view that the Amsterdam Treaty and EMU will take away a certain amount of sovereignty.  That issue must be addressed.  I am glad the Treaty includes a legally binding protocol on the role of national parliaments in the Union.  The objective of the protocol is to encourage the greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the Union.  It aims to ensure that all Commission consultation documents are forwarded to national parliaments promptly and in good time.  Legislative proposals from the Commission will not be forwarded to the Council for a period of six weeks to ensure national parliaments have adequate time to analyse the proposals and make their views known to their Governments.  As the Minister said, the role of COSAC, the Conference of European Affairs Committees of the national parliaments, is enhanced by giving it a formal legal status and by providing it with assurances on the timely provision of information to national parliaments. That safeguard is now legally built into the Union and must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Subsidiarity is a philosophical concept which argues that governing decisions which affect people's lives should be taken as close as possible to these citizens.  In a sense, it attempts to reconcile the effectiveness of government, which is often an argument for more centralised decision making, with the legitimacy of government, which would often favour the decentralisation of government.  That must be restated.  Subsidiarity has recently been employed in the European Union as a means to ensure decisions are taken at the most appropriate level of government, whether that is local, regional, state, national or European level.  Article 3b[5] of the Maastricht Treaty formalised subsidiarity as a principle of the EU's political and legal framework.  Therefore, the Amsterdam Treaty, which includes the legally binding protocol on the role of national parliaments and the strengthening of the subsidiarity element in the Maastricht Treaty, are to be welcomed by anyone who holds our sovereignty dear.</P>
    <P>We must be extremely careful to ensure that booming economies here and in Britain help everybody.  The Asian Tigers did not provide for the people in Asia but made a great deal of wealth available to very few people.  Hong Kong <Col N="1365" /> was portrayed as a miracle of capitalism. However, over 70 per cent of people in Hong Kong received social welfare payments which put them below the poverty line.  We must respond to the economic boom by ensuring all levels of society benefit from it.  Everybody will not have the same income but those who are incapable of looking after themselves must be helped when there is a growth in economic activity.</P>
    <P>A concentrated and unjustified attack was made this morning on our military neutrality.  We have taken part in peace keeping activities around the world whenever we have been asked.  The Treaty states the Western European Union is taking certain responsibilities for defence.  We are not, and should not be, members of the Western European Union, which is a subsidiary of NATO with a different set of initials.  However, we can choose to get involved in peace keeping or peace enforcement and can consult the people on this matter if necessary.  I do not think the policy adopted by successive Governments, in an attempt to heal problems in war stricken areas, will change.</P>
    <P>There is a grave need for co-ordination throughout Europe on the enforcement of laws, particularly those relating to drug offences.  There is a danger, with the removal of borders, of a further increase in drug trafficking unless policing is co-ordinated throughout Europe.  We have all seen the problems caused by drug taking and the laundering of money by drug barons.  Until financial institutions get their act together, whether they are in Switzerland or Dublin, we will not be able to address the drug problem.</P>
    <P>I do not feel very strongly about the creation of a single European Central Bank but I have some reservations about it.  Subsidiarity is an attempt to bring decision making closer to the people but this is an example of where decision making on fiscal responsibility will be further from the people.  There have been criticisms of the Irish Central Bank's role in the policing of NIB and other financial institutions.  I wonder how a European Central Bank would deal with such issues in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Discrimination against minorities, such as itinerants in Ireland, is a major and growing problem in Europe.  This phenomenon can be seen in Denmark, Sweden, Germany, France and the rest of Europe and it will not go away.  A huge number of people want to enter Europe to take up jobs, many of which Europeans are unwilling to do because they are low paid.  These minorities live in abominable conditions throughout Europe.  It is terrifying to see the hatred and discrimination against refugees and foreign workers in Germany and elsewhere in Europe where unemployment has increased dramatically.  We must carefully monitor the growth of such discrimination.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, Ireland is not lily white in this regard.  We must ensure genuine asylum seekers are taken care of and dealt with properly.  They can teach us a great deal about how to live with <Col N="1366" /> each other.  They can also tell us about their fears, the discrimination and threats they experienced and the deaths which occurred in their families. We must treat asylum seekers and refugees in a proper and controlled manner.</P>
    <P>If Europe is to be a strong political and economic entity we must ensure that people in Third World countries, who are constantly struggling not to live reasonable lives but to exist, do not suffer.  Growth in European society must not be at the expense of people in Third World countries, whether it is South America, Africa or Asia.  We must learn the lessons of the past.  Some 4.3 million people exist on less than $1 a month.  These people would love to discuss this topic but they do not get the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that European companies have been to the forefront in killing off hundreds of thousands of people in these countries by not providing proper aid and by milking them of oil or other natural resources.  Some 13 per cent of the oil in America comes from Angola.  As not one barrel of that oil is traded out of London, nobody knows how much money goes back to the Angolan people.  Angola is bigger than France, Germany, Holland and Belgium combined, yet it has a population of only 10 million people.  Its natural resources include diamonds and oil, yet the people are living in poverty because European and American multinationals are milking the system with the aid of the NPLA Government. If we want growth in the European economy, we must ensure it is not at the expense of those living in Third World countries.</P>
    <P>There was a danger that when the European Union was enlarged, we might lose our European Commissioner.  However, it seems that every country which becomes a member of the European Union will have a Commissioner and that those who have more than one at present will be reduced to one.  This means that while smaller countries, whether in size or economy, may not have an equal say, at least they will have someone to represent them at Commission level.</P>
    <P>The new euro currency will be introduced almost in conjunction with the Amsterdam Treaty.  There are exciting times ahead as no one knows what will happen.  It seems there will be a stable currency throughout Europe and that money will not fluctuate in the way it did in the past.  I hope we do not have a similar situation to that which exists between Britain and Ireland where if I put £400 sterling in the bank, I will get IR£500 but if I put IR£500 in the bank I will get just under £400 sterling.  That is a huge difference which is good for our tourism and export industries but not for people travelling to Britain.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the consequences of changing the Central Bank Act as this will remove a number of its controls, although people give out about the role of the Central Bank and the fact it does not act or react fast enough on many occasions.  The Central Bank Bill, 1997, which amends a previous Central Bank Act, was passed <Col N="1367" /> in March this year.  With an inflation rate below the European average and a growing employment rate, Ireland is well geared to deal with whatever changes take place in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Although we regret it, we must admit that Europe has been good to us.  There was a time when we were called the country with the begging bowl.  We did not beg but we knew how to put our case to the European Union for whatever money was available.  If we were better at getting through the red tape and getting money from Europe, the people who negotiated on our behalf should be praised, not criticised for having a begging bowl mentality.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the way he has presented the Amsterdam Treaty since January and those who drafted the White Paper.  We must also compliment the Institute of European Affairs and other groups which have organised information meetings throughout the country to sell the message of the Amsterdam Treaty and EMU.  However, the media's coverage of the debate has been abysmal. The local media, in particular, have not published any reports of these meetings, which were well attended.  The media are the only people who can get the message across.  I urge them and all politicians to sell the Amsterdam Treaty, which will further advance the European Union set up in 1957.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Byrne, to the House.  Further to a rotating Taoiseach, we have had a dervish like display of rotating Ministers here, which made me dizzy.  We had the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Flood, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews.  Senator Taylor-Quinn started her speech before the flood and it showed some evidence of that because she referred to the scaremongering tactics of certain people and the woolly arguments, on the one hand, while, on the other hand, there are issues and people who are extremely important and should be highly commended.  The difficulty was there was a certain absence of argument.  It is important that we sustain our positions by argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad Senator Taylor-Quinn's contribution did not descend to the personal, which has happened previously.  This country should be extremely grateful to people, such as Ms Patricia McKenna, who have examined this issue with a keenly critical gaze, which is extremely important in any debate.  Questions were raised which have not been answered and statements were made in the House today which are not true.  For example, the Treaty was commended for the way in which it looked after the disabled.  There is not a single reference to the disabled.  This is one of the things <Col N="1368" /> criticised in the Treaty in terms of anti-discrimination legislation.</P>
    <P>I compliment the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs who worked on the drafting of the Treaty which was produced in December 1996, during the succesful Irish Presidency.  I do not like everything in the Treaty and I will speak against many of its provisions but a highly professional job was done drafting it.  I also compliment the Department of Foreign Affairs on the excellent White Paper it produced.  It is highly informative, written in simple language, immediately accessible and discloses the main range of ideas.  I found it extremely helpful.  I also commend an excellent book produced by the Institute of European Affairs, <i>Amsterdam: What the Treaty Means,</i> edited by Ben Tonra.  I have picked through this book and I use facts established in it to be critical of certain aspects of the Treaty and I found it an extremely useful intellectual exercise.</P>
    <P>I am glad that, for the first time in a foundation document of the European Union, the question of discrimination in terms of sexual orientation is raised fully.  This marks a historic breakthrough but it is a pity the document has no teeth.  It is necessary to have unanimity among the Council of Ministers in order to take any action.  On one hand anti-discrimination measures are there, theoretically, but there is very little prospect of their implementation.  However, as a moral benchmark it is highly significant and I welcome it.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Treaty gives us an increased level of democracy, transparency or accountability. Increased powers have been granted to the President and the Commission.  However, I am much less sure about the role of the European Parliament. The concept of co-decision is there but the Parliament still has no entitlement to initiate new legislation.  It is still a neutered Parliament.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Treaty contains a gesture towards human rights.  I say this for a very clear reason. When I spoke at a COSAC meeting in Paris on the subject of the amoral policy of the French Government of arming dictatorships such as Indonesia, the response of the then Foreign Minister of France, M. Alain Juppé, was that the European Union was not a human rights organisation and contained no human rights elements. At that time he was right but I am glad to say that, with the production of this Treaty, he is no longer quite so firmly grounded in his cynicism.</P>
    <P>I understand that a new chapter dealing with full employment will be added to the EU Treaties if the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified.  It is not, however, part of the Treaty and there has been no attempt to make full employment an objective of the European Union.  On the other hand, there has been massive lobbying by certain vested financial interests, particularly by corporate lobbying groups, who organised a very strong campaign against having measures against unemployment included in the Treaty, and they were succesful. The group principally involved is called UNICE and their spokesperson, Zygmunt Tyszkiewicz, <Col N="1369" /> said &ldquo;we never wanted an employment chapter in the first place but, if we have to have one, this version is just fine.&rdquo;.  If it is just fine for dear old Zygmunt it is probably not all that fine for the 30 million people who are unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, competitiveness has been included so that employment policy is subservient to the economic objectives of the major employers within the European Union countries. I am worried about this because the European Union does not accept that we have been too complacently watching the demise of Communism and acting as if capitalism were impregnable and represented the way of the future.  I do not believe this is the case.  Capitalism is predicated on the notion of an infinitely expanding market. This is not sustainable in the long term and only sustainable in the short and medium term if we continue the massive exploitation of the weaker sections of the globe.  A day of reckoning will come.  Rather than celebrating the idea of competitiveness unchecked we should explore the possibility of a greater degree of economic co-operation.</P>
    <P>I do not share the moral certainties of those who draw distinctions between genuine asylum seekers and economic refugees as if there was not a perfectly logical and human ground for being an economic refugee in the circumstances which are produced by the policies of the European Union among others.  If you were living in, for example, Belarus, with the prospect of pollution, radiation, non-payment of wages, political turmoil and a rotten education system, would you not, as a responsible parent, attempt to move your family to an area where they might be better treated?  The philosophical basis of the economic ideas of the European Union are suspect and will lead to dangers in the future.</P>
    <P>Everybody is against crime.  There are, however, legitimate concerns about the movement for closer co-operation between European police forces.  I have expressed my ideas about drug smuggling and there is no point in my rehearsing them in detail.  We will never stamp out the drug trade.  It can be minimised and its impact limited by a more sophisticated response but the more sophisticated European response to the problems of drug use is being inhibited by pressure from the United States.  For example, the experiments in Bristol where heroin was being made available on prescription to addicts have been virtually stopped even though the experiment was being used as a model in the Netherlands.  Like others, I placed my reservations before the House during the recent debate on Europol.  It is clear that there will not be effective judicial control of this supra-European police force and I am extremely worried that this will have the effect of negating human rights.</P>
    <P>Mine is not an extreme view.  In advance of the German ratification of the Europol Convention last October, the Federal Prosecutor General, Mr. Kay Nehm, lamented the fact that the police <Col N="1370" /> and not the judiciary were the driving force behind European unity in criminal investigations. &ldquo;Control of the police through courts and public prosecutors is vital for protecting fundamental rights and liberties&rdquo;, he said.</P>
    <P>An important debate is on-going on the subject of the storing of information, the very curious nature of that information and the criteria to be used in authorising its collection.  It is supposed to be done when absolutely necessary but nobody has laid down criteria for judging when it is absolutely necessary or who would do the judging.  As far as I remember, someone very far down the police command structure could make a judgment that the collection of information was absolutely necessary.  Data would be collected relating to racial origin and religious, political or other beliefs.  This is an astonishing abrogation of human rights.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt briefly with the question of asylum refugees.  The Treaty of Amsterdam seeks to transfer visas, asylum and other policies related to the free movement of persons from the Third Pillar to the First, which would mean that these issues will fall more within the field of competence of EU institutions rather than being dealt with purely at national or intergovernmental level.  There is a kind of creeping takeover occurring in these Treaties.  When I deal with neutrality, I will highlight the incremental nature of the development of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I will now provide a number of examples to support my argument, the first of which is a quotation from the excellent book edited by Mr. Tonra.  I quote:</P>
    <P>Even though the Union would be no longer founded on the Member States, the present guarantee in a revised Article F(3) [6(3)] &mdash; The Union shall respect the national identities of its Member States &mdash; would stand.  This important guarantee, however, is from the Union to the Member States, and is not in the nature of a reservation by the Member States from the Union.</P>
    <P>In other words, there is an increasing and ongoing centralisation of authority in the European Union as an institution and a consequent parallel removal of competence to make decisions from the individual member states.  This affects everything from asylum seeking to policing to neutrality and defence matters.</P>
    <P>Article 731 of the Treaty states that measures in the Treaty will not in any way affect a member state's duty to maintain public order and safeguard its opportunity.  It also allows EU Ministers, voting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, to adopt &ldquo;provisional measures&rdquo; when one or more member states are faced with an &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo; involving a &ldquo;sudden inflow&rdquo; of nationals from third countries. The three terms &ldquo;provisional measures&rdquo;, &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo; and &ldquo;sudden inflow&rdquo; are phrased in &ldquo;Eurospeak&rdquo; and, as in the case of the term &ldquo;absolutely necessary&rdquo;, definitions are not <Col N="1371" /> provided.  What constitutes an &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo; or a &ldquo;sudden inflow&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>Amnesty International has registered its concern and alarm that no reference is made, for example, to the Geneva Convention in this Article of the Treaty:</P>
    <P>Any measure adopted, which has consequences for asylum seekers and refugees, should be in compliance with the member states' obligations under all international refugee and human rights instruments.</P>
    <P>As an example of what the EU regards as an &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo;, I must inform the House that in January, 3,000 Kurdish refugees fleeing from persecution in Turkey &mdash; which, among other countries, has a long tradition of persecuting the Kurds &mdash; arrived off the coast of southern Italy.  The European Union's first reaction to this crisis was to call a joint meeting between its police chiefs and Turkey's.  EU Foreign Ministers drew up a 46 point plan advocating measures, such as the tightening of the Union's external border controls.  Concern about the welfare of the refugees was a minor issue in the response to this &ldquo;emergency situation&rdquo;.  In light of their history, does the House not consider it astonishing that the attempt by 3,000 Kurds to escape possible extermination was seen as a massive threat to the 370 million citizens of the European Union?  The notion of proportionality appears to be completely absent from the EU's response.</P>
    <P>I also have a difficulty with another phrase, &ldquo;temporary protection&rdquo; measures, which may conceal something nasty.  These measures are independent of the ordinary routine of dealing with refugees.</P>
    <P>At the request of Spain, a Protocol has been attached to the Treaty which bars citizens from one member state seeking asylum in another, except in highly unusual circumstances.  It is not only my shrill voice which has been raised against this, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees &mdash; UNHCR &mdash; also opposes the Protocol and argues that it will breach the Geneva Convention to which lip service is paid in the Treaty.  The Geneva Convention prohibits discrimination against refugees based on their country of origin.  Ruling out the possibility that somebody could have their human rights abused in any particular country sets a dangerous precedent. The UNHCR argued that the ripple effect may be considerable and stated that &ldquo;this concept may be followed by other regions, with the inherent danger of undermining the scope of applicability of the international refugee instruments universally.&rdquo; He went on to indicate that it &ldquo;may also erode the humanitarian nature of asylum by complicating relations with non-EU states.&rdquo; In a remarkably cynical performance &mdash; I accept it was conducted with considerable brio &mdash; my colleague Senator Taylor-Quinn asserted, perhaps correctly, that the neutrality of this country was merely a moral fig leaf or a convenient <Col N="1372" /> fiction and it had only been used on one occasion in order to secure political advantage for the State.  That might be true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I like being interrupted, particularly by my dear friend Senator Taylor-Quinn. The general thrust of her point that Irish neutrality is merely a cynical exercise could be true. She inquired where it is written in stone that Ireland should remain neutral.  I must inform her that it is written in stone in the hearts of the people who, regardless of the cynical motivations of politicians in the past, have taken on board the notion of neutrality and have shown a clear commitment to it.</P>
      <P>I stated earlier that I believe the Amsterdam Treaty is incremental in nature.  A former Member of the House, Mr. Brendan Halligan, referred to that fact in his contribution to Mr. Tonra's book when he stated:</P>
      <P>The process of integration is incremental, proceeding in discrete steps.  Foundations with limited objectives are laid and then built on successively in the light of experience.  What begins as a modest experiment in cooperation grows into established procedures for jointly managing issues of common concern.  This may lack elegance as a way of doing things, but it arguably has the merit of working in practice.</P>
      <P>Mr. Halligan is correct because it is in this way that we are being led into military alliances for which the majority of Irish people have no appetite. The Treaty states that the common foreign and security policy shall include all questions relating to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, in accordance with the second subparagraph, which might lead to a common defence should the European Council so decide.  This is a significant incremental advance on the militarisation of the European Union.  Senator Taylor-Quinn will probably welcome that development.</P>

      <P>We should not defend something which does not need to be defended.  Let us be honest.  From a military point of view there is gross cynicism about most of the major players who are not interested in the slightest in human rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me highlight the shift in EU policy more clearly.  The Maastricht Treaty states that the common foreign and security policy &ldquo;shall include all questions related to the security of the <Col N="1373" /> Union, including the eventual framing of a common defence policy&rdquo;.  It has moved from an &ldquo;eventual framing&rdquo; to a &ldquo;progressive framing&rdquo;. Since we have succeeded in obtaining derogations on the Schengen agreement, why did we not follow the Danes who obtained a derogation on this issue?  The Danish Government insisted on a protocol, which states:</P>
    <P>With regard to measures adopted by the Council in the field of Articles J.3(1) and J.7 of the Treaty of the European Union, Denmark does not participate in the elaboration and the implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications, but will not prevent the development of closer cooperation between member States in this area.  Therefore Denmark shall not participate in their adoption.  Denmark shall not be obliged to contribute to the financing of the operational expenditure arising from such measures.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am establishing that there was a possibility, which has been clearly demonstrated by precedent, for a member of the European Union to obtain a derogation protecting the kind of neutrality to which we say we are committed. I am concerned that not only did we not obtain this derogation but we do not appear to have raised a single peep at the references to the development of cooperation in the European arms industry, particularly in the context of the Titley Report and the report &ldquo;Links: Ireland's Links with the Arms Trade and Military Industry&rdquo;, published by AfRI.</P>
      <P>The annual production of defence equipment in the European Union is approximately £40 billion, 3 per cent of annual industrial output.  The industry employs 600,000 people directly and 400,000 indirectly.  I cited these figures in previous debates.  With the ending of the Cold War there is a massive European arms manufacturing industry which aggressively seeks markets for its weapons and included in the Amsterdam Treaty is something which actively encourages them.  That is very dangerous and a country like Ireland ought to have taken the opportunity to register a strong protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that in defending the French arms industry, the European Union was not a human rights organisation.  We should listen to what Alan Clark, as a defence minister, said on <Col N="1374" /> this issue when he was asked how defensible it was to supply massive quantities of arms to the Indonesian dictatorship which was actively involved in the genocide in East Timor.  He was asked whether the public should be cynical about assurances, guidelines and denials from government about the sale of arms.  He answered:</P>
    <P>I don't know what you mean by the public, but I don't think the majority of people give a damn about it.  Unless those weapons are going to be used against our own troops.</P>
    <P>He was then asked was it correct that the assumption that the public does not give a damn allows Ministers and officials to deceive?  He answered:</P>
    <P>Why should they want to deceive if the public doesn't give a damn?</P>
    <P>He was then asked whether the matter, in broad terms, was about the right of a small country not to be invaded by a large neighbour.  He answered:</P>
    <P>Yeah, but they weren't British, were they?</P>
    <P>He was then asked whether that made a difference. He answered:</P>
    <P>Of course it makes a difference.  My responsibility is to my own people.  I don't really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another.</P>
    <P>This is the man who was in charge of the arms sales policy of our closest neighbour in the EU which, by virtue of its proximity, has a considerable effect on our policy, leading to the inevitability of our derogation from the Schengen agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a referendum will be held if there is any change, which I welcome.  However, the statement that a referendum would be necessary is completely untrue.  On page 167 of the book produced by the Institute of European Affairs, <i>Amsterdam: What the Treaty Means,</i> it states:</P>
    <P>The new Article J [11-28] provides the Union with a competence for the progressive framing of a common defence policy which might lead to a common defence, should the European Council so decide.  This is similar in some respects to the former competence in this area which existed under the Maastricht Treaty. However, the competence is unusually worded. It is very difficult to distinguish between a competence for a progressive framing and a competence for that which is to be progressively framed.  The difference in substance between a highly developed common defence policy and a common defence is unclear: the Community has a common agricultural policy but not a common agriculture.  It is important to focus on a few of the proposed changes.</P>
    <P>Under the present Article J [11-28] the competence is one which both the Union and its member states shall define and implement. <Col N="1375" /> This relates to the point I made earlier about the growing transfer of power to the European Union as a unit rather than the member states of which it is composed.  The book goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Under the new, the Union alone is competent. Under the old, the possibility of a common defence was left up to future treaty amendment.  Under the new, the European Council may decide without necessarily amending the treaty.</P>
    <P>There is no requirement on the European Council to make this decision at any point &mdash; they can continue to develop a common defence policy without ever deciding to call it a common defence.  However, if at some point the European Council takes a formal decision, it shall recommend (but not oblige) the Member States to adopt the decision in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  Unlike in amendments to the treaty, this is not an obligation.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, although the position is not crystal clear, it seems that as a matter of Irish constitutional law there would be no requirement for a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The book goes on to state:</P>
      <P>This is because if the Constitution is amended to license ratification of the proposed treaty which encompasses the competence to frame progressively a common defence, and to take a formal decision to institute a common defence, there will not necessarily be any development which would amend the treaties or add a new treaty competence for which a referendum would be required.  The closest available precedent was the decision to have universal direct elections to the European Parliament, which had to be adopted in accordance with constitutional requirements.  This did not necessitate any further constitutional amendment.</P>
      <P>It is not clear that there is any requirement to hold a referendum.  I will quote from another barrister on the question of peacemaking and the so-called Petersburg Tasks.  This is useful to highlight the cynicism of major players:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Apart from the obvious physical danger, there are other more fundamental issues to be considered.  The real agenda of the larger powers may not be apparent at first, and small or middle powers run the risk of being dragged unwittingly into an intervention that owes little to the noble aspirations of the UN Charter. Humanitarian intervention and international law are not high on the priorities of those states whose motives and policies are determined by the <i>realpolitik</i> of international relations and domestic concerns.</P>
    <P>We should look at the Gulf War and East Timor. Some of us attended a very moving meeting where Senora Pereanez from Colombia spoke about what peacemaking means there.  As an elected member of parliament, she has had to be smuggled out of the country to save her life. Members of parliament are burned in the public squares by the authorities.  She described peacemaking in areas where the peasants live, they first sort out the local officials and the mayor and then execute them publicly.</P>

It contains the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and the Treaty on the European Union as well, which tends to be forgotten.  I hope when the debate enters the public domain &mdash; and thanks to the McKenna judgment the Government will put forward both sides of the argument &mdash; much of the information will be supplied. Every house should also be supplied free of charge with a copy of both Treaties as many people would read them and, given time, would be able to assimilate what is in them.  There are decisions involved which will affect everybody's life in future.  It will be passed, as it is the only <Col N="1377" /> club in town and we have nowhere else to go. However, Europe has been very good to us over the years.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the Treaty to common action and police co-operation and it envisages, for example, the operational role for Europol, albeit in a support capacity.  There is nothing wrong with this because the Treaty must involve itself in justice and home affairs.  It paves the way for co-operation between the police forces of Europe, directly and indirectly.  Europol is the beginning of a new federal police force.</P>
      <P>According to the provisions of the Treaty, Europol is required to combat terrorism, drug smuggling, trafficking in women and children, etc., and this cannot be disputed.  However, when the Europol Bill was debated in the House I raised fears about it.  Within five years of the Treaty's ratification, Europol will be able to undertake operations and investigate crimes, etc. with the police forces of member states and, more importantly, to establish a research documentation and statistical network on cross border crime.  However, at no stage during the drafting of the Europol Convention was the European Parliament, consulted even though the Maastricht Treaty obliges the Council of Ministers to keep it informed of key developments on justice and home affairs and take its views into account.</P>
      <P>Similarly, the Oireachtas will have no say over the force's operations.  The convention was ratified and it cannot be amended.  Europol will be even less democratically accountable when the Amsterdam Treaty is ratified, but there must be something that can be done about that.  Senator Norris referred to a Protocol, but it is probably too late to negotiate that now.  However, this needs to be highlighted strongly.  The Council will have to consult the European Parliament about developments in justice and home affairs but, unlike with the Maastricht Treaty, it will not be required to take the Parliament's views into consideration. The Parliament will only have the power to deliver an opinion within three months of new developments, to ask questions of the Council about police co-operation and hold an annual debate on progress in this field.  Whereas in our Parliament we can pass any laws we want governing our Judiciary and police force, the European Parliament will have no control over its police force, which will become our police force eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Huge computer databases will be established by Europol and many categories of data will fill up the system which go far beyond what is necessary for fighting organised crime.  Under the Europol Convention the force may store data, not just on known and suspected criminals but on people who it is presumed will carry out a criminal offence or any potential victim or witness to a crime.  This remit is so wide it will allow data to be stored about virtually everybody.  Individuals will not have the right to inspect the files pertaining to them held by Europol or to correct any false data contained in them.  These files can hold <Col N="1378" /> data on racial origin, religious or other beliefs, political opinions, sexuality and health and lifestyle of suspects &ldquo;if it is absolutely necessary.&rdquo; However, there are no criteria for judging what is &ldquo;absolutely necessary.&rdquo; Many fears have been expressed that this police force could or might target certain groups or individuals out of unfounded prejudice rather than because of any strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that they were involved in organised crime.  One may think this cannot happen, but one only needs to think of the RUC and how it targeted solicitors who were acting for members of the Irish Republican Army.  That has occurred in recent times but the RUC has frequently targeted Nationalist groups and individuals.  The British police has targeted Irish people living in England time and time again and I am sure there are other known examples involving other police forces.  It is not unthinkable in the future that Europol could target groups because they did not fit the European model.</P>
    <P>Europol staff members will enjoy immunity from arrest under rules agreed by EU Ministers last year which will place them above the law. Only the Director of Europol can waive immunity for its staff and it will be more or less at his discretion to decide in what circumstances to do so.  He is supposed to waive it where it might impede the course of justice but only if doing so would be without prejudice to the interests of Europol.  Do we know what we are signing to in the Amsterdam Treaty?  I have no doubt in a few years time people will wake up and ask who were these guys.</P>
    <P>Whenever the judicial body of a member state feels that Europol is likely to abuse its powers and cannot reach agreement with the force about waiving immunity, the Council of Ministers shall unanimously decide on the modalities according to which these disputes will be settled.  However, these powers are not the same as those enjoyed by a police force in the EU and go beyond the immunity enjoyed by many parliamentarians.  In essence, a <i>carte blanche</i> is being given to a new police force to establish data and huge files on any EU citizen presumed to be involved in organised or who has witnessed a crime.  I do not know who thought it up but I am reminded of the Gestapo.</P>
    <P>The Treaty outlines the rights of EU citizens. Jacob Soderman, the European Ombudsman, states with regard to his mandate:</P>
    <P>Thus the European Ombudsman only has a mandate to supervise the institutions and bodies of the European Communities.  Consequently, he has no right to supervise the activities which take place under the third pillar of the Maastricht Treaty, that is Justice and Home Affairs, and he is not entitled to control national authorities, not even when they apply Community law.  This last point in particular constitutes a considerable limitation of the powers of the Ombudsman because, as we all know, the bulk of Community law is actually administered by national authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1379" /> Therefore, he is no good to anyone.  What about petitions to the European Parliament?  The Petitions Committee chaired by Mr. Edward Newman, MEP.  He said about his committee:</P>
    <P>There are various things the Petitions Committee can do.  It can forward the petition to the European Commission to obtain more information and then call on the Commission to take certain action.  It can forward the petition via the European Parliament President to the appropriate national authority.  It can forward the petition, together with a recommendation, to the Council of Ministers.  It can make the petition the subject of a report which will be debated by the European Parliament or it can ask another European Parliament committee that specialises in that issue to deal with the petition.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament is not a judicial authority and so it cannot revoke legal decisions taken by member states.  We can, however, call on the European Commission to refer a case to the European Court of Justice which, after a lengthy period, can result in a member state having to change its law or its practice as a result of a European Court judgment.</P>
    <P>That is not much use.</P>
    <P>I believe this police force is a dangerous development for democracy.  When we take this Treaty as a whole I believe we are establishing an embryonic federal police force.  That should be highlighted in information which comes out on the Treaty as it is very important.  I do not believe we can do much about it but at least we should be aware.</P>
    <P>Neutrality is a vague concept.  Senator Norris said that it is written on the hearts of the Irish people.  According to a number of studies this is not entirely the case.  It is written on the hearts of people opposed to the European Union and it is written as a vague concept.  We all know that if we become part of a federal Europe, we will have a defence policy.  This is axiomatic.  We are pretending if we think we are going to stay completely neutral.  We may be neutral in some areas but when it comes to European defence we will not be.  Eventually there will be a European army if we go on with this.</P>
    <P>The chapter on security and defence in <i>Amsterdam &mdash; What the Treaty Means</i> mentions Article J.7.1. According to this book &ldquo;the &lsquo;eventual framing of a common defence policy&rsquo; becomes the &lsquo;progressive framing&rsquo;.  If that suggests a hardening of the original aspiration it is balanced by the explicit conditions.&rdquo;.  At the moment we do not have to abandon our neutrality to join anything we do not want to, but in future we will have a common defence policy.  We must look at that realistically.  If we join a large European Union which will turn out like the United States, with different languages and cultures but with common foreign policies, we will be defending <Col N="1380" /> these common policies with our common army. The idea may be sold to us in some package but it will eventually happen.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Treaty will come into being and, for the most part, will be good for us but there are some areas, particularly justice, home affairs and the establishment of Europol, about which we must be careful.  These things may slip by without anyone noticing.  If you ask anyone in the street about the provisions of this Treaty or the Maastricht Treaty, few will know.  Few parliamentarians know, but they are there.  Somebody put them in for a reason.  The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty.  I regard this Treaty as part of our ongoing commitment to the European ideal.  I hope the electorate will vote for ratification by a sizeable majority.  Having said that, I am far from happy with the situation in which we find ourselves. I am bemused at both national and European level that we do not seem to have learned the lessons which emerged when we went about ratifying the Maastricht Treaty just a few short years ago.</P>
      <P>I want to set out the lessons we have not learned and I will finish with a concrete suggestion which, if followed through, would greatly reduce the likelihood that we would ever find ourselves in the same position again.  When Maastricht came up for ratification a number of issues were clearly raised.  I want to focus on two gaps identified at that point.  The first was between the needs of Europe as seen by the citizens of Europe and the needs of Europe as seen by the people who administer Europe at national and European level.  The second was a presentational gap, the gap between how Maastricht was put to the people and how it should have been put if was going to be clearly understood by everybody.</P>
      <P>The Maastricht agenda was essentially bureaucratic and administrative in focus.  It covered the single currency and co-operation on issues of justice and foreign affairs.  It streamlined EU decision making and touched lightly on defence issues.  All these issues were important but they were not the most important concerns of the people of Europe at that time.  Maastricht ignored the growing problem of unemployment with which we in Ireland had been living for a long time and which has since come to haunt the rest of Europe.  They were the concerns at the forefront of the minds of the people of Europe but they were not the issues addressed in the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
      <P>Maastricht also completely ignored the mammoth task of involving the people of Europe in the running of Europe, with the exception of some modest powers granted to the European Parliament.  The widespread European backlash against Maastricht which emerged at the time was not due to disagreement to its terms but because people across Europe found it irrelevant to their wants, needs and concerns.  Maastricht was not customer driven but neither was it user friendly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> That brings me to the presentational gap.  I disagree with the suggestion made by Senator Lydon that a copy of the Amsterdam Treaty should have been handed to every citizen.  I found it such a difficult document that I do not know if anyone would be able to get easily through it.  To put it bluntly the Maastricht Treaty was unreadable for lay people.  I am sure everyone in this House who dutifully waded through that 1,000 pages found it a profoundly frustrating experience.  Remember that we as legislators are well used to that stupid and unnecessary convention that all legislation is presented as amendments to existing legislation and those amendments can rarely be understood on their own.  We are asking the people of Europe to embrace 1,000 pages of turgidly phrased amendments on issues which reflected a different set of priorities to those which people have.  One wonders why we were surprised when the Danes rejected it and the French passed it by the merest whisker.  Those reverses gave the powers that be in Europe quite a shock.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sitting suspended at 1 p.m. and resumed at 2 p.m.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned before the sos that the people of Europe were asked to embrace 1,000 pages of turgidly phrased amendments in the Maastricht Treaty on issues which reflected a different set of priorities from those of the people.  We were not surprised that the Danes rejected it in their referendum and that it was only just passed in France.  I thought those reverses gave the powers that be in Europe a shock and I naively considered that the same mistakes would never be made again.  The former Irish Commissioner, Peter Sutherland, expressed the wish at the time that things would be done differently next time round.  However, nothing has changed in the Amsterdam Treaty.  In some respects things are even worse.</P>
      <P>Despite its faults, the Maastricht Treaty at least dealt with issues of profound importance regarding the future of Europe.  Most notably, it set up the framework for economic and monetary union which will dominate our lives for the foreseeable future.  The problem with the Amsterdam Treaty is that it has no central core of importance such as that in the Maastricht Treaty.  The reason for this is simple: the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference which lead to the Treaty was ducked.  The Amsterdam Treaty does not resolve issues; it dodges them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest task of the Intergovernmental Conference before the Amsterdam Treaty was to reform the institutions of Europe in advance of EU enlargement.  These institutions require reform from top to bottom before enlargement can take place.  It would be unthinkable to expand the EU on the basis of arrangements originally designed for only six members which are already coming apart at the seams with 15 members.  The major power struggle involve Ireland directly because they are struggles between the big and <Col N="1382" /> smaller member states.  The imbalance of power among the states, particularly in favour of the smaller member states, which made sense in a Community with only six members is totally unacceptable to the bigger powers in a Community which may eventually have 20 members.</P>
    <P>Under the old system, the bigger member states acting together could always impose their will if necessary.  However, with a membership of 20 countries or more, unless the power sharing structure is changed, the big states will be in a permanent minority even if they act together.  It is not an exaggeration to state that the challenge of reorganising the EU for enlargement is the toughest test the organisation has faced since the original Treaty of Rome.  Unfortunately, the discussions leading up to the Amsterdam Treaty totally fudged this issue.  It is also fudged in the Treaty.  The result is that when one reads the hundreds of pages of legal jargon, one finds little or nothing about this issue.  The problems of enlargement have not been resolved.</P>
    <P>All the big issues have been pushed down the road for resolution at a later date.  The Amsterdam Treaty is no more than a confession of failure to agree, camouflaged by a top dressing of crumbs from the negotiating table.  In a recent newspaper article, former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, for whom I have enormous respect, praised the Treaty because it defends so well Ireland's national interests in the struggle between the big and small member states.  That is the case, but the wider reality is that the Treaty is only a finger in the dyke to temporarily stop the problem.  The tough issues must be resolved before enlargement takes place.  They will not go away and there will come a time when the ducking and dodging must stop.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty celebrates a failure to agree on all the crucial issues.  Therefore, one can understand why the presentation issue has been dodged once again.  The people who created this fudge are not likely to advertise this fact, so the Treaty contains hundreds of pages of legal gobbledygook. Once again there is amendment after amendment going all the way back to the Treaty of Rome.  I offer my sympathy to the body which incredibly has been charged with the responsibility of putting the Treaty fairly and clearly before the public within the next few weeks.  This is an impossible mission.  What will the people of Europe make of it all?  Most of them will not have a chance to express a view because in most countries ratification does not depend on a referendum.</P>
    <P>How can we prevent being in exactly the same position in three or four years?  I have a number of concrete proposals to make to the Government. The first is that there should be a European constitution similar to Bunreacht na hÉireann.  I am sure all Members carry a copy of the Constitution in their briefcases.  It is a short book written in language which, for the most part, can be easily understood.  Any schoolgirl or schoolboy can read through it and immediately get a good <Col N="1383" /> picture of how the State governs itself, together with the principles which underpin administration and the law.  There is no such equivalent in Europe.  From this flows the democratic and information gaps between Europe and its citizens. I urge the creation of a constitution for Europe.</P>
    <P>My second proposal is that it should be obligatory to submit this constitution to the people of all the member states for ratification.  We will only have full and true legitimacy when the EU is endorsed formally by the citizens of Europe. Until then, it will always be the creation and creature of administrators and, to a lesser degree, politicians.  The third proposal is that when a Treaty, such as the Amsterdam Treaty, is negotiated, it must be immediately translated into changes to the European constitution.  These changes must in turn be put to the people for ratification.  Only the changes which the Treaty requires to be made to the European constitution, and not the Treaty itself with all its legal detail, should be put.  Such an initiative would at one strike close all the gaps.</P>
    <P>It would remove the democratic default and all the deficit which exists at present.  It would also solve the information and presentation problems I mentioned.  The people who run Europe would be forced to focus their efforts along channels which relate to citizens' real needs.  They would be dominated in their negotiations and decision making by the need to sell any changes to all the citizens of the European Union.  I do not suggest a council of perfection, but it is not an idealistic fantasy.  It is necessary if the future of Europe is to be fully legitimate.  It is a necessity if the future of Europe is not to be stopped in its tracks by an electorate which finally tires of these bureaucratic exercises which appear to bear no relationship to people's real needs.</P>
    <P>We should establish a European constitution.  I have held this opinion for some time but this is my first opportunity to urge the Government to give it serious consideration.  I spent the weekend in the United States and I was again impressed by the operation of the USA system.  The USA, in common with Ireland and many other EU countries, has a written constitution.  American schoolchildren can read their Constitution and understand the foundation on which their laws are based.  We can refer in the same manner to Bunreacht na hÉireann.  This is the direction Europe should take and I urge the Government to consider seriously taking steps to putting forward the idea of a European constitution.  If so Europe will move in a direction which will strengthen our position in Europe and strengthen Europe for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested to hear Senator Norris's contribution and if he were here I would debate some of the issues with him, although I did so briefly after his contribution.  I compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs for his address, particularly in the context of his commitment to <Col N="1384" /> the all-party talks in the North.  I wish him well in the efforts to bring them to a successful conclusion. I compliment him for a clear, succinct and comprehensive address.</P>
      <P>I am happier to support the revised wording for the referendum than the original text.  I questioned the Leader of the House on a number of occasions seeking information on the new wording. It is unfortunate that the Government published a wording initially which made it more difficult than might have been the case to secure the greatest degree of all-party support.  It would have been advisable for the consultation process which followed the publication of the original wording to have taken place prior to it.</P>
      <P>I am happy with the amended proposal and that it sets out the need for future co-operation and related elaborations of EU law which may evolve under the sections outlined in the second part to be endorsed by the Oireachtas.  This will help to clarify for the electorate the powers for future change contained in the Amsterdam Treaty.  It is important to point out, as the Minister did, that the developments in EU competencies which may follow from the Treaty are in Articles 1.11, 2.5, 2.15 and in the Second and Fourth Protocols.  It is also important to point out that there is nothing there with regard to the possibility of changing military neutrality.</P>
      <P>There is provision under the measures for co-operation in justice and home affairs to negotiate Supplemental Conventions which, when adopted, will have the force of Treaty law.  It is important that such conventions are considered by the Oireachtas.  This is an important duty which we must discharge conscientiously.  Many of the fears expressed by Senator Lydon about the development of Europol and police co-operation can be addressed in the context of those conventions which will in time be considered by us.</P>
      <P>Providing for the consideration of such proposals will enhance the role of the Oireachtas.  We do not scrutinise the performance of the Government at EU Council level to the degree that we might.  We tend to blame the Commission and the bigger member states for decisions, but we do not examine seriously the positions which the Government takes for Council negotiations or the efforts made to implement the decisions taken.  I do not suggest that we go to the extremes of scrutiny of the European Affairs Committee of the Danish Parliament, whereby a Minister going to a Council meeting must get a negotiating mandate the week prior and must report back the week after.  When Sweden acceded to the EU its parliament examined the mechanisms for scrutiny of other member states.  It considered that we have very few such mechanisms, examined the extent of the Danish parliament's scrutiny and attempted to find a median way for itself.  The Oireachtas should seek to follow that course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard I welcome the proposals for greater consultation with COSAC and the national parliaments.  I compliment Deputy Ferris for his work in this regard as chairman of <Col N="1385" /> COSAC during Ireland's recent Presidency of the EU.  We should spend more time scrutinising the Government's performance at EU level, and the powers which the Houses will have to ratify future engagements under the Articles and Protocols outlined should be used strongly and wisely.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is the third substantive amendment to the objectives, structure and powers of the EU.  It follows from the previous amendments made by the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.  I had far more questions about the Maastricht Treaty than about this one.  I found it hard to come down on one side or the other until I heard a speech by Mr. John Hume and was persuaded that on balance it was proper to support it.  There are far fewer changes proposed in the Amsterdam Treaty and I am happy to support them, particularly those which relate to improvements in employment and social policy.</P>
    <P>A large part of the drafting and negotiation of this Treaty was conducted under the Irish Presidency of the Council of Ministers in the second half of 1996 when Deputy Spring was President of the Council.  I compliment the efforts of the Ministers of the then Government and the civil servants in ensuring that the Presidency was successful and for having included in the Treaty many elements of importance for Ireland.  Those who may argue for a return to isolationism and protectionism should note the support that we can harness from like-minded interests in other EU states to ensure that the provisions on employment and social matters can be included in what will become EU law.  It is a matter of deciding whether the glass is half full or half empty, so to speak.  I look at it being half full and we must try to work with like-minded interests to fill it further.</P>
    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty proposes a number of reforms to the major institutions of the EU and the means by which they conduct their affairs. Since 1973 Ireland has continued to enjoy favourable representation within the major institutions <i>vis-à-vis</i> our population.  Under the proposed reforms, Ireland will maintain its right to nominate a member of the Commission.  At the time of the next enlargement of the EU it seems likely that those member states that currently nominate two members of the Commission will lose out, thereby ensuring continued Irish membership of the Commission.</P>
    <P>The structure of the Council of Ministers will remain unaltered, at least until the next enlargement. While most decisions are now reached by consensus or qualified majority voting, Ireland will maintain its right of veto over matters of vital national importance, such as our position of military neutrality.  Furthermore, any future amendments to the Treaty will, as previously, require the unanimous agreement of all member states.</P>
    <P>The Treaty's importance lies in the provisions which will allow the public access to all Commission and Council documents and to reports on how votes in the Council were taken in relation <Col N="1386" /> to the adoption of legislation to be made.  This relates to the scrutiny which we should have on how our Ministers act in the Council.</P>
    <P>The power of the European Parliament are further strengthened by the Treaty.  In terms of legislative power the Parliament is virtually unrecognisable in the European Assembly of 1957.  The greater use of the co-decision procedure substantially strengthens the law making powers of the Parliament and gives the public a greater say through their directly elected members.  The decision to introduce a common method of voting in the election of MEPs is to be welcomed and may afford Ireland the opportunity to look at the introduction of a list system in our electoral process.  The Treaty also provides that the nominee for President of the Commission must be approved by the Parliament. This will provide a direct link between the two and I hope it is a step towards a possible election of the Commission President by EU citizens.</P>
    <P>The Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty focused largely on the market dimensions of the Union.  The Single European Act paved the way for the internal market and Maastricht put in place the process for EMU.  The Amsterdam Treaty provides for new powers in a range of areas which relate much more directly to improving the quality of life of EU citizens.  That is why it is easier for me to give reasons to support this Treaty than for supporting Maastricht.</P>
    <P>Important advances have been made in the area of employment.  The employment policy of the Union should be much stronger, but we should recognise that when the treaty was negotiated, Britain, Germany and other countries were represented by conservative Governments who opposed the notion that the EU should concern itself with employment policy.  In that context it was a significant achievement by the Irish Government to have it included.</P>
    <P>The central economic objective of Maastricht was EMU and there was no specific mention of an employment objective.  The debate since Maastricht has raised in the public mind the necessity for convergence, not just on technical measures associated with EMU but on the necessity for convergence on issues that affect us in everyday life.  The Amsterdam Treaty has as an objective a high level of employment.  While this does not go as far as we would wish, it nevertheless represents a significant advance on the previous position.  To support this objective, a number of measures are indicated to bring higher levels of employment to fruition.</P>
    <P>Important advances have also been made in equality.  As certain occupations are frequently segregated on gender lines, it is sometimes difficult to establish genuine pay equality.  To overcome this difficulty the concept of &ldquo;work of equal value&rdquo; has been incorporated into the Treaty to overcome the difficulties that arise when exact comparators are difficult to establish.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy with the measures to combat discrimination and social exclusion, which <Col N="1387" /> is a polite name for poverty.  The Amsterdam Treaty also provides for the principle of non-discrimination to cover the areas of sexual orientation, race and religion.  This means that for the first time the Council can legislate in this area. People with disabilities are also the subject of a declaration on measures establishing the internal market, which provides that the institutions of the Community must take account of their needs. Actions under this provision only require qualified majority voting which should enable such measures to be more rapidly put into effect.</P>
    <P>The Social Chapter has been strengthened.  The European Union, through the Social Action Programme of the 1970s and 1980s and the Social Chapter in Maastricht, has enabled the introduction of progressive social legislation in Ireland with particular emphasis on workers rights.  The Amsterdam Treaty fully incorporates the Social Chapter, which the United Kingdom had previously opted out of, as part of EU law.  Irish workers will see the greater benefits of this through provisions such as those already adopted and in relation to future measures, particularly in the area of health and safety in the workplace.</P>
    <P>As regards combating poverty, the Treaty contains an amendment on social exclusion.  As the White Paper said, this was a matter of particular interest to Ireland during the negotiation of the new Treaty.  Social exclusion refers to the position of persons who are not merely unemployed but also marginalised and living in poverty as a result of various types of deprivation, including family breakdown, substance abuse and homelessness. Those matters can now be dealt with and responded to at European level; and I compliment former Ministers, such as Deputy De Rossa, who fought strongly against opposition from other countries and succeeded in having that provision included.  The problems we saw with the adoption of the proposed fourth anti-poverty strategy will not arise in the future.</P>
    <P>A central issue in the future is the question of how the European social model can be sustained and developed in a fashion compatible with combating unemployment and promoting the Social Europe Agenda.  This is an agenda to which the Labour Party and the Party of European Socialists are deeply committed.</P>
    <P>Major developments are proposed in the field of justice and home affairs.  The main feature is the adoption into law of the Schengen agreement, which allows for the removal of passport controls between member states as well as the development of common rules on asylum and visas. Ireland has, along with the United Kingdom, decided to opt out of this agreement by means of a protocol.  While it is regrettable that we will not participate in relation to the removal of passport controls, the decision was inevitable following the decision of the UK to opt out.  Irish ratification of Schengen without the UK would most likely have led to a passport requirement for Irish nationals travelling to Great Britain or Northern <Col N="1388" /> Ireland.  We may, however, under the wording of the protocol, participate in other aspects of the Schengen agreement and it is good that we have the capacity to have our voice heard.</P>
    <P>While genuine concerns have been expressed about Europol, the essence of the proposed changes must be recognised.  They are intended to fight organised crime and drug trafficking, issues which concern all member states, none more so than Ireland.  We more than any other country should realise that international co-operation is required to bring criminals to justice.</P>
    <P>To turn to the common foreign and security policy and defence, much has been written about the loss of sovereignty which will occur on ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.  However, the loss of a certain amount of sovereignty is not a new concept in relation to our membership of the European Union.  As far back as 1962 the European Court of Justice had clearly stated that the European Community constituted a new legal order for which member states had limited their sovereign rights in certain fields.  The loss of sovereignty was, therefore, known about prior to Ireland's accession to the Treaty of Rome in 1973.  Many of the more positive changes in Irish law in recent years have arisen through the decision making process of the European Union and the judgments of the European Court of Justice. Businesses, social welfare recipients, workers, holiday makers and students travelling abroad have all benefited from initiatives and decisions of the European institutes.  It could be argued that were it not for the pooling of sovereignty within the European Union, Irish citizens would be in a much poorer position today in relation to a whole host of rights and benefits that we now take for granted.</P>
    <P>As was stated by the Supreme Court in 1986, only by a constitutional amendment may sovereignty be yielded by the Government.  The Amsterdam Treaty provides for less loss of sovereignty than previous Treaties.  However, the conferring of extra decision making powers on the EU institutions alters the questions of sovereignty in some respects and thereby necessitates the holding of a referendum.</P>
    <P>The issue of a common foreign and security policy is one of the most sensitive areas for Ireland.  Since Maastricht, Sweden, Finland and Austria have become members of the Union. While the conditions which were substantially the cause of their neutrality policies &mdash; that is, the Cold War &mdash; have disappeared, their membership of the Union has given rise to a greater diversity of viewpoints on foreign policy, security policy and defence issues, and that is to be welcomed. In fact, it may be argued that agreement on substantial issues in these areas is now more difficult than heretofore and, furthermore, that further widening of membership to include some of the eastern European states will make convergence of policy in these areas more difficult.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, a number of changes are incorporated in the Amsterdam Treaty which need to <Col N="1389" /> be noted.  In the area of common foreign policy unanimity is still required.  However, an institutional capacity is added whereby a senior civil servant of the Council will assist the Presidency in representing the Union.  This role will evolve over time but it is clear that it does not have the capacity to make decisions as these remain the preserve of the national Foreign Ministries led by whichever country holds the Presidency.</P>
    <P>While some people have argued that the replacement of the phrase &ldquo;the Union and its members shall define and implement&rdquo; common foreign policy by the phrase &ldquo;the Union shall define and implement&rdquo; common foreign policy, as a shift away from member states, the retention of decision making in the Council of Foreign Ministers means this change in phraseology is of no practical consequence.</P>
    <P>Much debate on security and defence has focused on Article J7.  This article replaces the phrase &ldquo;the eventual framing of a common defence policy&rdquo; with the phrase &ldquo;progressive framing&rdquo;.  There is no doubt that this change in phraseology represents a marginal change in intention, but it is so constrained by requirements that it is difficult to see effective change in practice. For example, any change requires a unanimous decision by the European Council thus giving Ireland a veto on such changes.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for his clear enunciation of the position on this matter this morning. He outlined the four locks culminating in a referendum by the people, which would have to be unlocked should Ireland's position in relation to common defence be changed.  With respect, I disagree with the opinion expressed by Senator Norris that we could be drawn into a common defence commitment without the necessity of going back to the people.  Apart from the fact that both the present Government and its predecessor stated the people will be consulted by way of referendum on this matter, the Constitution provides that only the Dáil can declare war.  Any entry into a mutual defence commitment would necessitate a change in our existing constitutional provisions.  The people can be doubly reassured on that score.</P>
    <P>Article J7 also refers to the role of the Western European Union but in doing so makes specific reference that &ldquo;this Article shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states&rdquo;.  This provides explicit protection to Ireland's current neutrality. Article J7 defines the content of the common defence policy as including &ldquo;humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking&rdquo;.  Referred to as the Petersburg Tasks, they do not include the collective defence of Western European Union member states' territories arising from mutual assistance guarantees. I have difficulty with the concept of peacemaking but the Dáil approved the involvement of the Defence Forces in such operations under UN <Col N="1390" /> mandate &mdash; one led by NATO &mdash; in the cases of Bosnia and Somalia.</P>
    <P>It is clear that EU international crisis management will continue to be <i>ad hoc</i>&ldquo;coalitions of the willing&rdquo; reflecting member states' different preferences in relation to different situations.</P>
    <P>Environmental protection is substantively strengthened in the Treaty with specific recognition of the need for environmental protection to be considered in relation to all EU funded projects. The Treaty includes a Protocol ensuring proper recognition for the welfare of animals.  It states that this will be recognised by the Community in the implementation of its policies, including agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Treaty places emphasis <i>via</i> a Protocol on a greater role for national parliaments.  I hope the Oireachtas will take up not alone the powers it will have should the Treaty be passed, but also the existing powers we already have but do not use to the extent we should.  The Treaty also makes a declaration in relation to the abolition of the death penalty in accordance with the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>There is some extension of EU involvement in the area of health which is to be welcomed, particularly in the light of our recent experience of problems with blood products.  There is provision for the Council of Ministers to adopt measures to set quality and safety standards in certain areas and to provide incentives for the protection of human health.  However, the harmonisation of national laws and regulations is explicitly excluded.</P>

    <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is a modest step towards European integration.  The proposals in Maastricht particularly relating to monetary union are now nearing completion and it is important that the European Union should address new goals and objectives.  The inevitable political and national compromises that were required to bring Amsterdam to conclusion have led to a lesser set of objectives than might have been hoped for.  However, the proposals as agreed help in furthering the process of integration and alongside enlarged membership will significantly assist the process of greater co-operation across the entire continent of Europe. Ireland has gained in many ways beyond financial support through our membership of the European Union.  Most of the progressive developments in our labour, social and environmental legislation have been brought forward by the European Union.</P>
    <P>Developments in areas as diverse as company, insurance and competition law, liability for defective products and consumer protection have emanated <Col N="1391" /> from the European Union.  The ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty will help further our development with the introduction of further progressive legislation and will maintain our position at the centre of a new and enlarged European Union while retaining our capacity to maintain our traditional neutrality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to discuss this important and farreaching legislation.  I am curious to explore what the current mood is in Europe regarding this Treaty.  From what I have read, we are fortunate that this Treaty has been agreed as a move towards further integration of the institutions in Europe and a closer co-operation between member states.  I say we are fortunate because the impression seems to be gaining ground that there is a loosening of the determination for further and deeper integration between Germany and France.  That has been fuelled primarily by the reunification of Germany which has resulted in a reconfiguration of German thinking on an East-West basis.  Allied to that, the decision to relocate the German Parliament from Bonn back to Berlin reorients thinking within Germany.  For the first time since the war it has placed Germany in what it sees as its natural habitat as the centre of a psychological middle Europe, albeit geographically non-existent.</P>
      <P>This thinking is allied to the decision by the European Union to further expand its membership. This is a significant point because the expansion is inevitably from the east since most of the western European countries have already signed up.  In the next few years that expansion will bring in Poland, a large and powerful economic entity with some 60 million people, the Czech Republic to the south of Germany, Slovenia, one of the former Yugoslavian states and Hungary, which is next to Austria.  Ironically, that will bring about a rather exciting realignment of the old Austro-Hungarian empire.  I mention that for historic rather than any other reasons because that empire was past its sell-by date.</P>
      <P>In outlining these changes, the impression seems to be gaining ground that the strong axis between France and Germany &mdash; which has provided the engine room of development, particularly in the political arena, over the last 30 years &mdash; may be loosening to some degree.</P>
      <P>While I do not anticipate the Minister will deliver a lengthy discourse on what is effectively an academic view of where Europe is going, I look forward to his views on the points I have raised regarding the relocation of the German Parliament, the expansion of the Union eastwards and the impact this is having on Germany and on German attitudes to the EU.  Perhaps he would also comment on how this will impact on the Union and on Ireland over the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted that Europe, its bureaucrats, civil servants and politicians woke up in time to salvage what appeared to be a serious crisis among the citizens regarding their commitment <Col N="1392" /> to further development post Maastricht.  It is apparent from the thrust of the Amsterdam Treaty that there has been a realignment of thinking at the highest level in Europe and among the member states towards more citizen oriented policies.  That is to be welcomed.  The democratic deficit loomed so large as to threaten the future stability of Europe.  The results of the referenda consequent on the Maastricht Treaty provided the warning signs, especially in France and Denmark.</P>
    <P>It was a miracle that the Danish Government managed to overturn a serious and important referendum result within a short time.  What would have happened in Ireland if we had failed to vote for the Maastricht Treaty?  Would the Government have been able and confident enough to go back to the people within a short period of time with the same question in the hope they would reverse their decision?  This is what happened in Denmark and it was a good thing, because although we in Ireland have had a traditional enthusiasm for Europe, that has increasingly not been the case among the founding countries of the then EEC.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent we in Ireland were inured from that type of thinking because the gravy train has been running since 1973.  While it would be unfair to suggest that our only interest in Europe arises from the economic benefits, there is no question but that people in Ireland have benefited substantially.  We are more prosperous as a result of the initiatives taken by our European colleagues in the creation of Structural Funds and the continuation of the Social Fund.  Although it is not dealt with specifically in this Treaty, I hope Ireland will continue to fight strenuously for a continuance of EU structural and social funding into the early part of the new millennium.</P>
    <P>While the arguments are well made, it bears repeating in this House and other public fora that there are gross economic disparities within this country which must be addressed.  If there is any diminution in EU Structural and Social Funds to the affected areas &mdash; the Border regions and parts of the west, stretching from Counties Donegal to Kerry &mdash; the question of subsidiarity will be an academic exercise for the citizens of those parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the social inclusion aspirations in the Treaty and the definitive statements that have been made in this regard.  After unemployment, social exclusion is the greatest problem facing the citizens of this country.  Social exclusion knows no geographical boundaries.  It is to be found in my home town of Drumshanbo and the suburbs of Clondalkin.  They may be different manifestations but they are two sides of the same coin.  If the Government did nothing else in the lead up to the millennium and the expansion of Europe but address the problems our citizens face in those areas, it will have achieved a great deal.</P>
    <P>While we can have academic argument about the 15 Articles of the Treaty, go through it line by line, discuss the Schengen agreement and <Col N="1393" /> other buzz words, such as flexibility, for the vast majority of people its social and economic impact will decide whether Europe continues to function and progress along the path it has chosen.  In this regard, I welcome the emphasis on social exclusion and on the priority given to unemployment. These were absent from the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    <P>Consumer policy has been identified as an area of prime importance by the Treaty.  Behind the worthy phrase &ldquo;defence of consumer interests&rdquo; is the reality of pricing.  There are gross disparities in pricing within the EU.  For example, why should citizens of this country pay more to buy a motor vehicle than citizens in Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK or some other EU countries? Why have we tolerated this iniquitous vehicle registration tax, which has been proposed and encouraged by successive Administrations once they found a way around the relevant EU directive? They will continue to get away with it because the EU has no competence in the setting of internal tax policy.  That is not a free Europe and it does not make any contribution to the ideal of a Single Market, where we speak in lofty terms about the free movement of goods, people and services.  The sooner the Government starts to dismantle this tax the sooner we will move towards a more equitable situation.</P>
    <P>We are the largest economic trading block in the world, yet, as my colleagues who have visited the US will testify, one will pay half the price there for the same goods as one will pay in this country, France, Germany or England.  Why is this?  I am pleased the EU Commission has woken up to the fact and has in recent weeks indicated that there is now the beginnings of a debate.  I will be interested in the Minister's comments on the Irish contribution.  It does not appear logical that if we are creating a big trading block, our consumer prices are greater than the American model, on which we have to a large extent based our economic model, even down to the creation of a single currency.</P>
    <P>Labelling is another area of consumer policy that is of interest to the citizen.  There is no uniformity in the labelling of food products across the EU and there are still unscrupulous, large corporations operating within the EU who are hiding behind subterfuge and double speak, which is not in the best long-term interest of the health of the citizens of the EU.  Much has been done and I applaud the efforts of the EU Commission, but a great deal more needs to be done. Again, I am interested in ascertaining Ireland's input into this important area of consumer policy.</P>
    <P>We live in a world of great uncertainty, especially in the food chain area.  Our people need to be reassured.  Our lakes, rivers and seas are being polluted on a regular basis.  As an island nation, we have a proud reputation as a food exporting country.  Our success in agriculture has been because of our clean, green image.  We jealously guard that image, which is now under threat.  Farming organisations in Europe recently <Col N="1394" /> picketed outside the Commission building while Agriculture Ministers were inside.  I compliment our Minister, Deputy Walsh, on holding firm to protect Irish agriculture but the reality is that we are losing the power to involve ourselves in this area.  However, the Amsterdam Treaty will go some way towards allaying those fears.</P>
    <P>I have no real problem defending Europe's borders.  The greatest weakness of the European Union has been an absence of a common foreign and defence policy.  This came to fruition with the explosion of hatred and war in the former Yugoslavia. That stands as a black mark on European cohesion which I hope will never be repeated.  At least, the megalomaniac and tyrant Slobodon Milosevic has not been allowed to sweep the events in Kosovo under the carpet.  I applaud the cohesion Europe is showing in that area.  I have no difficulty with our movement towards a common foreign policy as long as our borders are at issue.</P>
    <P>I join my colleagues in welcoming this initiative and debate.  I wish all of us well on this ship as we sail into the new millennium.</P>

      <P>We must sell the Amsterdam Treaty to the public.  As we enter the new millennium our country will become increasingly involved with the European Union and it is important for our young people to be confident and forward looking. The boundaries of European countries have frequently changed as a result of wars but European ideas and philosophies have echoed forever in the world, particularly the ideals of the French Revolution of liberty, equality and fraternity which, unfortunately, are still sought in some countries.</P>
      <P>The Irish nation has historically been very insular in its views and has had a limited involvement in Europe.  The tremendous investment made by the EU over the past ten or 15 years in our roads, environment and infrastructure has made a magnificent contribution to Ireland.  Young people, in particular, have a great confidence and awareness and feel very much part of Europe.  European studies are very highly thought of in our schools. The passing of this Treaty will be an act of faith for our young people.  We are Europeans who want to play our full part in Europe.  We are a highly educated, young country which can contribute greatly to the European Union, which will undoubtedly expand in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Defence policy is important.  There has been trouble in the Balkan region for centuries.  I agree with the thoughtful contributions of Senator Mooney and others that there will be serious problems as Europe expands.  We are not in an historic position as a country to understand the problems in areas such as the former Yugoslavia or to know how to solve them.  However, we can, as a nation, give a commitment to Europe to <Col N="1395" /> solve the problems which will affect the borders of that country.</P>
    <P>We have an increasing part to play in supporting a policy of peace in Europe.  It is shocking to read about the horrors which occur in those countries, which are much more strife torn than Northern Ireland.  It is up to the Government to decide, through a referendum, what role we have to play but I think we should be more involved in such issues.  We must play our full part, without offending anyone's policies on neutrality.</P>
    <P>I was at a meeting yesterday with the Environmental Protection Agency concerning an asbestos issue in County Louth.  There is an EU directive on hazardous waste but, unfortunately, it does not mention asbestos.  However, it was great to be able to refer in a debate which affected a small community in County Louth which was concerned about the effect on public health of an asbestos dump which was built without planning permission, to EU rules and laws and to get what we think will be a very sensible and scientific investigation of the issue.  The local authority was unable to deal with the matter because, unlike the EPA, it did not have the necessary knowledge.  It is great to see the European Union is filtering down to the little village of Togher in County Louth.</P>
    <P>I look forward to my three young children playing their part in Europe.  It is as easy for them to travel to Brussels, London or Bonn as it is to travel to Cork.  Young people will be happy to support this Treaty as am I.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney referred to the fact that consumer goods are much more expensive in Ireland than in the US.  I investigated that as far as I could; I discovered a cartel operates in Ireland in the clothing sector whereby wholesalers will not supply to shops which sell the clothes at less than the price the wholesalers set.  The solution is for the relevant Minister &mdash; I presume it is Deputy Harney &mdash; to tackle such cartels, particularly in the clothing trade.  It is an absolute disgrace that clothes are three times more expensive here than in New York, even allowing for a weaker currency.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I look forward to playing my full part in the debate.  I wish the European Union every success and I look forward to my children playing their part in the future of Europe.</P>

      <P>I thank those who contributed to this important debate.  The Amsterdam Treaty, concluded in June 1997 and signed in Amsterdam in October 1997, has not sprung out of thin air.  In a debate on its merits it is important, therefore, to situate the Treaty by outlining briefly the challenges it is designed to address, the context in which it was negotiated and the constraints which applied in those negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1396" /> The European Union faces a complex and constantly evolving array of challenges.  The Union must accommodate significant further enlargement while at the same time continuing the process of closer European integration.  The widening and deepening of the Union must go hand in hand. Senator Mooney made interesting comments about the long-term prospects for the EU and the future attitudes and commitments of some of the larger member states.  I agree that some of the long held assumptions may be under review at present if not under threat.  It is important that the governments and people of Europe do not begin to take the EU and the process of integration for granted.</P>
    <P>The Union must retain and, if possible, increase public support.  The European Union belongs to its citizens.  It can only succeed and deserve to succeed if it addresses their direct concerns. Its priorities must be the priorities of its people.  Its functioning must be open and effective and its institutions must deserve and retain the confidence of the public.  The Union must also chart a direction for its future development.  It is not fixed in stone.  It must combine the ability to act at European level when necessary, with the right to act at national level when appropriate.  A delicate balance is required.</P>
    <P>It is important to understand also the context in which the intergovernmental conference which negotiated the Amsterdam Treaty sought to address these challenges.  As far as the past is concerned, the European Union of today has been created and shaped by a series of Treaties negotiated over a period of almost 50 years.  The Amsterdam Treaty amends those existing Treaties and constitutes another step in a process to which the Irish people have committed themselves on several occasions.  I emphasise that the Treaty provisions on Economic and Monetary Union have not been affected in any way.  As far as the future is concerned, the negotiations were not only aimed at equipping the Union to tackle more effectively key issues such as unemployment and crime, but were also designed to take a step towards shaping the enlarged European Union of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The intergovernmental conference operated on the basis of unanimity.  No Treaty change could be agreed unless every member state accepted it.  This requirement was an appropriate and necessary protection for each member state. However, an awareness of this self-evident constraint is necessary to any understanding of the negotiations and any evaluation of the outcome. Many people, freed of such constraint, might have written the perfect Treaty &mdash; perfect, except that it would lack the balanced welding together of national perceptions, aspirations, sensitivities and interests which lie at the heart of the European Union.  It is that welding together of difference in the common interest which still makes the European Union the most exciting venture in relations <Col N="1397" /> between free democratic countries anywhere and at any time.</P>
    <P>Support for the Treaty is rightly understood as support for the continued, full and committed participation of Ireland in the process of European integration.  The Amsterdam Treaty is a good deal for Ireland, for Europe and for the European citizen.  It addresses core issues which affect daily life throughout Europe, such as employment, the environment, social policy, in which all 15 member states will now participate, public health, consumer rights and combating discrimination, including provision for protection for the disabled.  It establishes fundamental rights on a treaty basis for the Union.  It creates a framework in which freedom of movement can be progressively realised to the maximum extent possible. It couples this with flanking measures in areas such as external border controls and fighting international crime.</P>
    <P>There will also be widespread support for those aspects of the Treaty which deal with the related areas of freedom of movement and fighting international crime.  The aim of the Treaty in this area is to enhance the capacity of member states to ensure the safety of their own citizens by developing common action among themselves in the fields of police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters.  The Amsterdam Treaty subjects this type of co-operation, which has been developed in the Union since Maastricht, to democratic and judicial controls for the first time. I emphasise that the new role which the Amsterdam Treaty assigns to the European Parliament and to the European Court of Justice in third pillar matters will help to ensure that co-operation between member states in police and judicial matters develops in accordance with the principles of fundamental rights which are enshrined in the Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Treaty is a good deal for Europe because it strengthens and makes more coherent the foreign policy capacity of the Union and better prepares the Union for the next historic enlargement phase.  Importantly for Ireland, there is no change in the right of each member state to nominate a full member of the Commission.  In advance of the Union's membership exceeding 20, the Union's institutions will be further examined to ensure that the functioning of the Union is not impaired by enlargement.  The outcome of this future review of the Union's institutions is not prejudged in any way.</P>
    <P>I welcome and endorse the view that the European Union should play a full and positive role on the international stage.  I want to take up some of the issues raised by Senators during the debate. I repeat in the clearest possible terms that Ireland's neutrality is not affected by this Treaty. This Government's commitment, which repeats commitments given by successive Governments, to put the issue of a common defence to the <Col N="1398" /> people for decision, if it were ever to arise in the future, ensures that the issue of military neutrality remains one for the people to decide.</P>
    <P>The EU does not aspire to become a nuclear superpower, waging war on neighbouring countries or regions and there is nothing in the Amsterdam Treaty which supports such a contention. The inclusion of the Petersberg tasks in the new Treaty should not be seen as a threat to the United Nations.  Successive Secretaries-General, including Mr. Kofi Annan, have called for greater regional support for the efforts of the United Nations in the peacekeeping and crisis management areas.  The Treaty explicitly situates the CFSP in the context of the principles of the UN Charter.</P>
    <P>In recent years the experience of the international community in former Yugoslavia, Albania and the Great Lakes region of Africa have all demonstrated that if the international community is going to play a role in conflict management and post-conflict rehabilitation, a greater degree of commitment from the EU is required.  The progressive framing of a common defence policy is situated in the context of the Petersberg tasks, which were conceived in the context of support for the UN and OSCE.  This is in line with Ireland's position on international peacekeeping, an area where the members of our Defence Forces and Garda Síochána have served with distinction for many years with the popular and proud support of the Irish people.  Ireland wants the EU to make an improved contribution to international peace and security in accordance with the principles of the UN charter.  We are willing to contribute to these tasks on a case by case and voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>It was suggested this morning that Ireland could be brought unwillingly into participation in international actions.  This is absolutely not the case.  I repeat that any participation by Ireland in conflict prevention or crisis management tasks under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty would be on a voluntary and case by case basis.</P>
    <P>It was asked why Ireland did not seek an opt-out or protocol in relation to the CFSP provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam as Denmark had done.  This comparison is misleading.  Denmark is a member of NATO, and its concerns have been based not on a policy of neutrality, but on a concern that NATO's role in European security and defence should not be undermined.  I should also point out that as there is no threat to Ireland's neutrality in the Treaty of Amsterdam, the question of an opt-out or protocol to protect our position does not arise.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not a member of the Western European Union and has no intention of joining.  Our three fellow neutral members of the EU, Austria, Finland and Sweden are, like Ireland, observers at the Western European Union.  The importance of our continuing observer status in the Western <Col N="1399" /> European Union is underlined by the inclusion in the Amsterdam Treaty of the Petersberg Tasks, which will be carried out by the Western European Union at the instigation of the EU.  Integration of the Western European Union into the EU is not an agreed objective of the EU and is not provided for anywhere in the Treaty or its Protocols.  The Amsterdam Treaty's provisions on the common foreign and security policy are in keeping with Ireland's constructive approach to foreign policy.</P>
    <P>It is clearly in Ireland's interest and in accordance with our long established European policy to be at the heart of the process of European integration. The Government and, I believe, the people of Ireland would wish the State to have the capacity and the freedom to continue to participate fully in the Union's development.  The wording of the constitutional amendment contained in the Bill before the House, and which the Government proposes to put to the people will, if accepted, ensure that Ireland can remain at the heart of the European project.  The tasks ahead in the process of European integration are very significant for the development of peace and security in Europe as a whole.  Ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty is a next and necessary step in the completion of those tasks.  I believe this view is shared by the overwhelming majority in this House.  The views expressed in this debate encourage me to have confidence that the Government's support for the Amsterdam Treaty will be endorsed by the people as a whole in the forthcoming referendum.</P>

      <P>However, there is a fundamental flaw in what the Minister said on this issue.  In my view the proposed amendment will, for the first time, place in the Constitution our position of neutrality.  The Minister has said it will not have this effect but, in my view, it will.  I believe that to give a constitutional basis to Ireland's neutrality will be a retrograde step.  I am concerned that a body of opinion holds that the Amsterdam Treaty threatens our neutrality and will lead to Ireland becoming part of a European military alliance.  The contrary is the case.  As a result of this constitutional amendment our neutrality will be formally framed in the Constitution and cannot be changed unless an intergovernmental conference is held on the issue, the Council of Ministers unanimously agrees to the change and a referendum is held here.  It is dangerous for the Government to articulate the view that the proposed amendment will not alter Ireland's position of neutrality.</P>

If we are to communicate our message before 22 May it is important that we use straightforward language rather than the jargon of high diplomacy, which is meant only for the select few. I hope the officials will further dilute and simplify the detail surrounding this issue.  It is fundamental that the Government should ensure that the question of neutrality is clearly presented to the people.  In my view, the Minister seems to take a different position on this matter.</P>

Much discussion and negotiation took place and member states had to compromise to ensure that everyone was satisfied with the final conclusions.  While I would prefer the Treaty to be stronger in certain areas, we must recognise that it was developed in tandem with negotiations on economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>The officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs are to be complimented for their efficiency and effectiveness.  They are some of the most competent and capable people in Europe. In the past Irish interests were well protected through their efforts and we have gained many benefits since 1973, particularly from the negotiations on the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty.  We will continue to benefit but we are now faced with having to make a contribution. We will do so with the generosity traditionally associated with the Irish people.

      <Col N="1405" /> We have decided to put before the people a proposal to change the Constitution.  Those of us who agree that it should be changed in the direction outlined in the debate have a job to convince the people in that regard.  We will not be able to engage in an eve of vote plea to people to vote in favour of acceptance because of the money involved.  Perhaps that is good because we will be obliged to address the substantive issues.</P>
    <P>I wish the new commission well in its arrangements for putting the information, pro and con, to the people.  It has a major job to do.  However, I am sure it will be no worse than the efforts made in respect of the bail referendum when one needed a magnifying glass to read the details printed in newspaper advertisements.  I trust the Commission's efforts will be more comprehensive and easier for people to understand.  A number of meetings will be organised during the campaign at which arguments in favour of and against acceptance will be put forward.  I look forward to taking part in them.</P>
    <P>It is good that money is not an argument because our eyes might be opened to the real success of the European Union.  This morning I stated that I had been convinced to vote in favour of the Maastricht Treaty by virtue of a speech made by John Hume in Galway.  He placed the conflict in this country, which we are currently trying to resolve, in the context of the peace which has existed in Europe since the foundation of the European Economic Community.  It is within that context that we have a duty to advocate our arguments.  I trust that the referendum will be successful.</P>

    <Title>Fishing Industry: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann recognises the vital role of the fishing industry in sustaining Ireland's coastal communities and supports the continuing efforts by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Dr. Michael Woods, T.D., to safeguard the livelihoods of Irish fishermen and develop the industry to its potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1406" /> The tabling of this motion gives us an opportunity to reflect on what has happened in the fishing industry in the past few months and on its future. As this motion concerns the fishing industry and as I did not get an opportunity to do so previously, I wish to express my deep regret at the tragic death of the former Minister for the Marine, the late Deputy Coveney.  He was a nice man who berthed his yacht in our harbour on several occasions.  When I visited his office when he was Minister I always felt I was speaking to a friend and he always treated me well.</P>
    <P>The motion speaks for itself.  People living on the north-west, west and south coasts depend mainly on the fishing industry for their livelihood. It sustains our coastal towns and provides good employment.  I wish to mention some of the measures introduced in the past few months which will boost the industry.  Members on both sides of the House have made representations on numerous occasions to implement a scheme for the renewal of our fleet.  It was recognised here and in the EU that our fleet was dilapidated.  The Minister made a major breakthrough by introducing a scheme, included in the Finance Bill, which I described to fishermen in Dingle as a type of urban renewal scheme for fishing boats.  Before one starts fishing, one must have a good boat. Our fleet was not kept as technologically up to date as those of other countries.  The Minister will explain this package in more detail and the way in which it will operate.</P>
    <P>An £11 million investment in the fishing fleet was announced by the Minister last October, including £3 million in EU and State aid.  Different announcements have been made in the past few months.  On a matter which was a bone of contention for many years, the Minister obtained an extra 5,000 gross tonnes to regulate small boats and those which did not have an up to date licence.  This regularised the licensing and registering of about 1,000 fishing vessels, which was an important step.  The extra 5,000 tonnes will not come out of our overall tonnage.  The Minister and his officials made a special argument for the granting of extra tonnage; this is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>As regards the Minister walking out in Brussels, it is a pity someone did not do the same 30 years ago to show that we meant business.  We have a small fleet and there is a massive amount of fish in our seas, particularly off the west coast. Some of the commentators at the time said that the walkout was a sham, that the Minister did so to show the fishermen he was with them but there was nothing behind it.  However, the Minister gained 12,000 extra tonnes of mackerel because of that walkout and since then he has been taken more seriously.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made many other statements and announcements.  When I was chairman of the Dingle Harbour Commissioners I received many letters and deputations at the start of the herring season asking me to do something about herring. <Col N="1407" /> I made representations to the Minister which were acted upon quickly and a special task force was set up, which is still in operation, to come to grips with the problems of herring fishing.  I wrote to Emma Bonino but did not expect to get a reply.  However, she sent me a reply that was curt and to the point stating that agreements made internationally could not be broken and she had no intention of breaking this agreement.</P>
    <P>Three weeks after I received her reply there was a headline in a newspaper &mdash;&ldquo;Woods Resists Tuna Ban&rdquo;.  The Minister succeeded in straightening out most of the problem.  A total of 23,000 tonnes of herring were dumped into the EEC which put the kibosh on the herring industry at that time.  Our total quota was approximately 25,000 tonnes and to allow Norway into the EEC without any duty on these fish was crazy.  Norway has 741,000 metric tonnes of herring in its waters; 73,660 tonnes in the North Sea; 3,000 tonnes in area 6b and 11,180 tonnes in the Baltic Sea giving a total quota of 828,840 metric tonnes.  To allow such a country to dump the equivalent of our quota in the EU market was crazy.</P>
    <P>On 24 March, the tuna ban came up for discussion. Tuna may account for a small part of our fishing industry but we changed our fishing methods to conform with the EU and then the EU introduced rules and regulations that prevent us from partaking in that type of fishing.  Tuna fishing has come on over the past number of years, especially in Dingle, Castletownbere and Dunmore East.  The Minister obtained agreement not to ban tuna fishing this year and over the next couple of years the issue will be examined in a different light.  The reason for the ban is that we are one of the few countries that drift net for tuna whereas other countries, such as France, long line for it and have no problem accepting a ban on drift net fishing.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to continue as he is and not to be afraid of walking out of any meeting.  I am delighted he is doing that.  I hope the debate will be constructive because we are all in this together.  A few years ago there were big arguments about who got £5 billion or £6 billion from the EU for Ireland and when the Taoiseach came home we were delighted he had received such a sum for investment in Ireland.  Every year Ireland gives £2 billion of fish to other countries in Europe and in the words of our fishermen &ldquo;we are sharing our wealth with Europe.  Europe is not sharing its natural resources with us&rdquo;.  I hope the Minister keeps up the good work.  He is doing a great job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is very much on top of his brief and knows the fishing industry well, from Donegal to my constituency in Cork South-West.  I compliment him on promulgating and promoting a major development in Union Hall a number of years ago.  He visited places that were forgotten, such as Roaring Water Bay and Schull and his visits were much appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1408" /> I concur with the praise given to the Minister by Senator Fitzgerald and his views on the tuna fish ban.  Tuna fishing is worth £4 million to the south-west region and I thank the Minister for making it a big issue in Europe recently because in the absence of scientific evidence the EU proposed a ban on drift net tuna fishing.  This would cripple fishermen in the south west while the Spanish would still be able to fish for the same tuna using trolling and long line methods.  In the Baltic Sea, there is no restriction on this type of fishing for Sweden, Finland and Denmark. Consequently, the Minister should stand firm and redouble his efforts in this regard because this is so valuable for these fishermen who take up tuna fishing when the white fish season is virtually over, particularly in May and June.</P>
    <P>I refer to the harassment of Irish trawlers in our waters and I laud the Minister for his efforts to deal with this ongoing problem.  A trawler owner from Castletownbere rang me today to say he was forced off fishing grounds 70 or 80 miles south-west of Mizen Head at 3 a.m. by a couple of UK registered Spanish vessels.  These flagships of convenience bullied him off the fishing grounds.  These incidents, only some of which are logged, occur on a weekly basis.  A well known local fisherman, Danny Boy O'Driscoll, lost his life in such an incident off the Castletownbere coast just over a year ago.  Admittedly, that accident was caused by someone who, with total neglect and a total disregard for the waters, put a big trawler on automatic pilot which cut through the fishing vessel.  It was lucky other lives were not lost on that occasion.  This is what our fishermen face.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the EU Common Fisheries Policy is free access to fishing grounds for member states.  The blackguardism and intimidation attempts by these large foreign vessels which have occurred over the past ten or 12 years must not be allowed to continue.  I urge the Minister to stand firm on this very serious issue, otherwise lives will be lost.</P>
    <P>The big problem seems to be caused by UK registered but Spanish owned flagships of convenience. Genuine French and Spanish trawlers do not have a problem with their Irish counterparts. I am not sure if we can undo the damage that has been done but these ships have created big problems.  I understand the French and Italians are supporting our position on tuna fishing.  I urge the British EU Presidency to row in behind the Irish position.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposals in the Finance Bill for tax incentives for investment in our aging fishing fleet, and not before time.  However, I urge that this be promoted in the fishing ports, whether they are in Donegal, the west, Dunmore East or Castletownbere, so that a great deal of money can be pumped in over the next three or four years.  Senator Fitzgerald was quite accurate in his comparison of this type of investment in the fishing fleet to the urban renewal schemes for towns which lack development.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> I am puzzled by the anomaly in relation to special tax allowances for seafaring people.  A full-time seafaring person, whether a commercial or passenger vessel, receives a special tax concession. However, this tax incentive does not apply to full-time fishermen who often have to spend 70 or 80 hours at sea, particularly those in the south-west who spend ten hours getting to the fishing grounds.  I am sure the unions have lobbied very hard for seafaring people whose trips across the Irish Sea usually take about three or four hours.  I urge the Minister to have a closer look at this matter.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to raise probably comes under the brief of the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  There still seems to be confusion about the worth of social welfare benefits to genuine fishermen.  Many fishermen do not have pension funds and something should be done in this regard.  If a fisherman is unemployed for ten or 12 weeks due to bad weather he should have easy access to social welfare benefits.  Ordinary crewmen who do not own a vessel should have something more to look forward to at the end of their days than, as the song says, ending up in Fiddlers' Green when they die.  I urge the Minister to sort out the social welfare anomalies for fishermen.</P>
    <P>I requested this debate on several occasions on the Order of Business.  I compliment the Minister on what he has achieved to date.  He is familiar with and on top of his brief.  I urge him to redouble his efforts because for many decades the fishing industry played second fiddle to agriculture. We lost out at times when we could have got better quotas.  It does not make sense that Ireland has almost 25 per cent of European waters but only 5 per cent of the quotas.  I am sure the Minister will do everything possible to support the industry.  I could talk for another 30 minutes on many other aspects of this motion but my time is restricted.</P>

      <P>I would be the first to admit there are many hard working Ministers in the Government, although I do not know if the present Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources fits into that category.  The public perception in my part of the north-west is that he is not doing enough to promote and develop the marine industry and to exploit the great wealth and job creating potential of all marine based industries, including marine tourism and leisure and marine food processing.  The fishing industry has virtually ceased to exist in my region.  I will not dwell for too long on fishing because there are many other sectors of the marine industry.  However, I compliment the Minister on playing hard ball with the Europeans and on what I hope he will achieve in relation to fish quotas, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, which is on the edge on the Europe, has over 900,000 square kilometres of seabed as defined in the marine designated area.  This has nothing to do with the 200 mile EU fishing zone and amounts to ten times our land mass.  The <Col N="1410" /> international law of the sea allows us to lay legal claim to that area.  In short, 90 per cent of Ireland's current territory lies under water.</P>
    <P>The importance of this resource is illustrated by the fact that over 90 per cent of our trade exports and imports are carried by sea.  Some four million people travel into and out of Ireland annually on international ferries; 51 per cent of Ireland's population live on the coast and 86 per cent live within 50 kilometres of the sea.  Ireland has the highest seabed area <i>per capita</i> in the EU, 14 times the EU average, and a very extensive coastline of 7,100 kilometres.  Although the marine food sector, fishing, aquaculture and sea food processing are under-developed, they are worth approximately £200 million per annum, that is, 0.5 per cent of our GDP, and provide over 15,000 jobs, or 1.4 per cent of the workforce, and up to 25 per cent of the workforce in some coastal areas.</P>
    <P>The attraction of Ireland's long coastline, with its outstanding natural beauty, is a major source of tourism revenue.  Ireland's 900,000 square kilometres of seabed provides technological opportunities in internationally traded areas such as operational oceanography, oil and gas exploration. Ireland also has one of the highest wave energy climates in the world.  The market for marine technologies in which Ireland is building some expertise is estimated to be worth $5 billion annually, increasing at a rate of 5 per cent per annum. Clearly the sea is a critical resource for Ireland and one offering huge potential returns for strategic planning and investment.</P>
    <P>A major step forward in regenerating the marine industry was taken by the late Deputy Coveney, when he was Minister for the Marine in March l995.  He commissioned the consultative process which led to the publication by the Marine Institute of a document entitled <i>Towards Marine Policy for Ireland</i> in September 1996.  This document is a blueprint for the development of the entire marine based industries in Ireland, and yet nothing has been done about it by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources or his Department.  It is as if the document never existed.</P>
    <P>This comprehensive consultative process, begun by the Marine Institute, was to enable us to look at the potential of marine based industries in Ireland.  Every organisation which had any connection whatsoever with the marine industry gave a submission, 146 organisations in all contributed. The end result is a document that charts the way forward for the entire marine based industries, and yet the Minister has done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>The document on marine policy states that there are seven major ports, all on the east coast, and they handle 89 per cent of all traffic to Irish ports.  Dublin and Cork account for half of the total; Dun Laoghaire and Rosslare are principally ferry ports and have relatively small volumes of trade and the Shannon Estuary port, Limerick and Foynes handle trade only and between them account for 28 per cent of all port traffic in the <Col N="1411" /> Republic, which is partly due to the large imports of coal and oil for the generation of electricity at Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>There is no deep sea port along the west coast.</P>
    <P>Everything produced on the west and north west has to be transported to either Foynes, Dublin or Larne.  The only regional port on the west coast is Galway and this is a landlocked port incapable of any further development.  Community based development organisations in the north west have waged an ongoing campaign over the past few years to establish a deep sea port in Killala bay, just seven miles outside Ballina.  So far there has been very little response from the Government. The extent of the Department's commitment to this project has been a mere £5,000 grant for an initial survey, which established beyond all doubt that this is a natural choice for a deep sea port because there is deep sheltered water within 30 metres of the shoreline.  An investment of about £20,000 million would be needed to fund the entire project.  If it were to go ahead it would provide economic regeneration for the north west. We already have anchor industries in place to make the project viable and we know there is potential for further investment.</P>
    <P>Is it the Government's policy to continue to haul all our export products across the country to be exported from Dublin and further clog the city with articulated trucks?  A major investment in a deep sea port in the north west is also prerequisite to the future development of our fishing industry along the west coast.</P>
    <P>Only recently we have recognised the possibilities for wealth and job creation which exist within our coastal and vast shore areas.  There is huge scope for development when we realise that Ireland's sea bed area is ten times the size of its landmass.  The sea bed resources include sand, gravel, algae and heavy mineral deposits with the possibility of valuable metallic deposits offshore. The total value of these resources could exceed the value of our onshore resources by a factor of ten to one, and yet this Minister has done nothing about it.</P>
    <P>In relation to renewable energies the Marine Institute, in its report, stated: &ldquo;Ocean energy can be harnessed in the form of tidal energy and ocean thermal energy from the ocean currents&rdquo;. The Irish wave energy resource is very large, with current estimates indicating that technically extractable resource of the renewable wave energy is about double the present total national electricity consumption.  This represents in numerical terms 50 gig watts along the west coast alone, which is 13 per cent of the ESB's production in 1994.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at the total development of the marine industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the tone of contributions here this evening.  In my experience of dealing with the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources I found it to be <Col N="1412" /> very underfunded and underdeveloped.  It has enormous potential.  The current Minister will know, through being the Minister for the Marine previously, that it has a great capacity in relation to the national economy of the State.  The growth of the fishing industry is an indication of its potential.  Even though the marine industry has grown substantially, it did not get the same priority as other Departments &mdash; for example, agriculture.  It is accepted nationwide that the importance of the fishing industry was bartered in the overall agricultural development within the EC.  It survived and is still a growing industry. There are 300,000 tonnes of fish being caught by Irish fishermen at the moment and, therefore, it plays a huge part in the economies of coastal communities.  Within that context of an under-developed natural resource, it is important that this Department and the Government provide protection for current fish stocks to enable us develop it in the future.  I respect the Minister for his stand against other EU partners in this regard. It is important that the Government puts the necessary emphasis on the protection of our stocks for future development so that they will not be over-exploited by flagship boats visiting our waters.  Many Irish fishermen feel these ships are poaching our industry and taking away our natural resource.</P>
      <P>The report of the Marine Institute &mdash; it was mentioned by Senator Caffrey and others &mdash; outlines the overall importance of the potential of the fishing industry.  I have a great interest in the fishing industry.  It is an area in which I believe there is enormous potential.  There has been huge job creation in aquaculture in Brittany in the area of shellfish development.  The potential for job creation in the fishing industry is enormous. There is also huge development in areas of long-term sustainable development which will help to retain families in rural areas, provide job opportunities and the economic livelihoods of families along the coast.</P>
      <P>There is a serious need &mdash; I support what the previous speaker had to say in this regard and I will be very parochial &mdash; for targeted investment programmes for the future.  In fairness some counties have operated dismally.  Mayo has a huge coastline with great fishing resources but job creation is at a deplorable level.  They are not playing the part as stated in the resolution of retaining economic families and supporting them. Targeted investment must take place in counties like Mayo and I have asked the county manager, through the county enterprise board, to set out a detailed plan of work for county Mayo in co-operation with the Department of the Marine so that we can tackle the problem of job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the decision by the Minister and Government in relation to special capital allowances with grants.  That has great potential which has not been fully realised.  We can do a lot to improve the stock and quality of our fleets through capital supports, grants and tax allowances. There should be a great take-up of the <Col N="1413" /> scheme which should be sold strongly along the western seaboard.  We should not overdo things. There is potential for great development; it will not be enormous but will help build an important base for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's work in this area.  I think it is time to take an innovative approach to fishing.  There is great potential in the idea of salmon ranching.  We have great quality fish along the western seaboard.  We should protect the wild species of salmon and trout.  The Minister has a great opportunity to improve this area through the Marine Institute and salmon research.  The development of salmon research provides tremendous potential for our streams and rivers in, for instance, the Clew Bay basin.  We have marvellous facilities and natural resources of wild salmon and fish in our streams and rivers that could be developed for tourism.  This could be done at community level without enormous cost. Through tourism we could develop our resource and provide long-term sustainable improvement for local economies.</P>
    <P>In relation to aquaculture, there is a request with the Department of the Marine on the need for helmsman's licence training facilities for people involved in fish farming. There is a need for the Department and BIM to work swiftly with the industry in providing facilities for helmsman's licences for people who wish to qualify for the required insurance and the proper development of their job skills.  I welcome the Minister's recent stand with his European partners.  If any Department can play a meaningful part in the development of rural Ireland I believe it is the Department of the Marine.  I will give the Minister my full support in relation to the long term sustainable development of the fishing industry in a very careful financed way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the fishing industry.  I compliment Senator Fitzgerald on his continued efforts in highlighting this matter in the Seanad.</P>
      <P>I believe &mdash; and I know this view has been indicated by the Minister &mdash; that the fishing industry has great potential for growth.  It is also &mdash; and I do not point the finger at any particular Government, we all share the blame &mdash; the cinderella indigenous industry which could have given and done more.  It has always been low down on our priorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might best be able to take on board the following points in that what I am suggesting is not his responsibility.  We talk about infrastructure in accommodating foreign industry and indigenous industry.  We talk about infrastructure in terms of the internal movement of communications for the growth of industry.  A person travelling from Killybegs or Dingle to the markets of Paris drives many bad roads from west Cork to north Donegal and it is quite difficult to reach their destination on time.  Their task is a <Col N="1414" /> difficult one and is something which should be looked at.</P>
    <P>The lack of research and development in marine industry is an area in which I know the Minister has an interest.  When I was first elected to this House 11 years ago I made a speech in which I said that for every ten people working at sea there was less than one job on land.  That has improved substantially but the Minister would be the first to admit it has a long way to go.  We need to push forward with the processing industry.  Perhaps &ldquo;processing&rdquo; is the wrong terminology to use in relation to the development of the industry through research and development.  Much of it is, as was outlined by Senator Chambers, the development of various industries based on salmon or other species.  We are not doing enough in this area.  We have an old fashioned approach to processing because we spent ten or 15 years trying to convince people to give added value to the fish landed and not simply export them.  That has led to a simplistic approach being taken.  We have not thought much beyond &ldquo;Donegal Catch&rdquo;&mdash; how much &ldquo;Donegal Catch&rdquo; is actually Irish I am not quite sure.  We have not convinced people that money invested in the development of the marine industry is money invested in the future of industry as a whole.  There are so many other areas that can grow from fishing even in terms of selling expertise.</P>
    <P>Wave and wind technology was mentioned earlier.  Is it not extraordinary that Ireland is located in the best area in Europe to harness the wind and yet technology is far more developed in Scandinavia than here?  This should worry us.  The same problem arises in the fishing industry.  The most frightening statistic is that Ireland has more than a quarter of the fishing area of Europe but lands only less than a tenth of the total catch.  This is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to discuss foreign trawlers operating without licences without appearing to sound racist.  However, those of us with many connections on the west coast and who know people who fish and work in the industry are aware of the facts.  Trawlers, particularly Spanish vessels, are breaking the rules in a way which clearly shows that they are getting support in some places.  Technically, fish cannot be landed without it being recorded.  However, there are repeated examples of hidden compartments and unrecorded fish stocks on trawlers that are boarded.  Some boats fishing the area for a number of years are not even registered.</P>
    <P>Somebody is landing the fish and others are buying and selling it in the European Union. People are operating freely in this fashion in certain countries and we should demand action.  If individuals can be sent to Iraq to investigate what Saddam Hussein has hidden, people should watch the return of Spanish trawlers in whatever ports they use.  I am not happy about this matter which has been raised in other places.  Will the Minister indicate how technology, and particularly satellite technology, is being used to trace boats and fleets and their landings and to identify where factory <Col N="1415" /> ships are based, where they do their business and the movement of fish?</P>
    <P>In Ireland not enough has been done in terms of developing the deep sea fish stocks in more distant parts of the Atlantic.  These include fish about which we did not learn in school and which are now being discovered.  More work must be done on researching and developing how these stocks can be harvested in conjunction with the protection of traditional species.</P>
    <P>The growth area is the luxury end of the market, which, in the main, involves shellfish.  It has been stated by previous speakers and it will be said again that Ireland has not done enough with regard to farming shellfish.  I am aware that many discussions have taken place on the rights and wrong of fish farming.  However, there is nothing wrong with fish farming.  If it is causing a problem, efforts should be made to solve it.  It should not be conceded to either side of the debate that fish farming is good or bad.  It is similar to alcohol; it is not good or bad, rather the use to which people put it.  Fish farming should be developed in an environmentally friendly way that is helpful to the creation of employment and ensures added value within the industry.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is, in the main, located in remote parts of Ireland.  There is an important base in the Minister's constituency and I am aware people fish on the east coast.  However, this issue involves developing an industry and employment in places where there are no other jobs.  The creation of employment in places such as Killala, Rossaveel, Achill, west Kerry and west Cork would make a real contribution to these communities.  I ask the Government to recognise that the development of the marine industry and the creation of jobs in such places is worth much more to them than to other large urban areas. It would be an investment in communities and infrastructure and involve the protection of their culture.  It would be a commitment to rural Ireland.  Those of us from small towns such as Dingle, Rossaveal, Killybegs and Killala and others would welcome that type of movement.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Chambers's point about the certification of helmsmen.  I grew up in a town where many people did not receive enough training before modern technology was installed on their boats.  They were not able to use it properly, but better technology is now available and fishermen need and want training.  Everybody would benefit from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I can already see the track of the Minister's hand in negotiations and statements about the fishing industry.  This is nothing more than I would expect because I remember his responses when he was in the Department of Social Welfare and also the Department of Agriculture during the launch of the first Leader programme. It was a new concept but he took it on board immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> It may appear strange that a Member from an inland county, such as Roscommon, wishes to contribute to a debate on the fishing industry. However, it is often forgotten that there is a large industry based on the inland fishery waterways. The Central Fisheries Board and the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board, which controls the area from where I come, are doing a fine job. However, the greatest threat to the fishing industry on the inland waterways is pollution which comes from many sources and, in some cases, is unintentional.</P>
    <P>Roscommon County Council recently started to monitor Lough Ree.  It is investing £700,000 in this project in co-operation with others.  The council has taken this action because it has been established that there is massive pollution in the River Shannon and Lough Ree.  It is not necessary for me to explain to the House that the inland waterways are one of the country's greatest assets.  The potential for jobs and development in this area should not be underestimated.  With proper care and attention, much of the pollution can be removed.  The provision of new sewerage systems by local authorities will help.  However, artificial manures which are washed in from small drains and rivers are causing an imbalance.  The farming community unintentionally causes this problem during floods.  A major educational programme is required to resolve this matter.</P>
    <P>There are great opportunities in the River Shannon and River Suck catchment areas for developments which would provide hundreds or even thousands of jobs.  For example, the Irish Wheelchair Association has made an application with regard to Donamon.  The opportunities there for the development of potential tourist attractions should not be underestimated.  This area, which includes Donamon Castle, is the only one which provides accommodation for disabled people who wish to take fishing holidays.  I understand that research has been carried out on this matter and that the development of fish stands on the River Shannon at Donamon, access roads and parking facilities would encourage tourist involvement, particularly by the UK Disabled Anglers Association.  I understand the potential in that regard is enormous.  When the application comes before the Minister he should examine it closely.</P>
    <P>Places on the Shannon, such as Portrun and Ballyleague, have great potential.  Recent discussions with the fisheries board on an application from Portrun should be developed.  Hopefully, the Minister can respond positively in that case also.  The same points can be made for many other river networks with which I am not familiar.  However, I am familiar with the Shannon, particularly the River Suck area.  Hopefully, such areas can be developed to provide opportunities.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is losing out to a degree from the lack of onshore processing.  I understand that 80 per cent of the catch on the south coast is frozen and exported to Spain.  It would be worth <Col N="1417" /> investigating the potential for creating job opportunities in onshore processing.  Perhaps the creation of a tax break would be an incentive in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fishermen feel that they have got a bad deal from the EU, not with what the Minister is doing now but through what was agreed originally when we joined the Community.  I understand the next review is not due until 2002.  In the interim the Government, the fishing industry and all other interested parties should come together to arrive at a comprehensive position promoting the national interest for the negotiations to review the Common Fisheries Policy in 2002.  If anyone can manage to achieve that it is the Minister, Deputy Woods.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will take a great interest in the fishing industry.  I look forward to working with him and the fisheries authorities to enhance the opportunities for the development of tourism in the catchment area of the Shannon and the Suck with a view to increasing employment and halting rural decline.  That may be achieved by tapping into the resource of our inland waterways which are second to none in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to review developments in the fishing industry and to set out to the Seanad my policy objectives for the sector and my strategic approach to delivering on those objectives.  Before doing so I will address some of the points raised by Senators.</P>
      <P>I would also like to pay tribute to Hugh Coveney.  He is a great loss to the Oireachtas as he was an honourable, decent, obliging, effective and friendly public representative.  All Members of the Houses got on well with him.  I conveyed my concern and upset at his tragic loss to his wife and family.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald spoke about fishing in the south, west, north and east in his tour of the country. However, there is nowhere more important for the Senator than Dingle.  He mentioned the achievement of over 5,000 tonnes for the small boats.  We had an earlier promise of 3,000 tonnes and I got that enlarged to 5,400 tonnes, which was important.  We are working as a priority to get the licences out as quickly as possible.  Over the past couple of weeks about 250 licences have been issued and we hope to complete the issuing of the licences within about two months.  This is a major improvement because it will leave many small fishermen in a more secure position for the future, apart from which each tonne is worth money.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald also talked about herring. He is right when he says there is a major problem with regard to the level of supplies which are allowed into the EU without hindrance.  At last week's Fisheries Council meeting we managed to have the proposal reduced from 23,000 tonnes to 12,500 tonnes for this year, which is a major improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> The tuna ban is an important issue.  We have succeeded in having the decision put off until next June, but there is an overwhelming majority in favour of the ban.  We are concerned to have a transitional period and to ensure that our tuna fishermen can continue to fish.  There is a cost in providing for that in terms of training and reequipping. The Commission and the Presidency are taking up the line we have put forward.  The only country which really supported us is France. Italy is in a similar situation but it has already converted about 500 out of its 650 vessels.  France and Italy also differ from us in that they need the approval of the Community to use the funds they have to convert their vessels and compensate their fishermen.  However, we need the money as well as the approval.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the development of Union Hall, Portmagee and other areas. I am glad he did because I took an interest in those areas when I was Minister for the Marine in the past.  I believed that worthwhile jobs could be created there and I had a long battle over it. It is satisfying to see the developments which have taken place because those who promised development delivered, they delivered jobs in areas where there are few other opportunities. Economists and others should recognise the importance of such jobs in these areas.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred particularly to the harassment of fishermen off the south-west coast. I will return to that matter later.  He mentioned an incident which occurred this morning 70 to 80 miles out and I would like to have any information the Senator might have on it.</P>
    <P>With regard to promulgating the new incentives scheme, we will do so once we have the total package.  We must get EU approval &mdash; I do not see a problem with that &mdash; and we hope to have it in the next few weeks.  We also want to develop a grant aid package to go with it.  We are working on that and we want to try to do the two at the one time.</P>
    <P>If I was getting too much praise, Senator Caffrey brought me down to earth quickly by saying I was not doing enough to help the marine sector.  I work most nights until 2 a.m., I get up about 7.30 a.m. and I work on this job all those hours so I do not know how much more I can do &mdash; I will have to split myself into two or get some other assistance.  I have done the best I can while I have been here and I have only been back in this job for a short time.  He said that this was the view in the north-west and I am sorry that is the case.</P>
    <P>He pointed out that 90 per cent of our territory is under water and I have made this point strongly also.  I have had meetings with the Marine Institute &mdash; I had one at lunch time today &mdash; about technology opportunities.  We have moved this a long way and I have established a special relationship with Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland based on those technologies.</P>
    <P>The Senator was right to talk about the major step in March 1995 towards a marine policy.  He <Col N="1419" /> pinpointed my failings and he is probably right in that I have failed to broadcast sufficiently what we are doing and how much we have done in a short time.  One difficulty is that if one tries to get things done one does not always do as much PR as one should.  I have clearly failed in that because the message has not reached Senator Caffrey and I will have to ensure that it does in future.  We have a thick volume of press statements, each only a page or two, all of which record achievements by the Department.  However, we have to get across to people what is happening.</P>
    <P>I set up the Marine Institute.  That was a far seeing move because it is having, and will have, a big influence.  Today I discussed with the institute the further steps which should be taken.  I spent much of my life working on research so I know a lot about it and am reasonably well qualified in the field.  I agree with the Senator that it is an important area for the future as well as the present.  If this country does not recognise that and back the people doing research we will miss out on much of our potential.  While we may be doing well, without it we will only achieve a small part of what we could achieve.</P>
    <P>The institute's document <i>Towards a Marine Policy</i> comprises the published proceedings of five seminars and consultations held around the country in 1995, as the Senator said.  It is not a policy document but a consultation document.  I am moving forward all the issues identified in the seminars.  One of them was renewal of the whitefish fleet.  We have started an historic package for the purpose; this is long overdue.  Money does not fall off a tree, however, it takes a lot of hard work to get it.  The Government is reducing the tax burden on the individual and in doing so it is cutting out incentives.  We got through the package against that background and it was not easy because the broad thrust of policy is to get rid of as many of these schemes as possible.  Nonetheless the Government recognised that this was a special area and for the next three years it will provide this incentive.  That was one of the major issues raised in the report.</P>
    <P>I launched the new national research vessel towards the end of last year.  It was an important development and will have a huge influence into the future.  I hope to reorganise the inland fisheries services soon.  We have also been working on other matters, such as fish processing and a seaweed strategy, and have made certain developments and improvements for them all.</P>
    <P>Senator Chambers mentioned the need for targeted investment in fishing and I agree with him. He specifically mentioned the need for helmsman's training in aquaculture and pointed to its benefits.  I support that idea.  There has been much growth in aquaculture since the mid-1980s. Mayo is an important area in that regard.  We would be glad to bring the Department, BIM and the county council together to review the potential for development in the Mayo area and we will <Col N="1420" /> also examine the training for aquaculture boat handling.</P>
    <P>On training generally, I announced some days ago that BIM is to locate a new training centre in Castletownbere, which is vital for the south-west region.  It will not take from the Greencastle centre but it will bring the new training facilities closer to fishing ports and regionalise them.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole said there was a lack of research and development and that it is important to push ahead with it, and I fully agree with him. He also said controls were essential.  One proposal I have pursued with the EU, which is coming into operation in July, is the use of satellite surveillance.  We are only able to do it now because we obtained Community agreement, which means getting all the other nations to agree.  That will be a major help.  Another proposal we made was for a weighbridge in the sea, which would enable us to check boats in the fishing zone and weigh what they have coming in and going out.  We cannot do that at the moment, although we can check for other things.  The Community has agreed to that, which is another leap forward.  It will also start in July.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran pointed to the difficulties with pollution, especially in inland fisheries.  We are giving this a good deal of attention.  I note his remarks on Donamon.  We are doing a lot of things about pollution because it is crucial and we are now getting much assistance from the local authorities, the farming organisations and many farmers, though not all of them.  There are some problems with farmers and the farming organisations are helping with those.</P>
    <P>My priority is to ensure a sustainable future for the Irish fishing industry which will underpin its vitally important socio-economic contribution to the wellbeing of our coastal communities.  My strategic objective is to enhance the safety and competitiveness of the fleet and the quality of landings, to maximise supply through full and effective take up of available quotas and to develop non-quota fishing opportunities.</P>
    <P>A critical commercial imperative for the industry at this point in its development is to ensure that supply is matched to demand in terms of price, quality, availability and regularity.  In addition, therefore, to improving supply &mdash; that is, fishing opportunities &mdash; we need to tackle the demand side, in other words, product quality and the markets.  This will require new partnerships and co-operation between the various players including the catching sector and the processing and export sector.  In the context of the strategies needed to deliver on the safety, quality and competitiveness needs of the industry, I will outline current developments in the sector.</P>
    <P>Recent years have seen exponential growth in consumer demand for seafood within the European Union and worldwide.  Very significant changes are taking place in traditional seafood markets around the world.  Patterns of consumption are changing fast with a huge potential market for a wide variety of high value seafood as <Col N="1421" /> well as for the fresh product.  Competition is intense and the liberalisation of world trade is adding to the market challenge for the Irish industry.  There are significant opportunities therefore but significant challenges also.  I will return to some of these later.</P>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry has developed remarkably in many respects since the foundation of the State, despite the acknowledged historic constraints.  Annual landings of sea fish in the 1930s were less than 10,000 tonnes.  By 1960, landings had more than trebled and the next 30 years saw output doubling in each decade.  By 1990, annual landings stood at over 200,000 tonnes of fish per annum.</P>
    <P>In 1997 total fish landings topped over 300,000 tonnes worth over £140 million.  We have already reached our 1999 target on landings.  Since joining the European Community and with the establishment of the Common Fisheries Policy, the fishing industry has, despite the acknowledged constraints, made substantial economic progress.  We still contend, however, that our allocated share of the fish stocks under the Common Fisheries Policy falls far short of a fair and equitable level.  I will outline later my approach to the review of the Common Fisheries Policy which will take place in 2002.  Various Senators mentioned the size of our waters in relation to those of the European Union.  However, the EU has been expanding and consequently our waters constitute 16 per cent of the EU total, while our quotas amounts to between 5 and 6 per cent of the EU total.  The same relationship holds but because the EU waters have expanded through the addition of new member states, our percentage has fallen.</P>
    <P>The single most serious threat to the future of the fishing industry worldwide and here at home is the depletion of stocks through over-fishing.  As a coastal State with a comparatively small fleet and a high level of fishing activity in our waters by other fleets, Ireland has particular concerns in this regard.  Conservation of the resource requires responsible management and constant vigilance in protecting and monitoring stock levels.  I can assure the Seanad that I will continue to be at the forefront in Europe in seeking demonstrable commitment by all member states to conservation and responsible management.  I am also pressing for a level playing field in enforcement of the rules.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Ireland has a small share of EU quotas and restrictions on total allowable catches will continue where the scientific advice and other considerations demand.  Nevertheless, there is room for continuing development of fishing opportunities by the Irish fleet.  Irish fishermen fished for blue whiting in Irish waters for the first time last year, landing around 30,000 tonnes.  I am confident that this fishery will continue to expand for us and the development of processing techniques for the species will enhance its value to the industry over time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1422" /> I have mandated BIM to work very closely with Irish fish processing and exporting companies in order to maximise product and marketing opportunities for Irish fish on the domestic and export markets.  I am pleased to say that good progress is being made to develop existing and new markets for Irish seafood worldwide.  Fish exports have increased by over 60 per cent since 1990 hitting a record high in 1996 when their value reached £252 million.  Of this, we exported £45 million worth of white fish and shellfish to Spain. I led a BIM industry trade mission to China last November which was an important new initiative, opening a number of doors and showcasing the Irish industry.  I believe the mission and the ongoing follow up will produce tangible commercial opportunities for our seafood producers in the Chinese market which is the largest in the world.  We have already had an exchange of technical information on aquaculture.</P>
    <P>I am committed to delivering the necessary support for the fishing industry through targeted investment plans under the current operational programme for fisheries.  I am ensuring that the ongoing investment is specifically designed to deliver on our modernisation and development objectives for the industry and for the communities which depend upon it.  The programme is also delivering on much needed investment in fishery harbour infrastructure, processing and research.</P>
    <P>Funding for Ireland under the PESCA community initiative is also supporting fishing communities to diversify and to support alternative activities.  Over £11 million worth of investment will be realised under this initiative.  To date over 100 projects have been approved and I will be announcing a new round of PESCA projects shortly.  I am pleased to say that Ireland has been uniquely successful in Europe in our efficient and effective use of PESCA funding and is held up as an example to other member states.</P>
    <P>As Senators are aware, the negotiations on EU Structural Funding for all sectors, including fisheries, post-1999 will begin in earnest with the EU Commission in the coming months.  I will be working to maximise the allocation for fisheries in the new round, reflecting the development needs and potential for the sector.  I am convinced that there is significant untapped potential in terms of employment and economic growth for the industry as a whole and for our coastal communities in particular.  Senators especially emphasised this aspect in their contributions.</P>
    <P>The whitefish fleet generates most of the employment in the fishing sector and accounts for 65 per cent of the value of fish landings. However, the age profile of the whitefish fleet is high, averaging 25 years, and is in need of further modernisation.  The fleet is seriously under-capitalised and there has been no significant reinvestment for over ten years.  My first priority in office was to deliver on measures for the renewal of the whitefish fleet in line with the Government's commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1423" /> It was quite clear to me that the industry has to be made attractive to providers of capital if the necessary investment is to take place.  The industry is a high risk sector and I concluded that it would be impossible to facilitate low cost money for the sector without special fiscal incentives which will encourage the banks, and other financial institutions as well as private investors, to support this vitally important sector.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, in the context of this year's Finance Act, I secured a package of special tax based reliefs to encourage capital into the whitefish fleet.  I have also announced my plans for a complementary capital grant aid scheme for new whitefish boats.  My proposals, which are consistent with EU State aid parameters, will be negotiated with the Commission in the coming weeks.  I am confident that the proposed tax reliefs and capital grant programme create a new climate of opportunity and will catalyse the much needed degree of change in the whole fish sector.</P>
    <P>My investment support strategy will help significant investment in the renewal of the whitefish fleet in the medium term.  The reinvestment in the fleet will enable full and efficient quota take-up and will enable Irish fishermen to develop new non-quota fishing opportunities. Safety and competitiveness will be improved and existing employment maintained with the potential for additional jobs at sea and in processing and supply services.</P>
    <P>The continued development of the fish processing industry is critical for jobs, growth, value added and exports in the fishing industry overall. A total investment of £22 million has been supported under the operational programme since 1994 in over 100 fish processing projects, securing existing jobs and creating over 200 new jobs.  In February, I announced a further round of grant aid for fish processing projects which will deliver an investment of over £3 million and create nearly 100 jobs.  Jobs will be created from development projects in the pipeline through obtaining additional EU funding.  I am pursuing this critically needed funding to support these projects in order to achieve further development capacity expansion and product development in fish processing.  We currently have more projects than there are resources in terms of grant aid under the programme.  I am pursuing this issue as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the challenges facing the Irish industry in the global market for herring. The competitive environment is tough and conditions can be difficult.  The herring sector is a case in point.  The EU and global markets are currently characterised by over-supply, low prices and changing consumer trends.  I am glad of this opportunity to brief the Seanad on the action being taken to address the crisis for the Irish herring industry.  Since the difficulties emerged last autumn, I have focused my initiatives on tackling the medium to long-term organisational, market <Col N="1424" /> and management issues which are at the heart of the short-term crisis.</P>
    <P>The main underlying global factor is over-supply and changing trends on the key Japanese herring roe and European herring flap markets, which are the key outlets for Irish herring exports.  Over-supply in 1997, especially from Canada and Norway, has led to a serious downturn in the market and low prices for traditional suppliers.  Norway, especially, is offloading an unprecedented level of supplies into EU and eastern European markets.  The Japanese herring roe market, where Irish herring producers have developed a valuable niche in recent years, is suffering from supply and prices problems, exacerbated by the downturn in the Japanese economy and signs of long-term decline in the traditional consumer market.</P>
    <P>The outlook is for little foreseeable change on the world market in the short to medium term.  I decided, therefore, that we should look at the factors within our control and see what could be done to position the industry to maintain a strong market presence and become more competitive in this very tough international environment.  A hard collective look at all aspects of the sector was needed.  Having consulted with the industry I established at its request a fully representative task force last December to comprehensively address the issues.  I asked the task force to assess all the options for better management and marketing of Irish herring, taking account of global factors and trends and all relevant domestic factors and to look at all aspects of the supply, processing and marketing chain.  I also asked for concrete recommendations on practical actions to deliver change.  I asked the task force to report by the end of March.  This was demanding but essential deadline, given the critical situation for the industry.  I am glad to advise it met my deadline and submitted their report to me yesterday.</P>
    <P>The task force represented key players in the herring fishing industry, including fishermen, processors, and exporters as well as BIM, the Marine Institute and the Department.  It worked intensively over the last three months and I am especially grateful to the industry representatives for its committed approach to the job in hand.  I am also grateful to the members of my Department who worked hard with it, including Sarah White, who chaired the task force.</P>
    <P>The task force made an interim recommendation to me in January on the need for EU action to reduce preferential market access by non member states and on the priority need for enhanced scientific herring assessment programmes. I took immediate action on both fronts. At the EU Fisheries Council I secured a reduction of the autonomous tariff quota for 1998 allowing preferential access for herring from outside the EU.  In the face of considerable opposition from other member states the quota for this year was reduced to 12,500 tonnes from 23,000 tonnes, which operated last year.  I will continue to work to have this quota dismantled entirely for <Col N="1425" /> 1999, given the EU oversupply situation.  We consider it is unnecessary and inappropriate in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish the task force report within a couple of weeks.  I will examine it in detail now with a view to responding to and taking forward its recommendations.  The report gives a comprehensive analysis of the situation and has come up with strategies directed at creating a new partnership approach, supporting improved operational efficiency and ensuring better co-operation in management and marketing.</P>
    <P>The development of the Irish aquaculture industry has been on a steady growth curve from small beginnings in the 1980s.  The industry is now worth £60 million per annum, accounts for 30 per cent of the volume of Irish fish production, is a major supplier of raw material to the processing side and gives valuable employment in our rural and island communities.  Downstrearn jobs are supported in supplies, services and fish processing. Many of the skills needed to develop aquaculture are to be found in our coastal communities. Traditional farming and fishing skills are being successfully harnessed to the new technologies for the production of quality Irish farmed sea food.</P>
    <P>The three major aquaculture species are salmon, oysters and mussels but I am keen to see continued expansion into new species, including turbot, halibut, charr and abalone.  This will position the industry very well in terms of diversification and expansion.  The Chinese are research leaders on abalone.  Following our visit to China we arranged a technical exchange which has been very helpful.  Continued sustainable and well regulated development of the aquaculture industry is a key objective.</P>
    <P>I have already underlined the importance for Ireland and the Irish fishing industry of a level playing field in fisheries enforcement across Europe.  The viability of the resource and the interests of the Irish fishing fleet depend on effective conservation and compliance by everyone with the rules.  My Department's sea fisheries inspectorate works closely with the Naval Service and the Air Corps to ensure rigorous control of fishing activity and landings in our waters.  The agencies will continue to co-operate and work together to ensure that the resources available for fisheries surveillance and control are utilised to best effect.</P>
    <P>In discussions at last weeks EU Fisheries Council, I underlined once again to ministerial colleagues and the Commission the critical importance which Ireland attaches to fair play and co-operation in fisheries protection.  I said that there must be demonstrable commitment and co-operation by all member states to uniformly enforcing the rules.  I made the point that enforcement is not an end in itself but a means to the end, which is better compliance and understanding by fishermen everywhere.  We need to build the confidence of fishermen that compliance <Col N="1426" /> with the rules will pay dividends in terms of protecting the stocks.</P>
    <P>As Senators know, there are specific enforcement difficulties associated with the activities of flagships.  As the coastal state most directly affected, Ireland is actively pushing for more co-operation from the other member states concerned in tackling the problem.  I had bilateral discussions with the UK and Spanish Ministers at the Council when I pressed for improved co-operation and better information exchange so that the activities of flagships are verifiably controlled, both at sea and at ports of landing.  This is a major priority for me, and I will continue to work on all fronts for the EU to deliver workable solutions to the flagship problem.</P>
    <P>It is critically important also that fishermen should be able to go about their legitimate business without being subjected to harassment or intimidation.  I am seriously concerned about incidents between Irish fishing vessels and vessels registered in the UK which occurred off the south west coast in recent weeks.  We cannot tolerate bully-boy tactics which put the safety, and the livelihoods, of Irish fishermen at risk.  Investigation of the alleged incidents is continuing.</P>
    <P>I have discussed the incidents with my colleague, the Minister for Defence, who shares my concerns.  We have agreed that our two Departments, the Naval Service and the Air Corps should liaise closely in reviewing the implications and lessons from recent events and in ensuring the most effective deployment of all our services in the task of preventing such incidents and responding to them if they occur again.  We need as a priority a rapid response to incidents and an agreed code of practice.  I have ideas in mind about how to do this.</P>
    <P>My Department has in the meantime taken the matter up at high level with the relevant UK authorities to convey my deep concerns and to pass on available information about the vessels allegedly involved.  I also raised the matter with my UK and Spanish colleagues and stressed the need, in everyone's interest, for concerted action to tackle these difficulties.  At Council I urged both Ministers, and the EU Commission to facilitate and ensure co-operation at all levels to minimise and prevent such incidents.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity to raise formally at last week's EU Fisheries Council the need to tackle the problems which arise between fishermen from various member states operating on the same fishing grounds with different gear types. This phenomenon is by no means confined to one or two fisheries but is quite widespread in Europe.  Conflict avoidance measures, along the lines which we are pursuing bilaterally with a number of member states, are needed generally and I will continue to be at the forefront in pursuing these measures.</P>
    <P>The fishing industry is critically dependent on berthages and onshore facilities for landings and services.  Investment to date under the operational programme for fisheries has delivered <Col N="1427" /> much needed improvements in key strategic fishing ports as well as smaller harbours and their related facilities.  However, I am convinced of the need for substantial additional investment at our key fishing ports for safety and economic reasons and I will bring proposals to Government shortly on the funding options.  The capital investment programme for 1998 will see further improvements around the coast.  Money has not been provided from any quarter, including the EU operational programme.  That is an issue we must address and I assure Senators I will do so.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by returning to the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy, which regulates virtually every aspect of the operation of the fishing industry.  This review is crucial from Ireland's point of view.  While it is four and a half years away, it is essential that the strategic process of preparing the national position begins now.  The Commission is beginning a round of consultations with the fishing sector and I have got Commission agreement to begin its round of consultations here with a series of face to face meetings with the Irish industry next September. Later this year I will establish a national common fisheries policy strategy group involving all the key players, including the industry.  The group will consult, develop and advise on national objectives and strategies for the review.  One of our difficulties is that the same people who work on the task force must also work on this group.  I want Senators to realise that my Department does not have many staff.  We have only a handful of key personnel.  Our expansion to include natural resources gives us a broader base and further dynamic, which is helpful.  I want to bring together and use to best effect all relevant expertise to inform the national negotiating position in Europe during the review.</P>
    <P>I reaffirm to the Seanad that the Government is fully committed to the continued development of all components of the fishing industry and to assuring a sustainable future for our coastal communities. I will continue to work on all fronts to deliver on our objectives for the sector and I am sure I will have the full support of this House in delivering our wide-ranging and challenging agenda.</P>
    <P>A commission of inquiry examined the Irish fishing industry in 1921.  Its report, which makes fascinating reading, strongly emphasised &ldquo;the interdependence of production and marketing&rdquo;. The report also set out the following strategic objectives for the industry:</P>
    <P>That the entire wealth of the rich seas about the Irish coast be exploited for human food;</P>
    <P>That the fisherman has satisfactory materials for this purpose and is provided with fair remuneration for his labour;</P>
    <P>That a cheap and speedy distribution is organised, first for the people of Ireland and second for the most remunerative foreign markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1428" /> The commission was farseeing and visionary in its outlook.  The Irish fishing industry has come a long way in the intervening years.  However, it is striking that those strategic objectives are as relevant now, over 75 years later, as they were in 1921.</P>
    <P>I only had time to give a brief overview of some of the work in my Department.  Senators spoke about the marine sector generally, which I could talk about for some time as we are doing a lot of work in that area.  Many plans have been devised by the Marine Institute which was set up for that purpose.  I am working closely with the divisional staff and the chief executive of the Marine Institute to make progress in this area of tremendous potential.  We must use all our energy to develop it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his contribution.  As my fellow Dingle Harbour Commissioner, Senator Tom Fitzgerald, said, we look forward to the Minister's visit to Dingle to help us set up projects there.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Tom Fitzgerald in paying tribute to Hugh Coveney.  As Minister for Defence and the Marine, he visited Dingle.  He was nature's kindest gentleman and was extremely knowledgeable about all marine matters. He loved the sea and got on well with everyone who earned their living from it.  He understood fishermen and everyone involved in the fishing industry and they will miss him.</P>
      <P>One of the great national tragedies relates to the resources of the seas around our coast.  This has been a cinderella industry under successive Governments.  The motion refers to sustaining Ireland's coastal communities.  However, that is all we are doing as we are not trying to expand them.  We must fight hard to safeguard the people's livelihoods.  Despite our best efforts, we are a long way off realising their full potential.</P>
      <P>I fail to understand why we have a quota of only 25,000 tonnes of herring while Norway enjoys a quota of 821,000 tonnes.  That is far too restrictive.  The Spaniards have become the bully boys of the seas.  Sadly, we heard again today that a small boatman was forced off his patch by the activities of flags of convenience fishermen who were undoubtedly Spanish.  We are also concerned about the ban on drift net fishing for tuna. We respect the reprieve the Minister has won but we are fearful for the future.</P>
      <P>Our fishing fleet is in an appalling state.  Our boats are not equipped to deal with the sea let alone reap the benefits of its resources.  I welcome the tax incentives announced by the Minister and we await more details.  Unlike other such incentives, particularly those relating to BSE which were too restrictive, I hope they are flexible and that they win wide acceptance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Senator Fitzgerald's concern for the port of Dingle, which enjoys many natural advantages and whose potential has not been tapped. The port has the supposed status of a major fishery <Col N="1429" /> harbour centre but we hope that the Minister may bring this status to reality.  Dingle needs an ice plant, an auction hall, to have the head of the pier completed and the channel dredged to allow for bigger boats.  The formation of a fishermen's co-operative is a hopeful sign.</P>
    <P>The Lakes of Killarney have suffered from pollution and consequent algae bloom.  I would welcome whatever assistance the Minister can give to deal with the problem of pollution because our fishing lakes and rivers are not as they once were or as they should be.  I welcomed the formation of the task force which has now reported.  I look forward to the publication of the report and the adoption of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of regulations is very important. Many of our people are not being allowed to fish in peace and that is a pre-requisite of a succesful industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I be associated with the vote of sympathy to Pauline Coveney on the death of Deputy Hugh Coveney.  He was a man who had a great knowledge of fishing and the sea.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  He knows there is huge potential for the development of fishing tourism on our inland waterways and around our coast.  I welcome the document, <i>Achieving Sustainable Growth,</i> which was launched by the Minister and produced by the Central Fisheries Board.  This plan sets out the work of the Central Fisheries Board, in co-operation with the Department and other agencies over the next five years.  If the necessary funding is provided this plan is to be warmly welcomed.</P>
      <P>There is great potential on the west coast for on-shore processing.  It is a pity that so much of our catch is exported without the added value of processing.  Will the Minister examine the possibilities for the development of on-shore processing of fish caught by Irish fishermen?</P>
      <P>The fishing industry has not been a priority over the last few years but I have no doubt that it will be so for the Minister.  The economy could benefit enormously from a succesful fishing industry.</P>
      <P>Regulations regarding safety at sea need to be updated.  When will the Minister introduce a Bill to regulate safety at sea in this House?</P>
      <P>Dredging is needed in a number of our lakes.  I do not know if this is the responsibility of the Department, the Central Fisheries Board, the regional boards or the Office of Public Works. Castlebar UDC, in conjunction with Mayo County Council and Bord Fáilte, have launched a major holiday village on the shores of Lough Lannagh, near Castlebar.  The lake needs to be dredged and the weeds on it need to be cut.  Will the Minister see that the appropriate body performs this necessary work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. T. Fitzgerald Mr. T. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Senator O'Donovan.  I am very heartened by the debate and I promise Senators that, in co-operation with the leaders of other groups, to do a <Col N="1430" /> regular review of the fishing industry and hear statements on the industry every three or four months.  It is a pity that among the great number of Oireachtas committees there is none for the fishing industry. I would like to see a committee, similar to Comhchoiste Gaeilge an Oireachtais, which, in an uncontentious way, would hear the views of participants in the industry.  The recently established task force was one of the few bodies which consulted the fishing industry effectively.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Coghlan's remarks about the harbour in Dingle.  I am sure Senators would allow the Minister a couple of minutes to announce funding for a development plan.  It is significant that Senators are running over time, such is the interest in this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his swiftness in setting up the task force, which is particularly important for the herring industry.  I speak as a fisherman's son and I remember that in 1976 fishermen in Bantry were getting four times more per box than currently.  That was because at that time the North Sea was closed to fishing and there was a huge demand for our fish in Holland.  I have to say that the quality of salt fish which we exported often left a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>Some of the comments made by Senators have been very pessimistic.  The most critical issue facing the fishing industry in Ireland and throughout Europe is the conservation of fish stocks over the next 20 years.  There is huge potential, on-shore and off-shore, for the development of mariculture. The farming of clams, aballone, crayfish, scallops and lobster should be developed because the traditional methods of potting lobster has almost died out.  A ton of farmed clams will fetch £7,500.</P>
      <P>Other speakers referred to rural development. Apart from agriculture, which is probably in decline, and tourism, in the next 20 years the marine will become one of the areas in which there will be great potential for job creation.  In that context, reference was also made to wind and wave energy.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for establishing the Marine Institute, which is of major significance. County Cork has a coastal management committee and I urge Senators living in coastal communities to encourage their local authorities to establish such committees because such fora can highlight important issues.  Other Members, particularly the two Senators representing County Mayo, referred to strategic development in rural areas.  There is a need for better infrastructure in certain areas on the west coast which are situated a great distance from markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have an emotive attachment to the fishing industry and I have always lived near the sea.  It galls me to see the juggernauts loaded with fish leaving Castletownbere for Spain on a road which is in a bad state of disrepair.  We should encourage onshore processing in this country.  The Minister's <Col N="1431" /> announcement about tax incentive schemes and grants is welcome.</P>
    <P>Despite people's pessimism &mdash; I accept there are problems &mdash; there is hope for future.  I welcome the Minister's statement about marine research into untapped species, etc.  That is the correct route to take.  As stated earlier, the Minister has a strong understanding of his brief and he has our full support.  I accept that the Department is understaffed and under-financed but in the next decade it will have great potential for growth.  There is also major potential for job creation in this area.  I am optimistic about the future and I thank the Minister for his concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Marine and Natural Resources for taking this matter.  I always seem to strike on evenings when the Minister for Health and Children is busy.  The Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources is either the fourth or fifth Minister who has taken matters I have raised on the adjournment in place of the Minister for Health and Children, who always seems to be otherwise occupied.</P>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Health and Children in respect of this matter a month ago.  I received a holding letter from him but no further information. A problem has arisen for medical practitioners regarding equivalence of postgraduate diplomas from the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians in Ireland with those in the United Kingdom as a result of the December 1997 amendment regulations to the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order, 1995, and its interpretation by the specialist training authority of the medical royal colleges in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>The amended order contains transitional provisions to enable doctors in non-training grade posts to be considered for inclusion in the United Kingdom specialist register.  The new paragraphs, which have the effect of allowing experience to be considered in addition to training, have been inserted into Article 12 of the European Specialist Medical Qualification, 1995 (part V &mdash; Transitional Provisions, Existing Specialists), paragraph (2)(c)(ii), which requires certain applicants who wish to have their name included in the specialist register to have &ldquo;qualifications awarded in the United Kingdom&rdquo;.  It is here that difficulties for those with post-graduate diplomas from the Royal Colleges in Ireland begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1432" /> In its interpretation of the UK statutory instrument, the specialist training authority, in its general information sheet revised in January 1998, sets out the requirements they will use to consider doctors in non-training grade posts for inclusion in the specialist register.  These are detailed, on pages 5 and 6 of the information sheet, in Article 9 which allows national health service consultants in post before 1997, doctors &ldquo;accredited&rdquo; as trained before 12 January 1996 and any others &ldquo;whose UK training was completed to the standard required in the UK at the time&rdquo; to be considered for inclusion in the register.</P>
    <P>Article 9, importantly, has a fourth paragraph which confirms that the specialist training authority, in any assessment for specialist registration of experience gained by doctors in non-training grade posts, will exclusively consider only those doctors &ldquo;who have UK qualifications awarded&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Considerable confusion has resulted from the fact that the wording of the term &ldquo;UK qualifications awarded&rdquo; in the specialist training authority's information sheet is not the same as that in the 1995 order, which refers to &ldquo;qualifications awarded in the UK&rdquo;.  Such qualifications could include Membership of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland which is awarded in Belfast, because the college has conducted examinations in that city since 1993 as part of its attempts to improve North-South co-operation.  The phrase &ldquo;qualifications in the UK&rdquo;, excludes Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (UK) which is awarded in Hong Kong, Malaysia, etc.  That is another matter, but worse is to come.</P>
    <P>In annex C on page 9 of the information sheet the requirements which the specialist training authority will seek for recommending an entry in the specialist register are listed.  The term &ldquo;UK qualifications&rdquo; is further defined in this annex as a &ldquo;UK postgraduate specialist medical qualification (obtained by formal assessment or examination)&rdquo;.  In the sentence which follows it is stated that &ldquo;Irish Qualifications&rdquo; are dismissed and excluded as follows: &ldquo;Holders of <i>only</i> Fellowships or Membership of the Irish Colleges (or specialist qualifications from other EEA Member States and overseas Countries) will not qualify as these cannot be regarded as a UK qualification&rdquo;. This is hardly evidence of &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; and it takes no account of the equivalence which has existed for centuries between the colleges.</P>
    <P>The direct effect of the United Kingdom legislation and its interpretation by the specialist training authority has been to disallow from registration as specialists in the UK a small number of doctors in non-training grade posts who have not been previous national health service consultants, accredited as trained prior to 1996 by the relevant college in the UK, whose training has not been completed in the UK or who &ldquo;only&rdquo; hold Irish post-graduate qualifications.  I accept that these people cannot become specialists but their qualifications are suitable for them to join the ranks of ordinary doctors who ably support the United Kingdom's national health service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1433" /> Doctors with Irish qualifications who understood at the time that their diploma was equivalent &mdash; as it was, and still is, with regard to entry into higher specialist training &mdash; are particularly puzzled.  These doctors have been informed that one solution would be for them to sit an equivalent UK examination.  Though this is theoretically possible, it is not a practical proposition at this late stage in their career.  The only other route would be for them to compete with others for a position as a specialist registrar and then undertake several years of higher specialist training in the UK.</P>
    <P>The small number of doctors directly affected represent a large constituency of non-UK and non-EU doctors who have for many years been encouraged to provide service support in hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Independently, and through the British Medical Association, these doctors have been drawing attention to their perception of injustices and deception brought about by these new arrangements.</P>
    <P>Of equal or even greater significance to us is the perception that Irish qualifications are not of equal value in other contexts.  This is despite the fact that the Royal College of Physicians is governed by its second charter, the William and Mary Charter of 1692 &mdash; its first charter was granted in 1667 by Charles II &mdash; and the Charter of the College of Surgeons, dating from the 1780s, is of almost equal antiquity.  The college was in existence long before the Act of Union, not to mention Partition.  The competent authorities in the UK have the duty to protect the UK register of specialists from entry by inadequately trained specialists, but surely this must be done in the context and spirit of the EU directive.</P>
    <P>Very delicate negotiations are taking place in Ireland and the UK regarding the establishment of special North-South as well as east-west bodies, which must be to some extent beyond present EU considerations.  Health is an area stressed by members of the British and Irish Governments as one where co-operation should be promoted.  As a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I organised a session on this subject.  This year the College of Physicians in Ireland is establishing an office in Belfast believing the cross-Border training we are promoting is in tune with the wishes of both Governments.  Health boards in the Border areas are co-operating more. Specialised units and research units in both jurisdictions are collaborating daily.</P>
    <P>We now have this Exocet from the specialists' training authority.  My colleagues on the British-Irish Interparliamentary body were surprised when I told them of it as it had not been before the Houses of Parliament in Westminster. However, my esteemed colleague on the British-Irish Interparliamentary body, Kevin McNamara, MP for Hull North, knew about it because he had also received complaints and was under the impression the regulation had been deferred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> Despite strong efforts in recent years to facilitate the free movement of doctors in these islands and especially of those in training, on the basis of equivalence of training qualifications, it has proved most difficult to overcome a very negative attitude in some quarters to the principle of parity of esteem.  For example, this is evident in some of the statements emanating from the UK Department of Health.  Phrases such as &ldquo;qualifications in the UK&rdquo;, the specialist training authority &ldquo;only&rdquo; Irish qualifications, the Joint Committee on Higher Medical Training reduction in Irish representation on the JCHMT committee, totally without our agreement, to that of &ldquo;observer&rdquo; status and the setting up of a Northern Ireland Committee of Medical Colleges which has taken upon itself the role of giving advice to the chief medical officer in Northern Ireland on the allocation of merit awards etc. are not very productive.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Foreign Affairs said this afternoon he was looking forward to a fundamental change in the relationship between bodies in the UK and the Republic of Ireland I do not believe he envisaged debacles such as I have outlined.  From both a professional and political standpoint, the action by the specialist training authority will have a negative effect on all our efforts to improve North-South and east-west relations.  I ask the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to ask the Minister for Health and Children to contact the Minister for Health and Social Services in London to have this regulatory instrument withdrawn immediately.</P>

      <P>I would like to confirm that the Minister for Foreign Affairs did not intend that interpretation when he spoke here this afternoon. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children; and perhaps the Senator can settle for a former Minister for Health on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this important and timely issue.  The bodies responsible for organising and supervising post-graduate medical training, including the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, have always operated on an all-Ireland basis and draw their membership from both jurisdictions.  In addition, the Irish training bodies have enjoyed very close relations with their opposite numbers in England and Scotland. These relationships have extended to participation in inspections of training hospitals in each other's countries, as well as examining students.</P>
      <P>As a result of this close co-operation these bodies have extended reciprocal recognition to each other's qualifications.  In the case of surgeons, this has developed to the point where all candidates for fellowships in these islands take a single inter-collegiate examination.  Successful candidates then choose to have the fellowship awarded by the college of their choice.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1435" /> New arrangements for the organisation of higher medical and surgical training in the United Kingdom have created difficulties for the continuation of these arrangements as heretofore. Most of these problems have been dealt with.  A recent difficulty has arisen from a decision of the specialist training authority in the United Kingdom that certain doctors holding Irish qualifications who have been working in non-training grade posts in the UK will not be accepted for entry to the specialist register in the UK on the basis that they do not possess a qualification granted by a UK training body.</P>
    <P>While this decision would not affect those seeking entry to higher training now or in the future it does, to some degree, reduce the level of reciprocity which has traditionally prevailed.  It could, therefore, be interpreted as casting doubt on the status of the Irish qualifications.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform Members that this issue has <Col N="1436" /> been raised at the highest level with the appropriate authorities in the UK.  It would be regrettable if these long standing arrangements, which are a perfect example of the benefits to be gained from North-South and east-west co-operation in these islands, were to cease at the point where the two Governments were seeking to expand the scope for co-operation.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senator for raising this issue.  I accept it is an important one and it has already been raised at the highest level in the UK.  I will convey the Senator's concern to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister, Deputy Woods, put an enormous amount of work into the Department of Health during his term of office there and he will understand the urgency of this issue for medical graduates in this country.</P>
      <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 2 April 1998.</P>
