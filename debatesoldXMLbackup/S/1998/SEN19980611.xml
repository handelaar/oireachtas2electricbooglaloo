      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to retain the Breaking the Cycle scheme in operation in the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, and Scoil Mhuire, Dorset Street.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to outline the steps he is taking to prevent the illegal entry of Romanian citizens into this country, allegedly through organised criminal elements in Europe, and if he has requested the French authorities to improve security at the seaport of Cherbourg.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Tom Hayes of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make funding available on a once-off basis to allow for the restoration of Fethard Abbey in County Tipperary.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator Costello and Senator Mooney and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Tom Hayes may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with deep regret that we learned last night of the death of an esteemed former Member of this House, Mr. Paudge Brennan.  He was born in Carnew in County <Col N="1302" /> Wicklow and was first elected to the Dáil in 1954, regaining the seat held by his late father, Tom, since 1944.  He was subsequently re-elected at every election up to 1969, heading the poll for that constituency on each occasion.</P>
      <P>A former member of the Fianna Fáil National Executive, Paudge was also a vice-president of the party for many years.  During his time in the Dáil he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the late Mr. Neil Blaney and Mr. Kevin Boland when they were Ministers.  He held this position from 1965 until 1970.  He was a Taoiseach's nominee in this House from April to November 1982 and he retired from national politics in 1987.</P>
      <P>Paudge was also a distinguished member of Wicklow County Council for many years and a former chairman of Wicklow VEC.  He was a member of Wicklow County Committee of Agriculture and a distinguished member of the General Council of County Councils for many years. He was a member of the European Conference of Local Authorities from 1961-5.</P>
      <P>During his time in the Dáil and Seanad he was a vocal public representative on agricultural issues and, in particular, on matters affecting those he so ably represented and his famed County Wicklow.  During his long service in public life Paudge continually pressed the interests of the people of his county whom he served so well. In fact, it was he who was instrumental in bringing Nitrigin Éireann, now known as Irish Fertilizer Industries Limited, to Arklow.</P>
      <P>Paudge was a proud member of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  He represented his club, Carnew, with great distinction for many years and was a well known player on the Wicklow county football team for many years also.  He was on that famous team which took part in the game known as &ldquo;The Long Whistle&rdquo;.  The game went 11 minutes over the time and the moment Meath got the winning extra point, the game concluded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Paudge, to all who have known him, was an honourable decent public representative who was strong in his republican views and principles.  His word was his bond.</P>
      <P>I was fortunate to have benefited from his guiding hand during my early days as a Member of the House.  In fact, as I was the only new Fianna Fáil Member of the Seanad on 7 May 1982, Paudge introduced me to the House.  He had a great one-liner which he said I should never forget and I never will.  It was that it was never the wrong time to do the right thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paudge was a great family man.  He was married to Mary for 48 years.  He is survived by her and his daughters Jo, Rosemary and Sally, and his sons Tom, Seán and Barry.  On behalf of the House and the Fianna Fáil Party, I extend our <Col N="1303" /> deepest sympathy to his wife and family and to those groups he so ably represented.</P>
    <P>Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader in this expression of sympathy to the family of the late Deputy and Senator Paudge Brennan, who was also a Junior Minister.  I remember Paudge Brennan in this House.  He had a long career for 33 years.  He was a man of high principles, as the Leader said, because he resigned on an issue of principle and that is never easy in public life.  He had a distinguished career as a Parliamentary Secretary but I do not remember that part of his career.</P>
      <P>The passing of such people is a great loss.  They represented a link in this House with early democracy.  After all, he came into this House when democracy was barely 25 or 30 years old. He was here during the formative years of the 1960s, 1970s and into the mid-1980s.</P>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I join in the tributes to him and in the expression of sympathy to his wife and family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expression of sympathy for Paudge Brennan.  I, like Senator Cassidy who came into this House at a similar time, met Paudge Brennan early on here.  He was extremely hospitable and friendly.  In those days I remember enjoying many hours in another place with him when his courtesy was extremely noticeable although we disagreed about everything.  That did not seem to make any difference to him.  In fact, I do not think he even noticed that sort of thing because he was such a friendly and genuine person that he took everybody at face value.</P>
      <P>As a member of Wicklow County Council, I can tell the House that he will be mourned.  He is a man who is remembered with great nostalgia there, not only as a Wicklow county councillor, but as a Senator, a Deputy and a Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>In my younger rebellious days I remember trying unsuccessfully to persuade my parents, who lived in Wicklow at the time, to vote for Paudge Brennan.  It was around 1968-9 and that was not a good time to ask Anglo-Irish people to vote for people who had taken republican stances; but I had met him and I had been greatly impressed by his deep decent earthiness and friendliness.  He was such an obviously decent guy.  On behalf of the Independents, I greatly mourn his passing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the wife and family of the late Paudge Brennan and with the tributes which have already been paid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He came into the Oireachtas almost half a century ago and served at every level.  He was a Senator here for a brief period of time, a Member of the Dáil and, indeed, a Parliamentary Secretary at ministerial level.  Therefore, his contribution <Col N="1304" /> at national level was substantial.  Likewise, at local level, as a member of Wicklow County Council, chairman of the Wicklow VEC, GAA player and office holder in Wicklow, his contribution was also substantial.</P>
    <P>I did not know the man, but I heard about him on many occasions.  He was well known and loved.  The principled stand he took when he resigned his seat, joined Aontacht Éireann for a period of time and subsequently returned to Fianna Fáil, indicates a man who was capable of taking difficult and principled decisions.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I express my deepest sympathy to his wife and family and, indeed, to Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join in this expression of sympathy on the death of the late Paudge Brennan.  Only last week I was talking to somebody who was regaling me about some of his escapades at Fianna Fáil National Executive level.  I did not know then that he was so close to death and his passing is to be mourned.</P>
      <P>He was obviously a very distinguished politician. He had a long career of over 30 years in national politics which was marked by service to the State and considerable success, being a Minister.</P>
      <P>Coming from neighbouring County Kildare, I was well aware of the stature of Paudge Brennan and the affection there was for him among the electorate, certainly on the western side of the hills and throughout County Wicklow.</P>
      <P>To his wife, Mary, and family, we extend our sympathy.  It must be a mark of the man and probably to his credit that he disagreed with Senator Ross on practically everything.  I hope the extra time which he is now playing is being played in a better place and that the whistle will not blow on him too soon.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1, Report and Final Stages, is to be taken today.  Item 2, Committee and Remaining Stages, is to be taken today.  Item 3, Second Stage, is to be taken at 2.30 p.m. with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1998, is being taken in the Dáil today.  If it is passed without amendment, <Col N="1305" /> I propose to take all Stages today.  If the Bill is amended in the Dáil, it may not be possible to do this as the text of the Bill, as passed by Dáil Éireann, may not be available to Senators.  I will have more definite information on this later in the day and I will inform the House of the arrangements for taking the Bill and, if necessary, move an amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Leader clarify which Stages of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill, he may take today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to take all Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Has a time limit been set for the completion of the Tribunals of Inquiry Bill in the Dáil?  It would help if we knew what time the Bill would come to this House.  We do not approve of the taking of all Stages of Bills in one day.  I know the Minister wants to have this Bill on the Statute Book by next week.  It is important that we know when Second Stage will commence in this House because that will have implications for the remaining two Stages.  I hope the Leader will be able to come back with information at a very early stage.</P>
      <P>I again raise the matter of rail safety.  While passing through a major midlands town yesterday I noticed a train going towards Dublin on the Sligo-Dublin line half an hour late.  I mentioned last week that the Minister and Iarnród Éireann have received the report from consultants appointed by the Minister to look into rail safety on lines which have not been upgraded in recent years.  It is important that this report be published. The Leader has promised a debate on this issue and it is important that this debate be held. In advance of that debate it is absolutely important that this report be made public.  Only the Minister can do that.  Will the Leader ask the Minister to publish this report as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recall that yesterday I raised the question of the statements made by the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland.  I indicated my intention to table a motion in that regard.  I have done so.  In the light of the Leader's response, which I found uncharacteristically unsatisfactory, I will be moving an amendment to the Order of Business that item 20 be taken first.  This will be seconded by Senator Ross.  I do this because the Leader indicated that I could use Independent Senators' Private Members' time and he generously suggested that Fianna Fáil would do the same the next week.  We have, however, plenty of time.  We can certainly fit in a debate on this question without removing from the Independent group the privilege which they, unlike other sections of the House, greatly value.  We recognise this fact by tabling serious and strongly felt motions.  In Private Members' time I will be moving a motion on East Timor and not on the insurance industry, which is the <Col N="1306" /> responsibilty of everybody in this House and for which there was widespread support when I raised it yesterday and when it was raised by other colleagues, including Senator Henry.</P>
      <P>I also raise the question of item 21.  Can we make some reference to this because of the growing number of attacks on asylum seekers and the involvement of some official and semi-official groups?  I have had to deal with a number of instances in which gardaí were unpleasantly involved.  This is a continuing and growing matter and one which a debate in this House should draw to the attention of the Garda Síochána. Once an unpleasant incident occurs in the lower ranks of the force it is the natural reaction of people in higher ranks to justify and protect their members.  It is imperative that a message goes from the top of the Garda Síochána to the gardaí on the beat that they must not abuse the rights of people whether they are citizens or asylum seekers and regardless of their colour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with incredulity to the Order of Business as outlined by the Leader.  I do not think this House has ever been presented with the hypothetical situation that all Stages of a Bill, if it comes to the House, will be taken in one day.  The Bill has been discussed for two days in the other House, yet Senators are being asked to deal with all Stages if it happens to turn up at some time today.  That is an insult to this House and is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>We do not oppose the Bill.  We have called for amendments to be made to the terms of reference of tribunals of inquiry.  Can the Leader discover when the debate is expected to conclude in the other House?  I suggest that we take Second Stage after tea-time and the other Stages tomorrow.  I cannot accept the scenario outlined by the Leader.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding was that Senator Cassidy, out of courtesy, was informing the House that he might be coming back later today with an amendment to the Order of Business. He is not making a concrete proposal in relation to the Order of Business.  The Leader was, for the information of the House, advising Senators of possible developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not object to what the Leader may come back with later but to his indication that all Stages would be taken today if he does come back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter to be decided by the House when and if the Leader proposes an amendment to the Order of Business at a later stage during the sitting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking on the Order of Business as proposed by the Leader.  We will oppose the Order of Business unless there is substantial clarification of what he has already said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> We will move an amendment to the Order of Business that item 18 be taken before the items outlined by the Leader.  In view of the importance of this issue, the manner in which the Insurance Ombudsman has been forced to retire, the bullying that took place, the need for a statutory Ombudsman to protect the interests of the consumer in this sector and the censorship that has taken place, we join Senator Norris in calling for a debate on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be understood that this House does not control what takes place in the other House.  These circumstances are quite unusual.  Both Houses wish to see the Bill pass in time to deal with these particularly serious matters. Given these unique circumstances it is reasonable that we adopt a flexible approach to ensure the passage of the legislation, which is the objective of all sides.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago I noted with concern the ongoing Garda pay dispute.  I raise the issue again and ask the Leader to ask the Taoiseach to intervene.  Notice has been given that the dispute may escalate with another &ldquo;blue flu&rdquo; day on Saturday next.  I voice the concerns of the people on this issue.</P>

      <P>At a time when many thousands of tourists flock to Ireland to trace their ancestral roots and to sample our good weather, will the Leader impress on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the importance of increasing the grants available to rethatch houses before the thatched house as we know it disappears?  It is an integral part of our culture and heritage.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on the Insurance Ombudsman's office.  I raised this matter on the Adjournment a couple of months ago and I was subsequently telephoned by a member of the council to ask whether I had been put up to it or duped.  When I wrote to the chairman of the council to ask whether this person had telephoned on behalf of the council I received no reply.  Senators will have noticed that the council maintains that it is not in dispute with the Ombudsman but the last Ombudsman's report did not contain a foreward by the chairman nor a photograph of him.</P>

Those in mainstream education can stay on after 18 years of age if they wish but those in special schools cannot.  This could be construed as discriminatory to pupils who are disadvantaged at the outset.</P>

The Leader indicated that the Supplementary Order Paper will propose to take all Stages of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill, 1998, today.  We cannot run blind into this matter and we should wait to see what happens in the Dáil.  I urge him to reconsider his proposal on this Bill.  In the public interest I strongly support the request for an urgent debate on the Insurance Ombudsman.  It is a matter of great concern and the House would show its relevance to the public by having a debate on the issue at an early opportunity.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader organise an urgent debate on the crisis facing the Western Development Commission?  The chief executive announced publicly last week that he is considering resignation due to the failure of the Government to put forward the legislation needed for the commission to conduct its business.  It seems possible to have legislation on many other matters &mdash; yesterday the House debated legislation updating 18th century laws.  However, it seems we cannot provide the Western Development Commission with the funds it needs urgently.  Objective One Status is being sought for the west from the EU but the Government will not give the west what it deserves.</P>

He spoke with the Whips earlier in the week and I support Senator Burke's request that we meet on the matter.  It was my understanding that we were to take the Tribunals Bill today.  At the time that proposal was made it was not clear whether the Bill would have been passed by the Dáil.  I proposed that we take the Bill tomorrow, which would have avoided uncertainty.  We wish to be helpful in dealing with this important legislation; it would make sense to take it tomorrow.  There is no reason it cannot be dealt with then instead of today.  We thought today's Order of Business was set, but now that we see it is not we feel it proper to table an amendment so that we can get in on the action.</P>

      <P>Senators Connor, Costello, Burke and O'Toole have raised concerns about the Tribunals of Inquiry Evidence (Amendment)(No. 3) Bill, 1998.  This Bill is expected to pass in the Dáil by 1.30 p.m., and if it passes without amendment, the Bill will be brought to the Seanad at 4.30 p.m. I will meet with the Whips and Leaders immediately after the Order of Business to clarify this matter further.  I thank the various parties for their help in dealing with this urgent legislation. There is a timeframe for dealing with the Bill which will come before the House in a motion later today or early tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Henry, Gallagher, Ross and Chambers referred to the serious position the Insurance Ombudsman finds herself in.  I offered Fianna Fáil and Independents' time, amounting to four hours, to deal with this.  I thought this would have been sufficient&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator Costello referred to item 8.  I welcome the Labour group back to the Seanad.  They were probably on a think tank mission as this seems to be the time to do that.</P>
      <P>Regarding today's business, Senator Costello should be as realistic and fair minded as he has always been.  There are three Bills before the House today, and there may be a fourth later. Senator Costello's party leader and former party leader agree on the urgency of that fourth Bill. Though item 8 is worthy of support, I ask Senator Costello to withdraw it, given the circumstances I find myself in.</P>

    <P>Senator McDonagh called for action from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government regarding thatched houses and I will pass his request on.  Senators Kett, Henry and Ormonde have enormous experience in the education field and I will pass on their urgent request to the Minister for Education and Science.

      <P>This is a Seanad Bill which has been amended by the Dáil.  In accordance with Standing Order 85 it is deemed to have passed its First, Second and Third Stages in the Seanad and is placed on the Order Paper for Report Stage.  On the question &ldquo;That the Bill be received for final consideration&rdquo;, the Minister may explain the purpose of the amendments made by the Dáil and this is looked on as the report of the Dáil amendments to the Seanad. The only matter, therefore, that may be discussed is the amendments made by the Dáil.

      <P>There were 27 Government amendments to the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, in the Dáil.  The amendments are listed Nos. 1 to 27 on the amendment sheet circulated to Members.  The amendments insert four new substantive provisions into <Col N="1313" /> the Bill in addition to amendments on seven technical issues.</P>
      <P>The substantive amendments are Nos. 3, 4 and 9 which deal with reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive, provide an exclusion in respect of proficiency in the Irish language.  Amendments Nos. 14 to 20, inclusive, and No. 23 establish strategic management principles in the Equality Authority and the redraft procedures.  Amendments Nos. 24, 25 and 27 provide access to the general redress procedures to members of the Defence Forces where discrimination on grounds of gender is concerned.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 4 and 9 are the substantive amendments to the disability provisions of the Bill.  Following the debate in the Seanad and Second Stage in the Dáil, I undertook to examine the question of providing specifically for a reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities in the context of the Bill.  Consequently, I arranged for a full review of the relevant provisions. Amendment No. 3 replaces the existing section 16(3) with a new provision.  The new section 16(3) obliges the Director of Equality Investigations to take into account, in the context of proceedings under the Bill, whether an employer has made a reasonable accommodation where such is needed by the employee in order to do their job effectively.  In other words, any case seeking redress for discrimination on the grounds of disability must be evaluated not just by reference to section 16(1) but also by reference to section 16(3).</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 broadens the scope of the obligation to provide reasonable accommodation in section 16(3) to cover employment agencies, providers of vocational training and regulatory bodies.  Amendment No. 9 is a consequential amendment to delete the now redundant section 35(4).</P>
      <P>I will now deal with amendments Nos. 10 to 13, inclusive.  Amendment No. 13 confines the exclusion in section 36 in respect of teachers in primary and post-primary schools to proficiency in the Irish language as distinct from the grounds of residency and citizenship.  Amendments Nos. 10 to 12 are technical in nature and they are consequential on the substantive amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 to 20, inclusive, and No. 23 can be explained in the context of the strategic management initiative.  Amendments Nos. 14 to 20 establish a statutory basis for implementing strategic management into the Equality Authority. The strategic management initiative was introduced in the Civil Service in 1994 and has been developed to enhance the management and effectiveness of the public service.  Its underlying principle is to promote an excellent service to the public and ensure that resources are used in an effective and efficient way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 requires the authority to submit strategic plans to the Minister every three years for his or her approval, following which he or she is required to lay the plans before the <Col N="1314" /> Houses of the Oireachtas with or without amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 sets out in detail the functions and accountability for the performance of those functions of the chief executive officer of the authority.  The chief executive officer is charged with managing and controlling the day to day business, administration and resources of the authority and he or she will be accountable to it for the implementation of its policies and the general performance of the new organisation.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 provide for the appointment of the chief executive officer and other staff of the authority.  The staff of the authority, including the chief executive officer, may include civil servants, non-civil servants or a combination of both.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 provides for the accountability of the chief executive officer of the authority to the Committee of Public Accounts. Under this provision the chief executive officer may be required to give evidence to the committee in respect of the regularity and propriety of the authority's financial transactions, the economy and efficiency of the use of its resources and the systems in place for evaluating the effectiveness of its operations.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 makes provision in respect of the accounts and audits of the authority and it is modelled on the analogous provision in the recently published Food Safety Authority legislation. Amendment No. 20 sets out the accountability of the authority to the Minister and brings this aspect of the Bill into line with the principles of strategic management.  Amendment No. 23 provides for the Director of Equality Investigations to submit an annual report of the activities of the office of the Director to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 25 and 27 provides access to members of the Defence Forces to the general redress procedures in Part Vll in respect of gender discrimination.  Before availing of the redress provisions in Part Vll, a member of the Defence Forces must first exhaust internal redress procedures. If the complaint is not addressed under these procedures to the satisfaction of the member of the Defence Forces or within the period of one year, he or she can refer the matter to the Director of Equality Investigations, the Labour Court or the Circuit Court in the normal way. Amendment No. 24 is a technical measure which brings consistency into the text of the Bill.  The remaining amendments are technical in nature.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 is a technical measure introduced because the definition of the word &ldquo;presently&rdquo; in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> includes the terms &ldquo;soon&rdquo; and &ldquo;shortly&rdquo; while the intention of the provision is to cover disability which currently exists.  This amendment will ensure that no ambiguity will arise at some future date about the interpretation of the provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 2 is also a technical amendment. Section 5(3) of the Bill amends section 4 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969, which relates to the Deputy Chairman of the Labour Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> References to the Deputy Chairman in that Act are lower case and this amendment ensures consistency between both pieces of legislation in that regard.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is also a technical measure.</P>
    <P>The Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, which came into operation on 1 March 1998 repeals the Shops (Conditions of Employment) Act, 1938, and, accordingly, section 17(1) was superfluous.  This amendment deletes that subsection. Amendment No. 6 is a further technical amendment which corrects a typographical error in the Bill and is self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 8 are of a technical nature and are intended to clarify the scope of section 31.  Amendment No. 7 removes an unnecessary reference to subsection (4) in subsection (2) as the distinction between employees and agency workers does not arise in the context of regulatory bodies.  Amendment No. 8 clarifies that subsection (5) applies to agency workers as well as employees generally.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are technical and bring consistency to the text of the Bill.  It is normal practice to provide that the Minister for Finance would consent to a proposal from another Minister, but would concur with another Minister when that Minister consents to a proposal from the third party.  Amendment No. 26 increases the maximum fine in respect of trials on indictment to £25,000, the amount considered appropriate bearing in mind the types of offences created in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill creates a great deal of concern for people in various walks of life, particularly those in the teaching profession.  The Minister is well aware of my views and I do not intend to restate all the arguments which have been dealt with on three previous occasions and in meetings between the two of us.  Teachers, particularly at primary level, are extraordinarily worried about the implications of the Bill for them.  I recognise we are constrained on Report Stage and if I am extending my brief or going beyond what is appropriate, I am prepared to wait until Final Stage to make my contribution.  However, I think it might be better to let me go at this stage.</P>
      <P>Since Committee Stage, the Treaty of Amsterdam has been passed.  I said on Committee Stage that the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, put certain requirements on boards of management of schools in order to ensure there was a diversity of cultures which would be maintained and helped along.  I am even more concerned now when I read aspects of the Treaty of Amsterdam which create a new imperative on the Government, the State and all of us.  I will not go back over all the details but I refer to Article 128.4º, which states:</P>
      <P>The Community shall take cultural aspects into account in its actions under the provisions of this Treaty, in particular in order to respect and promote the diversity of its cultures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1316" /> There are statements like that throughout the Treaty.  How can the Minister say primary teachers in particular can be excluded from this diversity in a State where between 95 and 97 per cent of primary schools have a church ethos? Where does that leave the question of diversity for those who might have different views, etc.  ? The Minister will respond by saying the Bill states an individual has to be seen to be undermining the ethos of a school and the action taken by a board or the school authorities against such an individual will be on the basis that they undermined this ethos.</P>
    <P>A more proactive role is envisaged by the Treaty, particularly where it refers to the social protection of people, the harmonisation of social systems and a harmonised approach to diversity and culture.  We are creating a huge problem for ourselves.  It will not be resolved by the amendments which have been tabled.  I very much regret the Minister did not extend the changes to encompass the new demands on Government by the Treaty and did not take a position where teachers would be protected.  They will not be protected because, as I said on Committee Stage, ethos will be dealt with locally.  It will involve a board of management of a school deciding it does not like something about a teacher's religious beliefs or practices and it will interpret that as undermining the ethos of the school.  Consequently, the teacher's employment will come under threat.</P>
    <P>I asked for a number of amendments to be introduced on Report Stage, one of which was that the concept of ethos would be determined by a particular Church rather than the management of a school.  I tried to establish that, for instance, if there are 3,000 Roman Catholic primary schools in the State, the Roman Catholic ethos would be determined for all of them rather than one person in one school taking a different interpretation. That concerns me.  The question of ethos is not detailed in the Bill despite the Supreme Court judgment which led to many of the changes being made to the Bill, some of which are reflected in these amendments.</P>
    <P>I note with wry irony that the Minister referred to the dictionary definition of the word &ldquo;presently&rdquo;.  That definition has been a matter of debate among people who enjoy language and the Shakespearean interpretation means &ldquo;immediately&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;currently&rdquo;.  That is the correct interpretation but the use of the word &ldquo;presently&rdquo; in the manner referred to by the Minister is understood by people nowadays.  I do not object to it but I refer to the fact that the Supreme Court had to go to the Chambers dictionary to get an interpretation of the word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;.  Have we reached a stage where people will interpret legislation by referring to dictionaries? We are leaving a great deal to risk which we could have dealt with.</P>
    <P>This legislation will create problems for teachers at school level which are unnecessary.  I did not correct Senator Walsh on Committee <Col N="1317" /> Stage, but I will now for the record.  Every time I spoke on this Bill I said schools were entitled to have an ethos.  However, the Senator attributed precisely the opposite to me.  I have always been completely in favour of that.  Parents are entitled to make the choice of a school with a particular ethos.  I completely support choice for parents and those running schools.  It is how we employ people beyond that and the connection between proselytization and teaching that creates difficulty. The teacher makes a professional input but is he or she required to do more?  The proposals I put forward on Committee Stage created a balance but I obviously failed to convince people.</P>
    <P>I also failed to make myself properly understood by Senators Walsh and Lydon who attributed to me a proposal to separate Church and State.  He said I wanted to take the churches out of schools.  I never made such a proposal, and would not ask that such a proposal be made, for the simple reason that parents have the right to choice in education.  Teachers also have a right to choice in education, which is more restricted, but it has to do with protecting their jobs and professionalism. There must be a recognition that an individual could be appointed to a school who is totally committed to its beliefs but who could have a change in attitude and find himself in a completely different set of circumstances &mdash; for example, in a relationship unacceptable to the school authorities.  This could not and should not be seen as undermining ethos, but the Bill allows for that to take place.</P>
    <P>I accept the amendments to that section have increased the burden of proof far more than was provided for and that there are now certain steps which must be proved.  The Bill, as amended, is a major improvement on the original proposal. However, it is unhelpful that Ireland is enacting reactive and regressive legislation in the month after our acceptance of the Amsterdam Treaty, with its proposals on third pillar rights, etc.  It is also unacceptable that an Employment Equality Bill should include a section which gives the right to discriminate.  The incompatibility in the issues raised by this have not been resolved by these amendments.</P>
    <P>While I do not have difficulties with the amendments I am disappointed other amendments were not accepted.  I concede the Minister of State has worked hard on the Bill and that many other pressure groups besides teachers have had to be satisfied.  However, I regret that in trying to meet the concerns of all parties the balance came down against employees, which the Bill seeks to protect in the first instance.</P>
    <P>People will lose jobs in two to three years.  We are in a new kind of society with new sets of relationships.  For example, what are the implications following the introduction of divorce, which is unacceptable to some of the Churches and would, therefore, be contrary to their ethos? What would happen if the board of management of a school decides that a divorced person living in another relationship, a marriage not recognised <Col N="1318" /> by the Church involved in the school, is undermining the ethos of the school?  How could such a person be defended under the terms of this Bill?</P>
    <P>Teachers who suffer and whose jobs are at risk because of the provisions of the Bill will be supported by the INTO if they take a case to the High Court or the Supreme Court to ensure their rights are protected.  There is a strong possibility that a teacher will lose a case and his or her job on the basis of this legislation because it allows a chairperson of a board of management to say that, when employed, the teacher was married in the religion of the school but is now divorced and in a new relationship and a marriage it does not recognise and on that basis should be sacked for undermining the ethos of the school.  If we lose such cases we will appeal to Europe.  The Amsterdam Treaty offers greater protection in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minster of State is making a mistake with this legislation.  It is not too late to reconsider it and make changes.  It is regressive, reactionary and repressive.  I regret we are passing this Bill, as drafted.  While 99 per cent of it is positive, good and necessary, for which I compliment the Minister of State, it is unacceptable in the way it deals with schools and teachers and in the way it undermines their security.  It is unfair to those hard working professionals who might find themselves with a different set of beliefs or a new set or circumstances in terms of relationships.</P>
    <P>I do not say that Churches should be out of schools.  Parents make those decisions and it is for us as professional teachers and politicians to ensure they are respected.  Nor do I say schools should not have an ethos; they should have one, whether it be Catholic, Muslim, Jewish, Church of Ireland or whatever.  Parents are entitled to chose, or to chose a school of no religious ethos. Nor do I say it should be acceptable that somebody should actively undermine the ethos of a school, including its culture and beliefs.  There is no protection nor a place for teachers who go out of their way to mock or undermine them or to create doubt in children's minds.</P>
    <P>However, people should accept difference, whether they run a school or, as teachers, work professionally, conscientiously and well and respect the culture and beliefs of the school in terms of parity of esteem.  The focus of a teacher's professionalism must be that every child is respected for his or her self, whatever their beliefs, colour, background or culture.  That should be a mirror image of the way the school authorities see their teachers.  Each should be valued for their goodness and their commitment. I regret the passage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not oppose the amendments, but I am disappointed the implications of the Supreme Court judgment on the original Bill have not been addressed to the extent that will allow, in the most positive manner possible, people with disabilities to enforce the rights <Col N="1319" /> which Members of both Houses had intended to give them under employment equality legislation.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 3, the Minister of State has gone as far as she can from a legal viewpoint in strengthening the employment rights of disabled people, while trying to work around the Supreme Court judgment, which many of us said on Second Stage is almost impossible to comprehend. What would the court make of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, which gave women the right to equality in employment and imposed on employers certain costs which could not have been judged nominal, such as the provision of proper toilet facilities?  It is possible a constitutional challenge to that Act on the basis of the judgment given on the Employment Equality Bill would succeed.</P>
      <P>The Minister had two options to greatly enhance the power of people with disabilities and other groups mentioned in the Bill to enforce their rights.  The first would have been a constitutional amendment.  That question has been addressed at length here so I will not rehearse the arguments again.  If the Minister's predecessor, Mr. Taylor, saw fit to argue to the Government, who then saw fit to argue at European level, to put the rights of people with disabilities and other groups into the Amsterdam Treaty, which may be called the Constitution of the EU, it is inconsistent for Ireland not to greatly strengthen in its Constitution the rights of people with disabilities. Ireland will agree to such strengthening in European law, but it will not agree to it in Irish law. Senator O'Toole is correct in his prediction that the legislation will be challenged on the basis of rights granted to people in the Amsterdam Treaty and the consequent failure of the Minister to adequately address the matter in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I am aware of employers who are open to employing people with disabilities and who are prepared to make a contribution of more than a nominal nature. However, they would have difficulty making substantial financial contributions in terms of the adaptation of buildings.  There is an onus on the Minister to address the interests and concerns of such employers by putting in place a strong scheme of financial incentives and supports and properly marketing it to businesses and employers.  As organisations such as the NRB and Rehab are aware, some employers are open to taking on people with disabilities.  The Minister should market that concept more strongly and put in place information and finance to encourage them to offer places of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate in the other House on the commission's report 18 months ago, I challenged the Minister of State who was then in Opposition to state that if her party went into Government, the Department of Equality and Law Reform would be retained and would have a Minister in the Cabinet.  On that occasion the Minister of State declined to answer my challenge.  We know <Col N="1320" /> what happened.  I do not question the Minister of State's commitment to her work; I am aware from many groups of her interest in their needs and her efforts to address them.</P>
    <P>However, a junior Minister and part of a Department with responsibility for this area is not enough.  As evidenced in the deficiencies in the Bill, I regret that this agenda is not being pursued on a full-time basis by a Minister with Cabinet rank.  I will continue to make this point to the Government.  In a sense, this is a plea for the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, to be elevated to the Cabinet.  I do not want her to interpret my comments as a personal attack, but the agenda for which she has responsibility and that her officials are trying to pursue will not be properly enforced until her office is restored to full departmental status and her Ministry has full Cabinet rank.</P>

However, that is not limited to the current Minister or the party currently in Government. Similar cases were made to the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, when the Bill was first introduced. There is nothing partisan or personal in my comments.  The issue relates to the correct function of the House.  We proposed the ideal situation which would meet all the human requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that there is an element of what is perceived as <i>realpolitik</i> in this area.  Although moves are desirable, it is not considered practical to move in the direction recommended by Senator O'Toole and me.  Having examined the Bill introduced by the former Minister, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, this legislation contains all the defects pointed out at that time, but it also contains some improvements.  I welcome the <Col N="1321" /> inclusion of these improvements, particularly for people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a considerable way and I applaud her in that regard.  It has made a good Bill better, although it still contains defects.  I will not weary the House by rehearsing the details but it is regrettable that a Bill which deals with equality and addresses the subject of discrimination continues to permit discrimination on the part of elements of society which have comprehensively shown themselves to be the least fit or worthy to discriminate.  I refer to the churches.</P>
      <P>I spent much time in the various debates dealing with problems originating from the Roman Catholic Church and its control of the school system. However, lest anybody considers that this was sectarian, I will refer to a case to which I referred briefly previously involving the curate at St. Bartholomew's Church in the Church of Ireland of which I am member.  He was gay and in a stable relationship.  It was known to most of the parishioners but when it was drawn to the attention of the church authorities, he was summoned. He was told that he either got rid of his stable relationship or he would be fired from his job and he would lose his house.</P>
      <P>The curate refused, he was fired and the relationship was destroyed.  Two people who had been happy together for eight years split up.  The curate's partner went to England where he formed another relationship with a clergyman in the Church of England but both of them died of AIDS.  The young man contracted it from his second partner in England.  The operation of discriminatory employment policies by the Church of Ireland had fatal consequences and this will continue under this legislation.  There is nothing to protect people in such circumstances.</P>
      <P>There was much talk yesterday about suicide. A report on poverty in the gay community has been produced by GLEN.  This indicates that there is a significantly higher rate of suicide among young gay men than in the rest of the population.  Anything which addresses this problem by giving people security in employment and housing, the very things for which we fought for the Catholic Nationalist minority in the North of Ireland, must be welcomed because they are still not fully guaranteed to gay citizens.  This was my principal reservation, in addition to the reservations expressed by Senator O'Toole regarding teachers, about the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will improve life for people.  I do not wish to be begrudging but it does not go far enough.  I understand the type of advice the Minister has undoubtedly received that opposition would be strong if amendments guaranteeing the rights of people in vulnerable positions were accepted.  I am not gloating but the power of the Church has evaporated.  For good or ill, it is gone. This is sad in many respects.  When one travels around the country one sees empty and derelict convent buildings.  One hears on the radio that the Roman Catholic Church is now facing the same problems the Church of Ireland has faced <Col N="1322" /> for many generations, for example, difficulty finding clergy to service parishes.  I do not gloat about this matter.  The Irish people will find much to regret in the passing of the presence of the Church at parochial level.</P>

      <P>I hope it does, but consider the closing of the monasteries &mdash; Henry VIII did that, now we are doing it for ourselves and it is a tragedy.  On the other hand, the Churches were never weaker politically.  I do not suggest that we punch them into a corner, gloat over and act oppressively against them; but if we have an intellectually sustainable and morally justifiable argument, we should now be in a position to stand up to them.  We know the history of the Church but we should put our view on the welfare of our citizens and state that they are entitled to jobs, security and a home.  Unfortunately, the Bill does not do that, although it has moved a considerable distance. I regret that we did not take the final step to protect people.</P>

We regret the dilution or diminution of their influence for various reasons, some of which Senator Norris enunciated but others he did not.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister of State for coming to the House with 27 amendments which improve the Bill.  She has been willing to take account of the individual and collective views of Members of both Houses.  It is with extreme reluctance that I respond to Senator Gallagher's remark that the Minister's lack of status was a reflection on the quality of the Bill.  He put a spin on his comments to camouflage the shortcomings of his former colleague with full Cabinet rank, the previous Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor. The former Minister's Bill was good in many respects, as I said on Second Stage, but it was mistake-ridden and rejected as unconstitutional. The Minister of State, lacking full Cabinet rank as she does, has been correcting those mistakes.</P>

      <P>The 27 amendments she has put before us significantly improve the previous flawed Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the issue of reasonable cost has been reincorporated in the Bill &mdash; the Attorney General did not give the Minister clearance to include that in the Bill when it was first before the House but she has secured it since.  I compliment her on that because it will prove workable.  The Director of Equality Investigations will be the final arbiter or even an arbiter of first call in the case of a person who feels wronged or discriminated against by an employer who claims the cost is <Col N="1323" /> prohibitive.  The appeal system is in place and it is up to us to ensure the Director has the calibre, competence and resources to deal effectively and efficiently with such appeals as may arise, which I hope will be few.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole is my leader in another capacity and I empathise with his concerns about teachers or other professionals dealing with religious orders who, without deliberately intending to undermine the ethos of a school or similar institution, find themselves in difficulty because of changes in their circumstances. However, I was disappointed that the Senator did not take into account the appeal mechanism in the Bill.  If circumstances such as he outlined should arise, a teacher has recourse in the first instance to the Director of Equality Investigations, and in the second instance either to the courts or the European Commission on Human Rights.  I would be surprised if the unions would have to go directly to the courts arising from a decision by the Director in the first instance.  The Senator also referred to the Amsterdam Treaty, the provisions of which strengthen workers' rights in this regard.  That is also to be welcomed because it will provide further safeguards and protection at European level.</P>
    <P>If shortcomings are found, which I doubt, reasonable care has been taken to ensure these rights are protected &mdash; parents have a constitutional right to have their children educated in the religion of their choice and, for the first time, this Bill gives teachers protection from religious discrimination at work.  Section 37(1) addresses the balance between these rights and we discussed that on Second and Committee Stages. The amendments improve the Bill.  We will never have perfect legislation and this is not put forward as a panacea for the nine areas which it addresses, but it is an important milestone in the evolution of our legislation to address serious discrimination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been well debated and we will not oppose the 27 amendments introduced by the Minister.  However, I agree with Senator Gallagher &mdash; the Bill provides for a lot of money to be raised through the Oireachtas for committees and staff but it should also have provided for a grant scheme for employers.  Many firms are well disposed to employing people with disabilities but a person's best friend is his back pocket, and if it costs a lot of money the employer will not do it.  If the Minister had provided for assistance by way of grant aid many employers would take it up.  Other than that, the Minister has worked extremely hard on the Bill and I compliment her for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendments which the Minister has introduced and the general thrust of the Bill.  I was surprised at the negative comments which were made.  Some of those comments were ill founded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1324" /> The Minister deserves credit in this instance. It is less than 12 months since this Bill ran into difficulties and was referred to the Supreme Court along with the Equal Status Bill.  In the short space of time the Minister has been in office she has succeeded in guiding the Bill through those difficulties, enabling her to present the Bill here in such a comprehensive form.  It will have a beneficial effect when it is implemented.  I hope the Minister will be able to make the same progress in relation to the Equal Status Bill.  That would be welcome and I hope the Minister will be back before the House with that Bill before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The first main point of substance in the 27 amendments was of concern to many people in this House &mdash; the provision of better opportunity in employment and lifestyle for the disabled.  The Minister has gone as far as is prudent with this and the amendments significantly improve the situation so that reasonable accommodation provisions will have to be made by employers.  They will be subject to adjudication if someone feels he or she has been discriminated against.  The employer will also be expected to make nominal financial provisions in relation to that.  If the Bill had gone further it could have imposed significant expense on employers which could be counterproductive in that employers might have looked at the costs involved when recruiting.  The economy is making progress on the basis of partnership. The ethos of the Bill in accommodating disabled people will be taken on board.</P>
    <P>The changes in relation to teachers are positive. The residency and citizenship requirements which were originally included in the Bill have been removed for teachers.  All that will be required is proficiency in the Irish language.  The retention of that requirement is important because as we become more integrated in Europe a great deal of emphasis is being placed on the preservation of individual culture and heritage at European level. There is no more significant measure of culture than the national language and anything which would diminish that would be a retrograde step. The Welsh have a strong love of their language and use it more often than we use the Irish language. That is the example we should follow.</P>
    <P>Teaching is an excellent profession and teachers shape our young people, who in turn will shape the State as we move into the next millennium. However, there is often a disparity in the proficiency of teachers in teaching Irish and there is patchy teaching of the language as a result. Hopefully the Bill, with this provision in it, will help to correct this.  There is a lack of uniformity in the ability of teachers to teach the language.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole.  The last time this Bill was debated here in this House, I did not ascribe to anything in his interpretation.  There was a far less intemperate use of language by Senators O'Toole and Norris today, they have clarified their positions and I agree with them. Senator O'Toole said he had no brief for teachers who undermine a school's ethos.  That is provided <Col N="1325" /> for in section 37 of the Bill and it was important the Senator acknowledged that.  The primary beneficiaries in all of this must be the students.  I accept that teachers, parents and school management boards are important components, but the focus of our efforts should be the pupils.  Senator O'Toole may have exaggerated his position to make a point when he mentioned a school interpreting the legislation in a way which would discriminate against someone who was divorced. The possibility of that happening is so remote that it does not merit comment.  The Bill also recognises that those schools under the management of religious orders are covered by section 37.  It would be discriminatory in the extreme if there was to be a provision which prevented them from promoting their own ethos and religion within their own schools.  In all of those schools there is parental discretion to decide whether the pupils participate in religious education.  There are people of other religious denomination throughout the State who have exercised their right under that provision but who are happy to have their children attend those schools.  We must be realistic when moving forward with legislation.</P>
    <P>A further point which might be missed if you took on board everything said by Senators Norris and O'Toole is that there has been a propensity in our education system over the years to make specific provision for and give certain advantage to schools operated by minority religions.  Given the history of our country, that is welcome and it is something which should continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the amendments related to the strategic management initiative.  It is important throughout the public service that we try to have the best quality management standards possible. The pursuit of excellence in all of our public services is laudable, as it is in all walks of life.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on all the work she has done on this Bill.  It was intricate work, as the previous Minister, Mervyn Taylor, discovered. The Minister has achieved the right balance and the fruits of the work will be seen in the years to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Toole, section 37(1) respects the cultural and religious diversity of schools.  The provisions of the subsection apply to schools of all religious denominations, not just the Christian denominations.  It is important that the Senator notes that section 37(1) was found to be constitutional by the Supreme Court.  In this subsection we had to reflect the wide ranging consultations we had with all interested groups &mdash; teaching unions, parents, the management of denominational schools and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The section seeks to strike a balance between the constitutional legal imperative, the individual and personal rights of teachers, and those of parents who wish to have their children educated in a religious based system.  As Senator Liam Fitzgerald pointed out, the Bill provides for <Col N="1326" /> a Director of Equality Investigations to whom a case can be appealed.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher rightly pointed out that Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam specifically includes disability within its equality provisions. The powers provided for in that Article will fall to be exercised by the European Council and the European Commission before the principles contained therein will have application for Irish law and practice.</P>
      <P>When proposals are brought before the Council, Ireland will take a proactive role in developing them at EU level and in the meantime there is no conflict between this Bill and the Treaty.  Indeed, it is likely to be some time before proposals for disability are developed at EU level which are as advanced as those provided for in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher also spoke in favour of constitutional change for people with disabilities and this matter is being looked at within the Department by an interdepartmental committee, along with all the other work that is taking place in the field of disability, including proposals to establish a national disability authority.  Once the Employment Equality Bill is passed, we can proceed over the summer with the other equal status legislation, already referred to by Senators Fitzgerald and Walsh.</P>
      <P>Senators Burke and Gallagher raised the question of putting in place financial support for a work scheme.  I would draw to their attention the fact that there is a scheme in place called the work adaptation grant scheme.  We referred to this grant scheme during the debate on all Stages of the legislation.  The scheme exists and as to financial support, one can obtain up to £5,000 for the adaptation of a workplace.</P>
      <P>It will be of interest to both Senators to note that this time last year funding for the scheme was expanded as there was a waiting list.  When the new Government took office it added additional funding for the scheme to clear the waiting list in 1997 and it doubled the funding levels for 1998.  There is no doubt that the scheme in place has financial support and that money is available for the adaptation of workplaces.</P>
      <P>In general terms, Senator Norris admitted that the Bill will improve life and that we have moved a considerable way forward.  However, he is not satisfied that we have moved far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald welcomed the fact that the Bill has returned to the House within a year.  It would be remiss of me not to recognise the hard working staff in the employment equality section of my Department who have been responsible for delivering this legislation on behalf of the Government.  As Senator Fitzgerald said, the Bill was found to be unconstitutional a year ago.  The new Government was anxious to see it on the Statute Book so it was brought back to the House as quickly as possible.  To be fair to the staff in the Department's employment equality section, they responded to that requirement.  Long hours of work on the legislation ensured that, within a <Col N="1327" /> year, we have been able to return to the House with the Bill for its concluding Stages.  I thank Senator Fitzgerald for recognising that fact.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the concluding Stages of the Bill, Senator Walsh also referred to the improvements for teachers contained in amendment No. 13 to section 36.  This is an important improvement and I was surprised that Senator O'Toole did not refer to it because it is relevant.  I thank Senator Walsh again for underlining that positive change for teachers in the Bill, which has taken place since we debated it some weeks ago in this House.</P>
    <P>I thank all Senators for contributing to the debate, in addition to Deputies in the Lower House and Oireachtas staff.  I also wish to thank outside groups who consulted with us, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, individuals with disabilities and their representatives who were involved during the consultation process. That constant consultation with outside groups as well as listening to Members both of the Seanad and the Dáil meant we were able to amend the Bill in a positive way.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that funding is available for the implementation of the Bill.  We have provided £2.1 million in the 1998 Vote for the establishment of the new Equality Authority and the Director of Equality Investigations.  As Senator Burke said, as long as the Bill is signed this week and everything is in order, we will be able to put the legislation into practice over the summer period.</P>
    <P>As Senators Walsh and Fitzgerald said, the important fact is that we can now proceed with the Equal Status Bill which, like the Employment Equality Bill, deals with the same nine grounds. However, while this Bill deals with employment aspects, the Equal Status Bill to be introduced later in the year will deal with the goods and services aspects of the equality issue with regard to the same nine grounds.  The passing of the Bill today allows us to proceed with that positive work over the summer period.  I thank all Members for their co-operation in assisting the Bill's passage through the House.</P>

    <P>&lsquo;(2A) Notwithstanding subsection (2) and section 46(4), direct access from any adjoining land to a motorway or from the motorway to such land may be granted by the Authority to Córas Iompair Éireann in respect of a light railway&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The background to this amendment lies in the intention that the proposed Dublin LRT will cross the M50 motorway at the Red Cow junction on the Naas Road intersection.  A special bridge will be constructed running parallel to the roundabout and on a level with the Naas Road. The light railway will cross the top of the M50 slip roads in order to gain access to the bridge.</P>
      <P>This design was agreed following consultation between the Dublin Transportation Office, the LRT project team, the National Roads Authority and South Dublin County Council.  It was agreed that the light rail crossing is feasible and that Luas vehicles will operate within the traffic light system determined by the road traffic.</P>
      <P>The DTO recommendation was based on a specially commissioned report which shows that it is possible to run the LRT line through the interchange without interfering with the road traffic.  Planning and design of the LRT have been carried out on this basis.  However, it has recently come to our attention that while access to the M50 motorway in the sense which the layman might understand it is not envisaged, the light rail might in law be regarded as accessing the motorway in that it will cross the tops of the ramps to and from the motorway, as is regularly the case. The map accompanying the motorway declaration order shows most of the ramps to be included in the motorway.  This is not done to avoid access being sought to the motorway from the land adjoining the sliproads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the prohibitions of the Road Act, 1993, on direct access to motorways, it is considered prudent to amend the Act to facilitate the proposal.  The amendment gives the NRA authority to grant direct access to the motorway to CIE in respect of a light rail proposal under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996.  It is important to note that this power to grant direct access will rest with the NRA which has statutory responsibility for the provision of a safe and <Col N="1329" /> efficient network of national roads.  All aspects of the LRT design will be open for consideration as part of the statutory consent procedures under the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996.</P>

      <P>There have been many requests in this House to take all Stages of a Bill on a particular day.  Many Members felt we could take all Stages of this Bill but the Opposition was not in favour of doing that.  We were proved right because the Minister has moved an important amendment which removes a doubt that might have existed if this legislation had been passed in its original form.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the interchanges on the M50.  The Minister said it is feasible to have light rail transport on the roundabout by using traffic lights.  When we were designing new motorways, roundabouts and interchanges, traffic lights were the last thing we needed.  Unfortunately, however, they were installed at the Red Cow and Blanchardstown interchanges.  It is difficult to understand how it will be possible for light rail transport to use the Red Cow interchange without interfering with traffic.  One has only to go to the roundabout each morning and evening to see the traffic difficulties there.  I cannot understand how it is feasible to have light rail transport on the roundabout.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Joe Doyle about this particular roundabout.  The build-up of traffic on it is horrendous.  When the roundabout was built, it was not intended to put traffic lights on it.  Traffic lights were only installed as a corrective measure because the roundabout did not work.  While it works better with them, they are not a solution to the problem.  This underlines the need for better planning of our road infrastructure.  Our thinking is too short term.  We are looking for cheap solutions which are more expensive in the long run.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which I hope will lead to more forward planning.  We should ensure that when we build roads they will be there for 50, 60 or 80 years and that they will only have to be maintained not reconstructed.  I urge the Department to do that.</P>

      <P>I thank both Senators for their comments on this matter.  This amendment is designed to provide a legal basis for a particular situation, that is, the crossing at the top of the sliproads and onto the ramps at the Red Cow interchange.  This is an enabling provision.  The pros and cons of the design of the light rail system at the Red Cow interchange or any other location must be examined in detail at a public inquiry before the Minister for Public Enterprise can <Col N="1330" /> make a light rail order.  The National Roads Authority has overall responsibility for the motorway network and it must also give its consent to any such light rail line.  These procedures will ensure there is no negative impact on the capacity of the motorway network.</P>

      <P>This issue was raised on Second Stage in the other House by a Member of the Minister's party who felt there should be a six month period.  An amendment was tabled on Report Stage in the Dáil which sought to extend it to four months, but the Minister did not accept it.  Concern was expressed by a Member of the Minister's party and by Deputy Howlin that the period for the public to prepare a case for a judicial review should be extended.  I am trying to act as Solomon here today by asking for a three month period.  I know from planning procedures that it takes time for local groups to get all the required documentation together before they present their case.  In light of the views expressed in the other House, it is only reasonable that the Minister should extend the period at least by one month.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>On Second Stage, Senators welcomed the provisions being introduced to regulate a judicial review.  Section 5 aims at striking the right balance between, on the one hand, ensuring that legal proceedings challenging decisions on motorway schemes or roads related environmental impact statements can be brought to finality and, on the other hand, safeguarding the rights of the individual to challenge these decisions where he or she considers it necessary to do so.  The correct balance has been achieved in section 5 and the related part of section 4.  I remain of the view that two months is a reasonable and sufficient amount of time for lodging an application for leave to apply for a judicial review.  All sides of this House have expressed concern on a number of occasions at the length of time it now takes to bring major infrastructural projects to reality.  In this light, it would be inconsistent as well as unnecessary to amend the Bill as proposed.  I ask the Senator to reflect on this and to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's anxiety to restrict the time the public has to <Col N="1331" /> oppose the building of motorways and other such projects.  However, the Minister is achieving that in another way in this Bill because the High Court can make a decision about a judicial review.  It is only in exceptional circumstances that it could go to the Supreme Court.  The Minister is already limiting the public's right to oppose such projects.  That is important because the delay occurred once people went to the High Court and then appealed the decision to the Supreme Court. I know of a number of motorways and roadways which were held up under that procedure, including parts of the M50 which were held up for a long time, but that has been resolved in this Bill. I ask the Minister to allow the public more time to present its case because it may be its last opportunity to do so.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>Other codes, such as planning, waste management and light rail, have specific rules governing legal challenge to decisions made under the legislation.  The aim of these provisions is not to rule out legitimate legal challenges, but to ensure that such challenges are brought to finality within a reasonable timescale.</P>
      <P>These new provisions will not restrict the right to institute proceedings.  They are intended merely to ensure that any such proceedings can be brought to finality as quickly as possible, bearing in mind the importance of having final and conclusive decisions on major road development proposals within a reasonable timescale.  The new arrangements give a longer time &mdash; two months instead of the former three weeks &mdash; to mount a challenge to a motorway scheme and formally provide for challenges to decisions on the EISs where there was no such provision before.  Two months, as allowed for in other legislation, is adequate and I cannot agree, unfortunately, to accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is very short and primarily technical in nature.  Similar Bills have been necessary following each previous Treaty since our accession to the European communities in 1973.  The Bill gives effect in domestic law to those provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam which affect the EC Treaties and the European Court of Justice.  It is necessary to bring this Bill forward at this stage because these provisions must be made part of the domestic law of the State prior to the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>The Bill contains just two sections and amends the European Communities Act, 1972, as previously amended.  Section 1 is the principal operative part of the Bill.  It adds the relevant amending provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the list of Treaties and other instruments contained in the definition of the &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; in section 1(1) of the European Communities Act, 1972, as amended. These are Articles 1.13, Articles 2 to 12, and annexed Protocols.  For the convenience of readers of the Bill, in a table to the section, there is set out the complete list of the &ldquo;treaties governing the European Communities&rdquo; contained in section 1(1) of the 1972 Act, as amended, with the amendment now proposed in respect of the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
      <P>Section 2 contains normal provisions concerning the short title, collective citation, construction and commencement of an Act of the Oireachtas. That is a normal piece of wording required in the introduction to a piece of legislation of this nature.</P>
      <P>I now propose to outline briefly the contents of those Articles of the Amsterdam Treaty which will be given the force of law in the State by the Bill.  They fall into three broad categories: substantive amendments to the European Communities Treaties, simplification and renumbering of the Treaties and the role of the European Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Articles 2 to 4, together with annexed Protocols, represent the main body of the substantive amendments to the EC Treaties provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Articles 2 to 4 deal <Col N="1334" /> with amendments to the European Community Treaty, the European Coal and Steel Community Treaty and the Euratom Treaty respectively.  I do not propose to go through the provisions contained in the above articles in detail today as the Seanad has already debated the Treaty.  The contents of the Treaty were also examined and debated in the course of the referendum campaign in which the Government sought approval of the constitutional amendment which will permit the State to ratify.  However, as Senators will be aware, articles 2 to 4 include a very wide range of provisions which improve the capacity of the Union for action, including: closer co-operation among member states, non-discrimination, free movement of persons, employment, consumer protection, environmental protection, institutional reform and the right of access to Community documents.  Taken together they represent a modest but important contribution towards European integration and greater effectiveness and efficiency within the Union.  The changes also help the Union to prepare for enlargement and bring it closer to the citizen.</P>
    <P>Article 5 of the Amsterdam Treaty deals with certain changes made in relation to the election of representatives to the European Parliament.  In this context, and as additionally outlined in article 2, the new Treaty will impose an upper limit of 700 on the membership of the Parliament, which is now 626.  It will also strengthen the role of the Parliament through a considerable extension of what is known as the &ldquo;co-decision procedure&rdquo;. The co-decision procedure makes the Parliament in effect a co-legislator with the Council in the adoption of Community legislation.</P>
    <P>Articles 6 to 11 deal with the simplification of the Treaties establishing the European communities and certain related acts.  The simplification of the Treaties was necessary to prune them of long obsolete provisions relating to the setting up of the Communities, the establishement of the Common Market, etc.  The complicated numbering system in the EC Treaty and the EU Treaty has also been rationalised and simplified by article 12 of the Amsterdam Treaty.  The end result of this is that the Treaties on which the Union is based will be shorter and more readable when the Amsterdam Treaty comes into effect.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Amsterdam Treaty contains provisions on the European Court of Justice.  These are contained in article 1.13 which establishes the scope of application of the powers of the European Court of Justice.  The Court of Justice has always had jurisdiction under the First Pillar.  However, when the Second and Third Pillars were set up by the Maastricht Treaty the Court of Justice was not given jurisdiction over them, with one small exception for certain conventions concluded under the auspices of the Third Pillar.  However, under the Amsterdam Treaty, the Third Pillar has become more like the First Pillar and in particular the Court of Justice now has general jurisdiction over &ldquo;Police and Judicial co-operation in criminal matters&rdquo;.  This <Col N="1335" /> of course replaces the Justice and Home Affairs designation in the Maastricht Treaty.  Thus, because it is important that Ireland be in a position to comply with the judgments of the Court of Justice on Third Pillar matters in the same way as it complies with its judgments in the First Pillar, it is necessary to give the force of law in the State to article 1.13 of the Amsterdam Treaty.  I would like to assure Senators that this measure will ensure that police and judicial co-operation is carried out not only with increased efficiency but also with increased protection for human rights.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the European Communities Act do not include matters relating to the common foreign and security policy provisions of the Treaty as these provisions, which are essentially intergovernmental in nature, do not require to be made part of domestic law.  This was also the case with the Maastricht Treaty.  Subject to one exception in relation to the European Court of Justice, police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters are also not included in the amendments to the Act.  This is because police and judicial co-operation, or the Third Pillar as it is commonly known, is contained in Article 1 of the Treaty of Amsterdam but is dealt with outside of the framework of the EC Treaties.  Police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters under the Amsterdam Treaty will build on the co-operation which has already taken place under the Maastricht Treaty, but the role of the Commission, European Parliament and the Court of Justice have been strengthened.</P>
    <P>The changes provided for in the Amsterdam Treaty will increase both the effectiveness and the democratic nature of the Third Pillar.  As a result they will make the Third Pillar more like the First Pillar or European Communities. However, in keeping with its approach throughout the period since signature of the Treaty the Government has been careful to seek no more authority in this legislation than is strictly necessary for the purpose of giving effect in domestic law to the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Thus, no authority is sought to make statutory instruments for issues relating to the Third Pillar which may arise in the future.  These would be matters of sufficient weight as to merit primary legislation and, thus, full scrutiny by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It has not been necessary to make the main provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty relating to police and judicial co-operation part of the law of the State.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty deal with amendments to the common provisions of the Treaty on European Union and also matters of international treaty law in that Treaty and the Amsterdam Treaty.  Due to their nature these provisions do not need to be made part of domestic law.  In short, the terms of section 1 of the Bill have been carefully drafted to ensure that the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty which it is necessary to make part of our <Col N="1336" /> domestic law prior to ratification are made part of Irish law, but the Government has not sought to go any further than is necessary in order to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the amendment to the Constitution approved recently by the people provides that the options and discretions provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam would be exercised by the Government only with the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  These would include the provisions for closer co-operation among member states and free movement of persons within the EU to which I have already referred.  The Government has been keen to ensure that all significant steps to be taken by it under the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam will be subject to full parliamentary scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Following the endorsement on 22 May by the people of the necessary changes to the Constitution, the President signed the constitutional amendment Bill into law on 3 June, thus paving the way for Ireland to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam.  This will take place as soon as possible after the consideration and passing of this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas and the terms of the Treaty are approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>To date, two member states &mdash; Germany and Sweden &mdash; have ratified the Treaty.  Senators will be aware of the positive outcome of the referendum in Denmark; I understand that Denmark intends to deposit the instrument of ratification of the Treaty in Rome tomorrow.  A further five member states are expected to ratify before the end of July.  I understand that Portugal may hold a consultative referendum on developments in the EU later in the year, which will probably not be specific to the Treaty of Amsterdam.  The target date for completion of national ratification procedures remains 1 January 1999, although the possibility of some slippage cannot be excluded.</P>
    <P>In accepting the proposed amendments to the Constitution required to ratify the Treaty of Amsterdam the Irish electorate, for the third time since accession, showed its continued support for keeping Ireland at the forefront of European integration.  Some have claimed that the Treaty was a difficult document to understand and left many voters confused or doubtful about its significance, resulting in a lower level of support than on previous occasions.  I would acknowledge frankly that the Treaty lacked a central issue which could engage popular attention.  The Treaty of Amsterdam is an amending Treaty, not a stand-alone text, and read in isolation it is without question a difficult document to comprehend.</P>
    <P>However, I do not accept there exists or that the outcome of the referendum implies any diminution of support among Irish electors for our membership of and full participation in the European Union.  There is not a facet of Irish society which has not been affected in some way by our membership of this unique project of pooling sovereignty and the results have been overwhelmingly positive for our people.  The majority of the <Col N="1337" /> people remain convinced, with good reason, that European integration is the way forward and Eurobarometer polling bears this out.</P>
    <P>Given its complexity, the Government decided to publish a White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam and set about producing a document which would be comprehensive but also accessible to non-experts.  It is not just the Government which believes that this aim was achieved.  Many commentators at home and abroad have complimented the White Paper for its lucidity and thorough treatment of the issues.  The Government also established a Referendum Commission.  Its role was to prepare and disseminate information on the Treaty and to promote public debate. Research carried out by the commission bears out my belief that the information campaign organised by the commission was successful in raising awareness of the Treaty.  The Taoiseach has stated that the Government will review in due course the manner in which information is provided for referenda.  This issue is also being examined by the all-party committee on the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is the task of all Members of the Oireachtas who support our membership of the EU, the efforts of member states to achieve further integration and who want to see Ireland continue at the forefront of these developments to examine seriously how we can bring Europe closer to the citizen.  The EU is there for its citizens and it serves no higher purpose.  The Government will continue to play its part but the subject is too large to be left to Government alone.  All political parties, the media and the social partners have a responsibility to ensure that European issues are aired not only prior to constitutional referenda.</P>
    <P>In accepting the Treaty of Amsterdam on 22 May by a substantial majority, the Irish people did a service to the further integration of Europe and to Ireland's place in Europe.  No one in this House or in Dáil Éireann should, however, be under the illusion that support for the European project can be taken for granted.  Information on the issues is one matter and the Government will examine this in due course, but political engagement and relevance is quite another.  We cannot assume that because of our spectacularly good performance within the Single Market, EU affairs somehow do not need political impulse within our own society.  European issues are as diverse as any other field of international relations and real debate, based upon real prospects and options, is the oxygen which an informed public opinion requires.  For these reasons, I look forward to the continued vigorous interest of Members of this House in developments in Europe.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill designed to amend legislation on EU Treaties. The Minister concluded by referring to the possibility of diminished support for membership of the EU.  It is easy to make such a statement but we should not close our eyes to the voting patterns <Col N="1338" /> that have emerged in the referenda held since 1972.  The numbers turning out to support European Treaties continue to decline.  On the day of the Amsterdam Treaty referendum the British-Irish Agreement was also voted on and it was extraordinary that only 56 per cent of those entitled to vote felt strongly enough to do so.  Had the other referendum not been held on the same day one wonders how many would have turned out to vote for the Amsterdam Treaty.  Of the 56 per cent of voters who turned out, slightly over 60 per cent voted in favour of the Treaty.  In other words, about 33 per cent of those entitled to vote were convinced that it was worth voting in favour of the Treaty.  We must address that issue.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty did not have a central issue or focus.  It lacked substance compared to the Single European Act or the Maastricht Treaty.  It has more of an aspirational policy focus than anything else and many of the issues to which it aspires are pursued as national policy by most of the member states.  The Treaty was a means of putting together our combined aspirations to remove discrimination, to provide for the free movement of persons, to exchange views on health research and to try to reduce unemployment numbers.  These are all aspirations that each Government would be doing anyway.  The Amsterdam Treaty did not catch the Irish public's imagination, and we must be aware of that as more referenda on the EU will be held in the future.  We must not acquiesce and think those will be passed, because the graph shows a definite decline.  We cannot be casual.</P>
      <P>I am not saying there was no campaign, because there was one, but the media did not give the Amsterdam Treaty the same coverage it has given to other issues.  Coverage of the Treaty was sparse for the preceding months until the last week, when there was a flurry of activity, and those trying to promote the Treaty found it difficult to get coverage for it.</P>
      <P>The electorate does not like to be taken for granted, and there is a feeling that Europe has too much control.  This concerns more people now than it would have in 1972, when there was great debate on Irish sovereignty.  Despite that debate, people voted in throngs for entry to the EEC.  People now feel that Ireland is regarded as a small member state in the northwest of Europe that is only part of the paraphernalia of the EU. The vote in this referendum was an indication to the powers in central Europe that the Irish electorate is not to be taken for granted.  The cynicism in the public's perception of Europe may also be attributed to the fact that Ireland is so financially buoyant.  People may have forgotten the time when we needed the support system and financial assistance of the EEC and may now feel that we no longer require that assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The serious questions about our Objective One status are related to this.  The success of the Celtic tiger means there is a real danger that we are to be relegated to Objective Two status, which is not good for half of the country.  In the past, EU <Col N="1339" /> Commissioners were brought through the most disadvantaged areas of the west from Cork to Donegal.  As a result of those visits Ireland was classified as extremely disadvantaged and received wonderful support through Structural and Cohesion Funds that were well used in the country.</P>
    <P>However, the western half of the country is still seriously disadvantaged.  One need only check the figures on income and development to find that the western counties are nowhere near the qualification criteria for Objective One status.  Past moneys were brought in on the back of the western disadvantaged areas, but the bulk of that money was not spent in those areas.  It was spent in areas that were relatively economically buoyant. If western politicians are seen as being ultra careful on Objective One status, it is because they feel they were cheated the first time on the use of funding and that the situation in the west was used to the advantage of more prosperous areas.</P>
    <P>This is a serious issue that the Government will have to deal with at European level.  The Commissioner feels it is merely a case of making a case to secure additional moneys, but that it is not true.  A case will have to be made for areas of severe disadvantage which need the money. Those areas are as bad as any retaining Objective One status, and I hope the Commissioner can be convinced of that by the Government.  There will also have to be serious control and monitoring of where that funding is spent, because the west has been used in the past and did not benefit.  It will be difficult; the Commission must deal with areas of disadvantage all over Europe and, given the strength of our economy, an observer might think it unreal that a country so buoyant would appeal for Objective One status.  The Minister should bring the Commissioner to the most disadvantaged areas in the country to see that this is a real issue.</P>
    <P>This is a technical Bill.  It simplifies previous Acts, protocols and treaties that have been incorporated into our legislation, which is welcome.  As the Minister said, the Amsterdam Treaty is an integral part of all the previous measures.  It does not make a special impact on its own.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains provisions regarding police and judicial co-operation, which has been going on since the Maastricht Treaty.  There has been great co-operation between the Garda and police forces across Europe in combating drugs and other serious crime.  I am delighted that this has been legislated for in the Bill and hope that that co-operation goes from strength to strength.  It is important that the Second and Third pillars are put on a par with the First Pillar in relation to judicial and police co-operation, and this provision is progressive and welcome.  However, as the Minister said, it is not unlimited.  We would like to keep some control within our State, and there is good balance on this issue.</P>
    <P>It is commendable that this Bill gives more power to the European Parliament because that <Col N="1340" /> body's members are directly elected by the citizens of each member State.  The Parliament has more powers as a result of the Amsterdam Treaty, which I welcome.  I am sure that issues regarding the other institutions such as the Commission will arise again during the enlargement debate.  When that debate begins the right of every State to a Commissioner will be questioned.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we fight hard for that. The fact that we are a small state should not diminish our right to proper representation in all European institutions such as the Parliament, the Commission or the Council of Europe.  It is very wrong to set the size of a state as a criterion for representation. I hope that issue will be put on the backboiler and will not have a negative effect on Ireland.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that all these issues are incorporated in this Treaty.  I am particularly pleased the Minister has seen fit to introduce this Bill in the Seanad, thus making the Seanad more relevant to the legislative process.  However, as far as Irish citizens' views on the future of Europe are concerned, I do not think we politicians should acquiesce to Irish voters being taken for granted.  It will be a challenge for us in the future to obtain a positive vote in referenda, particularly on the issue of a common defence and security policy.  We must be prepared to run a good campaign to ensure a satisfactory outcome to such a referendum.  The result of the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty is a warning to us for the future.</P>

      <P>As the Minister and other speakers said, this is a short Bill and we need not spend much time on it.  We have already debated the Amsterdam Treaty.  Last month the Irish people voted in favour of that Treaty and this Bill is a straightforward but essential piece of legislation to formalise its ratification in line with our domestic law.</P>
      <P>Ireland is one of only three EU states which put the Treaty before its people by way of ratification. It is very important to remember that. One of the three states is a monarchy and the other two are republics.  The fact we put the Treaty before our people shows our commitment to openness and frankness about the European Treaties which does not always exist in other states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill amends the original European Communities Act, 1972, which brought us into the EEC.  This is the fourth time the people have amended that Act, and each time the benefits for Ireland have increased.  By amending the European Communities Act and ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty the people have voted for peace, security and prosperity founded on the principles of democracy and human rights, not only within the European Union but also in the wider world. By ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty we will have underpinned and secured a continuation of the huge economic benefits we have enjoyed over our <Col N="1341" /> 25 years of EU membership.  We will allow for a measured and carefully balanced response to the real challenges facing the Union by enabling it to address more effectively the direct concerns of its citizens and will equip it to function more effectively.</P>
    <P>The Treaty is complex and not easy to read. However, it deals with down to earth questions about jobs, freedom, security, a clean environment and accountability to the voter.  Beneath the complexity are immeasurable benefits for the Irish people.  This Bill is simply a mechanism to bring the Treaty into effect.  About a dozen Acts and Treaties are amended by this Treaty, including the Treaty of Rome, EURATOM, treaties for the accession of new member states, provisions of the Single European Act, protocols and so on.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn highlighted the fact that many people do not understand what is happening in Europe.  It is incumbent on us as legislators and on the Government to make clear to the people what exactly is involved, to show them we are on a path towards a greater European Union and to remind ourselves why the European Communities were founded in the first place.  Those of us old enough to remember the last war know the Communities were founded in essence to keep Europe peaceful and prosperous. We can argue about all the rubbish that was talked about at the time of ratifying the Treaty, such as the possibility of us being sucked into a European army.  I commend the Minister on his anti nuclear initiative, which shows what a small state and an intelligent Minister can start.  I hope that initiative spreads.</P>
    <P>The Irish Business Bureau produces a magazine called the <i>European Monthly Newsletter.</i>  It did a survey in which 70 per cent of respondents admitted they knew nothing about the Amsterdam Treaty.  One of the reasons for this is the language used in the Treaty, with words such as &ldquo;subsidiarity&rdquo;, &ldquo;peripherality&rdquo;, &ldquo;articles&rdquo; and &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;.  How many people know what a pillar is, other than something which supports a house? We need to explain these matters and the best place to start is with children like those in Visitors' Gallery at the moment.  I hope Senator O'Toole will see to it that all children are educated about the provisions of the European Union and what it holds for their futures.  I know that, as a far seeing man, he will do that.</P>

      <P>It is 12 years.  The Minister frankly acknowledged the Treaty lacked a central issue. It is very hard to have a central issue in a Treaty which amends so many other Treaties and provisions, which is why education on these matters is so important.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Education and Science should get together to see how people could be educated on these matters.  I am not interested in pushing a message but in making people understand for what they are voting.</P>
      <P>As a confirmed European of many years, I believe we can bring people along with us if we let them see the benefits of the European ideal. If it is taken to its logical conclusion, we have a large conglomeration of countries which maintain their own national identities but which act together on crime and drugs and have more time for citizen's rights and social inclusion.  The European Union brought about the Social Chapter, for which Commissioner Flynn fought so hard, and the Irish proposals on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>This is technical Bill and its passage through the House should not be delayed by long speeches on matters which have been spoken about many times before.  It should be passed because we have done the ground work on it. However, legislators have an obligation to bring the message to the people that we are trying to promote a union of peoples where war will not exist, where people will be economically better off and will have more constitutional rights, where there will be less discrimination and where everyone will profit and benefit.  We should not begin educating people to understand this a number of weeks before the referendum on the next Treaty; we should start doing so now.  There should be an ongoing process of education so that, when a new Treaty to modify the effects of the Amsterdam Treaty is introduced, people will understand on what it is they are being asked to vote.</P>
      <P>Some of those who voted no to the Amsterdam Treaty did not do so because they oppose the European ideal but because they were told a number of untruths about what might happen if the process of integration continues.  These people did not listen carefully to the arguments regarding what might happen if we do not continue down that road.  I encourage Senators to allow the Bill to pass as quickly as possible so that we might proceed with other business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers, I congratulate the Minister on his extraordinary initiative in <Col N="1343" /> respect of reducing nuclear weapons during the past week.  It is great that a nation such as Ireland could take such an initiative.  I will return to that point later when I comment on common European policies in respect of defence, etc.  We must have a clear understanding of what we can and cannot do in these areas.</P>
      <P>It would be wrong if I did not refer to the UK challenge to certain European expenditure, which is very germane to the points made by Senator Lydon in respect of Irish cultural values.  One of the casualties of the UK's challenge to the expenditure of money at certain levels by the European Union has been support for the Irish language as a minority language.  I hope this funding will be restored because this is one of the areas where we have come to depend on European support. As Commissioner Flynn stated earlier, this development will be bad for Europe because the type of spending the EU has been able to provide for certain projects in various member states represents the human side of its initiatives.  Will the Minister give careful consideration to this matter?</P>
      <P>I must reiterate the point about Irish cultural values.  In the early 1970s when we discussed joining the then EEC, those who opposed our accession stated that Ireland would be suffocated, suppressed, lost, swallowed up and drowned in the European macro-culture.  However, the reverse has happened.  Irish culture is stronger now than ever and our music, language and personalities have come to affect Europe.  In my opinion, Irish culture and tradition have been strengthened during the 25 years since we joined the EU.  In furtherance of the point made by Senator Lydon, it must be remembered that when we discuss the impact of Europe on Ireland we are discussing not only the big issues, such as agriculture, but the also the small issues.  Ireland is firmly a part of the European Union and we are influencing its policies.</P>
      <P>That leads me to ponder the great conundrum of how to deal with common defence and social policies?  On the day I entered this House in April 1987 the first item discussed was the Single European Act and I recall speaking at length on sovereignty, neutrality and many other issues.  As was the case then, I remain unsure about how Ireland can take its proper place in trying to influence the international community to move towards a peaceful, improved and non-nuclear environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is strange that the Minister will be applauded for his efforts to bring everyone into line against nuclear testing.  He will be asked to make similar efforts in Europe, particularly in respect of France.  I heard him speaking on the 1 o'clock news on radio earlier in the week and I smiled because the Minister has two chances of bringing the French into line in respect of nuclear issues. Nonetheless, he will try to do so.  We must remember that we could have more influence on France under a common European policy dealing with nuclear arms, disarmament or testing <Col N="1344" /> because it would have only a single vote among a collective of 12, 14 or 20 nations.  By using such a policy we would have greater influence on its activities in the South Pacific than we would if we remained outside that tight circle.</P>
    <P>In the past number of years Irish people have taken a strong, anti-European attitude in terms of seeming to stand idly by when problems occurred in places such as Rwanda, Bosnia and, more recently, Kosovo.  What should we do in these instances?  I do not pretend to have the answer.  I have written to the Minister about Kosovo on six occasions in the past three years and he has provided extraordinarily explicit and lengthy explanations of the action he has taken in respect of the situation there.  I must emphasise that this correspondence took place a long period before Kosovo made headlines on the 9 o'clock news following representations I received from teaching colleagues in Albanian speaking areas around Kosovo, who asked me to bring problems there to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I still am unsure what should be done about this situation.</P>
    <P>I have always supported Irish neutrality. However, I have never been able to define neutrality. Sweden, Switzerland and Austria have been offered as examples of neutral countries. Whatever about Austria, Switzerland has become rich by laundering the money of every discredited organisation and regime throughout history and it is hardly an example of what a neutral country is meant to be.  Neutrality was never intended to be an &ldquo;I'm all right Jack&rdquo; philosophy.  That is proven by the fact that the people most likely to man the barricades in defence of this country's neutrality are cut from the same cloth as those who were first to travel to fight in the Spanish Civil War.  I have often asked those people if that was the right thing to do.  What action should a neutral nation take?</P>
    <P>I have asked colleagues on the left of Irish politics what they would have done if they were in Government in the 1930s when the Spanish Civil War began.  I also inquired if they would have sent support or sold our neutrality for that country. Now that Ireland is a member of the European Union we must ask if Europe is entitled to defend itself.  If it is, how will we go about doing so?  What role will Ireland play in defending Europe?  That is a difficult matter to discuss.</P>
    <P>Sweden puts itself forward as a neutral nation. However, that country's idea of neutrality is to sell arms to both sides in any conflict.  That is hardly what is meant by neutrality; neither is trying to return the money gained from such sales in other ways.</P>
    <P>In recent years I have come to the conclusion that were we to be part of an individual qualified majority voting system on European foreign policy, our Government could do more to represent the views of the people of Ireland in terms of what they expect of Europe in dealing with crises in places such as Rwanda, Bosnia or Kosovo. Many people will disagree with me &mdash; I do not <Col N="1345" /> blame them for doing so &mdash; but my entire being is opposed to the conclusion with which I am faced. However, a discussion should take place on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that Articles 2 to 4 of the Amsterdam Treaty include a very wide range of provisions which improve the capacity of the European Union for action, including the area of non-discrimination.  During this morning's debate on the Employment Equality Bill, in which I have a particular interest, I referred to the Amsterdam Treaty.  Will the Minister engage in a consideration of that Bill in as much as it deals with education, particularly at primary level, and the operation of schools?  The Bill, which has been passed by both Houses and has been dispatched to the President for signing, is in conflict with the spirit if not the letter of the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
    <P>The way teachers can be discriminated against on the basis of so-called ethos was never envisaged under the Treaty of Amsterdam.  Will the Department look at this?  I wish to obtain a legal opinion from the Minister on this issue.  Is the Employment Equality Bill, 1997, in conflict with the Treaty of Amsterdam, for which the people voted last month, particularly in areas of anti-discrimination, areas where it demands diversity and where it refers to parity of esteem for culture and beliefs?  I want this examined because some of us are committed to testing that legislation in whichever courts we have to in Europe, especially if it is necessary to defend teachers whom we believe it has discriminated against.  I hope it will never be necessary, but I suspect it will.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his work in the areas I mentioned but I wish to refer to the criticisms that have been levelled at the Government and his Department on the extraordinary no vote in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum.  The most effective vote in a democracy is a 51 to 49 per cent vote and I say that as leader of a teaching union.  I would be devastated if I ever did a deal with Government which was then put to the membership and accepted by 95 per cent because my negotiating hand would be very much weakened the next time I would sit around the table and I would be inclined to get less from Government.</P>
    <P>I think the same in terms of the Minister's negotiating hand in Europe.  The result of the vote was about right.  I take a different view to my Independent colleagues on this.  I differ very much with the Supreme Court on the McKenna judgment for the simple reason that it in some way perverted democracy.  Democracy means people electing a Government to lead them, the Government defines its policy thereby reflecting the people's wishes and if that means putting forward a change to the Constitution, the Government is entitled to push that hard as its point of view.  That is my view, but the democratically constituted Supreme Court took a different view and we need to look at our approach to these issues. The media has become so powerful that if one agrees to give equal time on an issue, one is effectively <Col N="1346" /> hitting people with two sides of the argument whereas that may be not representative of the views of the people or the leaders they elected to enunciate their views.</P>
    <P>That needs to be looked at but not by people whinging there should not have been a no vote of that size.  There is nothing wrong with a strong no vote.  This country has a long history of challenge, questioning and not being passive.  If Ireland is to be successful in Europe we do not want passive people but people who will question, challenge, push, probe and lead.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon raised the question of education. I was delighted it was included in the Maastricht Treaty, which was the first amendment to the original Article in the Treaty of Rome.  It moved from training only to include education and also allowed education &ldquo;to support and supplement&rdquo;.  Each member of European Union could still rightly determine its education policy, but the EU could also support and supplement that in certain ways, such as through European languages.</P>
    <P>That process began in primary schools this month.  A large number of schools have opted to participate in a pilot programme on the introduction of modern European languages.  That is important and we will see the value of such initiatives in a wider context.  It was good that upon the introduction of European languages in primary schools people were not saying our culture would be threatened.  They no longer feel that as they have developed confidence, a new sense of being European and do not feel any less Irish.  That is good because it would be hypocritical of us who said for many years that it was possible to be Irish and British.  We now know it is possible to be Irish and European without any diminution or reduction in our cultural values.</P>
    <P>Europe contains a broad spectrum of people. We recently looked at the question of immigration and refugees.  We need to hear more Ministers speaking out and putting that issue in context because newspaper headlines which refer to tides and floods of immigrants do not reflect reality.  The 4,000 or 5,000 people seeking asylum here is approximately one-tenth of the number of Irish people who lived illegally in north America ten years ago or one-sixth or one-seventh of the number of people exported to England annually up until seven or eight years ago.  The people should be allowed to give vent to their natural sense of welcome.  By understanding different cultures and people, they will be more open to and accepting of them and recognise they will add to our culture.  I wish the Bill well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his recent initiative on nuclear power.  While parts of the world indulged in lunatic actions with nuclear devices, his was the one sane voice.  Senator O'Toole pointed out the difficulties he faces with one of the largest nations in Europe a committed nuclear power, with over <Col N="1347" /> 70 per cent of its electricity alone generated by nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>I welcome the positive vote on the Amsterdam Treaty by the people on 22 May.  Over 61.8 of us voted in favour of the referendum.  While I canvassed for the yes vote for the Amsterdam Treaty and peace in Northern Ireland, I found there was no problem with the peace vote, as it subsequently turned out, but people had a problem with the Amsterdam Treaty.  Perhaps, as the Minster said, the opaqueness of its language and the lack of accord with the Treaty meant people could not concentrate their minds and that was probably one of its greatest defects.  Also, those of us in favour of Europe and who wish to see European integration proceed know of the great benefits involved.  Our membership of Europe has given younger generations a new sense of security, well being and self-confidence.  In the late 1950s and early 1960s Irish self-confidence was at its lowest, but now a total reversal has taken place in younger people's attitudes.</P>
      <P>I do not fault the McKenna judgment.  Ideas should be tested openly and in a democracy it is only right and proper that they should be debated before the people, but those of us in favour of the Amsterdam Treaty allowed the argument to go by default.  We were too focused on the yes vote for peace in Northern Ireland and took our eye off the other ball that was in play.  Some outrageous remarks, insinuations and allegations were made about the effects of this Treaty.  I was amazed by the attack on Europol which was designed to increase co-operation between police forces with a wave of international crime hitting Europe.  Criminals are not interested in the niceties of European co-operation.  They would prefer if co-operation between police forces within Europe and worldwide broke down as it would give them a freer field to play on.  There were no coherent or studied replies to these allegations. However, the people made their judgment.  Some 38 per cent voted no while 61.8 per cent voted yes.  Upon that basis we can build and develop Europe.</P>
      <P>The Amsterdam Treaty is a European initiative which addresses the issues of concern to the people of Ireland in a positive, structured and coherent manner.  I am pleased it was supported by a healthy majority in the recent referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill.  There was extensive debate in this House on the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty prior to the referendum. I keep up to date with European affairs, am familiar with developments in Europe and am interested in and supportive of further co-operation and enlargement.  Given the public has judged the Treaty suitable for ratification, why does the Bill only incorporate parts of it into Irish law?  I am sure there is a good reason for this. The Minister addressed these matters to some degree in his speech.  However if, having explained why further co-operation is necessary <Col N="1348" /> and outlined the advantages of further involvement and the deepening of relationships in the EU, we seek and obtain the support of the public for a Treaty to that effect but only incorporate part of it into Irish law, what happens to the other aspects?  These are legitimate questions for members of the public to raise and may explain why many decided to vote no in the recent referendum.</P>
      <P>While the concept, aspirations and objectives of European co-operation and union are easily explained, the law relating to them appears to become ever more complex.  Surely the provisions in the Treaties and agreements outlined in the table in the Bill are a case for consolidation legislation? While I commend the Minister's initiative regarding nuclear issues, I ask him to urge his colleagues to consider such legislation.</P>
      <P>Opponents of the Amsterdam Treaty argued that a yes vote would sanction related measures and provisions.  There was an aspiration at the start of the Intergovernmental Conference to bring together various legal agreements.  It is not an easy job; we have difficulty doing it in our jurisdiction for complicated areas, such as tax and social welfare law, but it has been done.  One of the best ways in which Governments of the member states can seriously address those who are well disposed to European issues but are concerned about the omission or inclusion of aspects they are not told of is to consolidate legislative provisions and such like.  For example, what will happen those aspects of the Amsterdam Treaty which are not provided for in this Bill?</P>
      <P>The 38 per cent no vote in the recent referendum was not the disaster some suggest.  The majorities in previous referenda may have been too large, perhaps because issues were simplified. People realised the Amsterdam Treaty incorporated a range of different issues.  The Maastricht Treaty referendum centred on whether we would get £8 billion by way of EU funding, which did not do justice to the Treaty.  The fact that people considered the Amsterdam Treaty and that a proportion of them decided to vote no is a healthy development.  It puts a greater onus on those of us who support the yes side to make our views known without the carrot of further European money being put before the people, which does a disservice to them and to the ideals of the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Talking to people who voted no I found mixed motivations.  Some said because there were two referenda on the one day they focused on the referendum on the Belfast Agreement.  Perhaps there is a lesson in this when we decide on how questions should be put to the people in the future.  Some people read the Treaty and decided they did not like aspects of it.  That is a healthy development.  Despite the best efforts of the Referendum Commission many said they did not understand the proposals.  The commission should not be blamed for that.  It did a very good job in the short time available and under the constraints of having to provide information on the two referenda.  I know the Government is considering <Col N="1349" /> changing the way information is disseminated. However, we should not move lightly away from the commission.  It conducted research on the effectiveness of its work from which it can learn, as can we as legislators.  Perhaps the members of the public should be encouraged to seek further information to better inform themselves.</P>
    <P>Some voted no on the basis that we will have to contribute to the EU.  Given that we have benefited so much from membership, not only financially but also legally, we are the last country to make such an argument.  Our membership has contributed to developments in labour law, women's rights and many other aspects of our legislation.  We justifiably pride ourselves, perhaps to an inordinate degree, on our contributions, financially and otherwise, to the Third World.  If countries in central and eastern Europe seek to join the Union from which we have benefited so much, we should welcome them with open arms.  If the same argument had been used against us by the six member states in 1972 how much poorer would this country be?</P>
    <P>There is one area which these Houses could look at to improve the links between the people of this country, the decision making processes in this State and those of the EU.  Too often Brussels is blamed for everything.  Our Ministers attend meetings of the Council of Ministers and our MEPs attend the European Parliament.  The MEPs are allowed attend meetings of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs but the times of the meetings do not suit them.  The sessions are usually mutually exclusive.  We should find a better way which would allow MEPs to report to Members of the Houses on their activities and the job they are doing for Ireland in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on European Affairs should consider the more effective scrutinisation of the actions and decisions of our Ministers on the Council.  Sweden considered this matter carefully before deciding on the measures that would be put in place prior to its accession to monitor Ministers.  It did not follow the Danish model under which a Minister is required to have almost a negotiating mandate prior to attending meetings of the Council and then must make contact from Brussels to ask if the European Affairs Committee will allow him or her to go further. I do not agree with that extreme.  However, the Swedish model should be examined.</P>
    <P>I urge Senators who are members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs to consider how the committee could scrutinise, liaise and report on the plans, ambitions, projections, performances and decisions of the Council of Ministers more effectively.  This would be a better measure than many other proposals to assist the people in understanding how our Ministers participate and involve themselves so effectively in the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the quality of the contributions which have been most helpful.  Some of the interventions <Col N="1350" /> were extremely well thought out and I thank Senators for their points of view which enhance the ongoing debate on the European experience.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn complained that only 56 per cent of the electorate voted.  However, that is a matter for the electorate and it would be wrong of me to criticise that outcome.  It was disappointing because the two issues were most important.  As Senator Fitzpatrick said, perhaps we took our focus off the Amsterdam Treaty referendum as a result of our efforts to ensure a large vote in favour of the peace process.  The latter probably was achieved at the expense of the former.  The campaigns on both referenda were good but those of us who canvassed in our constituencies and elsewhere found that the reaction to the Amsterdam Treaty referendum was one of puzzlement while there was a historically warm welcome for the peace process.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that politicians on all sides, with the exception of the Green Party, supported the Amsterdam Treaty.  Perhaps this says something about the party political process and involvement, but I am not a critic of Dáil Éireann or politicians.  I strongly support the political process and people who give their lives to politics through membership of the Seanad and local councils.  They are good and genuine people and I applaud them for their involvement in the political process and their contribution to democracy.</P>
      <P>I am not negative towards Oireachtas Éireann or politicians of all parties who have made enormous sacrifices to reach this point.  Those of us who have been in the political mainstream for over 30 years have experienced the ups and downs of the lives of many politicians, some of whom bit the dust in the most terrible circumstances. I pay tribute to the political process and those who involve themselves in it.</P>
      <P>The points made by Senator Taylor-Quinn were of a high quality.  She and others said in relation to the comprehension of the Amsterdam</P>
      <P>Treaty that it was difficult to get across the message. The Treaty did not contain a central idea.  It was a measure designed to amend and improve structures; it was less than an emotional experience. However, I reject the criticism about the lack of involvement in the debate on the Amsterdam Treaty by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>One of the star productions of the debate was the White Paper on the Treaty of Amsterdam and the accompanying précis.  Even the people who said no expressed strong support for the White Paper produced by the Department of Foreign Affairs in terms of its comprehensiveness and simplicity of language.  Politicians on both sides praised the paper and I accepted that praise on behalf of the officials who produced it.  They deserved it because they went to much trouble to produce the paper and also because of their involvement in the Treaty of Amsterdam process.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn about being on guard against the remoteness of Brussels.  This is an important point.  People are becoming fed up with the lack of linkage between Ireland and Brussels and politicians have a duty to ensure that the issue of subsidiarity is given a proper focus and the intended meaning.</P>
      <P>Regarding the 38 per cent of the electorate which voted against the Treaty, in a democracy these people should not be patronised by suggesting that they did not understand what they were doing.  Many people may not have been happy with the Common Foreign and Security Policy or the information they received.  As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, they may have been concerned about the apparent remoteness of Brussels and the suggestion that Europe was too much in control of our affairs.  However, the European experience is one of shared sovereignty.  This has been happening since 1973 and it appears the people have accepted it as a reality.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn also raised the issue of Objective One status and the suggestion that Ireland may be relegated to Objective Two status. I assure the Senator that I have been extremely vigilant about Agenda 2000, the transitional arrangements required in the context of the Structural and Cohesion Funds and, in conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, the CAP.</P>
      <P>As the Senator said, the Celtic tiger gives a veneer of economic strength but behind it are certain weaknesses, one of which, as she pointed out, is our lack of infrastructural development.  The country is almost in gridlock because what purport to be highways between cities are actually country roads.  The Celtic tiger also hides the marginalised in our society.  Large tranches of people are excluded from the current economic benefits and we must be vigilant on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of enlargement and reform of the institutions we are fighting to retain Commissioners for small countries.  As far as we are concerned, it is a given that Ireland will retain its Commissioner in exchange for weighted voting under which larger countries will have a greater say.  I give an undertaking on behalf of the Government and myself that we will not lose our Commissioner but will retain the post in the context of enlargement, which will progress in 2003 <Col N="1352" /> or 2004.  I am grateful to Senator Taylor-Quinn for her intervention.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon said the Treaty is a complex document and there is no question about that.  He mentioned the good provisions in the Treaty, those concerning jobs, freedom, security and the environment which might be described as bringing it closer to the citizen.  He said a recent survey had shown that 70 per cent of people did not understand the complexity of the Treaty, and that is a fair point.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator O'Toole and others for their congratulations for my initiative on nuclear nonproliferation. It is an important move for this country and was begun well in advance of the explosions by Pakistan and India.  It will be our function, with the support of the other countries in the initiative, to ensure this declaration becomes a resolution, if not at the UN General Assembly in September then at the following one. This initiative was begun by a former Minister for External Affairs, the late Frank Aiken, and it is a question of making it relevant to the next millennium.</P>
    <P>The Senator also mentioned the UK challenge to EU spending and asked for support for Irish as a minority language.  I am an Irish speaker and although I may not be as fluent as I should be I make an effort.  I do interviews on Raidió na Gaeltachta and Teilifís na Gaeilge as a way of supporting the language and will continue to do so even if I do not distinguish myself on those excellent media.  I will also support Irish as a minority language in the European context.  It was people like myself during the peace process who gave the Irish language a new relevance in Northern Ireland, as can be seen in the British-Irish Agreement of 10 April.  I assure the Senator that Irish is in safe hands as far as this Government and myself are concerned.  I pay tribute to Teilifís na Gaeilge; it came in for a lot of criticism at its inception but it is a greatly improved service in terms of news and sport.  It does a singular service for the Irish language.  It has come on terrifically and I wish it well.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that there is great emphasis on money in the EU &mdash; we used to call it the European Economic Community &mdash; and probably not enough on the cultural aspects of membership.  The EU is not only concerned with economics, it has opened a huge vista in the last 25 years.  Our young people can move around EU countries with great confidence and come back to us to use their experience to our advantage.  This is a singularly important value of EU membership.</P>
    <P>I assure the Senator that I have intervened on a number of occasions about the obscenity in Kosovo.  There has been universal condemnation of President Milosevic.  I reject Senator O'Toole's criticism of Sweden &mdash; it has an arms industry but nevertheless it has been helpful to this country in our efforts to take an initiative on nuclear nonproliferation. Perhaps we can become involved in peace-keeping in Rwanda, Bosnia and other <Col N="1353" /> areas and our record in that context has been heroic and historic.  Speaking as a former Minister for Defence, the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána have made a huge contribution.  On the legislation before us, we have subscribed to the Petersberg tasks and have no problems with them.</P>
    <P>The Senator wanted a legal opinion on whether the Employment Equality Bill was in conflict with the Amsterdam Treaty.  I have studied both and do not think there is a conflict but I will let the Deputy have the opinion he has requested to ensure that my view is the correct one.  I do not want it to be said that I misled the House.  He quite properly said that Irish people have developed a new confidence since we joined the EEC, as it was then.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Fitzpatrick for his remarks about my involvement with the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.  He mentioned the difficulties with understanding the Amsterdam Treaty, that is a given.  We did our best and I think it was good enough.  A successful result of 68 per cent compared to 32 per cent was an achievement which should not be underrated or criticised. When one looks at the Danish experience of European referenda, our experience has been a spectacular success.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher queried the contributions and the fact that we may lose our Objective One status.  I will appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs on Tuesday to give a complete account of the Department of Foreign Affairs following the Votes on the departmental subheads. That is an annual account and any issue which occurs to the members of that committee can be raised with the Minister of State or myself.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contribution to today's debate.  I apologise if I have not fully answered all their queries but I will deal with them on Committee and subsequent Stages.  In my opening statement I referred to the need for all of us to focus on European matters, and not just at times of constitutional change; for example, as EMU approaches we can expect to see an increased examination of the consequences of this enormously significant economic project.</P>
    <P>There is also a need to expand our awareness of other issues before the European Union, as Senator O'Toole said.  As Agenda 2000 is developed we will need a third debate on our developmental priorities in the next decade.  As enlargement of the Union draws closer we will need to examine its implications, not just in economic terms but also in light of the effectiveness of the Union's institutions and the stability and security of Europe as a whole.</P>
    <P>Ireland's interests are not achievable without regard to those of her existing and potential partners in the European project.  The future direction of Europe is as significant as the hugely impressive economic balances with which the voter is already familiar.  It is the task of those engaged in the formation of public opinion to <Col N="1354" /> promote debate on these issues and their impact on Irish economic interests.</P>

      <P>This Bill implements the Government's commitment, as indicated by the Taoiseach in the Dáil on 3 June, to introduce as a matter of urgency legislation amending the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts so as to enable the Houses of the Oireachtas to resolve to change the terms of reference of a tribunal subject to the consent of the tribunal.  That commitment is linked with the Government's stated intention, also of 3 June, to seek, on enactment of the legislation, the consent of Mr. Justice Flood to amendment of the terms of reference of the tribunal, as then outlined.</P>
      <P>Once the Government had decided that the investigation should be carried out by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal, it was necessary to bring forward this legislation because without the legislation both Houses of the Oireachtas would not be in a position to change the terms of reference of that tribunal.  If the Government had decided to propose the establishment of another tribunal to deal with the new situation, this Bill would not, of course, be necessary.  However, after careful consideration the Government formed the view that the further investigations would most appropriately be undertaken by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal so that all matters arising could be dealt with by the one tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only a short while ago in this House that we debated the terms of the 1998 Bill which led to amendment of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  That Bill was framed to <Col N="1355" /> meet the particular circumstances which had arisen by the request made by Mr. Justice Flood, in his interim report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Planning Matters, for amendment of the terms of reference of his tribunal.  The central concern of the Government in bringing forward that Bill was that once a tribunal is established, it should be allowed to proceed with certainty in the knowledge that its terms of reference will not be changed except in certain exceptional circumstances and where it is satisfied that any such amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who had co-operated with or provided information to it under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The difficulty faced by the Government at the time was that the Act of 1921 did not expressly provide for the circumstance in which it was desired to have a change in the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal and the Act, accordingly, contained no guidelines on the safeguards which should be observed when deciding on any change in the terms upon which a tribunal is established.</P>
    <P>The 1998 Act's provisions were not lightly proposed by the Government and they were devised on the basis of legal advice from the Attorney General.  The Government was conscious that any provisions which were vague, oppressive or in violation of persons' rights would be open to challenge and could jeopardise the otherwise healthy operation of a sitting tribunal.  These, I might add, are also the concerns of the Government in bringing forward the present Bill.  The overriding concern is to achieve a balance in what is brought forward, to ensure fair procedures and to uphold the principles of justice.</P>
    <P>It is argued by some that the Government should, in the 1998 legislation, have allowed the terms of reference of a tribunal to be amended otherwise than on the basis of a specific request from the tribunal, by allowing the Oireachtas to initiate the change.  The difficulty with the wider approach is not one, even now with the benefit of hindsight, that has somehow disappeared.  The difficulty is that the process of consultation with a tribunal in trying to establish change in its terms of reference with its consent, could create tension between the Executive, the Oireachtas and a tribunal. Agreement on the amendments of terms of reference must not, and cannot, be expected in all cases.  The integrity of the judicial process must be preserved and the onerous task placed on a tribunal needs to be uppermost in our minds in debating those same issues which arise in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the context of the 1998 Bill, following on the request from Mr. Justice Flood, there was simply no need to go further than what was proposed. The best approach, in the Government's view, was to allow for change where a tribunal has itself requested specific change.  That was the situation which the Government dealt with in the 1998 legislation.  There are now different circumstances and the present Bill recognises that.  The Bill, <Col N="1356" /> however, retains the central feature of the 1998 Act by requiring that the tribunal is satisfied that a change in its terms of reference will not prejudice the legal rights of any person before the tribunal. In addition, the Bill ensures that the tribunal retains its independence through the inclusion of the principle of consent.</P>
    <P>It has been argued also that the Government proceeded with the narrower option in the 1998 legislation because it did not want the terms of reference of the tribunal, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Moriarty, changed so as to have the Ansbacher accounts investigated.  I want to dispel that myth because the allegations have surfaced again, having been raised in debate on the 1998 Bill.  The various layers of investigation of the Ansbacher accounts are as detailed and as broad as can be, consistent with the laws, including revenue and international law in this area. The fact is that the Ansbacher accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners, by an authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Companies Act, 1990, and by the Moriarty tribunal, which has a brief to examine certain aspects of those accounts.</P>
    <P>The other myth which has surfaced again is that my Department advised that the 1998 Bill was not necessary on the basis that power already existed under the 1921 Act to amend terms of reference of a tribunal.  The reality is that the practice when preparing legislation is to engage in a detailed analysis of the issues involved, to tease out all the legal principles and all the practicalities.  In the course of this exercise on the Bill the Department and the parliamentary draftsman raised queries which required to be answered by the legal side of the Attorney General's Office.  One of the queries was the necessity for the legislation and the Attorney General's legal advice, which was confirmed by independent counsel, to expressly provide for, in effect, amendment of terms of reference of a tribunal.  The present Bill is based on that premise and that is also the premise of the Private Member's Bill that is before the Dáil in the names of Deputies John Bruton, Quinn, De Rossa and Sargent.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal briefly with the details of the Bill.  The Bill is concerned with tribunals of inquiry to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, is applied.  Section 1 of that Act requires that, prior to the making of an instrument which applies the Act, both Houses must have resolved that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiring into a definite matter of urgent public importance.  The provisions contained in the 1921 Act, as amended by Acts of 1979, 1997 and 1998, give to a tribunal certain powers, rights and privileges that are vested in the High Court for evidential purposes. Such a tribunal can enforce the attendance of witnesses, examine the witnesses under oath and compel the production of documents.  The 1998 Act inserted a new section 1A into the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, which provided <Col N="1357" /> that an instrument which appoints a tribunal shall be amended, pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, where the tribunal has requested the amendment and is satisfied that such amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>Section 1 repeals and re-enacts, with amendment, section 1A of the 1921 Act.  New section 1A(1) provides that an instrument to which the new section applies shall be amended by a Minister pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, subject to certain conditions which are specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the subsection.  The conditions are that the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister or the tribunal has requested the amendment.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (a) of the subsection represents an additional option to the procedure provided for in section 1A of the 1921 Act as it stands.  The effect is to allow the Oireachtas to resolve to change the terms of reference of a tribunal, in the absence of a specific request in the matter from the tribunal itself, whether or not that tribunal was established before or after the passing of the Bill.  Paragraph (b), under which the tribunal may request amendment of its terms of reference, is in the law as it stands by virtue of the 1998 legislation.</P>
    <P>New section 1A(2) provides that, without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a tribunal shall not consent to or request an amendment where it is satisfied that such amendment would prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference. It re-enacts the substance of the law contained in this respect in the 1998 legislation.</P>
    <P>New subsections (3) and (4) are technical provisions which also re-enact provisions to be found in the 1998 legislation.  The effect of subsection (3) is that, where terms of reference of a tribunal are amended, the 1921 Act will apply to those new terms of reference.  Subsection (4) makes clear that the conditions in the new section 1A will apply where terms of reference of a tribunal are amended.</P>
    <P>The Private Member's Bill is substantially different from the Government's Bill.  The Private Member's Bill allows for amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal on the initiative of the Houses of the Oireachtas but does not expressly provide for amendment on the initiative of the tribunal itself.  The Bill would, moreover, allow amendment of terms of reference of a tribunal in circumstances where the tribunal has not consented to the amendment.  The Bill merely indicates that the tribunal must inform the Chairman of both Houses that it is satisfied that the amendment proposed by the Oireachtas would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has <Col N="1358" /> co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its existing terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The Government's Bill is specific on these issues.  The terms of reference of a tribunal cannot be changed without the consent of the tribunal and the tribunal itself may, as in the case of the Flood Tribunal, request change in its terms of reference.  A consultation procedure is also specified in the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>When considering the question of what tribunal might investigate the further matters in question, I confirm that the Government asked the Attorney General to consult both with Mr. Justice Moriarty and Mr. Justice Flood in relation to whether they would be willing to undertake the work in the context of the tribunals they are chairing.  Both expressed a willingness to undertake further investigative work on behalf of the Oireachtas and neither felt there would be any prejudice caused to persons by such addition to their terms of reference.  As I have indicated, the Government has now formed the view that further investigation would most appropriately be undertaken by Mr. Justice Flood's tribunal.</P>
    <P>I understand queries have been raised regarding the appropriateness of the approaches made to the two judges by the Attorney General.  Let me make it quite clear that the approach which the Attorney General made was purely to establish whether either would be willing or in a position to accede to an amendment of their terms of reference.  The Attorney did not advance any specific proposal to alter the terms of reference of either tribunal.</P>
    <P>Both tribunals are impartial and independent. They were established by orders in the terms that were resolved by both Houses and, were the terms of reference of either tribunal of inquiry to be the subject of amendment, this could only be done under existing legislation pursuant to the provisions of section 1A of the 1921 Act.  Moreover, any such amendment can only be made at the request of a tribunal.  The approach made by the Attorney General to the judges was whether there would be any obstacle to their terms of reference being amended by the Oireachtas if that should be the wish of the Oireachtas.  Some Senators will be aware that it is quite normal and proper for the Attorney General to act as a channel of communication in this way and there are precedents.  The willingness of either judge to undertake further investigative work on behalf of the Oireachtas is to be greatly welcomed by the House given the heavy work that is already under way by those judges.</P>
    <P>The Bill is sensitively framed to expressly provide for the conditions and procedures which must be adhered to where it is determined that the terms of reference of a tribunal, to which the 1921 Act applies, should be amended.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a poor commentary on the state of politics and public life that we are back here yet again, the third time in six months, to <Col N="1359" /> amend the law governing the conduct of tribunals of inquiry.  It is an even poorer commentary on the state of politics that two such inquiries are investigating public scandals directly involving a former Taoiseach and two recently disgraced Ministers.</P>
      <P>We are now revisiting our tribunals of inquiry legislation because of further scandalous revelations involving Mr. Ray Burke when he was Minister in an all-Fianna Fáil Government in 1989 and a close colleague, friend and confidante of the present Taoiseach.  That close friendship with the Taoiseach lasted until Mr. Burke's forced resignation last October.  It is safe to assume that the close friendship ended then.  However, it is far from safe to assume that the hold Mr. Burke held over the Taoiseach was released.  I am convinced that Mr. Ray Burke's hold on the Taoiseach is as potent now as it was when both of them knew all the Byzantine secrets and the murky world which surround the private funding of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will not be surprised if the information Mr. Burke holds on the Taoiseach will be the time bomb which eventually blows away this Government, the 28th Dáil and the 21st Seanad.</P>
      <P>We would not be here today discussing this Bill had the Minister accepted in this House the Opposition amendments to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Bill, 1997, last December and to the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1998, just a few weeks ago.  If these amendments had been accepted, the tribunals of inquiry legislation would be wide enough and competent enough to deal with all the things which have happened since we were first forced, towards the end of 1997, to amend the legislation because the lack of co-operation by Mr. Haughey with the McCracken Tribunal led to the question of who should pay the extraordinarily huge costs the tribunal had incurred when a former Member failed to co-operate with that tribunal.  Unfortunately, we amended the legislation at that stage in order that the costs could be levied against the person who, by his lack of co-operation, raised these costs against the tribunal, but we were unable to introduce legislation which would levy them retrospectively as should have been the case.  Last April we had reason again to revisit the tribunals of inquiry legislation.  We would not be back here today had our proposed amendments to that Bill been accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the circumstances which gave rise to the need for these House to return to amend the tribunals of inquiry legislation, whether it was the consequences of Mr. Haughey's failure to co-operate with the tribunal or the consequence of Mr. Justice Flood's interim report on the planning tribunal which was published last February, the Minister's response has always been to frustrate the efforts of the Houses of the Oireachtas to give the legislation teeth to get at all the truth. At all times the Minister has acted in a minimalist <Col N="1360" /> way and has tried to restrict as far as possible reasonable amendments from the floor of both Houses which would have strengthened the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts in order that the tribunal could get to all the truth.  That is one of the reasons we keep returning to this.  I fear that we will be returning to this again because of the minimalist and restrictive attitude which has been adopted by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>Even in this Bill the Minister continues to ensure that the Oireachtas will have no role in initiating a change in the terms of reference or widening of the powers of a tribunal of inquiry which is under way.  That is a disgrace and it was done in the last amending legislation.  It is a disgrace that the Oireachtas cannot have a role in initiating, with the agreement of the tribunal and the Government, a change in or broadening of the terms of reference or in giving the tribunal greater powers.  I again ask why.  I pleaded for an answer to that question on Second and Committee Stages last April but I got no answer from the Minister.  Perhaps he will reply this evening.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not show the reluctance and downright hostility he showed &mdash; he mentioned this again this evening &mdash; when the proposal that the notorious Ansbacher accounts be referred to the Moriarty tribunal for full and thorough investigation, which cannot take place through the actions of the Revenue Commissioners or the officers of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because of constraints in the law.  We need only witness the spectacle of the officials of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment these days down at the Four Courts where they are seeking leave of the court to publish the salient details surrounding the NIB offshore insurance investment tax dodge scheme.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to assure the House that there will be no withholding of any information on all the circumstances surrounding Mr. Burke's personal intervention to ensure that all the profitable MMDS franchises were given to one company, Princes Holdings, or companies in which that company held a controlling interest.  I want a straightforward direct answer to that question.  I want to ensure that all the circumstances, facts and information are made available to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>There is something else which needs to be investigated thoroughly.  Why did Mr. Burke sign a letter of comfort &mdash; written for him by Mr. Joseph Hayes of Independent Newspapers plc &mdash; which was an open cheque to that company fulfilling all the terms which it demanded in these strange deals?  Let there be no withholding of any information or facts surrounding that extraordinary action by a Minister.  All this was done against the expressed opposition of the officials in the Department.</P>
    <P>We want to ensure that all the information has been disclosed surrounding the payment of the £30,000 by executors of Rennicks to Mr. Burke <Col N="1361" /> on foot, according to the executive of Rennicks, of a demand for this donation from Mr. Burke. We are now told that it was £10,000 from this payment, and not a third of the Bovale contribution, which went directly to Fianna Fáil coffers &mdash; the House will remember that the Bovale contribution to Mr. Burke was said to be about £30,000.  It is important that this is cleared up fully since the Taoiseach told the other House, following an inside out and upside down search and examination of the Byzantine area of the Fianna Fáil funding, that the £10,000 came from the Bovale donation, but now we are told that it came from the Rennicks/Fitzwilton donation.  That is a serious question.  We need to know all the facts because here was the Taoiseach effectively misleading the House.  We know the punishment in other jurisdictions for somebody, especially a Prime Minister, who misleads Parliament.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be able to assure the House that if the tribunal demands the books and accounts of the Fianna Fáil Party for the years 1987-9 or any other relevant year, they will be made available without question or the need for further amendment to the tribunal of inquiry legislation.  We have no doubt that the Minister and his party would be reluctant if the tribunal demanded these books for full examination.  We do not want to be told that the reason it might not be able to be done is that it might necessitate legislation.</P>
    <P>In yesterday's Dáil debate the Minister came under a great deal of pressure to be forthright in relation to Mr. Burke's involvement with the operation of the passports for investments scheme during his period as Minister for Justice &mdash; roughly between 1987-9 &mdash; and the operation of this scheme from 1987 to its abolition just a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Burke was in charge of this scheme 45 applications for naturalisation were granted. There is substantial evidence that the legal requirements demanded under the operation of this scheme were not met by a large number of people who were granted citizenship by Mr. Burke.  It appears that the requirement of major investments in employment creation in the country, one of the primary requirements of being granted naturalisation, was not fulfilled in many of the cases in which Mr. Burke granted certificates. The requirement of a declaration of fidelity to the State and to the nation was not met and the letters of character reference presented by a number of these people were highly questionable. We understand Mr. Burke signed many of these certificates of naturalisation at his home.</P>
    <P>This murky area must be examined.  Many of the details are difficult to listen to and speak of. They form a sorry commentary on the state of the body politic.  We are all affected by the public cynicism about politicians and those who conduct the affairs of the State.  This threat to democracy has been brought upon us by a few people in powerful positions.  Most people in Government and in these Houses conduct their business with <Col N="1362" /> absolute integrity, but a few rotten apples in the barrel have done much to undermine respect for the institutions and for the important work we do.</P>
    <P>We welcome this Bill.  We have tabled one minor amendment regarding the role of the Oireachtas.  This amendment was tabled when related legislation was debated in this House some weeks ago.  We will try again to convince the Minister to restore the role of the Oireachtas in relation to broadening the terms of reference and giving Members a meaningful role.  Given the experience the Minister has had since last April he may accede to our request on this occasion.</P>
    <P>We welcome the Bill although it difficult to welcome legislation of this sort.  It is a sorry indication of the pass we have reached.</P>

I am reluctant to make party political comments in circumstances such as these but I must remind Senator Connor of Fine Gael's fund raising activities, of money given by Ben Dunne to Deputy Bruton and of episodes involving Deputies Noonan, Dukes and Yates.  In one of last Sunday's newspapers a columnist wondered by what method Fine Gael had overcome a serious deficit in that party's finances.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Connor, I have nothing to fear but Fine Gael politicians may regret throwing too many stones because they may find they they have broken their own glasshouse.</P>
      <P>I welcome this technical, sensitive and necessary Bill.  Its main purpose is to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, and other legislation.  I do not accept that amendments proposed in this House in the recent past would have overcome the difficulty which now besets the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first tribunal I remember inquired into the Whiddy Island fire in which 50 people died. There was subsequently a tribunal of inquiry into the Stardust fire.  In the recent past we have seen a plethora of tribunals, principally investigating various types of white collar crime.  The Government clearly understands that the inquiries must be made and the full truth arrived at.  To that end <Col N="1363" /> this amending legislation is necessary and has been introduced on foot of the best legal advice in the country.</P>
    <P>The Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, provides for the setting up of tribunals of inquiry following a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Tribunals must not be set up lightly. It is fitting that tribunals should be established from time to time to inquire into matters of urgent public importance.  In such cases both Houses of the Oireachtas are consulted.  As a result of recent legislation, tribunals have wide powers &mdash; to call and examine and cross-examine witnesses, to make orders for discovery &mdash; and, in many ways, similar powers to those vested in the High Court.  The Bill provides an instrument for amendment by a Minister pursuant to a resolution of both Houses and subject to certain conditions which are very clear and explicit.  First, it is necessary that the tribunal requests the amendment and, second, the tribunal must be satisfied that the amendment would not prejudice the legal rights of any person who has co-operated with or provided information to it.  The Minister has said that a Private Members' Bill has been tabled by the Leaders of the Opposition parties which is similar to this Bill but which contains certain defects.  For instance, it does not allow for a situation where the tribunal finds itself hindered by the narrow parameters of its terms of reference and seeks, of itself, to have its terms expanded or amended.  That is a major flaw in the Opposition Bill although its general thrust is similar to that of the Government's Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the tribunal itself must consent to the amendment, albeit after consultation with the Attorney General acting on behalf of the Minister.  The principle of consent is very clear in the Bill.  If no consent is forthcoming there will be no amendment and the terms of reference of the tribunal will stand.  The Bill recognises the independence and impartiality of the tribunal. The tribunal must make the request, perhaps in consultation with the Attorney General. It is recognised that the Attorney General's consultations with Mr. Justice Flood and Mr. Justice Moriarty were essential and proper.  Both Houses of the Oireachtas must also be consulted before the terms of reference are broadened.  It must be emphasised that the Government is committed to uphold the independence and impartiality of judicial tribunals.</P>
    <P>It is all very well with hindsight to say that the 1921 Act is defective.  Legislation is a fluid and evolving phenomenon.  When the 1921 Act was framed it did not envisage the need for amendment. The amending legislation is a prudent, natural and proper evolution of the laws of the State.</P>
    <P>The Bill has in-built clear safeguards, particularly the consent of the tribunal and that there will be no prejudice to the legal rights of a citizen who has co-operated.  It is important to note that if the Bill is enacted it will enable the widening <Col N="1364" /> of the terms of reference of existing tribunals.  As the Minister said, the Bill is an essential piece of amending legislation to ensure the tribunals can get at the full truth and that this Government is co-operating with the tribunals.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Flood tribunal suggested an inquiry into events from 1985 to the present with regard to certain allegations about planning matters.  Evidence has emerged from the tribunal's inquiries which makes it necessary to go back earlier than 1985.  The Government is facilitating the tribunal, at its request, to do that. Without this legislation the narrow parameters of the Flood tribunal might be damaging.  Significant matters from 1983, for example, might be unearthed and without the legislation they could not be dealt with by the tribunal.  This legislation removes the ball and chain to give tribunals broader terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The proposal for an amendment with regard to the taking of evidence is a technical matter.  It is unfair to cloud the issue with claims that the subject matter of the Bill could have been dealt with many months ago.  I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister and the Government for the action taken.  The Bill will give the tribunals greater power and autonomy.  It is an indication of the Government's recognition of the impartiality and independence of the tribunals.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to welcome the Bill because it is necessitated by fresh disasters from north County Dublin.  It is unfortunate that further legislation in this regard is necessary.  I am sure I am not the only Senator to have faced the phrase &ldquo;you are all the same&rdquo;.  This does not help the public image of politicians.  The falling rates of turnout at elections and referenda are an indication of the growing cynicism toward politicians. It is regrettable that events have progressed to the point that we must legislate to widen the terms of a tribunal.  It is unwise to pretend that we are doing so for anything other than the most regrettable reasons &mdash; regretted as much by members of Fianna Fáil as anyone.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor mentioned that, horror of horrors, we might be on the streets canvassing for election.  I must rely entirely on financial contributions from myself for my election expenses and I hope we do not face an election.  I thank Mr. Justice Flood and Mr. Justice Moriarty for telling the Attorney General that they would be prepared to expand the tribunals.  They have been given very onerous tasks and it is laudable of them to take on even more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the changes to the tribunal I hope Mr. Justice Flood will be able to address the transfer of ownership of the title deeds of the land on which Mr. Ray Burke's house was built.  Mr. Burke has been distressed by the suggestions in some newspapers that his father, the late Mr. Paddy Burke, used his position in St. Ita's Hospital to further the purchase of the land.  It is very hard for the Burke family to face this innuendo <Col N="1365" /> and not be in a position to do anything.  Perhaps this amendment to the tribunal will allow them to put paid to these suggestions.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about this matter because it is a slur on all members of the medical, nursing and other caring professions who deal with people in mental hospitals.  It is not right that they should be so easily accused of having misused their positions unless there is good evidence to show this to be the case.  It is one of the most serious actions that can be taken.  The Minister will be aware that when one of the nurses who was freed recently having been convicted of murder in Saudi Arabia came home to Scotland one of the first things awaiting her was a charge of misusing the credit card of a seriously ill patient.</P>
    <P>It is a very serious matter for a professional person to misuse their influence in any way.  It would be useful if the matter were addressed so that not only the late Mr. Paddy Burke's reputation might be shown to have been honourable but that those who work, and worked, with vulnerable people would not feel that they were considered culpable with regard to any transactions which had taken place with a patient who was in any way connected with his or her care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister wishes he was not here to present more amending legislation on this issue.  The new allegations which came to light in recent weeks about the payment of £30,000 by Rennicks, a subsidiary of Fitzwilton plc, to the former Minister, Mr. Ray Burke, in June 1989 has brought the body politic under scrutiny once again.  It is a pity that so soon after the political success of the British-Irish Agreement and the passage of the referenda North and South, our profession should again be shown in such a negative light.  The vast majority of those in politics are involved not to line their pockets but to give public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for this amending legislation stems from the allegations that have been made.  This will facilitate the most thoroughgoing inquiry into the matters aired in recent weeks.  I accept that this is the third time since the Government was formed that the need has arisen to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry Act, and it is unsatisfactory that a single piece of legislation be visited so often in such a short space of time.  However, those changes have been necessitated by extraordinary circumstances.  In the wake of the new claims about money paid to Mr. Burke, the Government has made it clear it would seek a comprehensive investigation of these matters.  The Tánaiste made it clear that when the allegations were made public all options would be considered.  As the Minister said, once the Government decided that the investigation should be carried out by Mr. Justice Flood's Tribunal, it was necessary to bring in this new legislation.  Without it both Houses would not have been able to change the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal.  The Government could have opted to establish a new tribunal and eliminate the need for legislative change, but the <Col N="1366" /> view was formed that the investigation required would be most appropriately undertaken by the Flood Tribunal.  All matters could then be dealt with by that one tribunal.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has argued that the Government should have allowed the terms of reference to be amended otherwise than on the basis of a specific request from the tribunal by allowing the Oireachtas to inititate the change in the legislation introduced earlier this year.  In bringing in the change now, the Government is concerned that the process of consultation which it seeks to put in place could create tension between the Executive, the Oireachtas and the tribunal. Agreement on the amendment of terms of reference must not and cannot be expected in all cases.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister when he says the integrity of the judicial process must be preserved. All Members would agree that the most important issue in this matter is establishing the truth.  I am satisfied that this legislation will ensure the most exhaustive investigation of these matters.  The public deserves to know the full truth and we have a duty to the public to leave no stone unturned in our efforts to establish that truth.  I am confident that the various tribunals established to inquire into potentially unethical and corrupt practices will purge our democratic and financial institutions of the taint of wrongdoing. We must all hope that the end product of this in depth investigative process is the banishment once and for all of unsavoury elements which have undermined our democracy for over a generation.</P>
    <P>I find the criticism of the Government's approach to these matters quite extraordinary. The Fine Gael spokesman in the Dáil queried the role of the Progressive Democrats in this affair, although the same spokesman expressed vehement opposition to the establishment of the McCracken Tribunal in late 1996.  He saw no need for an inquiry in the wake of revelations about Deputy Michael Lowry.  I remind Members that it was the Progressive Democrats that first sought the establishment of the McCracken Tribunal by way of a Private Members' Motion supported by Fianna Fáil.  Introducing that motion, Deputy Bobby Molloy spoke of the public's right to know and of the need to uphold the integrity of our democratic system.  He stated correctly that a tribunal of inquiry was essential in order to get to the truth.  That motion was voted down by the three parties then in Government.  The attitude of the Rainbow was well summed up by one Democratic Left spokesman, who said that such a tribunal would be:</P>
    <P>. a potential disaster, a recipe for prolonged hearings, huge legal bills and a real prospect of journalists ending up in jail, with no guarantee of satisfactory or complete answers at the end of the process.</P>
    <P>Some months later the Rainbow Coalition bowed to the inevitable and belatedly took our advice on the need for a tribunal.  As we know, the <Col N="1367" /> McCracken Tribunal restored the reputation of this means of inquiry.  An excellent job was done and every taxpayer owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Justice McCracken and his team.</P>
    <P>This Government has established two tribunals since coming into office, those chaired by Mr. Justice Moriarty and Mr. Justice Flood.  There has been no footdragging or equivocation.  The Progressive Democrats, like others, want these inquiries to reach a successful conclusion.  We will not be found wanting if further action is needed. The Opposition has sought to criticise the Government for not wanting the terms of reference of the Moriarty Tribunal changed to include investigation of the Ansbacher accounts and have gone as far as saying they are not being investigated. That is utter nonsense.  Those accounts are subject to scrutiny by the Revenue Commissioners, an authorised officer appointed by the Tánaiste under the Companies Act, 1990, and the Moriarty Tribunal, which has a brief to examine certain aspects of these accounts.</P>
    <P>I speak for all Members when I hope that all matters which have come to public notice over the last 12 months are thoroughly and expeditiously investigated.  I commend the tribunal for the work it has already done.  In time it will be seen to have done us considerable service. This Bill has been carefully framed and outlines the procedures which must be adhered to in deciding whether the terms of reference of a tribunal should be amended.  Most importantly, it in no way represents an undue interference in the workings of a tribunal but merely facilitates wider investigation of issues which may arise subsequent to the establishment of an inquiry under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.  I commend the Minister for bringing forward this legislation and I commend the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret the fact that once again we must debate legislation arising out of the kind of scandal and sleaze that has dogged the political landscape for some years.  Senator Keogh referred to the backdrop of events and one can only concur with her wish that we are coming to the end of this episode.  However, the dripping disclosure of information has not ended.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle because the Government is responding to the public's demand that further revelations be included in the terms of reference of the Flood inquiry.  The Government has responded speedily to that demand, which is why we are debating all Stages of the Bill at such short notice.  We wish to see this legislation passed as soon as possible, but we believe it to be as flawed as the legislation which went before it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is flawed because it does not address the central component we attempted to incorporate in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 1) Bill, 1998, which was debated here barely six weeks ago.  We argued then for the need for the Oireachtas to have some <Col N="1368" /> discretion in extending the terms of reference of a tribunal it had set up.  I stated then that I could easily envisage a situation where terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry which had been drawn up initially, had to be extended because of further events taking place at a later stage creating a public demand that the tribunal widen its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>That is precisely what happened barely two weeks ago, when further revelations about donations to Mr. Burke became public.  In a matter of hours there were huge expressions of concern and Government Ministers trotted out to say that those revelations would have to be included in the terms of reference of the sitting tribunal.  It was astonishing to hear at the time that it was merely a matter of the Oireachtas expressing its will to the tribunal in order to extend the terms of reference immediately.  The Taoiseach and other Ministers had not read the legislation they had recently passed, which meant that further amending legislation was required.  At that time I thought that amending legislation, such as this Bill, would meet the requirement to give the Oireachtas the necessary discretion but it does not do that.  For that reason it is flawed.  It creates a very unusual situation which should concern Members.</P>
    <P>The formula which is being proposed to extend the terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry is a matter between the Minister and the Attorney General, the Minister presumably acting on behalf of the Government.  Yet again, we still have a situation where the Houses of the Oireachtas have no role in amending or extending terms of reference.  In other words, our role as public representatives to express and act on issues of major public concern cannot be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>As a result of the flaws in this Bill, we will undoubtedly have future Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 4), (No. 5) and (No. 6) Bills to meet eventualities as they arise, until the Houses of the Oireachtas are given a certain discretion to extend the terms of reference of a tribunal to meet eventualities such as those so well illustrated by the current set of events, that is, further revelations.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Government has lost this opportunity and failed in its duty to these Houses to generate the correct legislative framework to enable us to deal with what I suspect will be an ongoing situation of revelations about planning and other issues.  On more than one occasion we have referred in this House to living in an era of tribunals.  There is no way to know this, but I suspect it will take a number of years to deal with these issues effectively.</P>
    <P>Senator Keogh referred to the British-Irish Agreement.  It was ironic, and potentially tragic, how the euphoria generated by the success of the referenda on the agreement was so brutally and immediately dashed by the revelations in <i>Magill</i> magazine almost overnight.  The good done to politics by the British-Irish Agreement has almost <Col N="1369" /> been wiped out.  While that is a pity, it is also a fact.</P>
    <P>We can hardly be surprised by growing public cynicism at each emerging revelation and how the public views us collectively.  We have a major job to do to restore public confidence because while these allegations only refer to a small number of individuals who have mostly left politics, we are all coloured by the stain created by their actions. Senator Henry mentioned that people say we are all the same and that we all in politics for ourselves; we hear that regularly.  I do not know how one can rebuild public confidence in the political system because with each revelation we hit a new low.  The tribunals have not yet even begun to have public hearings and one can only guess what the future will bring.</P>
    <P>I regret the mudslinging element about who did what which creeps into these debates with one side saying &ldquo;We had Burke but you had Lowry&rdquo;. That does not add to the debate and does nothing to build public confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>I am under no illusion that more will be revealed and that the corrosive effect of the drip feeding of information will ultimately undermine this Government so much that it will lead to a general election.  That will not happen today or tomorrow but the revelations will have a corrosive effect on the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and it will have to re-establish its mandate.  I do not welcome that.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's announcement that he is tabling amendments to strengthen the current ethics legislation.  I hope he will not meet resistance to that from quarters within his party which resisted the initial legislation.  There cannot be a politician in the country who does not see a need for such legislation now, particularly in relation to how the public views us.  Words such as &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; have been bandied about and undermined in many ways, but unless we are all prepared to act in an open and accountable fashion we cannot expect the public to have confidence in how we conduct our business.</P>
      <P>We will probably have to ban all political donations ultimately and totally fund the political system through the Exchequer.  Unless we do that, there will always be a question mark over who is answerable to whom.  Only when politicians and the political system are funded solely through the public purse can we argue that we, as public representatives, are only answerable to the public whom we are supposed to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I realise the background to it.  The first two or three pages of the Minister's script were a justification of his position.  It is a pity that Governments and Departments apparently feel they must cover themselves.  All politicians are painted with the same brush, regardless of which party they belong <Col N="1370" /> to.  Members of the public regard us all as chancers, irrespective of which party is in power. They do not say there was a great sea change in Irish life in 1995 when a different Government came into power because that is not how they see it.  Unfortunately, many of the rows in these Houses become big news to the public simply because they are big news in here, although they are not really matters of great moment to the electorate.</P>
      <P>There is a crisis of confidence in public representation. We have lost consumer confidence which we must regain.  We must recognise that if, for example, the Tánaiste's list of 300 names eventually emerges, even if there are no politicians on that list they will be tied into it in some way and accused of being friends with people on the list.  People will be helped to do that by this House because Members will rush to the microphones to say that so-and-so is a friend of Fianna Fáil and so-and-so is a friend of Fine Gael.  We will all be eventually sucked in; like lemmings to the slaughter, we can never rush soon enough to a microphone to bury each other.</P>
      <P>We need openness, which does not mean there can be no confidentiality.  I have said to previous Ministers that the public debate on so-called transparency and accountability has created immense problems.  The Minister or one of his colleagues will have to return to this House in about six months' time to amend the Freedom of Information Act.  They will have found that, as many of us said at the time, if we are to have freedom of information legislation we must also have privacy legislation.  Confidentiality and privacy are as important in a democracy as transparency and accountability.  We have lost that balance. Civil servants are now afraid to make notes on a file because someone can ask to see it the following day.</P>
      <P>I return to how the activities of politicians can be examined.  I wish to make two fundamental points in this regard.  In my opinion tribunals will become a fixture of life in Ireland in the future. It is the public's perception that tribunals represent the way to deal with problems such as those which gave rise to the need for this legislation. People believe these problems should not be dealt with by the courts or by politicians but by the third force in the land, namely, tribunals. That is what people want and what journalists have called for; once that call was made it developed its own dynamism and has inevitably and inexorably become a reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be careful in dealing with this issue. In my opinion the Minister should give serious consideration to establishing some sort of standing tribunal which would remove the need to introduce legislation of the type under discussion and which could deal with the matters that tend to be referred to tribunals.  I refer here to issues which do not involve politicians.  Matters involving politicians must be dealt with differently.  I plead with the Minister to fight against the nonsensical proposal before Cabinet that an ethics <Col N="1371" /> committee of outsiders should be established to restore confidence in public representation.  Only one group of people can win back that confidence, namely, public representatives themselves. We must be seen to investigate, take action on and clean up the unacceptable parts of our act rather than requesting an outside body to do so.</P>
    <P>Self-regulation is by far the best internal discipline that can be practised by any profession.  I convinced the Government and its predecessor to introduce self-regulation in teaching and I am confident it will become a reality.  I will argue with the same vehemence that politicians, like the members of other professions, should be in control of their profession, they should set, maintain, police and implement standards and they should take disciplinary action where those standards are not complied with.  We are the only people who can do this.</P>
    <P>It will take courage for the Government to introduce self-regulation because the first response from the media and the cynics among the general public will be that we are looking after ourselves.  However, when self-regulation is seen to work and when people realise that we will take action, confidence will be restored because no one knows the tricks in a profession better than those who practice it.  A High Court case is currently underway to prevent a professional accountancy body investigating one of its members.  Six to seven months ago another High Court action was taken to stop the Irish Medical Council, which was intent on getting into every corner and crevice of hidden knowledge not perceptible to the neutral observer, from investigating matters pertaining to the medical profession.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Houses of the Oireachtas require an internal committee which is not biased in anyone's favour.  It should be made up of people elected from the ranks of the Members of both Houses who will have the confidence of their counterparts and who will deal with matters directly so that public confidence can be restored. That would be better than bringing in outsiders to solve our problems.  However, it will take courage on the part of the Government to say that we can do the job better than anyone else.</P>
    <P>If it is to work, the committee will have to have recourse to force of law.  It will not succeed if it is established by means of regulations or internal mechanisms; it must have the powers and functions of a court.  Issues such as the compellability of witnesses, proper procedures for taking evidence, natural justice, etc., would come into play. There should be some sort of internal mechanism &mdash; namely, the profession itself resolving its problems &mdash; to deal with accusations of corruption in politics.  Such a mechanism should be based on proper structures which would be acceptable in any other profession.  In other words, the co-ordinating body charged with responsibility for self-regulation of our profession should have the power to investigate and take disciplinary action. Beyond that, people could have recourse to the <Col N="1372" /> courts when they had exhausted the options available. This represents a better way to deal with internal political issues than the proposal to establish an ethics committee comprised of outsiders.</P>
    <P>The only people who can determine the ethics of a profession are those who practice it.  When others determine the standards, they retain ownership of those standards.  The people who should have ownership of, proprietary influence over and involvement with such standards are those who are part of the profession in the first instance.  We should give careful consideration to this issue.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the forms Senators are required to complete and the accounts we are obliged to supply of the funding we receive &mdash; I take as much responsibility as anyone else in this regard because I took part in the debates on the relevant legislation when it came before the House and my comments are not intended as a reflection on a particular Government &mdash; but I believe they are an unnecessary imposition.  In my opinion it would have been better if every Member was required to provide a proper and complete account of the source of their funding and how it was spent after each election campaign.  I have been doing so for ten years because, following every election, I send such an account to the key people among my supporters.</P>
    <P>During the last election campaign I received funding of almost £10,000 from the INTO.  People were aware of that and they were in a position to vote for me or not depending on their preferences. That is much better than merely having the names of Senator Ross and me on a ballot paper without providing further information.  People will be better able to decide for whom they wish to vote if they know the source of candidates' support.</P>
    <P>We must take a practical approach to this issue. Openness is about access to information; it is not about having no unspoken thoughts or gaining access to everyone's private files.  It is concerned with telling people what they need to know, which is different from controlling people by means of funding their election campaigns.  These two issues are being discussed together as if they are synonymous but people must realise they are different.  This debate began as an investigation into openness because we wanted to discover who was supporting whom, which is fine.  That should be our objective and, given that this is a democracy, we should not place further regulation on it. We should accept that every penny invested in an election campaign is accounted for in terms of its source, destination and how it was spent.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and I hope it will fulfil the objectives outlined by the Minister.  I suspect it will probably fail to do so because on each occasion we enter uncharted territory new issues arise which must be dealt with in different ways. It is sad that Governments have been placed in a position where they feel they must protect themselves by being slow to take action on issues and <Col N="1373" /> that the parties in Opposition believe they must attack Governments for protecting certain elements.  This does not make sense to those outside.</P>
    <P>I hope the legislation will allow us to reach a level where we can discuss, without party political sniping, the best way to regulate our profession and do our jobs.  This can be done by recognising that at any given time the percentage of corrupt politicians is no greater in one part of the House than in the other.</P>

This argument was advanced on the basis that the Opposition had it right at that stage and the Government had it wrong.  That accusation does not stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
      <P>The reality is that certain circumstances presented themselves when the 1998 Act was being debated in this House.  Those circumstances were quite clear.  A chairperson of one of the tribunals sought an amendment to the terms of reference. It was clear legislation was required to deal with that and such legislation was introduced, enabling the terms of reference to be amended on the application of the chairperson of the tribunal.  I argued at that time that this was the preferred course of action and I still hold that view.</P>
      <P>Different circumstances have led to the introduction of this legislation and the Government has responded to those circumstances.  During the debate on the 1998 Act, I heard many arguments that a resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be sufficient to enable terms of reference to be amended in order that the Ansbacher accounts could be examined.  That of course, is a different matter, albeit an important one.  I explained <i>ad nauseam</i> the position in regard to the accounts cogently and credibly.</P>
      <P>The 1998 Act was introduced to meet a situation where the chairman of the tribunal sought an amendment to his terms of reference.  During that debate the Opposition consistently put forward the view that it did not regard legislation to be necessary.  Some Opposition Members changed their minds and are now of the view it is necessary. The Private Members' Bill before the Dáil in the names of Deputies John Bruton, Quinn, De Rossa and Sargent, which I referred to in my introduction to this debate, is testimony to the fact that despite their protestations to the contrary, they also now believe legislation is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circumstances surrounding the introduction of the Bill before the House are unprecedented and could not have been foreseen when the earlier legislation was introduced.  During the debate in this House on the 1998 Act two amendments <Col N="1374" /> were tabled by the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party which allowed the amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal where a tribunal had not requested such an amendment.  The amendments contradicted each other.  One envisaged consent and the other did not.  I pointed out that even though the principle of consent was included, the proposed amendment did not provide for any mechanism or procedure whereby the tribunal would be consulted.</P>
    <P>In that context the amendments left open the possibility of toing and froing between the Government and the tribunals.  Such comings and goings would relate to fundamental matters for the tribunals regarding proposed changes to their terms of reference and the tribunals were already engaged in the inquiries for which they were established.  Unlike those amendments, the legislation before the House provides for proper procedures whereby the terms of reference of a tribunal can be amended by a Minister following consultation between the Attorney General and the tribunal on behalf of the Minister.  The amendment of the terms of reference will take place on foot of a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, where the proposed amendments will be debated.</P>
    <P>An important feature of this legislation is that the tribunal will be consulted prior to the making of the amendment and its consent to the amendment will be required.  This requirement preserves the independence of the tribunal.  During the debates on the 1998 Act I stressed it was of paramount importance that the tribunal retain its independence.  It is undesirable that one should have to approach a tribunal of inquiry to ask if it wishes its terms of reference to be amended.  I set out the reason for this opinion on a previous occasion.  The current circumstances are exceptional and exceptional legislative measures are being introduced in the Oireachtas to address them.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the 1998 Act I cogently made the argument that I did not believe it was appropriate to provide for a member of the Government to go to a judicial personage in charge of a tribunal seeking to change the terms of reference.  I also said such a provision would leave the process open to the allegation of interference with the tribunal.  It is of the utmost importance that the independence and integrity of the tribunals be maintained.  I explained in great detail the terms under which the Attorney General, due to the exceptional circumstances which were presented, went to the chairperson of each tribunal.  That consultation was for the sole purpose of determining whether either tribunal would be prepared or be in a position to have its terms of reference amended.</P>
    <P>I emphatically reject any suggestion that there has been a conscious attempt by me or the Government to be minimalist in our approach to this legislation.  That allegation is simply not true. We introduced legislation to deal with these matters whenever it was required.  We have reached <Col N="1375" /> a position where the tribunals of inquiry can have their terms of reference amended by a request or in accordance with this legislation.  On each occasion we ensured any person who previously gave evidence will not be prejudiced by the fact the terms of reference have changed.  The consent of the tribunal is a necessary prerequisite which maintains its independence and a procedure for consultation has been provided for, all of which ensures there is no uncertainty in the matter in so far as that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill does not provide for the consent of the tribunal to the amendment of its terms of reference.  It simply provides that the only matter with which the tribunal would be concerned is whether an amendment of its terms of reference would prejudice the legal rights of persons who have co-operated with the tribunal. Notwithstanding the comments of some Senators, some Opposition Members consider that the tribunal should have no say in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Government wishes to have the fullest possible inquiry into the matters in question.  In addition, it wants to ensure there can be no successful challenge to the tribunal's work.  The tribunal is best placed to decide whether there should be an amendment to its terms of reference and what the amendment should be.  Therefore it cannot come as a surprise that I ensured that if the approach comes from the Minister through the Attorney General, the consent of the tribunal will still be required.  To that extent the integrity and independence of the tribunal has been maintained. To foist amendments on a tribunal without its consent would invite a challenge to it which would in all probability be successful.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that Senators said there is no role for the Houses of the Oireachtas in the establishment of tribunals where a change in the terms of reference are being discussed.  This is a misunderstanding and/or a misrepresentation of the true position.</P>

      <P>The Houses of the Oireachtas have a central role in such matters because it is only on foot of a resolution of both Houses that a tribunal can be established and it is only following debate in the Houses that its terms of reference will be finally decided.  Before such debate, consultation with the chairperson of the tribunal will be necessary for the reasons set out in the Bill.  The Houses of the Oireachtas are central to any proposed change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arguments by at least one Senator that this legislation is minimalist can be countered by the very cogent argument that some Opposition parties sought during the debate on the 1998 Act to suggest there was no need for legislation.  If no legislation had been enacted this would represent a minimalist approach.  A minimalist approach such as that, which could have been challenged <Col N="1376" /> successfully, could lead to the disruption of the work of the tribunals.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of passports, I do not want to go ploughing in the winds again for Senator Connor or anybody else. However, one should be careful in making allegations of this nature.  A tribunal is dealing with this matter and it should be accepted by everybody that the tribunals should be allowed to get on with their work.  In this context, if it should be the case that files are required, then obviously they will be made available. I remind Senator Connor that when he speaks of laws being broken, the Constitution not being obeyed and guidelines not being adhered to, he might reflect on the record of the Rainbow Coalition in regard to the issuing of certificates of naturalisation.  On 4 September 1996 the Government decided that no further applications would be processed and only those in hand would be considered.  This amounted to 19 applications. When it was due to leave office that Administration decided to consider and grant certificates of naturalisation in respect of four other applications which were not included in the 19 applications. If Senator Connor or anybody else wishes to speak about a breach of guidelines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Senator O'Meara is of the view that more revelations could be forthcoming which would require further legislation.  I hope further legislation is not required.  However, in fairness, the Government has demonstrated that where legislation is required it is forthcoming, that matters have been addressed as adequately as possible and that we did what we had to to ensure that the matters giving rise to concern would be fully investigated at the appropriate fora.  I hope I have explained the position as comprehensively as possible.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 19, after &ldquo;by&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Government or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill refers to &ldquo;the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister&rdquo; at line 24 and there is reference to &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo; at line 19.  In the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1997, commonly referred to as the Cabinet confidentiality amendment, the Schedule, in setting out the exceptions to the specific rule of Cabinet confidentiality, provides that the High Court shall determine that disclosure shall be made, first, in respect of a specific matter in the interests of the administration of justice by courts, etc., and, second, by virtue of an overriding public interest pursuant to an application on that behalf by a tribunal appointed by a Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into matters stated by them to be of public importance.  It has been brought to my attention that there is an inconsistency between this and the wording of the Bill.  These amendments seek to clarify this by the insertion of the words &ldquo;the Government or&rdquo; before the words &ldquo;a Minister&rdquo;.  They are largely technical and allow the Bill to refer to the Government collectively, consistent with the Seventeenth Amendment of the Constitution Act.</P>

      <P>The amendments propose the inclusion of the words &ldquo;Government or&rdquo; in lines 19 and 24 page three.  The amendments, as such, propose that the instrument to which section 1A applies shall be amended pursuant to a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Government or a Minister of the Government. Where an amendment is contemplated it would arise in the context of a specific area of Government responsibility, which would come within the remit of the Minister who would be charged with responsibly for carrying out the wishes of the Government.  Accordingly, the inclusion of the word &ldquo;Government&rdquo; is unnecessary. I hope the Senator understands this clarification and withdraws her amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 21 to 25, and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) the tribunal consents to the proposed amendment following consultations between the tribunal and&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1378" /> (i) the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister, and</P>
    <P>(ii) the authorised representatives of any group, recognised for the time being under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas, which has sought to enter into such consultations with the tribunal on the question as to whether such an amendment should be made.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment is at the centre of the debate on this legislation.  I thank the Minister for his erudite exposition of the legal and constitutional framework of the legislation.  However, I am sure he accepts we are entitled to disagree with him.</P>
    <P>In this Bill and in previous legislation we have sought to allow public representatives in the Dáil and the Seanad to respond to issues of major public concern.  All sides of the Oireachtas, including the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste responded to the revelations about Mr. Ray Burke in <i>Magill</i> by seeking to ensure the truth will come out and on Second Stage I acknowledged the speed with which the Government introduced this legislation. The widespread reaction was to extend the terms of reference of the relevant tribunals.  The Minister referred to the fact that the Oireachtas established these tribunals and, therefore, has a role in that regard.  In view of this, it is not unreasonable to extend the role in this legislation to amending the terms of reference where required from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Minister described the circumstances which gave rise to this legislation as exceptional. I hope he is right.  We are seeking to achieve a consistency regarding the role of Members of the Oireachtas acting as public representatives and reflecting the concerns of the public on matters of major public interest.  If we were to say we do not have a role and that it was up to the tribunal or the Minister there would be a major outcry.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has set out cogent and erudite legal arguments against the thrust of these amendments and has proposed this legislation, which I largely accept, I ask him to listen to what we are seeking to achieve.  The amendment seeks to extend the consultation process with regard to any extension of the terms of reference beyond what is envisaged in the Bill.  It requires that there should also be consultation with groups in the House recognised under Standing Orders.  A tribunal is established by resolution of the entire House and not by an individual party or Minister. There is no reason for secret lines of communication with the tribunal which do not involve all Members of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There would be greater public confidence in the operations of a tribunal, which is what everybody wants to achieve, if all parties and Independent Members were involved.  We should be determined to ensure that is the case.  An extension of the terms of reference of a tribunal should not be viewed as belonging to an individual or small group.  In addition, it should not be perceived to be happening behind closed doors <Col N="1379" /> rather than in the public domain where it can be openly debated.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that amendments will be made pursuant to a resolution of both Houses by a Minister of the Government where the tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister, or the tribunal has requested the amendment.  This appears simple but it could be a complex matter. For example, in the current case there was a revelation which was followed by widespread debate in the public domain.  Every newspaper, radio and television outlet covered the subject and everybody demanded the extension of the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>The legal framework will be that such extensions will happen following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister.  This a narrow procedure and I wonder about the extent of public reaction if further cases arise in the future and this incident is not exceptional as the Minister envisages and hopes.</P>
    <P>The amendment is designed to extend the consultation process.  I hope the Minister accepts it was tabled in good faith and with the aim of building confidence in the manner in which the Houses operate, particularly regarding tribunals of inquiry which are so important in terms of public confidence in the political process.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the amendment favourably.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator O'Meara on her contribution.  I am at risk of repeating a number of the points I made on Committee Stage of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in April.  The Minister said that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are an essential part of the formulation of the legislation governing tribunals of inquiry.  However, that is true of all legislation. Under the Constitution, both Houses have a role in that regard but the Minister appeared to suggest Members should be satisfied with that position.</P>
      <P>Some Senators on the Government side are members of the legal profession and they should consider that the Minister is refusing to allow Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas have a say in requesting, with the agreement of the member or members of a tribunal, a change in or extension of its terms of reference.  Why does the Minister want to exclude the Houses of the Oireachtas from that role?  If a need is identified by the Oireachtas, I do not understand why any Member of either House cannot request an alteration. There are procedures in both Houses under which such a motion can be passed or defeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public issues are ventilated in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am open to correction but the previous legislation was silent on this matter. However, in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) <Col N="1380" /> (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill the Minister inserted a provision which ensured that the role of Members of the Oireachtas was excluded. Members on the Government side should ask themselves why they should be excluded.  This issue does not only affect Opposition Members of either House.  This role should be open to all Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Members of both Houses may wish to raise matters in connection with the terms of reference of a tribunal of inquiry and they should have the democratic freedom to do so.  Deputies and Senators are elected representatives in our bicameral system and they should not be excluded.  If the Minister cannot accept the amendment, will he explain the reason?  Why should Members of the Houses be excluded from this simple role which they have in most other areas?</P>
    <P>Senators may trespass on the latitude of the Cathaoirleach during the Order of Business. However, they can raise matters and can have an impact because the issue will have been ventilated in the most important debating forum in the country.  This is the important point.  It is fundamentally important that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas retain this right.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The first part of Senator O'Meara's amendment is covered in the Bill where the issue of consent is emphasised.  We should not forget once a tribunal is established by both Houses of the Oireachtas it must have a sense of full independence.  It must be impartial and this is what the Minister and Government are seeking to ensure.</P>
      <P>Tribunals are only established to deal with issues of urgent public importance.  Once they are set up they must be independent of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The second part of Senator O'Meara's amendment would create a situation where political parties would have the right to make proposals to the chairman of the tribunal. This would defeat the purpose of tribunals which must be independent and impartial.  Although I empathise and agree with the first part of Senator O'Meara's amendment, the second part is wrong.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that Senator Connor is sincere but he is incorrect when he says the Houses of the Oireachtas will have no input.  Subsection 1A(1)(a) states:</P>
      <P>The tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister.</P>

It would be unconstitutional and these amendments must be rejected.  The process of consultation to amend the terms of reference must be initiated by the tribunal or, in cases of significant importance, by the Government and the Minister in question after consultation with the Attorney General, . The thrust of these amendments would take from the independence and impartiality of the tribunal and could do harm which was not intended.</P>

      <P>I am not a legal person but I will give the House the following example.  Many years ago I was a member of a State board, BIM, but when I became a Senator I had to resign. When I asked why I was told there would be a conflict of interest.  Every couple of months we see Bills to set up State boards and all of them exclude Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas because of the potential for a conflict of interest &mdash; a Deputy or Senator could be on an Oireachtas committee which was examining the board of which he was a member.  This case may be rather different but the same conflict is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands both Houses would be in a position to resolve that the terms of reference of a tribunal be amended where the tribunal has consented to or requested the amendment.  Where the tribunal consents to the amendment the Bill stipulates that the consent must follow consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister.  The responsibility of the Minister, in due course, will be to make an order incorporating the new terms of reference and designating the tribunal whose terms of reference have been changed.  It is normal and proper for the Attorney General to act as a facilitator or channel of communication in this way and the Bill gives statutory expression to that role in the delicate context of amending the terms of reference of sitting tribunals of inquiry.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 seeks to provide, in addition, that the consent of the tribunal must follow consultation with what are described as the authorised representatives of any group recognised for the time being under the Standing Orders of either House of the Oireachtas which has sought to enter into such consultations with the tribunal about whether such amendment should be made.  In effect, it seeks to provide, as the condition of a tribunal's consent to any change in its terms of reference, that it must have engaged in consultations with representatives of political groups &mdash; including, it would seem, their legal advisers &mdash; where those groups have sought to enter into such consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the amendment could lead to a wholly undesirable situation where the tribunal is confronted with opposing views and would, it <Col N="1382" /> appears, be expected to arbitrate on them.  The appropriate venue for the debate on the issues involved in any proposal to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal is surely the Houses of the Oireachtas and not a tribunal whose functions were never intended to deal with such matters. The amendment would constitute, to say the least, an unwieldy intrusion on the operation of a tribunal and could create considerable confusion. The exercise involved in formulating appropriate terms of reference and having them agreed in both Houses can be quite difficult.</P>
    <P>The amendment would permit a multitude of authorised representatives of any group to conduct their own separate and distinct consultations with a tribunal.  In some cases this would inevitably lead to conflicts between proposals for amended terms of reference and to delays in agreement on terms of reference and expose the tribunal to possible unending representations and correspondence, all of which would deflect it from its purpose.  I am satisfied that the Senator's amendment is ill conceived and unacceptable and I have no basis for supporting it.  The consultative process is so open ended and broadly based that the tribunal might never examine the issue for which it was originally set up.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 appears to assume that the Bill as it stands does not cater for the circumstances that a proposal for the amendment of the terms of reference of a tribunal might come from the Opposition rather than the Government. Such an assumption is incorrect and Senator O'Donovan is right to say that the role of the Houses of the Oireachtas is central to the amendment of the terms of reference, because the resolution must be passed under this legislation by the Houses.</P>

      <P>It is true that the consultative process takes place through the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister but the resolution must be adopted by the Houses, irrespective of whether that is placed before the House by the Government or the Opposition.  Once there is a majority in favour of the resolution, it is passed and that must underline the central role which the Legislature plays in the change of terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated on Second Stage the Bill is concerned with tribunals of inquiry to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, is applied.  Section 1 of that Act requires that, prior to the making of a ministerial order which applies to the Act, both Houses must have resolved that it is expedient that a tribunal be established for inquiry into a definite matter of urgent public importance.  The Bill provides that the ministerial order shall be amended pursuant to a resolution of both Houses, subject to certain conditions which I have outlined.  There is nothing in the Bill or in the Act of 1921 as amended which prohibits <Col N="1383" /> the Oireachtas to resolve &mdash; for instance, by way of acceptance of the terms of an Opposition motion, where the Government joins in the motion &mdash; to amend the terms of reference of a tribunal.</P>
    <P>However, the principle of the consent of the tribunal to changes in its terms of reference, the need for which is acknowledged in both amendments, must be borne in mind.  Because of the fundamental importance of that consent it is reasonable to assume that the Houses, under their working arrangements, would in suitable cases arrange through the relevant Minister, and ultimately the Attorney General, for the necessary consultations to be engaged in with the tribunal to seek its consent.  There are precedents for the Attorney General working in this way and in the circumstances I do not consider there is a need to change the Bill to cover the point at issue. It should also be stressed that if it were the other way around &mdash; that is, if the Houses of the Oireachtas decided to pass the resolution before seeking the consent of the tribunal through the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister &mdash; the tribunal could refuse its consent, which would mean the Houses would have been wasting their time.  In those circumstances I think everyone would agree that what is before the Seanad is reasonable, logical, makes perfect sense, and will be workable, practical and sensible.  For all those reasons and others I have specified I cannot accept either amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>If the tribunal is not requesting an amendment to the terms of reference &mdash; in other words, where the desire for a change comes not from the tribunal but from the political establishment, that is, the Houses &mdash; is it not the case that, in the framework proposed in the Bill, the initiative for such an amendment can only come from the Minister?  Under this Bill as drafted, it is the case that the initiative can only be taken by the Government of the day.  The Opposition cannot take the initiative with regard to moving an amendment to the terms of reference.  The initiative must come from the Government of the day.</P>

      <P>The approach to the tribunal is that the Minister goes through the Attorney General, that much is true.  I indicated there would be nothing to prevent an Opposition party putting forward a view in Private Members' time in regard to how it believes the terms of reference of a tribunal should be altered.  If that view was accepted by a majority vote, the process of consultation could take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis, the Oireachtas must pass the proposal regarding a change to the terms of reference by resolution.  If I were to go down the road suggested by Senator O'Meara, the Opposition would be allowed to impose its will on the majority in the Houses of the Oireachtas and insist on the terms of reference of a tribunal being <Col N="1384" /> changed.  That would not be a desirable road to travel because then the Opposition, although it is in a minority, could act as if it were in Government. Democracies do not work like that.  In all circumstances the legislation as it is now presented is reasonable and sufficient for this purpose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astounded that the Minister says that any Member of the House could use Private Members' business to introduce a change in the terms of reference of an ongoing inquiry. Under Standing Orders and the law, the Chair of both Houses would have to say that could not take place.  Provision is not made for it in the Act, it is as simple as that.</P>
      <P>The Minister then mentions the danger of an Opposition dictating, even if it achieved a majority in the House which could alter the terms of reference of a tribunal.  We want to insert &ldquo;the Houses of the Oireachtas with the consent of the tribunal, having requested the amendment&rdquo;. Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, whether organised as a party or on an individual basis, could raise the issue in the House and Standing Orders and the law do not prohibit that from happening, as would happen now because the law specifically prohibits Members of the Oireachtas from initiating a change in the terms of reference in the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister has closed his mind but I appeal to the Members on the Government Benches to see that they are taking away a power guaranteed by the Constitution.  I have a suspicion, having heard the Minister express some fundamentally antidemocratic sentiments, as to why he does not want the participation of Members of the Oireachtas in this area.  We do not need a lecture that the terms of reference of any tribunal must be passed by a majority of Members of the Oireachtas.  That is the fundamental tenet of the Constitution which guarantees the existence of this House and the role of its Members, the basic principle of any parliament which is even semidemocratic. We do not need to be told that.  We are seeking a central role for the Houses of the Oireachtas.  We would not seek a change in the terms of reference unless the tribunal itself sought it or agreed it after we suggested it.</P>
      <P>What difference would it make if it said in section 1A, &ldquo;The tribunal has consented to the proposed amendment, following consultation between the tribunal and the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas with the consent of the tribunal having requested the amendment,&rdquo;?  What would be wrong with that section reading like that? Nothing extraneous is being introduced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has confirmed that the Government has a monopoly on asking the Attorney General to approach the sole member of the tribunal to find out his views on any change to the terms of reference.  In other words, the Attorney General could not act on behalf of anyone <Col N="1385" /> other than the Government.  The Attorney General has a role in acting in the public interest. There has been a precedent set before the courts on this.  Such tribunals of inquiry as are sitting at the moment are appropriate places for the Attorney General to act in the public interest, on behalf of Members of the Opposition, for example.</P>
      <P>Considering that both Houses of the Oireachtas set up the tribunals, to move into a situation where it is not the will of the Oireachtas to initiate any extension of the terms of reference, then extension falls within the gift of the Government of the day.  That is antidemocratic.</P>
      <P>I know my pleas are falling on deaf ears but it would be in the public interest if this legislation, or any legislation allowing for an extension of the terms of reference, required as much consultation as possible concerning the actions of Members of the Houses.  It would increase the level of public confidence in the performance of tribunals.  I appeal to the Minister to realise that the extent of the monopoly created by the Government's actions regarding the extension of the terms of reference is against the public interest.</P>

      <P>The Senator is correct according to my legal knowledge, although I do not consider myself an expert.  In fact, the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government. However, the kernel of the issue is being missed in that when a tribunal is established it must be impartial and as far as possible fully independent. Interference by anyone is not possible except by the Government or the Oireachtas in exceptional circumstances.  The Bill sets out exceptions that can be made, particularly where the tribunal itself requires it, but these are extreme circumstances. Otherwise, that sense of independence and impartiality must not be interfered with either by the Government &mdash; apart from exceptional circumstances &mdash; and certainly not by party groups or individuals.  This impartial and independent role is not being grasped.  It would certainly affect the whole purpose of tribunals.</P>

      <P>Everybody would accept that an individual's vote, as exercised by free will, is fundamental to any democracy.  The intention of an individual casting a vote at a general election in a democracy is to elect a Government. That is the decision which the individual makes, of his or her own volition.  Quite clearly, the party or parties that obtain a majority form a Government, having been mandated to do so by the ultimate and supreme authority &mdash; the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is then charged with exercising its functions under the 1937 Constitution, pursuant to legislation duly passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas and pursuant in some instances to custom and convention.  One of the primary functions which a Government is charged with is the passage of legislation.  That does not mean there are not instances and have not been times when a Government has not accepted, for example, <Col N="1386" /> Private Members' Bills emanating from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition I had the privilege of having some Bills accepted by the then Government. However, that is the decision of the Government of the day.  If the Government of the day decides not to accept certain legislation then that is democracy in action.  It is the will of the people that the Government should exercise its discretion in that matter.</P>
    <P>In the same way there is nothing to prevent a motion being put down by an Opposition party in the Houses of the Oireachtas seeking that a Minister would ask the Attorney General to discuss a motion for an amendment of a tribunal's terms of reference and seeking the consent of the tribunal.  In the event of the consent of the tribunal being forthcoming, it could go back to the Houses of the Oireachtas who in turn would be empowered to pass a resolution in accordance with the consent which was obtained.</P>
    <P>However, what cannot be countenanced is that the discretion of the Government of the day would be fettered in any way.  Majority rule underpins our democratic process and that much has to be accepted.  To make a counter argument is, in my view, futile and, anyway, such an argument is facile.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, true that the Attorney General is constitutionally charged with the protection of the public interest.  However, I submit that in this particular instance the public interest must be expressed by a majority of the Oireachtas, irrespective of whether the motion comes from Opposition or Government.  Majority rule has to be respected.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances which I have outlined, it will be clear that it is possible for an Opposition party to bring forward a motion to amend terms of reference, but a majority would be required before the Attorney General, on behalf of the Minister, would seek the consent of the tribunal. Ultimately, in any event, a resolution would have to be passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  All that is quite illustrative of our democratic process and exemplary in so far as one wishes to provide an example of how it should operate in any democracy.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the point being missed at all times is that the Houses of the Oireachtas must pass the resolution.</P>

      <P>We will carry on.  The Bill as currently drafted envisages a situation where a tribunal may consent to or request a change in its terms of reference.  This is to be welcomed. However, the tribunal may refuse to consent to a change in its terms of reference.  Indeed, on more than one occasion Senator O'Donovan has referred to the fundamental principle of consent contained in this legislation as it refers to tribunals of inquiry.  It is fundamental, of course. The Bill leaves it entirely up to the tribunal to make the decision as to the grounds on which it may refuse such a request.  This amendment seeks to confine the grounds which a tribunal might raise for refusing to agree to a change in its terms of reference.  As the Minister pointed out, that request would come by virtue of a majority vote of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The amendment confines the grounds solely to the risk of prejudice to the legal rights of parties before the tribunal.  If the Minister thinks there are other reasons a tribunal might be justified in refusing to comply with a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps he would set them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Bill as it stands, a tribunal must not consent to a request to a change in its terms of reference where it is satisfied that such change would prejudice the legal rights of <Col N="1388" /> any person who has co-operated with or provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference. The amendment purports to substitute that provision with one that would require a tribunal, after a request to change its terms of reference, where it is satisfied that such amendment would prejudice the legal rights of a person who has co-operated with and provided information to the tribunal under its terms of reference, and that would require a tribunal to consent to the amendment unless it is satisfied that the legal rights of persons would be prejudiced.  The effect of the amendment would be to compel a sitting tribunal to agree a change in its terms of reference in cases where the rights of persons before the tribunal would not be prejudiced.</P>
      <P>I find the amendment to be strange and apparently oblivious of the reality that exists in relation to sitting tribunals.  Where a tribunal has been in operation it is seized of extremely onerous duties placed on it by existing terms of reference.  It may have already published its terms of reference in newspapers, sought information, considered whether information supplied is within its terms of reference, considered requests for representation and taken evidence.  It may, for example, have advanced to the stage where it is at a crucial point in its deliberations and it may be nearing completion of its work.  These clearly are considerations, among others, which may lead a tribunal to the conclusion that it should not agree to a change in its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>It is entirely wrong to impose amended terms of reference on a sitting tribunal without that tribunal having a say in the matter.  I am satisfied that a tribunal in those circumstances is best placed to say whether amended terms of reference are acceptable.  The principle of consent is, in my view, fundamental to the Bill.  The amendment seeks to remove that principle from the Bill and in those circumstances I propose to reject the amendment.</P>
      <P>The whole concept or principle of consent and maintaining the independence and integrity of the tribunal is the essential plank of this legislation in as much as it was a central plank of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998.  I am sure Senators will agree that is of considerable importance and must be retained to underpin the legislation.  Failure to do so will result in badly flawed legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion seeks to ensure that the Minister for Education and Science retains the Breaking the Cycle scheme in operation in the Central Model School in Marlborough Street and in Scoil Mhuire in Dorset Street.  I tabled it two weeks ago because I was told that four teaching posts under the Breaking the Cycle scheme would be lost in the junior and senior primary schools in Marlborough Street and in Scoil Mhuire boys' and girls' schools.  Since then other proposed teaching losses have come to my attention in Sheriff Street, City Quay, St. Vincent's and in many other parts of the city.  I refer to these areas in particular because they are deprived areas of the inner city and all, except one, are in my constituency.</P>
      <P>When the Breaking the Cycle scheme was introduced in 1996 by the then Minister for Education, Ms Bhreathnach, its purpose was to examine the declining numbers of pupils in primary schools and the subsequent staffing requirements in terms of pupil/teacher ratios.  There should be a deliberate attempt to reduce the teacher/pupil ratio in certain areas where that is required.  Half the teacher surplus should be used for this purpose rather than dividing it equally between schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister chose 25 urban and 25 rural schools which fell into a particular category, the criteria of which were determined independently by the Combat Poverty Agency.  The idea was to have a maximum ratio of 15:1, which would be a substantial reduction of a ratio of approximately 25:1.  This was a major effort to focus resources in areas where they were most needed.  I understand from speaking to teachers in the area that it has made a great difference to have an inner city class size of 15 or fewer compared to 25 or more and <Col N="1390" /> the level of personal attention which can be given to pupils in the classroom has greatly improved.</P>
    <P>I am dismayed that the Minister now proposes to reduce the ratio in these schools.  When the scheme was introduced two years ago it was on a five year basis.  Nobody expected anyone to interfere with it until we saw how it operated.  If it operated effectively, then it could be assessed and a decision could be made.  However, the Minister is interfering with it in its second year.  The Minister was not in a position to interfere with it last year because the elections took place in June and it was then too late to require schools to reduce their teacher numbers.  However, at the first opportunity the Minister has intervened in a negative fashion to take teachers who are very much needed.</P>
    <P>I will give the Minister an idea of the type of school to which I refer.  In one of the schools in the area 10 per cent of the pupils are categorised as seriously disruptive.  In other circumstances these students would be in special schools and they would cost the State a fortune.  They are being taught now and, according to the teacher with whom I spoke today, they are anxious to stay on in school as the summer holidays approach. That is a good sign of the quality of teaching and care, although I suppose it says much about the environment in which the students would find themselves outside school.  In the same school a number of pupils have specific disabilities as well as being disruptive and at risk in other areas.</P>
    <P>There are also 11 children of asylum seekers attending the school.  They account for roughly 10 or 11 per cent of the pupils in the school.  The school is taking on board that new category of pupils which is increasing in number in the inner city.  These circumstances render it difficult for a decision to be taken in the previous September. The decision was taken on 13 September 1997 for allocations in 1998.</P>
    <P>There is flexibility in the operation of schools with regard to the numbers of pupils enroling on an ongoing basis for many reasons, including the fact that some pupils are the children of asylum seekers and the nature of inner city schooling where, unlike in middle class environments, the names of pupils are brought to the teacher at the last moment at the end of the summer.  Until the school opens in September it is never easy to know precisely the number of pupils who wish to attend.  It is a different scenario entirely from what one would expect in other areas in the country.</P>
    <P>The existing good system, which was set up as a five year pilot programme, is being undermined in its second year.  At the same time, the Minister is introducing a good scheme for 15 to 18 year olds.  If the teachers are taken from these schools, it will probably result in the need for new teachers.  There are teachers who are being trained for the Breaking the Cycle scheme who <Col N="1391" /> will be let go and new staff will replace them later in the year.</P>
    <P>In the interests of the pupils, education, Breaking the Cycle and, indeed, the Minister, because this is a volatile situation and there is much antagonism in the communities over what the Minister is proposing to do, the Minister should rescind the decision which has been taken by the Department of Education and Science and letters should emanate from the Department to these schools reversing the decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one fact which the Minister for Education and Science is anxious to put on the record, that is that the concessionary teacher arrangements and pupil/teacher ratios which were announced for the Breaking the Cycle pilot project remain fully in place in these schools and in all other participating schools.</P>
      <P>In the interests of clarity, he has asked me to explain that the general staffing levels in all primary schools are determined by reference to enrolment numbers on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since.</P>
      <P>Both the Central Model Infants national school and Scoil Mhuire have disadvantaged status and as such are entitled to an overall staffing level which enables them to operate at a maximum class size of 29:1.  Both schools are also included in the urban element of the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  As a result of their inclusion in this programme, both schools are also entitled to a staffing level which enables them to operate their junior classes at a maximum class size of 15:1. This is an essential point.  Breaking the Cycle has never involved simply handing out teaching posts; it establishes a PTR and allocates the staff required to meet it.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the pilot project, all schools participating in the urban element of the scheme have been allocated additional staffing to enable them to operate their junior classes at a maximum class size of 15:1.  In keeping with standard procedures, these staffing allocations were determined by reference to enrolments at 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science understands that the enrolment of Central Model Infants national school on 30 September 1997 was <Col N="1392" /> 72 pupils.  This represents a decrease from 86 pupils the previous year.  Because this is a junior infants school, all classes qualify for the 15:1 maximum class size applicable under the Breaking the Cycle project.  Based on its reduced enrolment figure, the school requires a total staffing complement of five teachers.</P>
    <P>At present, the school has a staffing level of principal, two assistants, a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post, plus two teachers allocated under the Breaking the Cycle project to meet the previously higher enrolment figure.  The school also has the full-time services of a remedial teacher and shares in the services of a home-school-community liaison teacher and a teaching counsellor.</P>
    <P>On the basis of its reduced enrolment figure, the staffing allocation being made available to the school for the forthcoming school year is adequate to meet the school's requirements.  The PTR in its junior classes will be below 15:1 on the basis of the enrolment data.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science understand that the enrolment of Scoil Mhuire on 30 September 1997 was 100 pupils.  This is a reduction from 103 pupils the previous year.  On the basis of the composition of the school's total enrolment, in terms of junior and senior class pupils, this school requires a total staffing complement of five teachers to remain within the required class size limitations.  For the forthcoming school year, the school will have a principal, three assistants, plus a disadvantaged concessionary teaching post.  The school will also have the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a shared home-school-community liaison teacher and a concessionary teacher post arising from a previous amalgamation.  Once again, the school will have a PTR below 15:1 in its junior classes, in fact 13:1 on the basis of enrolment data.</P>
    <P>The Minister utterly rejects the idea that this is a new policy and that, as was said earlier this week, he is undermining the agreed staffing for these schools.  If he were to allocate further teaching posts to these schools, it would require a new staffing schedule.  Both schools will continue to benefit from preferential PTR arrangements which recognise their particular needs.</P>
    <P>However, there is an arrangement in place whereby schools may contact the Department if their projected enrolments are likely to increase for the forthcoming school year and they would be unable to work within the maximum class size guidelines.  In such situations, the Department will re-examine the schools' staffing needs based on the projected enrolment figures.  Both of the schools in question have recently submitted projected enrolment figures suggesting increases for the forthcoming school year.  These submissions are currently being examined in the Department to determine whether revised staffing arrangements are required.  If it is the case that new enrolments would push them above the agreed <Col N="1393" /> guidelines this will be attended to as it is in all such cases.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for extending his stay in the House.  He has had a busy afternoon.</P>
      <P>I bring this matter to the attention of the House because of what appears to be a significant increase in illegal entry by Romanian citizens who are coming to Ireland through French ports, specifically Cherbourg.  Recently, a lorry driver discovered eight Romanian nationals in his truck on the Naas dual-carriageway.  Through foresight and good luck he was able to bring them to the nearest Garda station.  They are currently receiving the attention normally extended by the law enforcement agencies to those who enter the country illegally.  I understand they have applied for residency and/or political asylum.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise that I make a clear distinction between those who seek political asylum, particularly from third world countries, and others who might, in a general sense, be referred to as economic refugees.  I use that term loosely because it could well have been applied to the many Irish people who legally emigrated to the United States and who made and continue to make a significant contribution to the US economy. I use the term in order to distinguish between them and the genuine asylum seekers who are among the 5,500 cases with which the Minister is currently dealing.  These refugees seek asylum from political and social persecution.  I have every sympathy with them and support all who come to our shores seeking refuge as, in the past, the United States welcomed those who fled persecution and torture in Ireland.</P>
      <P>We are being penalised for our economic success to such an extent that criminal gangs now operate in Europe organising and encouraging people to enter this country illegally.  Not only are they encouraging people to do so but they are putting a premium on their service and charging between 500 and 700 deutschmarks or between £200 and £300 to process people through the illegal entry system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am grateful that I was able to listen to the RTÉ radio programme, &ldquo;Liveline, presented by Marian Finucane, when the lorry driver who found the immigrants spoke by telephone from Barcelona.  His account of the incident was a great help to me in framing my contribution this evening.  Not only were the eight people wearing Adidas trainers, which cost the equivalent of a week's non-contributory pension, but they were otherwise well-dressed, carrying extra clothes and had significant sums of Irish money which they had obviously acquired before they arrived here. They came through Cherbourg where they illegally entered the vehicle of the driver who then drove through the United Kingdom and crossed to Ireland.  Had he been stopped in <Col N="1394" /> Britain and his illegal cargo found, it would have been extremely difficult for him to prove to the UK authorities that he had nothing to do with them.  We know that the attitude of some elements in the UK police forces, in their dealings with Irish people, leave much to be desired.  I do not wish to dwell on that aspect of the matter but I emphasise the dangers that exist for Irish citizens caught in such a situation.  There was also the possibility of his being attacked.</P>
    <P>The immigrants told the driver that they chose Ireland because they had got information about Irish welfare services on the Internet and because they had heard that the Irish Government gave &ldquo;easy money&rdquo;.  Once such people arrive in this country they are effectively on the State payroll. That is not fair to the Irish taxpayer or to the many genuine refugees who are attempting to set up a new life for themselves and their families in this country.  Genuine refugees are being penalised through association with these other people for whom I have very little sympathy.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister give us, in broad terms, his view of this recent phenomenon?  Has he requested the French authorities to enhance security at the port of Cherbourg?  This compete lack of security appears to be unique to Cherbourg. Lorry drivers do not report a problem at other French ports.  If Cherbourg was closed to this traffic the situation would be minimised.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to a number of people who wrote and asked if I would convey to the Minister the need to streamline the immigration process.  One process involved the &ldquo;user charge system&rdquo;.  The Departments concerned are finding it difficult to provide staff resources to clear the backlog of applications.  It is suggested that the payment of certain fees would help the Government to employ more staff to employ better and more reliable services to those who need them and to establish separate immigration offices to deal with the increasing flow of immigrants.  This would help to clear the backlog and be less of a charge on the Irish exchequer.</P>
    <P>I have also been asked if the Minster could look at the possibility of rationalising the various systems currently in operation.  For example, immigration registration &mdash; green book applications &mdash; is handled by the Garda immigration office, work permit applications by the Department of Enterprise and Employment and business permit applications are handled by the Department of Justice.  There appears to be a need to look at the current processes.  I appreciate that the Minister has inherited a growing problem which would have been alien to the country five years ago.  We are in a new situation and I understand the constraints on the Minister in dealing with this growing problem.</P>
    <P>This is not about those who come to the country genuinely seeking political asylum from terror, persecution and possible death.  It is about another category of people who are being exploited by criminal elements in Europe and <Col N="1395" /> who seem to consider Ireland a soft touch for State welfare.  When one considers the calls from the social partners and politicians on the Government to respond to the needs of society and progress its policies for social inclusion, it is time we adopted a more strict approach to those who come here illegally.  If they have a genuine craft, skill or profession to offer the procedure is open to them to apply for a work permit to enter the country legally.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for having listened to my points and I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <P>I share the Senator's concerns at what appears to be a well organised activity, which not only undermines immigration controls but also represents a risk to the health of those being transported and the property abused in the course of transportation.</P>
      <P>Implementation of entry controls at the ports is a matter for the Garda, including the detection of stowaways attempting to enter the country without the necessary permission.  The Senator will be aware from the media of a number of high profile incidents recently in which persons have been caught attempting to enter in lorries.  There have been many others, indicating that the Garda, with the co-operation of drivers and haulage firms, are detecting not insignificant numbers of those entering illegally.  The Garda is working hard to tackle this problem.  I understand consideration is being given to strengthening the Garda presence at ports for immigration control purposes.</P>
      <P>In those instances where stowaways have been found on trucks they have been refused leave to land and returned to France as soon as arrangements could be made.  Persons are entitled to apply for political asylum and when they do so, the Department has specific guidelines for determining which state, under the Dublin Convention, is the appropriate one to deal with their claim.  In the type of cases the Senator is talking about that state is usually another EU country and once the process is completed the person is returned to that country for determination of his or her claim.</P>
      <P>People evade the immigration authorities which allows them to present themselves to my Department to seek asylum in circumstances where it cannot be determined with certainty whether they came through another Dublin Convention country.  In these cases the application is considered in full here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the additional resources allocated by the Government to deal with the backlog of asylum cases and to process new cases promptly are starting to have a real effect.  Since the start of May the additional staff, having <Col N="1396" /> received the appropriate training, have begun to process cases in earnest.  The initial figures on the number of interviews being held and cases processed are very promising.  Approximately 80 people per week are being given the substantive interview for asylum assessment purposes, and all persons who present themselves as seeking asylum are met and interviewed in a preliminary way by departmental staff and given a lengthy and detailed questionnaire to complete in advance of their substantive interview and assessment.</P>
    <P>This means that persons not entitled to asylum here will soon be unable to rely on administrative delays as a means of staying in the state when otherwise they would not be entitled to remain here.  The additional resources also mean that a genuine applicant can have his or her case processed more quickly and obtain recognition as a refugee within a reasonable timescale.  This point is important and I emphasise that our approach to the question of illegal entry will not affect the entitlements of someone seeking asylum.  Last month alone 11 persons were granted asylum here.</P>
    <P>My Department is keeping the entire situation under review and examining a range of additional practical measures which might assist in combating smuggling.  In this regard we are looking at the experience of other countries, including the UK, in dealing with similar situations at ports. Appropriate technological and operational techniques are being researched and evaluated and, if they appear to be of value, will be introduced in consultation with the Garda.  Contact has been made with other agencies involved in the regulation of commercial transportation with a view to reducing the abuse of legitimate hauliers' vehicles.</P>
    <P>One of the recommendations of the interdepartmental committee on immigration, asylum and related issues was that traffic in illegal immigrants be criminalised.  The Government accepted this recommendation and work on provisions for its inclusion in an illegal immigrants trafficking Bill, which will give effect to the recommendation, is at an advanced stage in my Department. It is intended that these measures will be introduced as soon as possible.  These powers will increase greatly the ability of the Garda to pursue persons involved in this trade and persons who employ illegal entrants.</P>
    <P>I confirm that the Garda has been asked to use its French police contacts to see whether the specific case of security at Cherbourg can be addressed effectively.  My Department is approaching this concern on a number of different fronts and is reviewing all its options on a constant basis.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 7.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 12 June 1998.</P>
