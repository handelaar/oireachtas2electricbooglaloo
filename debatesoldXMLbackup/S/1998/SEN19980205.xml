      <P>I have notice from Senator Seán Ryan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the closure of Mary Queen of Ireland national school, Toberburr, St. Margarets, County Dublin due to lack of heating and for the need for the school to be designated disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by Senator Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is Items 1 and 2 and statements on the abolition of the death penalty.  Item 1 is to be taken without debate.  On Item 2 the statements of each Senator are not to exceed ten minutes.  Statements on the abolition of the death penalty are to be taken at 2 p.m. and should not exceed ten minutes duration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Leader of the House allow a greater length of time for the statements on the death penalty and on homelessness?  Perhaps 15 minutes could be allowed.</P>

      <P>In Ennis last week the Director General of the Cohesion Fund, while announcing the good news about the amount of money to be spent on sanitary services throughout the State this year, which will be assisted by cohesion and Structural Funds, stated he envisaged that Ireland would have to introduce water rates to fund the sanitary services programme after 1999.  Clearly the cohesion funds for these services may disappear after 1999 and any structural funding may be <Col N="110" /> greatly diminished after 1999.  The major party in Government announced it was opposed to water charges but the junior partner has no such policy. It is a matter of public concern.  Does the Leader of the House have a response to this question raised by Senator Doyle on the Order of Business yesterday?  I hope he has discussed the matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised the need for better industrial relations.  The Leader said he would look favourably on that and I would like to hear his response.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with two issues on the Order of Business and, to take up Senator Connor's point, perhaps the Leader might consider 15 minutes for the first speaker from each group with the option of sharing time.</P>
      <P>We should also discuss the transport infrastructure. We have debated roads but we should also discuss rail travel.  A report in today's newspapers states that the Dublin-Sligo rail line is not viable but a service which is barely heated, never on time, often derailed, always uncomfortable and rarely provided with a dining car will never be viable.  People in the west should take a stand on these issues.  In any other country in Europe people can commute on a daily basis over similar distances.  They should not need to take their cars. This problem undermines our social infrastructure and the House should discuss it.  The Athlone bypass, useful as it is, cost more than it would cost to upgrade the Dublin-Sligo track to European TGV standards.  We should demand such a service for rural Ireland and hold a debate on the rail service, stock and track condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour group would prefer if ten minutes were allocated to speakers because in that case the tenth speaker waits only 90 minutes to speak.  It would be all right if a group could split up a 15 minute time slot but the tenth speaker should not have to wait for nine speakers to speak for 15 minutes each.  We will oppose the extension of speaking time for that reason.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that we should have a debate on transport infrastructure, and that the Sligo-Dublin line and other rail services should be upgraded.  In Dublin the light rail is on hold pending a new inquiry, as is the port tunnel. The country will soon no longer have Objective 1 status for European infrastructural funds so we should urgently examine where money can be spent on transport infrastructure under the present tranche, because we will have much less funds for that area on the next occasion.  We should have an early debate, with the Minister present, to find out the position on these major projects.</P>
      <P>The House should welcome the imprisonment of a north inner city drug baron, the second in a month.  He and the other man, known as &ldquo;the Boxer&rdquo;, were the main drug suppliers in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="111" /> We should pay tribute to the good work of the gardaí and of the previous and current Governments which provided the gardaí with the legislation and resources to do their job.  Perhaps RTÉ should give credit where it is due to all the participants in this House, rather than giving two interviews to one person on a news bulletin as it did on the previous occasion.  That is unprecedented on any news media and I fail to understand why it happened.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise a matter of concern which I heard on the radio this morning.  For this weekend's rugby international Iarnród Éireann is increasing its fare by £3 through the introduction of a boarding pass. People bringing their families to the match will pay not only for their tickets but also an extra £3 per person.  I thought that payment for a ticket included a seat on a bus or train.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter could be taken up with Iarnród Éireann.  The House has no function in that regard and it is not relevant to the business.  It has been my practice to allow considerable latitude on the Order of Business to the leaders of the various groups.  Yesterday I extended that latitude to all Members but today and for the remainder of the session I must insist that contributions on the Order of Business be brief and relevant to the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We know of the problems caused by death threats and intimidation in the North.  I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the death threats to Protestant ministers in my county.  We have often called for a debate on the North and death threats emanating from the North towards the South should be drawn to the Minister's attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the urgent need for a grant aided scheme for the provision of home heating, particularly for the elderly.  Some years ago there was a grants scheme for house reconstruction but the major need at present is to provide proper heating for the elderly.  They cannot afford the cost and such a grant would make a significant difference to their quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise the essential need to extend the DART to Balbriggan.  I agree with Senator O'Toole that transport policy should be debated here.  I also ask the Leader to bring to <Col N="112" /> the Minister's attention the horror felt by supporters of rugby and all other sports at the extra charge of £3 per passenger imposed by CIE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second that amendment.  I asked yesterday why the previous proposed wording for the referendum, which has been withdrawn by the Government, is still on the Order Paper as item 8.  Will the Leader indicate when the new wording will be provided for our consideration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to come to the House in the near future for a full and open debate on the funding available to community groups?  I have asked continually for such a debate for nearly a year. Some funding has been given to community groups on which local authority members are in a minority.  I question the wisdom, efficiency and viability of continuing along that path.  Will the Minister come to the House to debate this matter before the current phase of funding ends?  This would give Members an opportunity to assess the position and perhaps make recommendations. The Minister may welcome such a debate because there are rumours that changes are in the pipeline. I raised this matter on a number of occasions previously and I do not want to have to make a similar request in six months.  I do not blame anybody because I am aware of the pressure on time in terms of the number of matters raised. However, I ask the Leader to make time available for this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls of Senator O'Toole and Senator Cosgrave regarding the upgrading of the Sligo-Dublin railway line. County Donegal is not fortunate enough to have a railway.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is upgrading the local government system and I ask the Leader to invite him to the House to discuss the effectiveness of the National Roads Authority and particularly the funding available for secondary roads.  The level of funding for this year was announced recently and while I welcome the total amount made available for County Donegal, £8 million will be spent on one stretch of road.  I criticise the sum of £900,000 made available to upgrade the M56 which covers in excess of 100 miles between Donegal town and Letterkenny.  Calls have been made over many years for the upgrading of this <Col N="113" /> road.  It covers the most scenic part of the coast and the Minister should come to the House and outline the up to date position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when a revised Electoral Bill will be produced?  I understand the Electoral Act is proving so unsatisfactory that it must be reconsidered.  When that happens, will the Leader make every effort to ensure the Seanad is included and that, at the very least, election expenses can be discounted against income tax?  It is extraordinary that the House is not included.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister what has happened to Operation Freeflow in the city of Dublin?  It took me a great deal of time to get to the House this morning because at least 12 lorries were parked on double yellow lines on one side of O'Connell Street.  I presume there was another dozen on the other side.  The inner city business group complained loudly about the illegal operation of stalls on Moore Street yet it is happy to flagrantly break the law every morning. Will the Leader ask the relevant Minister why it is tolerable for business people to treat the capital city as a provincial market town?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by my colleague from the Labour Party who raised the position regarding the Amsterdam Treaty.  I raised this matter yesterday because I understood it had been dropped from the Dáil Order Paper. However, precisely the same wording, about which disquiet has been expressed, is used on the Seanad Order Paper.  I understood the Taoiseach agreed to drop the section giving a blank cheque to Government.  This is guaranteed to cause problems for the parties supporting the Amsterdam Treaty if it continues.  Will the Leader outline the position?  Is it that there has not been time to remove it from the Seanad Order Paper?  Is it an oversight or is there a deliberate political will to retain the section, which the other House found unsatisfactory, for presentation to the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the remarks regarding the Dublin-Sligo railway line.  Will the Leader provide time for a debate with the relevant Minister to discuss a national strategy for railways?  In the light of increasing investment in the European railway system, the bodies charged with investment in Ireland need scrutiny, specifically with regard to the Mullingar to Sligo part of the Dublin-Sligo line.  Serious concern is being expressed by business and other interests in the north-west at what is perceived to be a neglect of the line.  This is irrespective of the assurances of <Col N="114" /> various bodies that investment is ongoing.  That may be the case but it is significantly lower on the Mullingar to Sligo section in comparison to the Dublin to Mullingar section.  It involves pennies as against hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>This is unacceptable in the context of Senator Bonner's remarks about infrastructural deficiencies in County Donegal.  The Border region generally has been the subject of abysmal neglect at official level in Ireland and at European level. The people in my area will no longer accept this second class citizenship.  It is past time that the various reports which point out the serious inefficiencies in the Border and north-west region were addressed.  There should be a debate in the House on whether there is a national strategy for railway development.</P>
      <P>Senator Chambers referred yesterday to the report which was published before Christmas by the National Economic and Social Council.  This deals with the points I raised.  There will be serious implications if the Government takes on board the report's recommendations which are saying that there is no longer a future for rural Ireland and there should be growth centres throughout the north-west, the west and other depopulated areas.  It concludes that there is no longer a future for those who wish to live in the areas in which they grew up because they are too small.  The report has serious implications and the House should have an opportunity to debate it.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Cathaoirleach clarified the position that the House does not have much say in relation to the penal tax which has been imposed by Iarnród Éireann.  A similar position has developed with regard to Telecom Éireann which has imposed a 40p charge on mobile telephone users.</P>

      <P>As a resident of an area which Senator Norris would probably regard as a mere provincial market town, I believe the Chamber is a forum for national issues.  I am fed up with Dublin provincialism in the House.  Dublin is not the only place with traffic problems.  The fact that it happens in Dublin and inconveniences Members travelling to the House is a coincidence.  It has nothing to do with national policy.  If Members want to discuss traffic in general, a debate should be arranged.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole raised a valid point.  I have a serious question for the Government.  How are some of the rumours about the view being taken of rail travel reconcilable with the alleged commitment to sustainable development which is supposed to be part of every decision in every area?  There cannot be sustainable economic development if rail travel is run down in favour of road travel.  This is the fundamental aspect of the issue.  This is what should be debated, not a traffic jam on O'Connell Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on the rail service.  I live a short distance from the Sligo line.  I also support the call on the relevant Minister to come to the House to discuss the issue because it is time something was done.</P>
      <P>I wish to compliment all those associated with the improvement in conditions for Members but we should spare a thought for those who elected us, the members of local authorities.  I refer particularly to those with certain disabilities who cannot write.  They should receive secretarial assistance.  There are not many people involved so the cost would not be great.  I am sure Senators share my concerns and they should be conveyed to the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who has shown an abiding interest in the welfare of local representatives.</P>

      <P>Prior to Christmas it was agreed in principle that an all-party delegation from the House would visit St. Ita's Hospital to assess the progress made there.  A delegation comprising those parties who wish to attend should be formed, as agreed.</P>
      <P>It is a scandal that so many people must wait for taxis, especially in Dublin, when there are taxis which cost £24,000 sitting idle.  Political football is being played with the taxi issue between the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Garda and the Chief State Solicitors Office.  The Leader should seek to ensure that these taxis can operate.  Those who own them are not earning a living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="116" /> The events at Ryanair were raised in the House yesterday.  I welcome the Bill put forward by Deputy Broughan in the Dáil on trade union recognition.  Will the Leader afford the House an opportunity to discuss trade union recognition in Ireland?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken before of my concern at the policy of some of the major UK retail multiples who have come to Ireland, Marks and Spencer and Tesco in particular, of buying so little in Ireland.  This has a great impact on small Irish food producing firms.  There was a news report last night that Tesco in England is boasting proudly that it sells only British beef, not Irish beef although it is cheaper &mdash; it may import some beef for burgers.  This does nothing for the image of Irish beef.  Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the impact of these major retail firms on small Irish food businesses and on the beef industry?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the requests on speaking time and the proposals I made, I had to keep in mind that today's Order of Business had to be changed because of the many requests for statements on the death penalty.  With the permission of the House I propose 12 minutes for principal spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers, with Senators allowed to share time.  I bear in mind Senator Costello's request in that arrangement.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor expressed concerns about water charges.  The Local Government (Funding) Bill will be before the House in the coming weeks and the matter might be discussed with the Minister in that context.  Given the volume of requests for debates on various issues, the requests will have to be accommodated in Private Members' time, during discussions on Bills before the House or in two to three hour debates.</P>

      <P>I have indicated to the leaders of the groups that it is our intention to sit on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and to sit four days in some weeks because there is so much legislation to come before the House.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, O'Dowd, Mooney, Brendan Ryan, Costello, Glynn and Bonner expressed concern about public transport, and the rail service in particular.  I will arrange time for a discussion at the earliest opportunity, particularly to address the Dublin to Sligo line which has been in decline for many years.  In the previous Seanad I was Fianna Fáil spokesman on transport and I am aware of the historic lack of investment in this line.  I will arrange a debate at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello expressed his views on the north inner city.  Senator Norris expressed his interest in traffic flows in the city.  I have seen an improvement in the north inner city.  I welcome the large investment of about £70 million announced by the Taoiseach for that area, which <Col N="117" /> has fared badly in the economic boom.  I am sure all public representatives from the north inner city welcome the investment.  I use O'Connell Street every morning and the traffic lights are only green for 30 seconds while the lights on the quays going west to east are green for a minute and a half.  That is the problem on O'Connell Street.  Perhaps it is pre-planned to discourage motorists from using O'Connell Street.  It now takes a minimum of 20 minutes to come through O'Connell Street.  Perhaps the local authority would let the local representatives know if this is a planned arrangement.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard expressed concern about the Iarnród Éireann price increase.  We share that concern.  However, we must respect the Cathaoirleach's ruling that it is an operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.  The Senator also referred to the death threats issued in the Border region.  The House agrees with her sentiments in this regard. I hope to arrange a general debate on foreign affairs at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd raised the issue of grants for senior citizens to install heating systems in their homes.  I support his point and we might bring it to the attention of the Minister when he is in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara proposed an amendment to the Order of Business.  I have considered this at some length.  I do not wish a situation to develop in which Senators put six or seven different Bills before the House &mdash; that is the job of Government. However, as a gesture of goodwill to the new Senator I agree to her amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan commented on the value for money of funds allocated to communities.  The Senator has been making this request for the last 12 months and I will arrange a debate on this issue within the next four weeks.  Many Members would wish to contribute to such a debate and now is an opportune time to do so.  Senator Bonner called for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  We had such a debate two months ago during which the Minister gave a thorough overview of the NRA's plans for the coming year.  I welcome the allocation given to County Westmeath.</P>
    <P>I will come back to Senator Norris today regarding his comments on the Electoral Bill.  The Senator and others made comments on the Amsterdam Treaty.  This will come before the House as soon as we have agreement between the party leaders.  I will report to the House at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senator Mooney expressed concern for rural renewal.  I hope to arrange a full day's debate on this subject at the earliest possible opportunity.  We have seen the transformation brought about by urban renewal and the uplift it has given to depressed areas in larger towns and cities.  This must be the way forward for rural renewal which is the next planned phase of Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="118" /> I concur with Senator Glynn's views and I will pass them on to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Senator Seán Ryan expressed views on St. Ita's, Portrane.  The Minister for Health and Children recently conducted a comprehensive tour of St. Ita's.  I have no problem in getting together with party leaders to arrange a fact finding visit to this institution at the earliest opportunity.  The Senator also expressed concerns about taxis.  I will be in touch with the Minister today on this matter and I will come back to the Senator immediately I have information.</P>
    <P>As a Senator elected on the Labour Panel, I would be only too pleased to arrange a debate on the success of the trade union movement and how well it works with Government.  The national understanding is the greatest example of how the trade union movement, employers and Government have worked hand in hand.  That has been the hallmark of the success of Government since 1987.  I would be only too pleased to assist Senator Henry in her call for a debate on major UK retail multiples.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to make a statement on the issue of homelessness. A person who becomes homeless experiences deprivation and social exclusion in their most extreme forms.  As the exceptional levels of growth continue in our economy, the needs of those on the margins of Irish society are rightfully at the centre of Government policy.  Provision for homelessness has improved greatly over recent years and there is greater co-operation than ever before between all of the agencies that deliver services to homeless people.  However, more needs to be done.  People still become homeless notwithstanding that there has been a consistent and long standing effort to respond to the difficulties of homelessness on the part of the voluntary agencies.  There are people who, for a variety of reasons, keep themselves apart from the assistance available to them and these we see sleeping rough, the most visible symbol of their vulnerability.</P>
      <P>It is now widely accepted that homelessness is not simply about the absence of accommodation. The causes of homelessness are complex and require complex responses.  I propose to outline the measures which my Department has put in place to address homelessness and which provide a framework for extending and deepening the response to homelessness as the need arises.  I will refer to the importance of co-ordinating the resources of the statutory and voluntary sectors. Senators will appreciate that my comments relate to adult homeless people.  The very specific needs of homeless children and young people under the age of 18 are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The factors which give rise to homelessness are many and varied.  Some people may still have an old style image of the homeless person as one who moves from place to place building contacts within various communities and receiving support from them.  This assessment of a homeless person is no longer valid.  There is no simple description of a person living outside the home.  Young adults with difficulties at home, women and children escaping from domestic violence, single or separated men, families in acute financial difficulties; can all become homeless.  In some cases the abuse <Col N="120" /> of alcohol or drugs can be the trigger which leaves somebody without a roof over their heads. Very often there is a combination of factors at work which combine to push the vulnerable person or family over the brink into homelessness.</P>
    <P>It is at this stage that the responses to homelessness, whether provided by a State agency or a voluntary body, must come into play.  The longer a person is homeless the more difficult it is to break that cycle.  The intervention must focus on providing the supports which are needed to make the period of homelessness as short as possible and must involve the combined efforts of the various agencies and bodies in providing a full range of services.  The supports may take the form of a hostel space for a short time, transitional accommodation while a person is helped to move back into society or longer term sheltered accommodation for those who may need such support. Shelter is a most basic requirement but alongside shelter will be the need for other services, such as training, health, psychological and other supports which will be needed to facilitate a homeless person's return to a more normal type of living.</P>
    <P>It is essential, therefore, that all the resources of the various State bodies and voluntary groups be maximised; that there is a commitment to co-ordinate the efforts not only of the statutory agencies but also of the voluntary agencies and to combine the efforts of the statutory and voluntary agencies.  No one agency is the sole provider of services to homeless persons nor can this ever be the case.  While local authorities have overall responsibility for accommodation, other services to homeless people, such as health and welfare, provided by other statutory agencies are equally important.  At the point where services are delivered, therefore, it is essential that there are no gaps and that no duplication of effort takes place.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, as far as accommodation is concerned, there is a good and flexible framework in place to provide a service to homeless people both directly though local authorities and indirectly through the voluntary bodies.  The voluntary sector in the form of individual local groups and the more well known bodies working throughout the country, such as the Simon Community, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and Focus, provides a reservoir of expertise and commitment which makes a huge contribution to providing services for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>The local authorities' powers to counter homelessness are broad and varied.  The most significant development for many homeless people, especially families, has been the expanded local authority and social housing programme of recent years.  The Government has made a commitment to maintain the programme at a high level.  Many homeless families have benefited directly through first time lettings in new houses or casual vacancies in existing houses.  For 1998, provision has been made for a programme of 3,900 new houses and the capital provision for the programme has again been significantly increased.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> The various social housing measures also play an important part in meeting housing needs, including those of homeless people.  The voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, in particular, is used to provide accommodation of a high standard for homeless people as well as for other categories, such as the elderly and the disabled. Since the scheme was introduced in 1988, £37 million has been paid in respect of projects for homeless people.  The Simon Communities in Cork, Dublin and Dundalk have made use of the scheme to provide 150 units of accommodation in these areas; Focus has provided a total of 100 units of accommodation under the scheme in Dublin, Limerick and Waterford; the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has provided 71 units of accommodation in Dublin; the Salvation Army has provided 107 units of accommodation in its flagship hostel at Granby Row in Dublin and 38 units of accommodation for homeless persons have been provided by Respond in Waterford. Some of these bodies have also provided accommodation for homeless persons under the separate rental subsidy scheme funded by my Department.</P>
    <P>While the level of provision has been satisfactory, I would like to see activity expanded and I considered that there was scope to improve the terms and conditions of this and other voluntary housing measures to achieve this.  Last November, at the Irish Council for Social Housing Conference in Galway, I announced a comprehensive package of improvements, including improvements to the capital assistance scheme, with a view to making the scheme as attractive as possible to voluntary bodies providing accommodation for homeless people and other groups.  The scheme has focused on special housing needs and the improvements will, I hope, result in an increased uptake of funding under the scheme and the provision of more accommodation suitable for homeless persons.</P>
    <P>In addition to the availability of capital funding to provide accommodation, the need exists to provide more direct assistance to homeless people and the bodies working on their behalf. Funding is needed to allow voluntary bodies to run their organisations and, in this regard, my Department makes an annual grant to a number of voluntary bodies, including Focus and the Simon Community National Office, who work on behalf of homeless persons.  Funding is needed to help run hostels and provide emergency accommodation and to support the provision of accommodation referral services which are directly availed of by homeless persons.  The mechanism used for these purposes is section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
    <P>Local authorities have extensive powers under the Act to provide assistance to homeless persons and to the bodies working on their behalf, outside the traditional response of local authority housing. This can take the form of funding emergency bed and breakfast accommodation, funding the provision by voluntary bodies of accommodation <Col N="122" /> and resettlement services for homeless persons and, in the Dublin region, funding homeless persons, the refugee units and the homeless initiative which I will mention later.  In practice, health boards, which provide income support for homeless persons, are often involved in arranging accommodation for homeless persons so that in many areas combined arrangements involving the local authorities, health boards and voluntary bodies are in operation.</P>
    <P>The powers of local authorities of which I have spoken are very extensive in nature and my Department has consistently stressed to authorities that they must use these powers to the fullest extent possible.  Their use in a flexible way by authorities has increased over the years.  Under the terms of the Act, 90 per cent of expenditure by local authorities in relation to homelessness can be recouped from my Department.  As an indication of the extent to which authorities use their powers, the level of recoupment payable by my Department has increased significantly since the first years of operation of the provisions, from £7,000 in 1989 to £6 million in 1997.</P>
    <P>While a proportion of the 1997 funding relates to emergency accommodation for asylum seekers in the Dublin area, the level of increase in the provision for homelessness is still striking.  In 1997, for example, my Department recouped to various local authorities £307,000 in respect of payments to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, £145,000 in respect of payments to the Simon Community, £163,000 in respect of payments to Focus and £500,000 in respect of payments to the Salvation Army.  These payments to voluntary bodies are a crucial contribution to their capacity to respond effectively to the accommodation needs of homeless people.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to Dublin where the incidence of homelessness is different to the rest of the country.  Dublin has about two-thirds of the national homeless population.  As the largest urban centre in the country, it will naturally have a greater number of homeless persons and, as the capital, it may attract vulnerable people from other areas, especially the surrounding counties, who will see some hope of a better life in the city.</P>
    <P>Specific aspects of homelessness in Dublin are putting pressure on available emergency and hostel accommodation.  Drug addicts are making use of shelters and hostels.  These can be a disruptive influence in hostels, discouraging other homeless people from using them.  Another significant pressure on emergency bed and breakfast accommodation, and, indeed, on the lowest end of the private rented sector, is the large number of asylum seekers in the Dublin area.  These are classified as homeless and are placed in emergency accommodation until they move into rented accommodation.  Dublin Corporation and the health board are monitoring this situation closely to ensure that there is always some form of accommodation available to homeless people who need it and are developing proposals to <Col N="123" /> upgrade homeless services and to increase accommodation in the city.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of the greater incidence of homelessness, the Dublin local authorities and the Eastern Health Board have special arrangements in place to ensure that services are accessible to homeless persons.  These include the operation of a drop-in daytime accommodation referral service and a 'phone-in referral service at night and at weekends.  Dublin Corporation provides transitional and emergency accommodation at their premises at Mapel House on the North Circular Road and Marlborough Place and are upgrading their existing hostel at the Model Lodging House.</P>
    <P>Capital funding for this is being provided by my Department.  We know that the demand for emergency accommodation increases when the weather disimproves and, for this reason, Dublin Corporation has put in place a &ldquo;cold weather strategy&rdquo; which aims to increase the numbers of short-term emergency beds available in hostels throughout the city and which monitors the numbers of people sleeping rough to ensure that no one who wants one is without a bed for the night. There are, of course, a small number of homeless persons who do not wish to avail of any such services and continue to sleep rough.  This does not mean that they can be lost sight of.  Efforts must be made to keep options open to them and this is what the corporation and other bodies are doing.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the scale of homelessness in the Dublin area compared to other regions, the Dublin homeless initiative was established in late 1996 to secure better co-ordination and delivery of services for homeless people in the Eastern Health Board region covering Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  It has a particular role in ensuring the development of responses which will enable homeless people to become settled and move out of the cycle of homelessness.  The aim is to achieve this through the development of an effective partnership between all the agencies involved in service provision for homeless people, both statutory and voluntary.  A separate administrative structure has been established jointly between Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board to oversee and co-ordinate the provision of services.  There is a management group comprising senior officials of Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board, a consultative board comprising representatives of the housing authorities in the region, the Eastern Health Board and the voluntary bodies in the region who provide services for the homeless.  An administrative director has been appointed by the management group to co-ordinate the work of the initiative. The initiative receives its funding from Dublin Corporation which, in turn, is recouped by my Department and the Department of Health and Children.  Its total expenditure in 1997 was £600,000.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the initiative is making an important contribution to the provision of homeless <Col N="124" /> services in the Dublin area by building links and co-operation between all of the bodies involved, by defining the needs of homeless people and by taking a strategic view of how services should develop.  It has taken a particular interest in resettlement issues and is ensuring that the funding available to it is effectively channelled.</P>
    <P>The concept of partnership is, I believe, the main strength of the Dublin homeless initiative. It is a feature of the delivery of homeless services which underlines the value of a properly co-ordinated response.  I am not yet sure that the full administrative arrangements of the Dublin initiative would be warranted across other health board areas because the incidence of homelessness is so much less than in the Dublin area.  All local authorities have been asked to develop strong links at local level with the health board and voluntary bodies working in their areas.  Co-ordination is already a feature of the services delivered locally to homeless people.  Nevertheless, there is scope for enhanced co-operation between the statutory and voluntary sectors in some other areas, more particularly in the major cities, to ensure that the needs of homeless people are recognised and tackled in a co-ordinated way.  I am arranging to have this aspect pursued with the authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to touch briefly on the question of the numbers of homeless persons, an aspect of homelessness which is the subject of much discussion among the bodies providing services. Local authorities carry out assessments of homelessness alongside their periodic assessments of housing need.  Three such assessments have taken place and the next assessment is due in March 1999.  There has been some criticism in the past that the method of assessing homelessness, that is, by way of a count on a specific day, understates the extent of the problem and that the situation would be more accurately reflected by quantifying the flow of homeless persons seeking accommodation over a period of time.</P>
    <P>The Economic and Social Research Institute considered this matter in its analysis of the results of the 1993 housing needs assessment.  It concluded that a method other than a count would be elaborate, expensive and statistically uncertain. However, it suggested certain improvements in the existing procedures which were carried into the 1996 assessment and which resulted in a more accurate picture of the extent of homelessness in each local authority area.  I am, however, conscious of the need to further improve the reliability of the local authority assessments on homelessness.  This is among the aspects to which I shall be giving special attention in the preparation of guidelines and so on for local authorities on the next assessment.</P>
    <P>In view of the greater scale of homelessness which exists in the Dublin region, I am considering, in conjunction with Dublin Corporation and the Dublin homeless initiative, whether a separate assessment of homelessness, making use of <Col N="125" /> different assessment techniques, is warranted in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater and more well informed response to homelessness now than ever before.  Very often there is no quick or easy solution.  As I said earlier, accommodation, while meeting an immediate need, will not, in every case, deal with the overall problem.  Other factors such as unemployment, family breakdown, alcohol or drug addiction are often involved.  The Government's Action Programme for the Millennium includes a commitment to assessing the accommodation needs of people suffering from mental disability and autism.  While this is largely met through the State and voluntary care services, there may be instances where the accommodation needs of some people with less severe mental disability may not be recognised as, for example, in the case of adult children being cared for by elderly parents.  This will require an integrated approach by the local authority and the health board to provide specially adapted facilities where necessary and to facilitate community services involvement.  I am, therefore, arranging for discussions with the Department of Health and Children to ensure that these accommodation needs are adequately assessed and provision made to meet them.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the involvement of voluntary bodies in providing and operating accommodation and services for homeless people.  We are very fortunate, in this country, to have so many voluntary bodies dedicated to improving the living conditions of less well off people.  The development of the social housing programmes in recent years has increased the importance and significance of the voluntary sector contribution. Last year I visited a number of hostels in the Dublin area to see the accommodation for myself and to discuss the position with personnel running the hostels.  I have also met many of the voluntary bodies separately and officially opened, in my home town last November, the Conference of the Irish Council for Social Housing, the representative body to which individual voluntary bodies are affiliated.  I have also visited many other places throughout the country.  On all these occasions I was very impressed not only by the whole range of involvement but also by the dedication of the personnel, voluntary or otherwise. This is something which cannot be taken for granted.  It is very important that adequate and proper support be available to sustain this involvement.  This is the basis of the social housing scheme and of the funding, capital and current, available through my Department to sustain the effort to deal with homelessness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for his statement on homelessness. When preparing notes on the new planning legislation, I compared the year 1963 with the present.  Most of us have lived through the past 35 years but it can be startling to remind ourselves how different Ireland was then to the <Col N="126" /> Ireland of today.  The population of the State in 1963 was 2.5 million compared with 3.6 million today.  In 1963, 46 per cent of the population lived in urban areas compared to almost 60 per cent today.</P>
      <P>This is a universal problem.  Cities worldwide are growing at the rate of one million people per week.  By 2025, more than two-thirds of the world's population will be living in urban areas. Many will suffer as a result of poverty, poor housing, crime, ill health and homelessness.  The threat of massive homelessness is greatest in Asia, Africa and Latin America where the population is growing fastest.  Homelessness is also a problem in developed countries.  In London, for example, life expectancy among homeless people is a mere 25 years.  The most pressing environmental, economic and social problems which we will face in the next century will occur in our cities.  Housing conditions are the root cause of homelessness and poverty.  As a capital city, Dublin is no exception to that.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government's policy document entitled &ldquo;Social Housing: The Way Ahead&rdquo; outlines a vision for housing provision with which most people would concur.  It states that the overall policy is to enable every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality which is suitable for its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, with tenure of its choice.</P>
      <P>I had difficulty in establishing the actual number of homeless people.  There are different Government assessments of the number but these figures have been challenged by many voluntary groups which deal with housing issues.  The Simon Community argues that official Government assessments have seriously underestimated the extent of homelessness because of a limited definition of the term, a flawed methodology and a lack of consultation with voluntary bodies.  I am pleased the Minister of State addressed that point in his statement, that he is conscious of the need to improve the reliability of local authority assessments of homelessness and that he is preparing guidelines for the next assessment.  That is very important.</P>
      <P>In October 1996 the Minister of State with responsibility for urban affairs introduced an initiative to combat homelessness in the Dublin region.  It aimed to put in place new arrangements for a unified approach by the statutory authorities and voluntary sector to developing services for the homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The homeless initiative was established as a result of a review of the services for homeless people carried out by the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation, in consultation with the voluntary bodies.  The review found there was a high level of service provision, ranging from emergency accommodation to food and drop-in centres, medical care and limited outreach and settlement services.  However, the provision was fragmented with no overall framework for the <Col N="127" /> planning and delivery of services, leading to inefficient and non-effective delivery.</P>
    <P>As I said, it is not possible to estimate the extent of homelessness in Dublin because the information is not readily available due to the lack of overall co-ordination of service delivery. This matter has been assessed at a number of levels by the homeless initiative to allow for the provision of more information in a systematic and ongoing way in future.</P>
    <P>Last year, Dublin Corporation assisted 1,575 homeless cases, including 800 involving women and children, at a cost of £600,000.  Under the plan, a management group of senior officials in Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board has been established to co-ordinate and deliver services to the homeless.  A consultant group has been formed representing the various authorities concerned and the various voluntary organisations.  Dublin Corporation is very aware of the need for short-term and medium term accommodation for women and families.  It is actively examining the issue with the Eastern Health Board in consultation with the voluntary bodies.</P>
    <P>Until recently hostel provision in Dublin city was considered to offer emergency accommodation for homeless people, but in practice a high proportion of the residents were permanent or semi-permanent.  In the past few years, the age group has changed from mainly 45 to 50 year olds to younger people.  Many of these people have drug problems and related health and social concerns.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been evidence of excessive demand over supply of hospital places in Dublin.  While this may appear to indicate an increase in homelessness that is not the only reason for the excessive demand.  There is a tendency now for people to stay longer in hospital, some out of preference and some because their choice of housing options has been reduced as they can no longer rent in the private sector.  The problem of excessive demand for hospital places applies equally to men, women and children.  The initiative has given priority to settlement services to address this situation.</P>
    <P>Recurring homelessness is often characterised by family breakdown, drug use, long-term psychiatric problems, lack of family support and people who are marginalised with few coping skills and who wish to live in solitariness.  There has been a recent increase in the number of people sleeping rough in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said his responsibility was for adult homelessness and that homeless children under the age of 18 years are the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. However, we must deal with teenage homelessness, an area about which I am very concerned. Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy, the president of Focus Ireland, stated that children as young as ten and 11 years are presenting to the agency for emergency services.  There is no doubt that more <Col N="128" /> teenagers and children under the age of 12 years are becoming homeless.  The number of homeless children between the ages of 12 and 16 years is increasing at a frightening rate.</P>
    <P>Sr. Stanislaus Kennedy also commented that the statistics on the number of children under 12 years and those between the ages of 12 and 18 years presenting themselves to Focus Ireland were not easily available.  She added that the exact number of homeless teenagers was likely to be higher than that shown in the statistics because many slip through the net and live rough on the streets.</P>
    <P>According to the Eastern Health Board, there are more than 40 emergency residential places, including the Focus Ireland emergency service, which are either directly managed or funded by the Eastern Health Board.  However, on any given night, there are only a few places available for emergency cases because many of them are filled for several nights at a time.  This results in children and adults being turned away and having to sleep rough.  At least 30 children have difficulty being placed and at least 160 people sleep rough on the streets of Dublin every night, a large number of whom have drug related problems, mental health problems and a large range of social and family problems which have led to their being homeless.</P>
    <P>A recent survey by the Merchant's Quay project found that 40 per cent of those sleeping rough are young women, many of whom are drug addicts.  Specific services are urgently needed to deal with this age group.</P>
    <P>A report published by Focus Ireland this year cited family violence, abuse and disputes as a significant cause of homelessness among the 18 to 25 year age group.  These statistics are a cause of concern because the report shows the number of homeless 18 year olds in Dublin increased from 362 in 1994 to 599 in 1995 and to 824 in 1996. The report also indicated that family abuse and disputes were the main reasons for young people leaving home.  In the past if a child had a problem at home he or she would usually go to an aunt or uncle.  However, that is no longer the case due to the breakdown of family traditions and neighbourhoods.</P>
    <P>If the Government is committed to a just society, and it is extraordinary that we are talking about the need for a just society at a time of substantial economic growth, it is obliged to provide substantial funding to eliminate the problem of homelessness.  If we fail to break the cycle of homelessness we will end up with the social problems which are rampant in other British and European major cities.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the voluntary organisations which provide services for the homeless.  I wish to put on record my appreciation of the Salvation Army, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community, Focus Point, the Iveagh Trust, the Legion of Mary and many other organisations that provide a large range of services for the homeless.  Some organisations provide accommodation <Col N="129" /> with varying degrees of support while others offer other services.  While I acknowledge the voluntary services receive public funding from one or more sources or State agencies, there is an obligation on the Government to be more generous in providing voluntary organisations with the funding necessary for their excellent work.</P>
    <P>In acknowledging the work of the housing initiative, especially the work and dedication of senior officials of Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board, in endeavouring to deliver these services to the homeless, I believe a more comprehensive method should be found.  I support the Simon Community in its efforts to convince the Government to appoint a commission on homelessness.  If anything is to happen as a result of this debate, this is one principle the Minister should accept.  The purpose of setting up such a commission would be to address all the issues in a comprehensive way.  Such a commission would produce a realistic assessment of the number of homeless people, where and how they live and under what conditions.  It would also examine how homelessness is linked to other poverty indicators such as unemployment, poor education, bad housing, inadequate health services and segregation.  It should also consult with the voluntary bodies and statutory organisations involved in the area, and it should especially consult with the homeless themselves.  They are a group of people who should be listened to.  This would then put in place a co-ordinated strategy for the elimination of homelessness by a set date.</P>
    <P>If this is to be achieved, the State must have the will to make it happen.  I believe that, in a time of economic prosperity, if we are to avoid the danger of establishing a two tier society with a drift towards social exclusion, there is a responsibility on Government to act quickly in support of such a measure.  This is the very least we can offer the homeless people in this time of unprecedented growth.</P>

      <P>I echo the sentiments of my colleague, Senator Doyle.  I welcome the Minister of State to the House and commend him on his comprehensive approach to what is an emotive as well as a practical problem facing society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sight of a heavily pregnant woman huddling with her husband in a dark corner of a city centre store in Dublin at Christmas brought home the reality of homelessness in the Ireland of today to many who saw those pitiful scenes on RTÉ television.  Only the most hard hearted would not have been moved by the plight of this young woman and her husband in the week we were celebrating the birth of Jesus.  It was that poignant scene, coupled with growing reports of the extent of homelessness in our affluent society, which prompted me, along with others, to call for this debate.  It is also an opportunity to commend those working to alleviate, and it is hoped eliminate, homelessness which is a blight on our society. As regards those vivid pictures on television, I <Col N="130" /> never saw any follow-up as to what happened. Given the many measures the Minister of State outlined to address problems such as those we saw on television, one wonders if the various agencies involved were approached and if they were able to respond adequately.  I hope the young couple eventually got a house, as promised by Dublin Corporation, and that a new life has now begun in our society.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle finished his contribution by referring to the various agencies involved.  I reiterate his comments.  The Minister pointed out that it is the work of the voluntary agencies, in association with Government and State agencies, which is addressing this problem and helping to alleviate it in some way.  Father Peter McVerry has been a voice crying in the wilderness for many years and is now in the mainstream of providing shelter, accommodation and encouragement not only for homeless young people but also for those suffering social problems such as child abuse and drug taking.  Other groups include the Simon Community, Focus, St. Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and the local voluntary housing groups to which the Minister referred and for which increased funding has come on stream over the past number of years.  It is to be hoped that will continue.</P>
    <P>I could not help but reflect on the involvement of the Simon Community and on our colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, whose political consciousness was raised to such an extent in his early involvement with Simon that he embarked on a political career which brought him to this House.  It is obvious from listening to Senator Ryan's contributions in the Seanad down the years that his early experiences of dealing with the homeless problem in Cork strongly influenced, and continues to influence, his political philosophy, and this is as it should be.</P>
    <P>We should be angry about homeless children and homelessness, especially in this affluent society as Senator Doyle correctly stated.  All of us who profess to be Christians in a Christian society should be outraged by scenes such as those to which I referred earlier, especially at Christmas if not at any other time of the year. These scenes can be witnessed practically every day of the week in certain parts of our cities.  It is unacceptable in a democratic society, especially in this land of plenty, that people should be without a roof over their heads.  There are those who do not wish to be housed, as the Minister pointed out, and who, for a variety of reasons, have rejected society through alcohol problems, marriage problems or simply a collapse in selfesteem. We have all seen the image of the bag lady, irrespective of what city we have been in. This is not to trivialise these unfortunate people, but if a citizen of this country desires accommodation and wishes to be part of society, there is an obligation on Government and the statutory agencies to ensure they respond adequately.  Searing criticism of successive Governments' abdication in this regard runs throughout all reports <Col N="131" /> from Simon and other agencies dealing with the homeless.  I commend the library service of the House for providing much of the information I and, I assume, Senator Doyle have received in this regard.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem relates to the overlap between various Departments which are responsible for homeless people at different ages.  As the Minister pointed out, he is present to specifically address the problem of adult homelessness, those who are defined as adult by being 18 and older. The Department of Health and Children is responsible for homeless children, while the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs is also responsible for some elements of homelessness.  The Minister of State, Deputy Molloy, is present because he is responsible for homeless people over 18.  There should be a clear and focused approach to the homelessness problem and it would be better served by ensuring that, if there is not one single Department under a Minister responsible for homelessness, there is at least co-ordination across the relevant Departments. The Minister of State touched on this in his wide-ranging address.  Perception is all in politics and it seems as if these Departments are operating either unilaterally, independently or are addressing problems on a fire brigade basis rather than in an overall co-ordinated and strategic way.  I stand to be corrected on that.</P>
    <P>I support the view of Simon that the Government should, as a matter of urgency, establish a commission on homelessness to address the problem in a comprehensive and strategic way.  One way of addressing this overlap across the various Departments is to have a clearly focused group identifying and addressing the problem of homelessness nationally.  The terms of reference of the commission could include an investigation into the extent of homelessness, because despite the evidence before our eyes, over 50 per cent of local authorities in Ireland in 1996 declared themselves completely free of homelessness.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle touched on this and the Minister of State referred to the reports of various commissions on housing needs assessments established over the past number of years.  From his remarks, the Minister is obviously not satisfied with the level of information in these reports and he stated that he believes there is a need to further improve the reliability of local authority assessments on homelessness.  I welcome that as well as the Minister of State's further statements in this regard.  It is obvious that, if we do not know the extent of a problem, we cannot adequately address it.  Some 50 per cent of local authorities said they were completely free of homelessness, but how can this statistic be reconciled with the existence in some of the areas mentioned of county homes and other facilities providing shelter to homeless people?</P>
    <P>There should be an examination of how homelessness is linked to other poverty indicators such as unemployment, poor education, bad housing, <Col N="132" /> inadequate health care and community segregation. I referred earlier to those who had opted out of society.  It is not too difficult to understand why.  If one is unemployed and middle aged with poor education and from an impoverished background, one is already operating with very severe handicaps.</P>
    <P>It is not only those in the categories I mentioned who are opting out.  Decisions taken in recent years to move long stay psychiatric patients out of hospitals to live in communities are another problem.  While this is desirable in itself, it has been grossly under-resourced, and some of the most vulnerable people in the State are now homeless.  We are often happy to point the finger at more prosperous societies such as the United States, where images of mentally handicapped patients wandering aimlessly around the streets of New York are interpreted as an object lesson in an uncaring society.  We should look at the mote in our own eye.</P>
    <P>The commission on homelessness should, among its other terms of reference, seek a response from the voluntary and statutory agencies working with homeless people and from the homeless in order to establish how their needs could be met.  That would not be an easy task, as all Members agree that the reasons for homelessness are complex, leading to complexity in the attitudes of homeless people.  Whether one can get a co-ordinated response from the homeless is a moot point, but it is worth pursuing.</P>
    <P>The Government is to be complimented on its £45 million increase for local authority and social housing in the budget.  However, we have a long way to go, as the Minister of State acknowledged. At last count there were 27,427 households still on local authority housing waiting lists, while some 3,900 houses will be completed this year, according to the Minister of State.  Consequently, housing provision continues to be inadequate, despite the Government's best efforts.</P>
    <P>Recent statistics state that owner-occupation in Ireland comprises 80 per cent of permanent and private households.  We still have an adherence to land and property.  For most of the remaining 20 per cent, ownership is not an option due to rising house prices and the consequent vulnerability of new purchasers to variations in interest rates.  I am aware that the Government is attempting to address the staggering inflationary spiral that has gripped the housing market, especially in Dublin. Figures from this year show that an average semi-detached three bedroom house in Dublin has increased in price from £60,000 in 1996 to £105,000 in 1998, a staggering increase by any standards.  While I favour the free market, this current cycle of huge increases in house prices will have to be addressed urgently.  How the Government, as the regulatory body, can do so is another question.</P>
    <P>I remember a similar cycle of house increases in London in the late 1980s.  My sister was a beneficiary of that cycle when she sold a flat in North <Col N="133" /> London for almost double what she had paid for it three years before.  However, boom leads to bust in the best managed societies.  We saw negative equity emerge in London and other British cities after the cycle of house price increases.  It is inevitable that a similar cycle of boom and bust will happen to the housing market here.  Homelessness will then be an even greater social problem than it is today.</P>
    <P>I referred to the social housing schemes operated by local authorities, but I also compliment the voluntary agencies that have provided voluntary non-profit and co-operative housing.  This sector currently provides 25 per cent of all new rented social housing in addition to the national housing stock each year.  I compliment the Minister of State on his initiatives in this area.  The recent increases in the capital assistance and rental subsidy schemes are also welcome, but it is obvious there is a need for a mechanism to fund the ongoing management and care costs of these special needs projects.</P>
    <P>Aspects of homelessness include low self esteem, not being part of society, not having a roof over one's head and not having a job or education. Another aspect is the growing number of young people turning to prostitution, especially male prostitution.  The Eastern Health Board gay men's health project showed that over one third of those surveyed were homeless at the time of research, while the majority had experienced homelessness at some point in their lives.  Drug addiction is also linked to homelessness.  The Merchant's Quay project in Dublin reported that 35 per cent of 252 drug addicts surveyed were homelessness, which is a 5 per cent increase in less than a year.</P>
    <P>Leading Irish writers were recently invited to contribute to a book published by Focus titled &ldquo;Home&rdquo;.  Nothing could be more poignant or relevant than Paul Durcan's contribution.  He identified what home meant to a group of women who did not have homes:</P>
    <P>They said being without a home meant being without safety and security, being without dignity and respect.  They were saying very clearly that a home is a place where one can feel safe and secure, warm and dry and protected, where one can be oneself, where one can rest and eat, sleep and be entertained, love and laugh, argue and cry, read a book, share a meal, watch a television programme, play an instrument, do a bit of gardening, play with the kids, have a drink, get the housework done and the bills paid, where one is at ease with oneself and with one's family and friends, without fear of intrusion or interference: &ldquo;I closed my eyes and breathed in and breathed out, It is ecstasy to breathe if you are at home in the world.  What a windfall!  A home of our own!&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak about homelessness without a sense of <i>déja vu.</i>  I keep wishing that sometime it will no longer be an issue, and we can move on.  I read the Minister of State's <Col N="134" /> speech, and he has shown a grasp of the complexities of homelessness that is to his credit.  He should not sit back too much because I will not be totally complimentary, but the range of options and issues he has identified in his speech is like reading a briefing document from the Simon Community.  He has attempted to respond to all of these matters.</P>
      <P>The problem of homelessness is first of all a human problem that the homeless must live with. Everybody is now well informed about the multiplicity of factors that contribute to somebody being homeless.  The insight into homelessness among politicians is different from 15 years ago. It is also true that a consensus has been reached on the responses that would be needed when it was, at worse, a slightly growing problem in an era of affluence.  However, the tragedy now is that this is no longer a residual issue but a growing problem.  This will have to be accepted by the political process.  The number of people sleeping on the streets is increasing again.  It had stabilised and the quality of housing and shelter was improving, to which speakers have referred.  The quality of accommodation available to homeless people in Dublin and other urban areas has improved out of all recognition in the past 15 years.  That would be wonderful if there was enough space for those living on the streets.  The fundamental problem is now quite different.</P>
      <P>When I started in the Simon Community 25 years ago, the standard of accommodation would make one cringe with embarrassment now.  The redeeming characteristic was the quality of human care.  The other providers of shelter in those days would similarly recognise that what they were doing at that time was abysmal in terms of standards.  This has changed and it is to the credit of successive Governments, the voluntary sector and the many initiatives that have been undertaken.</P>
      <P>Other things have changed, and we are beginning to create a new cycle of homelessness.  It is difficult to explain this to the Government, particularly at a time of growing affluence when more units of accommodation are being built then ever before, as happened last year.  I am speaking about the total number of units of accommodation built and not only local authority housing. I understand local authorities provide accommodation through acquisition as well as building. The record level of building should be beneficial, but this is where the problem arises and why a speech which I would like to have been entirely positive must include a very rancorous note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half the large number of accommodation units provided last year were built by what are euphemistically referred to as speculators and investors.  It is clear that half the units were not bought directly by couples or individuals who needed accommodation, but by people who needed or wanted to make money.  It is out of fashion, and perhaps not a good idea, to criticise people who want to make money.  However, the effect of large scale speculative investment in the <Col N="135" /> housing market is beginning to cause the crisis of people living on the streets.  Increasing numbers of people are living on the streets because they cannot get accommodation.  These people move into what are meant to be temporary emergency shelters because they cannot find alternative accommodation.  We are spending increasing amounts of money on resettlement and other programmes, but people cannot be resettled if there is no accommodation available.  This is what is happening.  People will not be resettled because of the rapidly diminishing supply of affordable accommodation.</P>
    <P>The vast bulk of speculative investment in the housing market is not being geared towards the bottom of the market or low cost housing.  The fundamental thrust of public housing policy ought to be to maximise the development of low cost, affordable housing.  It is a matter of indifference as to whether this is provided in the private or public sector once it is low cost, secure and good quality housing in which people have secure tenancy.</P>
    <P>It is astonishing that a tenant who meets the conditions of tenancy can be ejected at a month's notice for no reason other than the inconvenience of a landlord.  This is outrageous and flies in the face of any attempt to draw up a coherent housing policy.  The tragedy for homeless people and the State is that, because of the way in which the housing market is loaded, low cost housing is becoming a thing of the past.  Unavailability of low cost housing will result in the unemployed, the disadvantaged and the handicapped scrabbling for a limited amount of housing provided by well intentioned voluntary organisations, such as that with which I am associated.  They cannot beat the market.  The tragedy is that the Government, in the last budget, did the opposite of what was required in terms of ensuring the market is geared towards the provision of cheaper housing.</P>
    <P>The halving of capital gains tax was the most scandalous decision of a Government in recent years.  It guaranteed a flood of speculative money into the housing market.  People now pay less capital gains on outrageous profits than the average working person pays on his or her income.  I have no reason to believe there was any economic logic or human compassion behind that decision which amounted to a speculator's pay off.  There will be no substantial reduction in the terrifying growth in house prices as long as it is possible to make huge capital gains from speculative investment in housing at minimal tax rates.  This is the real issue which should be addressed by the Government.</P>
    <P>We remember the variety of responses to the budget, one organisation describing it as the worst in ten years.  Other voluntary organisations dealing with poor people described it as an outrage. I do not believe that all the initiatives listed by the Minister in his speech, worthy though they are, will be any more than a straw in the wind if the housing market is pushed in the opposite way <Col N="136" /> to which it must go if accommodation is to be provided for people with limited means.</P>
    <P>Society must be suffering from collective insanity if it allows a situation to develop in which a young couple with a combined income of £100,000 have difficulty finding accommodation which they can afford, as was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> during the week.  It was extraordinarily unjust in a social context and economically insane to introduce a budget which made that situation worse.  This is the wrong time to reduce capital gains tax in the property market.  Perhaps there would be a case for doing so at the height of a recession.  However, to hand over 20 per cent of the speculative gains, with no contribution to society whatsoever, at the height of the biggest house price boom in the history of the State, was the most economically irresponsible decision a Government took since the splurge of borrowing in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  It would not matter if I was only talking about economic policy. However, the consequence of this decision, which can be seen on the streets of Dublin, is that there is nowhere for poor people to go.  Local authority housing is limited and often not accessible to homeless people.  Low cost rented accommodation is becoming a thing of the past.  Where are the people going to go?  We can build wonderful hostels and have all the projects we want, and we can spend money on funding resettlement officers in every voluntary organisation in the State, but we will have spiralling homelessness if a place is not provided for people on low incomes.</P>
    <P>The phenomenon of people at work being homeless, already common in the US, will become evident here because they will not be able to afford accommodation.  This is the core of the issue.  Many wonderful things have been done in response to the problem of homelessness but they will count for nought if the present daft policies on the funding of housing and the provision of tax breaks for investment in housing continue. We are moving toward a situation where nobody will be able to afford accommodation unless they have the type of affluent, well paid job which I have.  This is not what society wants and I do not believe it is what the Minister wants.  However, the Government of which he is a part, has taken a decision which will do this.  It is a general concern among the voluntary sector that housing is becoming unaffordable for poor people.  This issue needs to be tackled.</P>
    <P>All the other measures are necessary, but without an increasing supply of affordable accommodation of reasonable quality with reasonable security of tenancy, they will be meaningless.  I appeal to the Government to address this issue before it runs out of time and before we have a New York scale crisis on the streets.  It should turn the market around and cause it, through a combination of incentives, taxation measures and refocused grant aid, to focus on the bottom end where the need is greatest, the supply is least and <Col N="137" /> where those in the market can least afford to pay astronomical prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  It is the second time in two months he has been here and on each occasion he has demonstrated that he has a thorough understanding of the problems in relation to housing and what needs to be done.  He has an informed and conscientious approach to homelessness, which is a good starting point for this debate.  When we talk about homelessness, we narrow it down to the issue of housing and specific cases.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to what Senator Brendan Ryan said which was valid in the wider context. However, the problem of homelessness, particularly among the young, must be analysed in more detail if we are to establish the factors which have made these young people homeless. We must first understand that none of these young people was born homeless.  As we begin to investigate the problem, particularly as it pertains to young people, we must analyse the factors which have driven these people out of their homes onto the streets, into the shelters and in search of a home other than that into which they were born.</P>
      <P>There is no more visible a manifestation of poverty than to see people sleeping rough on the streets.  More than anything else, it pricks our consciousness and makes us believe there must be a greater response than that in place.  It was particularly shocking at Christmas when there was so much evidence of wealth and disposable income in every city, town and village.  There has never been such a spending spree.  On the other side of the coin, there was the sad spectacle of people, and often very young people, sleeping rough on the streets in every city and in many towns.  I have seen girls as young as nine years of age sleeping rough on the streets of my city.  That is a frightening indictment of our society and it must be the dark underbelly of the Celtic tiger.</P>
      <P>It is an issue which demands a more planned and thought out response than that which has been provided to date.  That is not in any way not to acknowledge the good work done by the voluntary groups dealing with homelessness, including Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, St. Vincent de Paul, Respond and the other groups which work with might and main to try to do something to help the homeless, and the efforts being made by this and previous Ministers and the Department.  Clearly, what has been done to date is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the start of another new year and with two years to the millennium, we, as a society, must say that homelessness is not acceptable.  It is a problem which can be solved and, in the case of young people, it is one which should be prevented.  In the light of all the information we have, we need a new planned national strategy, a point to which I will return later.  The starting point of that strategy should be the prevention of <Col N="138" /> homelessness at all costs, particularly among the young.</P>
    <P>I asked most of the groups that deal with homelessness to give me a breakdown of the age profile of homeless people.  There was a time when we thought of homeless in terms of unfortunate people who had been in mental institutions and who, as a result of a policy of integration in the community, were discharged into the community. In many cases, proper provision was not made for these people and they became homeless very early on.  Many of these were middle aged men, which we thought appalling.</P>
    <P>I asked Focus Ireland for the age breakdown of people who presented and asked for assistance and services.  In 1996 statistics show that of the 5,850 people who visited its services division 84.5 per cent were under 40 years of age and 50 per cent were under 26 years of age.  In 1994, 352 people who presented were under 18 years of age &mdash; a statistic which terrifies me.  This figure has increased to 1,362 in 1995 and to 2,070 in 1996. The number of people under 18 years of age presenting has increased sixfold between 1994 and 1996.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he does not have responsibility for people under 18 years of age.  It is a pity the Minister with responsibility for children was not present at this morning's debate.  While we must be concerned about homelessness no matter what the age of the homeless person, we must be particularly concerned about the vulnerability of young people who are cast out or who cast themselves out onto the streets.  These vulnerable young people are prey to every type of exploitation, whether drugs, prostitution, etc; and are exposed to the evil which stalks our streets at night.  I ask the Minister to confer with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, speak up in Government and ask specifically for a new initiative to deal with homelessness among teenagers and children.</P>
    <P>This problem requires a different level of response to that which we give to homeless adults.  These young people need a great deal more than a roof over their heads.  The younger children need to be at school.  They need education, training and to be nurtured and reared. They also need the services of a multiplicity of agencies to enable them to make a decent living for themselves in later years.  That should be our aim.  This problem calls for a different level of response and I ask the Minister to confer with the relevant Minister in respect of this part of problem and to make it a particular project.  I would like us to invite the Minister with responsibility for children to come to the House to outline what he proposes to do to tackle this element of homelessness. Young people are missing school and nobody knows where they are or what is happening to them during the day.  They are on the streets.  There is no proper tracking system for these young people and they are the homeless who are most at risk.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister of State to discuss this issue with the Government.  A tracking system is necessary for the earliest possible detection of young people who are at risk.  The aim must be early intervention and prevention.  Young people under 18 years of age should not be in the homeless category.  That point must be emphasised, even if it is outside the parameters of this debate.</P>
      <P>A planned national strategy to deal with homelessness is necessary.  I agree with previous speakers that a commission should be established.  This has also be recommended by Simon, an organisation with vast experience in dealing with this problem.  Its recommendations deserve an audience and should not be taken lightly.  A commission on homelessness would be a valuable starting point.  We must also establish the extent of homelessness and its nature and scale.  I am not satisfied that surveys carried out by local authorities give us the type of accurate information we need to enable us to tackle the problem in the correct manner.</P>
      <P>The national strategy should have a clearly defined action programme and a timeframe whereby we would be able to make a commitment that five years hence, homelessness will no longer be a factor in society.  That is not an impossible objective.</P>

      <P>I hope the statements on homelessness, whether they are within or outside the Minister of State's remit, will be taken on board. Homelessness is a complex issue which, unfortunately, covers a broad spectrum of society.  There is little disagreement among the political parties about this issue as all are concerned with trying to promote solutions to it.</P>
      <P>When I was growing up in Dublin there was plenty of poverty but no homelessness.  Now we have, to a great extent, cured the problem of poverty but we have been unable to cure other social ills.  Instead, the incidence of homelessness is increasing.  At this stage it is evident that our high-minded notions of community care have not worked.  Indeed, community care has, in some cases, become community neglect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main categories of homeless people, those who are homeless in the strict sense of not having a house, such as those on the housing lists, and people who are homeless through choice, in so far as all other choices have been removed.  With regard to people who do not have a house and do not have the income to secure one, the Minister of State should be mindful of the unrealistic number of housing starts.  I am not seeking to make a party political point in this regard.  The council in my area has 1,700 applicants on its housing waiting list but has permission for only 105 housing starts.  That will house about 8 per cent of the applicants.  The council is also constrained by the fact that applicants for local authority housing have low levels <Col N="140" /> of income relative to the current cost of purchasing a house.  People are given unrealistic expectations of being housed by our refusal to admit that there is a major housing crisis, particularly in the greater Dublin and other urban areas, as a result of the lack of affordable housing for young people.</P>
    <P>The remit of the Minister of State does not extend to young homeless people but one should not categorise people who lie in doorways by age. All can be described as homeless people who have fallen through the net of normal society and apparently cannot cope with the problem of finding somewhere to live.  I agree with Senator Quill that the reasons for this problem are myriad and complex.  They usually arise from a lack of parenting skills.  In my electoral area it is not unknown for children of six years of age to live rough, even though their parents possess a house. The lack of control is so severe that children of this age only feel obliged to come home when they are tired or hungry.</P>
    <P>School attendance records in the same area are unbelievably dreadful.  Some children have never attended school.  It is a short step from truancy to homelessness when there are no supports and no need to clock in, as it were, at home or at school. That problem could be alleviated greatly by the obvious measure of appointing school attendance officers, a measure which has not been taken in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">
      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate is about homeless adults, not children.  Homeless children will, I hope, be debated on another occasion.  The Minister of State cannot deal with the problem of homeless children as it is not within his remit.</P>

      <P>I am sure he will undertake to convey our comments to the relevant Minister.  His speech was about homelessness in general and, with respect to the Chair, if the Minister of State does not object I must refer to an issue that has great relevance.</P>
      <P>The purpose of our statements today is to underline the gravity of this issue.  We should not categorise it.  I mean no disrespect to the Chair. Large urban areas with populations of up to 20,000 people never had school attendance officers because they were in the county area and were considered to be rural.  Such areas had to rely on the Garda Síochána to monitor school attendance.  That was a ludicrous policy because the gardaí in those areas were hard pressed to carry out their own work not to mind carry out additional tasks.  We allowed many children whose parents, for whatever reason, were not fulfilling their duties to slip through the net.  They are the children who are now on the streets.</P>

    <P>I want to think positively about solving the problem.  It is very distressing to see people of any age lying in a doorway, no matter what time of year it is.  When I was young I read a book called <i>Children of the Sun.</i>  It was about homeless children in Naples.  At night they would lie on the <Col N="141" /> gratings over the bakeries.  At least during the day the sun shone, our homeless do not even have that.</P>
    <P>I support the Simon Community's request for a commission on homelessness.  That the Acting Chairman drew our attention to the division of the brief for homelessness makes the point more strongly for the need for a single Department to cope with this grave social issue.  I hope the Minister will give us some direction on this in his response.  It is ridiculous that there are separate Departments dealing with a problem which is growing daily.</P>
    <P>The new docklands project will include a 20 per cent social housing concept.  In view of the vast profits made by developers, if they put something back into the local authorities they should not be begrudged their profits.  That is the way building developments should be conditioned in future. Instead of ghettoising people by having entire areas of local authority housing, we should have a 20 per cent social housing programme in any future developments.</P>
    <P>I appreciate none of us have the answer to the problem but our comments are aimed solely to assist.  Perhaps the Minister might take on board the majority desire for a commission on homelessness and the need for this issue to be addressed by a single Department.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I commend him on his efforts to tackle this serious problem.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is no longer a problem which is confined to the urban areas.  The sight of men, women and children wrapped in a blanket in a doorway is an ever increasing problem in our city centres.  The more affluent society becomes the greater the extent of homelessness.</P>
      <P>It appears homelessness deals specifically with people lying in doorways.  How is homelessness quantified?  Is it only those who have no roof over their heads who are categorised or do we include people who are no longer able to afford rent or mortgage payments who are living with family or friends?  Do we consider women and children seeking refuge from domestic violence in shelters, even if it is only for a short time?  There has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of women and children seeking refuge from domestic violence. When are they considered homeless?  We concentrate solely on those who are on the streets.  There are many more people who could be described as homeless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Homelessness does not happen in isolation.  It is the extreme form of poverty, often associated with unemployment, low pay and educational deprivation.  Exorbitant prices for rented accommodation will add to this problem.  There is also an association with gambling, alcoholism and drug abuse.  I commend the Simon Community, St. Vincent de Paul and Focus who are so resilient in their efforts to improve the status of people who find themselves homeless.  The greatest problem these organisations face is that they are no <Col N="142" /> longer dealing with people on a short term basis. There are many long term homeless people in their emergency shelters and hostels.  The shelters in Cavan are providing long term accommodation for those living in them.  That the Simon Community and other organisations must turn people away every night is very disturbing.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State deserves credit for his attempt to tackle this problem, particularly with the increases in capital assistance and the rent subsidy schemes announced in November.  This will enable the voluntary housing movement to expand its range of sheltered housing for homeless people.  The Government is committed to continuing its programme of local authority house building and improving social housing schemes by its allocation of £45 million to these areas in the recent budget.  These measures will not eradicate homelessness but someone must put down a marker to try to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>Research indicates there are 11 homeless people in County Cavan and none in County Monaghan.  I do not believe these figures.  There may not be the visible signs of people lying in doorways, but there is no doubt that will happen in the future.  There are people who may have a roof over their heads but who have no security. House prices are of great concern.  When there is a boom it is always followed by a bust.  I am concerned this will happen.  This happened in England.  Young couples got a mortgage and within a year and a half there was an onslaught of repossessions.  There is no doubt that will happen here in the next couple of years.  These people will become homeless yet they do not come into the equation at all.</P>
    <P>My other concern is the increasing number of homeless children who find home life so intolerable that life on the street appears to be a better option.  There is nothing as sad as seeing a child sitting in a doorway in Grafton Street at 11 o'clock at night.  Childhood is supposed to be the happiest time of your life.  Children who find themselves in this situation are in a vicious circle and it is impossible for them to escape.  Children who go on the streets at ten years old are open to crime, drugs, alcoholism and child prostitution, particularly boys.  The problem is how to deal with this and if the Minister had the answer we would also.  There must be greater co-ordination between local authorities, health boards, teachers, schools and social workers to identify dysfunctional families and deal with the problems before children become homeless.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the ESRI considered quantifying the flow of homeless to be too expensive and elaborate.  Speaking from a rural perspective, the expense can be reduced by using the local authorities, which have the information about who is homeless.  Emphasis should be placed on them and on greater co-ordination between the other bodies which are essential to assessing the number of homeless.  I support the call by the Simon Community for the establishment of a commission on homelessness.  If we are serious <Col N="143" /> about tackling this problem we must consult knowledgeable people who can help.</P>
    <P>This is an ever increasing problem and my greatest worry is that many young couples with mortgages are getting in over their heads and their homes will be repossessed.  This happened to a friend of mine almost three years ago.  One starts out happy in life with a new home but sadly, may end up almost on the roadside.  I am afraid of what may occur in the coming years.  I have no doubt we will be discussing this problem in a year's time.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech focused on his Department but the plight of the homeless is an interdepartmental matter.  For that reason I will address two groups who suffer severely from homelessness, prisoners and psychiatric patients. Senator Leonard said she had not yet seen people sleeping in doorways wrapped in blankets but walking home along Baggot Street I see them all too frequently.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The plight of the homeless who go to prison is quite dreadful.  They are immediately discriminated against because many judges faced with a homeless defendant deny them bail, so they are immediately committed to prison.  Considering it costs £43,000 per year to keep someone in prison and how much it would cost to keep these people outside prison while awaiting trial, this is unfortunate not only from a civil liberties viewpoint but also from the taxpayers' viewpoint.</P>
      <P>A recent survey by Dr. Paul O'Mahony of 105 prisoners in Mountjoy found that 8 per cent were homeless and 2 per cent were sleeping rough. This is a much higher percentage than one would find in the general population, mercifully, but it shows how easy it is for homeless people to end up in prison.  The vast majority of those in prison who were categorised as homeless were there for minor offences and there was a strong possibility that they were going in and out of prison for such offences.  One must also take into account that these offences may have been associated with homelessness.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute, as others have done, to the great work done by numerous voluntary organisations, such as the Salvation Army, Simon, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Los Angeles, and individuals such as Sr. Caoimhín Ní Úallacháin O.P. of the Matt Talbot Community Trust, who deals mainly with people discharged from prison, many of whom are homeless.  She told me that people often sleep in her house because other accommodation cannot be found.  Hostels do exist but there are not enough of them and many of these people require so much support that we must consider providing sheltered private accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The probation services have great problems keeping up with these people.  They may be let <Col N="144" /> out of jail to allow the probation officer prepare a report but when they come back before the courts, the officer may not have been able to make a report because he or she was unable to keep in contact with the person involved.  It might be a good idea if two probation officers were assigned to look after the homeless who come before the courts because at the moment assignments are made on a sectoral basis and it is extremely hard to follow people who are on a nomadic pilgrimage around Dublin if a person is transferred continually between area probation officers.  We must examine this area carefully. These people need great support and they cannot get out of their predicament &mdash; they go to prison because they have no accommodation and when they get out of prison there is no accommodation for them.  This is not a huge area and we should focus on it.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to Eastern Health Board staff who make great efforts to get accommodation for these people.  However, many organisations are reluctant to give accommodation to people who are in trouble with the law and may have been involved with drugs also, as Senator Leonard and others mentioned.</P>
    <P>Many psychiatric patients who have been discharged from long-term institutional care have become homeless.  New thinking and developments in the treatment of psychiatric illness have led to far more people being discharged from mental institutions than would have been in the past.  I can do no better than quote from the <i>Report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals for the year ending 31st December, 1995,</i> the most recent report available.  These reports are excellent but are rarely, if ever, quoted in the Houses of the Oireachtas, so I will do the inspector, Mr. Dermot Walsh, the compliment of reading his words.  On community services, he writes:</P>
    <P>The decline in numbers of new long-stay patients does not necessarily reflect a decline in the incidence and prevalence of psychiatric illness as a whole.  However, it is clear that hospitalised prevalence of serious psychiatric illness has declined greatly in recent years. Patients are increasingly being cared for in settings other than in-patient care.  The growth of alternatives to hospitalisation has been referred to in previous reports.  These include an increase in the number of community-based residences and day facilities.  Nevertheless there is always the apprehension that the rate of provision may not keep pace with the decline in in-patient facilities, particularly with the phasing out of the former large mental hospitals and their replacement with short stay acute psychiatric units of small size.  By virtue of the perceived increased level of violence in our society, the rise in the number of homeless, the increasing problem of marriage breakdown and the undoubted increase in suicide rates in recent years, it becomes extremely important that alternatives to in-patient care are quantitatively and qualitative adequate so that <Col N="145" /> patients do not become homeless, do not suffer social or economic deprivation and are adequately housed and fed.  The Inspectorate visits every health board community based facility at least once every two years and reports on the condition of such premises and the quality of care delivered therein.</P>
    <P>The book contains reports on the various health board areas.</P>
    <P>This is the most vulnerable group of people and I ask the Minister to urge his Government colleagues to ensure that adequate facilities are available for patients who are discharged from psychiatric hospitals and who may all too easily, as the report shows, due to lack of quantitative and qualitative facilities become homeless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this debate on the plight of the homeless.  I, too compliment the Minister of State on the measures he has taken to combat this serious problem.  The perception of homelessness in larger areas <i>vis-á-vis</i> cardboard cities might not apply in all towns.  However, problems exist and, as the Minister of State pointed out, they are many and varied.</P>
      <P>I spoke to the Minister of State on a personal basis about this matter and I have raised it at meetings of Westmeath County Council.  Homeless people include those who do not fall into the OPD category.  Usually they are confirmed bachelors or spinsters but local authorities, in the main, do not cater for them.  Something should be done about this aspect.  Perhaps the Minister of State could liaise with local authorities and consider making an allocation.  I acknowledge that he has been very generous.</P>
      <P>This problem involves single men and women who live with their brothers or sisters.  The brother or sister gets married and the cuckoo solution comes into play.  The new in-law soon decides there is no room for the single brother or sister and he or she must move out of the house. He or she is then placed on the housing list of the local authority.  This is a problem.  It is also reflected in rural areas where farms are willed to a brother or sister.  If he or she gets married, the single brother or sister often finds himself or herself without a home.</P>
      <P>A small number of people choose to be homeless. They do not want to be housed and there is a famous example of this in Mullingar.  In the past, under the Mental Treatment Act, the community welfare officer or the local sergeant would pick up an individuals hanging about and commit them for treatment.  That day is long gone but it was one of the cures for homelessness.  Thank goodness that no longer happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the comments of Senator Henry who referred to the report of the inspector of mental hospitals.  I have worked in the psychiatric service for many years and people who have spent a long time in psychiatric institutions are taken through rehabilitation and resocialisation processes and deemed suitable for housing in community residences. <Col N="146" /> However, it must be borne in mind that this is a short term measure.  It is part of the process of ultimately placing individuals back in the community.  The homeless also include individuals who travel round the country.  They are often chronic schizophrenics and some fall into the psychopathic category.  They are admitted regularly to psychiatric hospitals.  It is difficult to deal with this category of homeless people.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the role of local authorities and health boards in combating homelessness.  I offer my praise to community welfare officers, who help through providing supplementary welfare allowance and housing and rent supplements, and housing officers.  They do their best with limited resources to combat this problem.  We are not making enough use of the voluntary housing groups.  I was involved in a couple of groups in the early part of my membership of Westmeath County Council.  They played a major role in ensuring that people who were homeless got houses.  Some of them were on very low incomes but they were told that if they achieved a certain level of savings each week and could prove a capacity to repay a financial institution, they would be deemed eligible for a loan to buy a house.  This proved most useful.</P>
    <P>I am from a rural part of Ireland and there is a small number of homeless people in rural areas. We should bear in mind the flight from the land and that everybody cannot live in town, cities and villages.  Many people want to live in rural areas rather than towns and this should be taken on board by local authorities.  There is a reticence on the part of managers to construct single dwellings in rural areas.  They articulate many reasons such dwellings should not be built.  They say that if there are two or three houses together, the people will soon seek lights, footpaths and other services.  However, people must live in rural areas as well as towns.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard referred to the serious problem of marital breakdown which lengthens housing lists.  Regrettably, marriage breakdown occurs all too often.  This means that one of the spouses will be back on the housing list seeking accommodation. This difficulty always existed but it has increased dramatically in recent years.</P>
    <P>Most of my points have already been made by other speakers.  However, much must be done to tackle the problem of homelessness.  Much can be done with the resources provided and I welcome the increased allocation.  The voluntary organisations have a pivotal role in combating homelessness and I compliment them, especially the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for its great work in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin where Senator Glynn finished by complimenting the statutory and voluntary organisations which have attempted to address the growing problem of homelessness. Many of the Simon Community's operations are in my constituency at Seán McDermott Street, Usher's Island and previously at the fire station <Col N="147" /> on Buckingham Street.  I also compliment Focus Point and Sr. Stanislaus who have a large operation in George's Hill; the Salvation Army which has 107 units for homeless men in Granby Row; Threshold which has its offices in my constituency and all the emergency shelters run by the homeless section of the Eastern Health Board.  There is a great concentration of services in my constituency and I am well acquainted with the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is a worsening problem and child homelessness is the most serious element of all. The indications are that child homelessness is increasing rapidly.  The Simon Community has given us figures which indicate that between 1995 and 1996 there was an increase of 100 per cent in the numbers of people in their teens presenting at Garda stations seeking a bed for the night.  In June 1997, a time of year when the mild weather increases the incidence of people sleeping rough, 30 per cent of the children who presented themselves for emergency accommodation were unable to find it because the health board was unable to cope.  Those children had to spend the night in Garda stations or hospitals.  That is a scandal.</P>
      <P>A survey conducted by the Merchant's Quay Project in Dublin in May last year of 252 drug addicts showed that 35 per cent of them were homeless.  Undoubtedly the sudden arrival of approximately 4,000 refugees and asylum seekers in the 1990s has put enormous strain on the emergency services and available shelter.  There is a shortage of space and that shortage has reached crisis proportions.  Senator Henry referred to the policy of moving long-stay psychiatric patients into the community without adequate support services which has created a new category of homeless.</P>
      <P>These factors combine with the difficulty faced by local authorities in the economic boom of finding suitable sites for building and the escalating cost of private rented accommodation.  So many of the marginalised and vulnerable in the community find it impossible to get reasonable accommodation and end up on the streets.  The benefits of the booming economy are not being distributed equally and it would seem that with regard to shelter the nation's children are the least cherished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present it is estimated that there are 75,000 to 100,000 people waiting for proper housing from the local authority or the health board or social housing.  Dublin Corporation estimates that it will have about 20,000 people awaiting adequate housing in 1998; its estimate for the number of homeless is 800.  The last assessment of the number of homeless carried out by Dublin Corporation was in March 1996.  At that time there were 600 counted but that was a snapshot, so to speak, on a given day which did not take into account the longer term picture and the numbers vary from time to time.  Between 1996 and 1998 it is estimated that there has been an <Col N="148" /> increase of 25 per cent in the numbers seeking housing with Dublin Corporation and a one-third increase in those seeking shelter, in other words, the homeless.</P>
    <P>The Government must recognise that there is a housing and homelessness crisis at present.  It took us a long time to address the drugs crisis and two years ago the previous Government set up a task force which produced the present blueprint to tackle the drug problem which is being successfully implemented.  A task force on homelessness must be established and we need a strategy to deal with social and local authority housing and emergency accommodation.  The Simon Community has proposed the setting up of a Government commission or task force on homelessness. The purpose of such a task force would be to determine the extent of the problem nationally.</P>
    <P>We do not know the extent of the problem because we do not have a proper definition of what constitutes homelessness.  We have not determined the various categories of people who are homeless <i>per se.</i>  The Minister of State acknowledged this problem.  He said:</P>
    <P>[The] assessment of a homeless person is no longer valid.  There is no simple description of a person living outside the home.  Young adults with difficulties at home, women and children escaping from domestic violence, single or separated men or families in acute financial difficulties can all become homeless.</P>
    <P>One could add to this list asylum seekers because they seek emergency accommodation.  We must have a clear assessment of the problem and the numbers involved.</P>
    <P>That done, we must identify the factors giving rise to the various categories of homelessness. This is where a multi-agency approach may be adopted, involving the various statutory and other agencies other than the local authorities. The local authorities will always be primary in dealing with adult homelessness and the health boards will be primary in dealing with children. However, once the factors behind homelessness have been identified the services required to combat the problem can be put in place.  It will require a multifaceted approach.</P>
    <P>A phased plan must be adopted based on a determined time schedule.  On the one hand, we have a booming economy from which some people derive an inordinately high level of prosperity while, on the other, another part of the population is being lost to the system.  The nation must decide whether it will eliminate homelessness. Any task force in this regard must have as its objective the phased elimination of homelessness. That is the only way to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>We could talk forever about various problems which exist, how sad the situation is, what wonderful charity work is being done by the various organisations and so on.  An ideal response would be a Government task force similar to that set up to combat drug abuse with the implementation <Col N="149" /> of its findings subject to a Cabinet committee.  A Cabinet committee is making the decisions on the amount of money to be spent on combating the drugs problem.  As a result of the clout given to the implementation strategy and the personnel we saw that it was possible to increase last year's budget of £1.25 million for the youth services development fund to £30 million.  The communities ravaged by the drugs problem made it clear that £1.25 million was peanuts and was making no inroads on the problem.</P>
    <P>We have a serious problem.  I recognise the importance which the Minister has attached to it and the extra money he is making available. However, there must be a single objective focus through a phased plan.  This could be achieved by establishing a commission or task force, followed by an implementation strategy to ensure that results are produced.</P>

Tá sé soiléir freisin go bhfuil ar a chumas agus go bhfuil sé i gceist aige cabhrú leis na daoine seo tré polasaí dearfa an Rialtais a mhúnlú agus a dhíreadh ina dtreo.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his informative statement. It was underpinned by a deep sense of humanity which one would expect from him.  It was reassuring to hear the Minister's comments on his first hand experience of seeing the difficulties which the homeless face.  Senators of a particular age can recollect reciting a poem about the old woman of the roads.  We can also remember the hunger of spirit she experienced at not having a home and what it would mean for her to have one.  It would mean an end to isolation and deprivation. She would no longer be a non-person subjected to the rigours of climate.</P>
      <P>Homelessness is a part of our folk memory.  We all have vivid images of the eviction times and how people, through no fault of their own, found themselves going from security to virtual helplessness. We are also inspired by the many stories of people who, through tenacity and determination, succeeded in overcoming those terrible difficulties and re-establishing security for themselves. We are inspired by historical figures who helped others at a time when they had so little resources of their own.</P>
      <P>Serving on a local authority in Tipperary 20 years ago, I recall that the perception of a priority list for housing was that one was assured of salvation once one was on such a list.  We also knew that one would serve a very long purgatory before one go a house.  One could wait for three or four terms before a house would come one's way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> There has been a vast improvement in the meantime. Three days ago I had a meeting with a delegation of diplomats from an affluent country which I will not name.  Their first impression of Ireland was that they could not understand how so many people had their own houses, whether from a local authority or in private ownership. That is not the case in their country even though it is wealthy.</P>
    <P>We are a society of contradictions.  We have achieved great affluence but we have also developed a pseudo-sophistication.  To some extent we wish to keep problems at a distance.  It is not that we will not provide money or support agencies willing to help others.  However, we do not get to know people or what causes their problems. We do not help them to make the transition from homelessness to security.  This may be a result of embarrassment.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that, for one reason of another, a minority of homeless people do not wish to be housed.  Last night I came across two homeless people wrapped in a blanket begging for money.  There was a terrible sense of frustration at how little one could do.  One could give them some money but not help them to become part of the community.  One sensed that but for voluntary organisations who are prepared to experience the harrowing incidents and despondency of the homeless on a day to day basis, we would have an exceptionally serious situation.  I compliment those bodies.  In particular I compliment the Simon Community which supplied a considerable amount of literature to Members in preparation for this debate.  However, no matter whatever affluence we achieve, so long as there is one homeless person in our midst, for whatever reason, we are not achieving our full potential as a developed society.</P>
    <P>As I travel through rural Ireland I always find it difficult to understand the number of unoccupied houses.  These houses are of all sizes, some in exceptionally good condition, but they are allowed to become dilapidated.  There is no doubt that they would be suitable to house the homeless. I am not suggesting that we take them from their owners but there should be some method of acquiring them to house the homeless.  A similar situation may apply in the city but not to the same extent.</P>
    <P>I am glad that we have had this debate.  We are dealing with the most vulnerable and marginalised section of society who require a prop, assistance, confidence and resources.  We have to contend with the perception that the homeless are also lawless.  This is not correct.  One could say the same about any section of society.  We must correct that image.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>On my way home last night I spotted homeless old gentlemen around Nassau Street.  What is homelessness in that light?  There are teenage homeless.  Are they being driven out of home?  If so, why?  Is it because of the breakdown of traditional family life, violence in the <Col N="151" /> home, major disputes or inadequate housing? Education is an important factor in addressing this aspect.  The Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs have big roles to play.  A co-ordinated effort is required.</P>
      <P>Teenage homelessness is associated with drugs, crime and being outside the mainstream of society and the normal routines enjoyed by boys and girls.  We should attempt to move the teenage homeless into sheltered hostel accommodation where they would get one to one caring and local schooling.  I speak from experience here because of the nature of my other work.  I have dealt with the matter at the coalface and have considered how best we can attract young people back into society.  They may have psychological problems in which case they will always be homeless until these problems are tackled from another angle.</P>
      <P>The other category of homeless are those who cannot live under a roof.  No matter what we do we will never include them because of an inadequacy in their makeup; many of them suffer from claustrophobia.  These people must be cared for and we need to reach out to them at a different level.  If they want open space we must ensure that it is comfortable because they may never settle under a roof, otherwise they may become involved in dangerous activities.</P>
      <P>A co-ordinated effort between local authorities, voluntary agencies, the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children is required.  Many good people want to help but we work in our domains without being aware of how others view matters.</P>

      <P>I welcome this debate.  The Minister of State has vast experience with housing and social issues.  If one was to walk down a county lane or look over a wall one would never find a body under plastic bags or living in cardboard boxes.  However, they are always found in the city.  Why do they orientate towards the city? They are found in substantial numbers in larger cities, a trend that has developed at an extraordinary rate with the growth of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Growth in the economy appears to be parallelled by the growth of the numbers who are homeless.  Why?  It should be the other way around.  I agree with Senator Ormonde in this respect.  I do not see the problem being solved in a single generation.  The roots of the difficulty reach back into the family and it is very difficult to change families and get them to be more at ease and supportive.  People from broken homes are likely to continue the cycle when they set up their own homes.  Similarly, those from violent backgrounds are likely to solve their future problems <Col N="152" /> through the use of violence.  It becomes a recurring pattern.  The solution is more complex than simply providing accommodation.  Other facilities must also be provided, including education and support.</P>
    <P>In discussing this issue with others I was told that many of those who become homeless are sheltered or housed and they must depend on themselves.  However, they do not have the necessary basic skills to do this.  For example, they are unable to undertake culinary or household duties, are unable to feed themselves properly and have no sense of nutritional values.  They need the kind of support which is provided on a one to one basis.</P>
    <P>The first thing we must do is assess the numbers involved.  There is a huge disagreement about this.  According to the ESRI report &ldquo;An Analysis of Social Housing Need&rdquo;, two different figures are given for the homeless.  A figure of 2,667 was enumerated in 1993 while another figure of up to 5,000 was reported by Daly in 1994. Something is wrong with these.</P>
    <P>One approach to assessment is to appoint a time examination assessment.  Those involved in the issue, such as the Simon Community, maintain it is inadequate and that a flow chart measurement of the number of homeless is required, which can only be undertaken over time.  If the problem is to be resolved there is a need to assess exactly how large it is.  The Minister of State indicated that the programme for Government includes an undertaking to carry out such an assessment.  This must done on a scientific basis and over a long period to enable us assess the actual numbers as distinct from the speculative figures which some organisations proffer.  For example, those involved on a voluntary basis tend to overstate the numbers to ensure that all are included.  By contrast, those involved in providing local authority housing will reduce the numbers and advise that they are minimal.</P>
    <P>I once discussed the provision of a shelter in a town with an elected member of a political group who said that we should never provide shelters because they only encourage people to be homeless. It was an extraordinary statement, but it is true.  We are inclined to reject remarks like that.</P>
    <P>The Dublin homeless initiative has been effective. Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board got together with voluntary groups under the auspices of the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, in 1996.  They had a multifaceted solution to the problem which included an area response.  They say it has been extremely effective. Will the Minister of State consider using a similar initiative in other areas, such as Cork, Galway and Limerick?  If it has been so effective it may be one form of help.  I also ask him to be conscious of the need for assessment.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending the House and providing us with the opportunity to debate an issue that is so central and important. <Col N="153" /> Will he consider the establishment of a commission on homelessness?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on his thoughtful and detailed assessment. We have come a long way since the time of the workhouses, especially the 1830s when there was great poverty and hundreds of thousands of people were homeless.</P>
      <P>If one asked for a definition of homelessness, there would be as many definitions given as there are Senators in the House.  We have a caring community and society.  The Department of the Environment and Local Government, which is responsible for housing and urban renewal, is obviously doing its best to tackle the problem.  I compliment the voluntary organisations such as the Simon Community, St. Vincent de Paul Society and the Salvation Army for their involvement in this area.  The health boards are also very important.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board caters for young mothers up to 18 years of age and provides sheltered accommodation for them.  However, some young mothers between the ages of 18 and 20 years, with whom I come in contact, also need temporary and semi-permanent accommodation. The North-Eastern Health Board is not in a position to provide this statutorily.  Many single parents are at risk in our community and are living in accommodation which is not suitable to their needs or those of their children.  People end up living in very poor accommodation which, in may cases, may be subsidised by the health boards. These are often disgraceful, rat infested hovels which would not even have been acceptable in the last century.  I have brought this issue to the attention of the local authority and the health board in my area.  There should be a basic minimum requirement for accommodation before the State will pay a subsidy in respect of it.  It should be necessary for accommodation to have hot and cold water, proper ventilation, a decent toilet and basic cooking facilities.  The health boards are subsidising landlords to the tune of millions of pounds for providing no more than a roof over people's heads.  This is an area which should be addressed urgently.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the excellent organisation which deals with homelessness in the Dublin region.  In the North-Eastern Health Board area no such service exists for people who find themselves homeless at weekends. There is no 1800 number for them to contact. There is nowhere they can go and they must resort to knocking on the doors of local clergy or councillors.  Perhaps the Minister would consult with the health boards on the provision of a 1800 number in all health board areas which homeless people could contact in the evenings and at weekends as they cannot gain access to statutory help at those times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People might be homeless as a result of having been put out of their home.  There may be room in the house but because of interpersonal problems, <Col N="154" /> a young mother and child, for example, might find themselves on the street.  In order to get bed and breakfast accommodation, they must go through a procedure whereby they must consult with the housing officer of the local authority who, in turn, consults with the relevant community welfare office in the health board to decide whether a person is deemed to be homeless under the conditions which they must apply. I am not suggesting that anyone who has a row with their parents should have access to bed and breakfast accommodation but, where young children whose parents have been put out of the family home are involved, there should be simple, clear and concise rules for getting them into bed and breakfast accommodation.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise in that bed and breakfast accommodation is not always available to homeless people.  I know of cases in County Louth where homeless people, who had letters from the health board saying it would pay for their accommodation, were refused by the owners of the accommodation who felt homeless people would demean their reputation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his patience in sitting through a long debate on this issue in which he will have detected a great deal of unanimity on the part of Senators.  I do not intend to break that unanimity.  I welcome the Minister's address and appreciate his grasp of the complexity and range of issues involved.  I join with him in paying tribute to the voluntary bodies in this area.  From my own experience in another jurisdiction, I am amazed that the same names turn up here namely, the Simon Community, Salvation Army and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech underlined the complexity of this issue and the fact that homelessness is a product of complex changes in society.  It is difficult to understand the issue of homelessness if one takes a narrow focus and I believe it is <Col N="155" /> impossible to solve or ameliorate the problem if we content ourselves with such a focus.  The very economic growth and conditions which have made life better for 80 per cent of the population have made it worse for the other 20 per cent, the homeless.  The conditions which make it possible for us to dream of a society in which people will own their own houses can only be realised by 80 per cent of people.  Those are the issues with which we must grapple and with which the Minister must be concerned.</P>
    <P>As other Senators pointed out, we must first seek to get a grip on the size of the problem and carry out an assessment of the extent of homelessness. Figures were quoted in the range of 2,500 to 5,000 in 1993 which display a significant difference of opinion.  My own subjective impression is that those figures were an underestimate at that stage and are highly likely to be a gross underestimate now.  I am glad to hear that the Minister is proposing to commission a survey to establish figures in this area.  Such a survey should also probe into the extent of hidden homelessness. It must seek to identify the number of people who would not be homeless if they were not in jails, psychiatric hospitals or other institutions or, conversely, the number of people who would not be in those institutions if they had a place to go.</P>
    <P>In an era of increased standards of living and affluence, it is morally indefensible that we should allow a substantial segment of the population to sink into a pit from which it becomes increasingly difficult to rescue them.  It is also politically unwise and economically inefficient.  It would be much cheaper to keep people in their own homes than in any other type of institution. The situation is clearly worsening.  My own travels around Dublin at night are limited but I have noticed the numbers of people, particularly young people, who are sleeping rough.  A co-ordinated approach must be adopted to deal with the problem. It is not simply a housing problem, although that is an important part of it.  That is why I add my voice to those of other Senators who have commended the idea of a commission, on which I hope the Minister will look kindly.</P>
    <P>The main argument for a commission is that the problem crosses departmental and functional boundaries.  It has large health and education components and there are also issues in the juvenile justice field.  There is a need to look at the impact of some fiscal or social policies which may be very beneficial in their own fields but often have untoward knock-on consequences for the poor, deprived and homeless.  There must a capacity to look at the interaction of those policies and to lift them above one departmental responsibility.  I hope a wide-ranging commission will be set up which could report authoritatively and quickly on the matter.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the co-ordination which has been effected in the Dublin housing initiative is to be commended.  As other Senators have suggested, <Col N="156" /> that could be replicated in other cities.  We must examine ways to stop the flow of people into Dublin.  We must ask how the large number of homeless young Irish people on the streets of London and other British cities came to be there. The division which makes children under 18 years the responsibility of a health regime rather than a housing or social regime is artificial in a society in which children have babies at 13 years of age. We must provide variety in the range of housing. There must be a range of choice which will buttress the work of the voluntary bodies, in particular. In each area outside Dublin which does not warrant a project the size of the Dublin housing initiative, a local official should be given responsibility for co-ordinating policies on homelessness in the area.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be wise to rely on the advice of people working in this field, particularly those in the voluntary organisations.  They sometimes have a different perspective as they are not as caught up in professional and other orthodoxies as local authorities and health board officers. There is a wealth of experience, compassion and knowledge in bodies such as the Salvation Army, the Simon Community and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul on which I hope the Minister will draw.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first time I have seen you, Sir, in the Chair of this august body and I cannot think of a more appropriate debate for you to preside over.  I know of your continuing interest in the question of homelessness and your work with the Simon Community.  I am relying in what I am about to say on very valuable briefing documents produced by the Simon Community and also by GLEN, the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, and NEXUS because that area of homelessness has been largely concealed, although some references were made to it.</P>
      <P>I agree with several previous speakers who said there is a clear need for a full commission of inquiry into homelessness.  We do not have the full facts, although we appear to be provided with them by various voluntary organisations and local authorities.  However, when one probes local authority figures one finds they are not accurate. For example, the Simon Community report stated that in Tullamore, County Offaly, the local authority reported zero homelessness but a survey carried out by a local group in December 1996 and January 1997 found between 25 and 40 people sleeping rough in the town.  How is it possible that a local authority can report zero homelessness when there are simultaneously between 25 and 40 people sleeping rough in the area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is perfectly clear the method of assessment of the level of homelessness is inadequate.  We must accept we do not have the facts.  We have a purchase on them, in a sense, by our observations and contact with voluntary organisations but we do not know the actual situation.  Even our best efforts have not resulted in a realistic figure. There is also a limited definition of homelessness, <Col N="157" /> so we are not quite sure we are looking at the real notion of homelessness.  We must have proper assessments carried out in a fully scientific manner, perhaps with the assistance of groups such as the Combat Poverty Agency or university departments.</P>
    <P>There are a number of factors involved in homelessness.  The &ldquo;Pat Kenny Show&rdquo; came from Limerick this morning where he spoke to young people from Moyross and other areas.  People were talking about being able to predict which four year olds in primary school would drop out of the system.  In many circumstances they drop out because there is no direct intervention.</P>
    <P>The show compared the different school drop out rates for different districts in Limerick.  There are massive drop out rates from secondary schools in some areas for a number of reasons, one of which is the lack of facilities in the evenings.  Far fewer dropped out in Moyross, which has a boxing club, a social club, a library and so on, than in some other areas.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the engagement of teachers.  One of the teachers involved, who sounded like a very fine man, made an excellent point.  He said it was no good to have teachers with a disinterested academic view of life who leave the community at 5 p.m. and take no further interest.  It struck me he was talking about a wonderful idea which was fashionable in the Roman Catholic church in the 1960s, which was worker priests who can still be seen in the Jesuit community in Ballymun.  They are committed to living the full experience and know what happens when the lights go out in the school at 4.30 p.m. They know that children will become hopeless, hang around street corners and get involved with drugs if their imaginations are not engaged.  For example, can we not use the public pool of land for people in Ballymun with horses?</P>
    <P>There is also the question of moving of people from psychiatric hospitals into the main community. We got a warning signal when this policy began in the US.  Those of us who travel to the US frequently know there is large number of homeless, visibly disturbed people on the streets because of the lack of a proper transitional phase, monitoring and half way houses.  We must look at that.</P>
    <P>Professor Anthony Clare wrote in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 1 February 1998 that:</P>
    <P>The current situation is a shambles.  We have children who are not sick staying in hospital wards because the State cannot provide anything else.  We have children homeless at night and referred to the Eastern Health Board ending up in bed and breakfast facilities or Garda stations overnight because we have no appropriate child residential facilities.  We have children who have committed no offence held in St. Patrick's Detention Centre because there is nowhere else for them to go.</P>
    <P>He went on to state:</P>
    <P>My own hospital &mdash; St. Patrick's, a psychiatric <Col N="158" /> hospital for adults &mdash; has been asked on occasions to help provide accommodation for psychiatrically sick children and young adolescents because virtually no residential provision has been made for the number of disturbed children requiring help.</P>
    <P>We are not talking just about adults in regard to homelessness as even children, for whom there should be special care, are homeless.</P>
    <P>Some of my colleagues referred to male prostitution. I direct the Minister's attention to an excellent book, which I hope will be discussed in full by the House, called <i>Poverty, Lesbians and Gay Men: the Economic and Social Effects of Discrimination.</i> This book should be discussed in a much broader context than just the question of homelessness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leader for making this arrangement.  I will summarise the arguments in this book.  Gay people are often subject to pressures at home when they come out. They may be flung out of home which means they are on the street.  There is a higher rate of homelessness among young gay people, men in particular, and this leads to prostitution.  It is something which must be examined.</P>
      <P>There is a lack of emergency &ldquo;move on&rdquo; accommodation, especially in Dublin, which causes a crisis in emergency centres and hostels because people are forced to stay in these facilities on a long-term basis.  As a result, people in an emergency on a specific evening find the hostels provided by groups such as Simon are already full.  There is Outreach which is frequently the primary source of contact for people living on the streets or in insecure accommodation.  We see people around Kingsbridge Station being visited by soup runs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Government is doing something in this area.  I noted already that there is a £45 million increase for local authority social housing in the last budget.  However, when some 30,000 people are homeless and only 3,000 houses are being completed each year, a serious gap exists. As I had my lunch I read the property supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> in which there was an article on starter homes.  People were trying to find a house under £100,000.  That suggests we are creating a two tier society in Ireland: the men of property and the men of no property.  The latter will never get a foot on the ladder because the gap is so enormous.  In 1968 I sold our old family home, a five bedroomed detached house in a good part of Ballsbridge, for less than £8,000.  I <Col N="159" /> bought a four bedroomed semi-detached house in Dundrum for just under £4,000.  That would be a couple of months' rent in an apartment in Dublin now.  The situation is impossible for people trying to get into this market.</P>
    <P>I mentioned &ldquo;men&rdquo; and I realise that might have sounded almost like a sexist comment. However, another document has been produced by the Simon Community, <i>Still Waiting for the Future,</i> which on page 17 deals with &ldquo;Demographic Characteristics, Life Experiences, Indicators of Health Needs and Usage of Health Services&rdquo;. It showed the majority were male, middle aged, from lower socio-economic backgrounds and had few education training qualifications. The majority were either single &mdash; 59 per cent, or living as single people &mdash; 32 per cent.  Family or marital breakdown was a frequent feature in many of their lives.  About 10 per cent were reared in health care institutions.  It seems to me that this is overwhelmingly a problem for a group which is already marginalised, single, male and with low education experience, disruptive family background and various other experiences.  If one refers again to the report by GLEN and NEXUS, one finds within it an especially troubled group of people who, because of historic discrimination, have been fired out on the streets, often as young people.</P>
    <P>I remember many years ago when I ran a gay community centre in the middle of Dublin seeing 11 and 12 year old kids sitting on top of the Thomas Moore statue.  There was nothing I could do for them and it broke my heart because I would love to have been able to do something for them.  What would have been said had I brought them into the Hirschfeld Centre?  What would be said today with all the scandal stories of swimming coaches, priests, etc.  ?  It is an extremely delicate area for anyone to enter.  Anyone intervening needs to do so in the best possible and most professional way.  These are people with glaring needs, but there are grave risks for the adult world trying to intervene unless it is done properly and professionally.  However, we should not be deterred from trying to intervene.  It is intolerable that we should wring our hands over the problems of people interfered with by swimming coaches while we know well there is a significant problem on the streets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for extending what has been a useful debate.  I have a certain knowledge of the problem, as do those who have served on local authorities, although that knowledge varies depending on what part of the country one comes from and the extent of the problem there.  I appreciate the contribution of the various groups involved in helping the problem of homelessness, especially the Salvation Army, Simon, Focus Point, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others, and especially the officials and volunteers who work in these organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> There is no doubt we are not fully aware of the extent of the problem of homelessness.  We do not have sufficient up to date figures or records on it.  I support the call made by the Simon Community to establish a commission on homelessness. Task forces have at times been set up as a quick response, but as regards homelessness, this commission would be more meritorious than many task forces established before.  Its basic terms of reference would include the extent of homelessness, an examination of how it is linked to other poverty indicators such as unemployment, lack of education, bad housing, inadequate health care and community segregation.  The links between child care provision and follow-up support and the response of both voluntary and statutory organisations should also be investigated with a view to reducing, if not eliminating, homelessness by a set date.</P>
    <P>It is obvious much work needs to be done.  It is a problem about which successive Governments have not done enough and we all stand guilty on that score.  There are many reasons people become homeless: financial problems, problems in the home or problems which evolve in a community. All these matters must be examined with a view to arriving at solutions.</P>
    <P>Because of the property market, home ownership is not now an option for many people. Senator Norris asked where one could buy a property in Dublin.  If a property is on sale for less than £100,000 in Dublin one asks what problems are associated with it.  Such house prices were the original target of the property tax, which will have to be examined.  Local authorities have faced problems with this issue, and there is greater pressure on those authorities because people are staying too long in emergency housing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this debate.  Much remains to be done, and the Government must produce a greater response to the matter.  Communication between the organisations must improve, and the Minister of State must note what has been said. Many Members are barely aware of some of the problems of the homeless.</P>
    <P>People can become homeless because of family difficulties.  Senator Doyle said that long ago one could perhaps go to one's grandmother's house. That is not an option in the modern era.  There can also be problems when family members look for their entitlements under wills or settlements.  Family members who are less well off or less well educated may find themselves the side of the road.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should take on board the points made in the debate.  I thank the Simon Community for sending me and other Members data on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for attending this debate which and was requested by many Members.  Many good ideas have come from the suggestions of Members who draw on their experiences in the cities and larger towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Homelessness seems a far greater problem in the urban community than in rural areas.  The <Col N="161" /> debate has shown how well those in rural communities care for their neighbours.  That example should be followed by those in urban areas who must take part in and contribute to their communities. It is a sad reflection on urban areas that their doors are closed to community participation. One need only listen to the contributions made by Members who work with the less fortunate, day in day out.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris put his finger on the problem when pointing out that long ago teachers taught until 4 p.m. or 4.30 p.m., and were then involved in sports clubs, the ICA and other community organisations.  Now they drive 20 or 30 miles home after school, which happens in rural areas also.  Those who sit on interview boards to appoint people to positions in which they will participate in the community must bear this in mind. Those who give a commitment to participate in the community after the classroom door is closed should be given preferential treatment.  I favour this approach having seen the changes of the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>This is not a proposition for Government alone or for any particular Minister.  It is a challenge to the community and to all in public life.  We must try to encourage those who do not participate.  I call on the media, particularly people such as Gay Byrne and Pat Kenny, to encourage people to get involved in their communities.  Their mothers and fathers were probably involved, but nowadays television takes up all people's leisure time. People do not know their neighbours, and, even worse, they do not seem to want to know them.  I call on all those in the media, the Oireachtas and the churches to get people involved in their communities.</P>

      <P>It is remarkable to discover such an extraordinary consensus here and in western Europe where we take such a fundamentally opposite view of the death penalty to that of a country we choose to believe is the leader of the democratic world.  Having suffered 30 years of outrageous violence, the murder of a Member of this House and bombings on the streets, we have never come near restoring the death penalty. That is because we have a sense of civilisation and of what is appropriate.  In the same way we do not believe in chopping people's hands off because of theft or in castrating rapists.  The death penalty is an inappropriate response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter of enormous concern to those of us who believe in democracy that the country which, regrettably or otherwise, tends to set trends in politics, economics, fashion, the media, etc. , seems to be intent not only on maintaining <Col N="162" /> the death penalty but on extending it and increasing the frequency of these revolting spectacles.</P>
    <P>The US has moved from the initial decision to restore the death penalty to a situation where it has become a matter of fact in some states.  It is now being refined to the extent that victim's families are being invited to watch the spectacle.  The US is only a small step from public executions when people, including journalists and families, with no judicial, legal or medical purpose &mdash; I wonder whether it is possible to have a medical purpose in the deliberate killing of another human being &mdash; are invited to watch an execution.  A further step would be televised executions.  It is time the rest of the civilised world said to the US that, irrespective of its internal political problems or difficulties, it has no right to do something which is an affront to civilisation.</P>
    <P>The reason I identify the US as particularly culpable is it claims a pre-eminent position in the world in terms of what it calls freedom and democracy.  I am not identifying the US because it is an easy target.  A country is entitled to be judged by the standards it claims others should live by.  It must meet the standards it sets in making an enormous fuss about abuses of human rights in other countries and wonderful rhetorical flourishes regarding freedom and civilisation. This is particularly the case in the context of the US.  I do not care how difficult the crime problem is; other countries have crime problems.  I do not care about the political pressures.  These issues cannot be justified by political expediency.  Every Member of the House is aware of issues being pressed which are wrong and which no Member would permit to be done politically, even at the cost of political position.  People have values below which they will not sink, one of which relates to the death penalty.  These values are universal in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>No political party supports the death penalty or the concept of a free vote on the death penalty, a most welcome display of political maturity which I hope we will sustain.  We must focus on the one member state of western civilised democracies which persists in this revolting spectacle of executing human beings.  Killing somebody else is not an appropriate response irrespective of how revolting the offence.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has made representations on the issue, but it is time we supported international organisations in telling the US that it cannot remain in the company of civilised states if it persists in its policy of judicial execution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Senator Ryan for sharing his time.  He and I have a long record of fighting on this issue in the House.  Many years ago we proposed a Bill for the abolition of capital punishment which was eventually adopted by the then Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has made representations, but they have been docile in nature.  Yesterday I asked the Leader to request the US Ambassador <Col N="163" /> to come to the House to explain how this &ldquo;most civilised nation in the world&rdquo; can justify, in the eyes of the world, the judicial murder of its own citizens.  On the whole I am an unapologetic supporter of the American way of life, the American system and the American way of free and private enterprise.  The reason I do not apologise for this motion which singles out the US is we, as a nation, are so closely identified with America.</P>
    <P>We oppose capital punishment, physical brutality and torture in other countries, but we do not often take our courage in our hands and summon countries, which we count as friends, allies and colleagues in morality, before us to ask why they are doing this and to express our condemnation of it.  I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say regarding the representations made. Pleas for mercy are totally inadequate.  I congratulate the Government if the representations constituted outright public condemnations because this is what is required.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to judge the US on this issue as our record on it is impeccable and almost unanimous for many years.  This is why I regret the Leader's failure to reply to my request to bring the US Ambassador to the House to explain the issue.  The Kennedys are a great liberal family of the US and I do not believe it favours this type of execution.</P>
    <P>I wonder how this type of execution can happen under a Democratic Administration, which is traditionally far more liberal than Republican Administrations.  I know the Governor of Texas is Republican and that it is a conservative state. However, at the end of the day, responsibility rests with the Federal Government.  It is up to us to clearly show our disapproval.</P>
    <P>This is the most macabre, public and nasty type of punishment which can possibly be inflicted on anybody.  As Senator Ryan said, it is only necessary to watch the scenes before the execution and the victim's families attending the execution to realise that it has become a quasi-public spectacle which is revolting and encourages blood lust.  We have a right to say that this must stop.  Our voice can be heard on this issue and can carry across the world.</P>
    <P>I echo Senator Ryan's sentiments about condemning the activities of other countries.  In the past we have made huge political capital of our moral outrage at the activities of Saddam Hussein. The Americans make similar capital out of the slaughters in Bosnia and other places.  The US army and Government are to a large extent the policemen of the world.  This does not only imply military might, but the supporting of moral stances.  This is what military might affects to do.</P>
    <P>If the policemen of the world, those who decide what is right and wrong and who set the moral code of the world, are allowed to murder their own citizens in an institutionalised way, we, as a small country with much influence in America, must condemn it.  Will the Leader tell me if we can elicit a formal response from the US <Col N="164" /> Ambassador?  Why is there no representative of the US embassy in the Visitors' Gallery?  Was it notified of the debate?  What message will go out from this House when the debate is over?  It is important that the US Government and Administration knows that nobody in this House, which is representative of friendly nations, supported this barbarous activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my party, I would like to add our voice to the condemnation of the death penalty, which is a barbarous and so-called judicial method of a state taking the life of a prisoner for committing a heinous crime.  Nobody denies a state must take stern action against crime and criminals.  However, all civilised countries accept the United Nations universal declaration on human rights.  Central to that is the inalienable right to life of persons, good or bad.  The declaration specifically states that there is no reason to take a human life, even by a state or judiciary.</P>
      <P>It is timely, in view of what took place in Huntsville, Texas this week, that this House should speak on this issue which has been debated in both Houses many times over the years.  It is a tribute to our civilisation that these Houses abolished the death penalty in 1990, although perhaps we were slow in so doing.  I pay tribute to the then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke, who steered the legislation through both Houses despite opposition to the proposal.  There continues to be opposition to the abolition of the death penalty in all parties and among the public.</P>
      <P>The situation in the United States is a cause for great concern.  A culture has developed there since 1976 when the Supreme Court cleared the way for states to determine their own policy on capital punishment and the death penalty.  Some 400 people have been executed in the United States since 1976 &mdash; barely 20 years ago.  Of these 246 have been executed by lethal injection, 131 have been executed by the electric chair, nine have been gassed in gas chambers, nine have been hanged by the hangman's rope and at least three have been shot by firing squad.</P>
      <P>I refer to an event which took place in Washington last summer at a new museum, called a &ldquo;newseum&rdquo;.  It displayed the artefacts or memorabilia of the news media over the past 100 years or so.  The main exhibit was a photograph taken in the late 1920s by a press cameraman who went into an execution chamber where a women was being electrocuted in an electric chair.  With a camera concealed on his leg, he took a photograph of the woman as she died.  It was a photograph of a person going up in a puff of smoke &mdash; a woman literally burning to death.  That exhibit drew some of the largest crowds and was the one with which people were most fascinated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the largest police and crime exhibitions in the world is located in Miami and it has an electric chair.  Young people and children clamour to be photographed sitting on that chair. Over a year ago a man executed by the electric chair in Florida literally burned to death.  A justice <Col N="165" /> official of the state of Florida jokingly remarked afterwards that criminals should know that Florida has an electric chair which does not work and it is an incentive to people not to do anything which would result in their being sent to that chair.</P>
    <P>In a country so developed in terms of its social attitudes, or so we believe, there is support for the death penalty in the United States.  There are 447 people on death row in Texas.  Recently, a senior justice official of the state of Texas said they were executing people at a rate of three per week on average.  He said they were gradually shifting to the right side of the curve, in other words, they were executing more people on death row than the number coming on to it from the courts.  He was congratulating himself on the fact that they were speeding up the rate of executions in this famous prison in Huntsville where this orgy of executions takes place each week.</P>
    <P>The woman executed in the United State's a few days ago only became famous because she was the first woman to be executed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in Texas since the Civil War. When a Belgian woman was executed in England in the 19th century <i>The Times</i> commented: thank God she was not British.  We can congratulate countries like the United Kingdom which used the death penalty in this country and elsewhere on thousands of occasions.  It probably gave the world its most famous executioner, Mr. Pierpoint, who wrote his memoirs about the futility of the death penalty, although it was his job to administer it.</P>
      <P>In 38 of the 50 states of the United States of America, the death penalty is used.  In 13 of these states people under 18 years of age may be executed and in nine, children under 16 years of age may become victims of the death penalty. Extensive research has been done on the death penalty as a deterrent to crime because that and society's need to take retribution on somebody who has done an evil deed have always been the justification for it.  It is a very emotive argument but research has clearly shown that in the states in the United States which have the death penalty and the 12 states which do not, there is no difference in the capital crime rate between states. That proves beyond doubt that there is no relationship between capital punishment as a deterrent to serious crime and deterring crime.  If this were the case, states with the death penalty should have lower levels of serious crime or serious capital crime.  This, however, is not the case.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly.  Yesterday, a vote was called on an amendment to the Order of Business which proposed that this matter be discussed yesterday rather than today.  I felt so strongly about it that I could not vote against the amendment even though I did not mind the delay of 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="166" /> It is a great displeasure to come to the House to talk about this truly awful subject.  About 100 countries have abolished the death penalty for all crimes.  A significant number have abolished it except for serious crime and many others do not apply it, although capital punishment has not been abolished.  The majority of countries do not exercise the death penalty and many only retain the punishment in their legal codes for serious crimes such as murder of defence forces personnel or political crimes that involve mass murder.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights recognises one human right in all circumstances and above all others, the right to life and the fact that nobody has the right to take a human life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In modern society the death penalty has not been a deterrent from crime.  Ireland abolished the death penalty in 1990 and all Members of the House were appalled by what happened in the United States yesterday.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves on our humane approach to all aspects of society and life.  We are friendly with neighbouring countries and with every country with which we conduct business.  We also have a close association with the United States and we will continue to use our best efforts to convince its legislators and those of the various states that the death penalty is not an acceptable deterrent.</P>
      <P>The media and its use of the airwaves to cover this sorry affair left much to be desired and I agree with the comments of previous speakers in this regard.  It was execution by television.  It was an appalling spectacle which I would prefer not to have seen.  It was not suitable viewing.</P>
      <P>Under no circumstances does this House condone what happened in the United States yesterday. As a friendly nation, Ireland will do everything it can to try to convince America and other countries which utilise the death penalty to abolish it.  We can only use our best endeavours to bring this issue to a favourable conclusion.</P>
      <P>Senator Lanigan is a senior Member of the House and has travelled extensively in many nations.  I wish to share my time with him.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to stand in this Chamber and condemn what took place in the United States.  However, this punishment started 15 years ago when a young drug addicted prostitute killed two people.  We cannot condone that crime but for the intervening 15 years the girl who committed the crime was incarcerated.  She went through what I consider a life sentence.  In Ireland a life sentence would not last 15 years.  After the trauma of that incarceration she was legally murdered and we cannot ignore the fact that the law provides that a criminal can be legally murdered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my reservations about the American judicial system is that it is not a system of justice for all the people.  Ninety-nine per cent of the <Col N="167" /> people on death row in the United States never completed the basic first grade education cycle. However, the people who have been on death row for up to 15 years give the impression that they are highly educated and highly motivated. That is because prison offered them their first opportunity for a scheduled life.  It was also their introduction to an education.</P>
    <P>Members of the public are usually amazed to discover that people who were drug addicted and crazy as children and who were convicted of heinous crimes can emerge 15 years later as rational, logical people who can talk through their problems. I do not understand why they are amazed. The convicts are put in a place where they have access to education and they are fed.  The vast majority of them come from emotionally, physically and materially deprived backgrounds.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to see the statistics on the number of white people who have been judicially murdered in the United States.  I believe that 99 per cent of the people who have been killed by the death penalty in the US are from non-white ethnic backgrounds.  A judicial system that keeps people on death row &mdash; even the words &ldquo;death row&rdquo; are callous and haunting &mdash; not knowing if an appeal will be heard or granted is cruel in the extreme.  There is no justification for it.</P>
    <P>Our comments in this debate will not be taken into account by George W. Bush, Jnr., who sees himself as the saviour of the right wing in the United States.  However, what are the crime statistics for the states which sanction judicial murder?  Have they increased or reduced?  I believe that every time a judicial murder takes place in the United States the crime statistics increase.  People involved in crime will simply decide they have nothing else to live for.  They are not unlike the Japanese suicide bombers during the Second World War or the Hizbollah who decide there is nothing for them in Iran so they may as well go to God.  The attitude is: &ldquo;There is nothing left for me in this world and if I die, so what&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The judicial system in the United States is wrong but the economic system drags people into situations where they no longer care.  Suddenly they are in an establishment where they are educated and fed.  They receive things they never had.  Then 15 years later they are injected with drugs and they die.  That is horrendous.  There is no excuse for this.  We in Ireland must condemn it.</P>
    <P>In condemning what happened in the United States in the last number of years, we must also condemn other countries which still use the death penalty but that is not publicised.  The statistics in China, Saudi Arabia and certain Muslim countries are equally horrific.  We must campaign for the abolition of all types of capital punishment.</P>
    <P>It has been said that capital punishment was only abolished in Ireland in 1990 that there had not been a judicial murder for many years before <Col N="168" /> that.  There was judicial murder on the statute books in Europe.  Some of the sophisticated western countries only abolished the death penalty in the 1990s.  If American society, which has a reasonable human rights record, criticises human rights violations in places such as Saudi Arabia and Iraq, it must acknowledge that human rights violations in the United States are worse today than they were 50 years ago.  More and more states in the United States are reintroducing the death penalty.</P>
    <P>In joining with the huge number of people worldwide who are criticising the United States for their attitude to life, we, in Ireland should start a campaign for the abolition of the death penalty in every country, and we should start in the United Nations.  There should be United Nations resolutions on human rights abuses presented to the United States and other countries suggesting that the greatest human rights abuse is that a government or judicial system should have the last say whether someone lives or dies.</P>
    <P>They say it is much more humane to kill a person by injection.  The drug culture in the United States is out of control and people are sent to jail for injecting drugs into themselves.  Yet here is a situation where drug addicts are sent to jail, or they die from addiction, and at the same time we have a drug administered to a person to kill them judicially.  If a drug addict is sent to jail, why should the person who injects and kills someone else not be sent to jail?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Seanad provided the opportunity for us to discuss this matter.  I would like to make a practical suggestion at the outset. Since there is nobody in attendance from the American Embassy, and since Senator Ross suggested that the American Ambassador should be invited to be made aware of the feelings of the House, and since this is unlikely to happen, the Minister might care to send a copy of the proceedings to the American Embassy so that officials there might analyse the feelings of Members.  This might have some small impact.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan that we ought to fight against this issue on a global basis.  We are already doing that, not entirely at official level, but through Amnesty International, with whose work I know the Senator is familiar.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor raised the important point of whether the death penalty works as a deterrent. There has been much statistical analysis of this and it is perfectly clear from a scientific basis this is not the case.  It simply does not act as a deterrent in the vast majority of cases.  He mentioned the fact Mr. Albert Pierrepoint, the hangman for many years, wrote his memoirs.  Michael O'Toole, a distinguished columnist in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> had a fine article on Wednesday, 4 February, where he quoted what Albert Pierrepoint had to say.  Perhaps it would be useful to put it on the record of the House to flesh out what Senator Connor said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="169" /> Michael O'Toole says:</P>
    <P>The man who hanged Ruth Ellis came to regret her death and the deaths of the 400 or so others whose necks he had broken.</P>
    <P>One must question the sanity and decency of a state that will pay an individual for breaking the necks and thereby causing the deaths of 400 of its citizens.  He says:</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that executions solve nothing. It is said to be a deterrent. If death were a deterrent, I might be expected to know.</P>
    <P>It is I who have faced them last, young lads and girls, working men, grandmothers. It did not deter them.</P>
    <P>All the men and women whom I have faced at that final moment convince me that in what I have done I have not prevented a single murder.</P>
    <P>That was the man who hanged 400 people on behalf of the state.</P>
    <P>One draws a distinction between execution and judicial murder.  Senator Lanigan described everything as judicial murder.  I do not think this the case.  There is execution in those circumstances where someone is demonstrably guilty and I deplore it, but any analysis of the figures in the United States indicates clearly both execution and judicial murder take place.  There is not the slightest doubt a significant portion of those put to death are innocent and in some cases are even believed to be innocent by the prosecuting attorneys.  If you examine an analysis of the background of those put to death, in the overwhelming majority of cases they are black, educationally deprived and mentally retarded.  In other words, they are classic victims.  It was unusual in this case that it was an attractive white woman.  Again this raises interesting questions.</P>
    <P>We are asked to believe in this country, and in the United States, one element of the penal system is rehabilitation.  It is obvious the authorities in the United States do not believe in rehabilitation at all.  There is no such thing as rehabilitation. There is a Clemency Board in the State of Texas.  Numerous appeals have been made to that Clemency Board and not one appeal has succeeded. What does that tell us?</P>
    <P>Karla Faye Tucker certainly committed a grotesque and horrible act.  It was made more horrible by the fact she knew the people involved and she claimed in an interview that she derived sexual pleasure to the point of orgasm by burying a hatchet in the body of the young woman involved, someone who had been sleeping with her former boyfriend.  That does not make her a particularly pleasant person, but over 15 years she changed radically: she underwent an apparent religious conversion.  Interestingly Mr. Victor Rodriguez, the head of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, said he did not believe she had undergone a religious conversion.  One wonders <Col N="170" /> what his qualifications were for determining the reality of a religious conversion.</P>
    <P>From all the accounts I read her appalling background, she seems to have gone to her death with dignity and giving the impression that she had a religious conversion.  If she had not done so and that was a totally cynical exercise, why did she not take the opportunity to spit in the face of her executioners?  It seems plausible that she went to her death as someone who had experienced a religious conversion.</P>
    <P>I wish one could say the same for the Bush family and the American Presidency.  It was suggested that it would be good to call in the American Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith; it certainly would as part of an educational process. We know from the Cuban tapes that her late brother, President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, calmly sat down with the CIA to plot the murder of President Fidel Castro.  Murder is a significant arm of foreign policy, not only for the US but for some European countries also.  One must raise the question of the double standards involved.</P>
    <P>A number of people said how morally revolting it was to be expected to witness these scenes.  The most arrogant act of which the human animal is capable is depriving another human being of the capacity to live.  None of us from the Pope to the Ayatollah to the rag and bone man in Marrowbone Lane, knows what, if anything, follows physical conscious life.  We must therefore bear in mind the possibility that one is absolutely and for all time depriving another sentient being of all capacity to experience anything, and that this is done by the State in a callous, clinical, prepared manner.  What I found most revolting were the shots of the well prepared death room, with discreet little curtains and the comfortable gurney onto which the person would be strapped before being injected with a lethal substance on our behalf.  Even the name &ldquo;gurney&rdquo; is revolting.</P>
    <P>At least on this occasion it worked.  Members will recall the appalling event some years ago when, as usual, an educationally deprived, mentally sub-normal, young, healthy, black man was strapped into an electric chair in an American state, the electric current was switched on, but it did not work.  His brain was partially fried and there were pictures showing smoke coming out of his ears.  Is this an edifying spectacle?  Was this what led people to chorus &ldquo;Fry him&rdquo; outside the jail?  That was exactly what was done.</P>
    <P>In considering the violence of American society we must remember the glorification of the gun and the political lobby which supports it.  In the run up to President Clinton's election the death penalty became a popular issue and he signed an execution warrant because it helped him politically.  This is what we have become involved in as a race and it is appropriate that we should protest in the strongest possible fashion to the US authorities on this issue as a matter of international human rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> My colleague Senator Quinn said he could not support this debate because America was not the only country with capital punishment.  It is not, but it is astonishing that a country which we believe to be one of the great democracies has the fourth highest total of public executions after countries such as China and Iran.  That is not a comfortable position for any democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A dreadful act took place yesterday morning and I support Senator Lanigan's call for a worldwide campaign to abolish the death penalty.  Everyone abhorred yesterday's act.  I do not agree with the death penalty, especially in this case where the lady had served 15 years and experienced a total change of character.  We can talk about this subject till the cows come home but that will not change what is happening in the United States.</P>
      <P>I found the media attention given to the case revolting.  The day before Karla Faye Tucker was executed, cameras went into the execution room, showing the bed, etc. , while a mundane voice outlined what would happen.  I worry about a society which enjoys such a programme.  I found it disgusting and would be concerned about people who would sit up to wait for the murder or execution of an individual.  The death penalty is an inhumane act and I would worry about the humanity of those who enjoyed watching it.</P>
      <P>We can criticise the United States and other countries which inflict the death penalty as much as we like, as many did on yesterday's Order of Business.  However, everyone seems to have forgotten that over Christmas and the New Year random executions took place in our country - I tried to intervene to mention this yesterday.  We can talk all we like about other countries and we should remember that the lady who was executed committed horrific crimes, albeit 15 years ago. The innocent people who were murdered in Northern Ireland were walking to and from work or down the street.  No one condemned those murders yesterday and it does not say much for our society or ourselves as individuals that we do not abhor what happens here yet we criticise what happens in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Leonard, we have condemned all killings in Northern Ireland on numerous occasions.  The present so-called random sectarian murders have been widely condemned by all parties.  The difference between that and the subject of this debate is that in State judicial killings a state takes it upon itself to decide that execution will be a form of punishment for its citizens.  This is different from so-called paramilitary organisations which take it upon themselves to kill people, which must also be roundly condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support what has been said on all sides and condemn in the strongest possible terms the use of the death penalty as an inhumane and uncivilised form of punishment.  I also condemn its continuing <Col N="172" /> use in the USA.  I support the calls of Senator Norris, Senator Lanigan and others that Ireland should lead a campaign for the worldwide abolition of the death penalty.  Amnesty International is doing so at present but it would be worthwhile if a small, neutral country like Ireland could take the initiative.  Perhaps the Minister would take this on board because credit would redound to the Government and himself.</P>
    <P>The penalty exists worldwide but there is a vast difference between countries like Iran and China on one hand and the United States on the other. The US projects itself as the moral leader of the free world.  We look up to that country as one of our oldest and strongest democracies.  There are 40 million descendants of Irish people living in the United States today.  We have close relations with the USA and a country which regards itself as the leading world democracy should be to the forefront of establishing standards.  It should do so in a civilised fashion.  This is why the United States should be condemned in the strongest terms possible and singled out.  Some may say that is unreasonable because there are other horrific regimes.  However, the regimes in Iran, China and Iraq, where executions take place on a large scale, are not democratic.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the American Ambassador, Mrs. Jean Kennedy-Smith, and I also wish that she could have attended the debate.  It would have been worthwhile and informative and Senator Norris's suggestion should be taken up.  I ask the Minister to ensure that a copy of today's proceedings is sent to the ambassador.  We would welcome a response from her and perhaps she could peruse it and refer it to her Government.</P>
    <P>The arguments used in favour of the death penalty do not carry weight.  The main argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent; if somebody is killed, others will be deterred from committing murder.  A commission was established in Britain in 1948, following the war, when it began to seriously consider the death penalty.  It was established on a scientific basis and it found no evidence to support the thesis that the death penalty was a deterrent.  There have been surveys and commissions since then and no evidence in support of it has been brought forward.  The earlier commissions which considered events in the 18th and 19th centuries discovered that many people who were subsequently hanged had witnessed executions.  An enormous amount of crime, such as pilfering and pickpocketing, happened during the public spectacle of a judicial execution in those times.</P>
    <P>The argument that it is a deterrent is not valid. It is a supreme irony that the life of a citizen should be taken to show other citizens that taking the lives of individuals is wrong.  How can one stand over the suggestion that a nation will take the life in a judicial execution of somebody who committed murder to show others that murder is wrong?  There is an inherent contradiction in the <Col N="173" /> deterrent argument.  It does not stand up to examination.</P>
    <P>The other function of punishment is rehabilitation. This is also inherently contradictory because somebody who is dead cannot be rehabilitated.  There is no justification for murder in terms of the normal justification for or purpose of sanctions imposed by a democratic state.  There is one explanation for the death penalty and that is simply and solely retribution.  It is tit for tat, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  It is Old Testament morality and some Christian countries, although fewer than previously, in the West retain it.  Other religions have the same type of morality and other countries have espoused it. However, we have moved from Old Testament morality and towards the morality of the New Testament, which is more civilised and humane. It does not demand an eye for an eye.  It demands punishment but with hope of rehabilitation, of people turning over a new leaf and becoming good citizens.  The death penalty is totally at odds with that morality.</P>
    <P>This is why so much emphasis has been placed on the United States.  It projects itself as the leader of the modern world.  It presents itself in a moral fashion that what it is doing is for the good of the free world, humanity and democracy. However, it is totally out of kilter with most other countries which project themselves as leaders. How can the position where the majority of states which have the death penalty are in the southern part of the country and the largest proportion of people on death row are black be justified?  The largest proportion of people killed in the United States is of ethnic minorities.  This has always been the case and statistics on people on death row at present show this is still the position. People spend 15 years on death row.  They are already tormented for what we acknowledge are hideous crimes and then they are then killed.  This is an anomaly, to say the least.  The normal length of time on death row is between ten and 20 years before people are executed.</P>
    <P>The death penalty was abolished in Ireland in 1963.  I pay tribute to former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, who abolished it for approximately 200 offences, including the theft of a turnip, the crime for which Stoney Burke was hanged in 1847, and stealing sheep.  The last capital offences were abolished in 1990 by another former Fianna Fáil Minister, Mr. Ray Burke. Unfortunately, there is a cloud over both men at present, but we should pay tribute to them for their contributions to those desirable developments.</P>
    <P>I agree with the condemnation of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights of this week's execution and her request to the nations of the world, specifically the United States, to adhere to the 1971 UN General Assembly decision which called on all countries which retained the death penalty to progressively restrict its use with a view to eventual abolition.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators who contributed to this honest, open and realistic debate.  Senators Norris, Costello and others suggested that a copy of the proceedings should be forwarded to the American Ambassador.  I will pass on that message to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, and ensure that is done.  It is appropriate in light of the contributions.</P>
      <P>Various issues need to be addressed.  The debate reflected the common ground which exists in Ireland.  There is also common ground across party lines given the actions of successive Governments on this issue.  I acknowledge the remarks of Senator Costello regarding the actions of former Taoiseach and former Minister, Ray Burke, on the death penalty.  Senator Lanigan and others said the important thing is what is done from now on.  Meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights will start in Geneva on 16 March and will continue into April.  As Senators may be aware, Ireland is a member of the commission which runs from 1997-9.  The Government will take the lead in advocating the universal abolition of the death penalty.</P>
      <P>The death penalty has not been carried out here since 1954.  We formally abolished the death penalty for all offences, civil or military, in 1990 with the Criminal Justice Act of that year.  There were two motives behind that Act.  The first was to respect the dignity and sanctity of human life and the second was to promote human rights and civilised values.  I wish to record my appreciation of the then Minister for Justice, Ray Burke.</P>
      <P>At the UN General Assembly meeting in 1994 the Italians tried to place on the agenda a draft resolution to call for a moratorium on executions. We supported the Italian position strongly.  The Egyptians defended the death penalty as essential for safeguarding human rights.  The retentionist camp was led by Singapore, which argued strongly from the basis of respect for state sovereignty, supported by Algeria and Bangladesh.  We must be realistic about the strength of Ireland's voice on the international stage and what we can achieve.  It is a battle because other countries hold strong positions.  That meeting at the General Assembly was chaotic and did not lead to a decisive inclusion.  Ireland supported the Italians strongly on that occasion and we will continue to pursue such a position at the UN.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to draw the Senators' attention to the proceedings of the 53rd session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 16 March 1997.  Many Members will be aware of the work of our Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Anne Anderson, who is typical of our many excellent ambassadors abroad, and her contribution to the commission represents the deep and strong feelings the nation holds on human rights. The ambassador outlined three important areas with regard to executions: first, many people who are executed are from vulnerable sections of <Col N="175" /> society, second, mistakes can also be made and, third, there are alternatives to the death penalty.</P>
    <P>With regard to the issue of the vulnerable in society who suffer from the death penalty Ambassador Anderson said:</P>
    <P>. there is strong evidence that the death penalty is applied disproportionately to those who are least able to defend themselves, to the most vulnerable in society &mdash; the poor, the mentally disturbed and members of racial, religious or ethnic minorities.  Those individuals may be less able to function effectively within the criminal justice system.  They may not possess sufficient knowledge or financial resources to defend themselves properly; indeed, the legal or judicial system in place may reflect a negative attitude to them by those who hold power.</P>
    <P>On the second issue of mistakes being made the ambassador said:</P>
    <P>We know that all criminal justice systems are vulnerable to error.  It can take time, sometimes years, before such errors come to light.  When injustice is uncovered it is in most cases possible for a state to release the person wrongfully convicted, to make reparation and to seek to restore that person to his or her place in society.  Where the death penalty has been applied and an innocent person has been executed we are powerless to remedy the injustice.</P>
    <P>On the question of alternatives and other means available, the point is well made by the ambassador:</P>
    <P>It is argued in defence of the death penalty that society must take measures against those who threaten its essential fabric.  We fully recognise the concerns of those who make this argument.  All governments seek to put in place appropriate preventative and punitive measures to protect the security of the State and the lives of citizens.  We believe, however, that the challenge must be to shape and implement such measures without resort to the ultimate and irrevocable sanction of the death penalty.  We are convinced that with sufficient conviction on the part of states this challenge can be met.</P>
    <P>That underlines the nature of a true democratic society.  Policy on this matter does not depend on the Government of the day because there is such widespread agreement.  The Ambassador concluded:</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most persuasive argument that we can offer . in addressing the issue of the death penalty . is the human factor.  Can any system of justice, no matter how carefully elaborated, be one hundred per cent proof against human frailty?  Amnesty International has quoted Lafayette who said in 1830 &ldquo;I shall ask for the abolition of the death penalty until <Col N="176" /> I have the infallibility of human judgment demonstrated to me&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I concur with the sentiments expressed by Ambassador Anderson in March 1997.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the action Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Karla Faye Tucker case.  The expressions of regret and sympathy have been well made and, unfortunately, we cannot turn back the clock.  I add my voice to the expressions of regret.  The Minister wrote to Governor Bush yesterday stating:</P>
    <P>I am appalled to hear that it is intended to proceed with the execution today of Ms Karla Faye Tucker.  In my view, such executions are a setback for the goal we share of universal respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>He made an unsuccessful appeal to stay the execution.  The Minister also wrote to the US Ambassador, Her Excellency Mrs. Jean Kennedy Smith stating:</P>
    <P>. such executions are a setback for the goal we share of universal respect for human rights. We, in Ireland, view this issue very much from a human rights perspective and we lay particular stress on the need to protect that most fundamental of human rights, the right to life.  It is our firm belief that the State has a duty to safeguard that right and we are, therefore, totally opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>We have a lot of work to do before we can secure the universal abolition of the death penalty. The 54th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva will take place on 16 March.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated the Irish position and we will adopt a strong position in favour of a worldwide abolition of capital punishment.  It is our firm conviction that the abolition of the death penalty as an instrument of judicial punishment would contribute to the enhancement of human dignity and the progressive development of human rights throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have attended this debate. Sadly, our views were not acted upon in the Karla Faye Tucker case.  However, the sentiments expressed across party lines reflect the feelings of the people on this issue.  The principles were set out by the Members and I hope I have encapsulated them appropriately.  I also hope the public appreciates that the time of the House was well used with this debate.  We hope that in some way Irish foreign policy on this issue will have an influence in the future.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to be realistic, in the same vein as many Senators, in saying that there are many countries and states of the US who have taken decisions on this matter for whatever reasons.  We find the death penalty abhorrent and reprehensible and we object strongly to it.  There is a lot of work to do and we cannot presume that we can change the world overnight.  However, let us try to do it in the various international fora, especially within the UN system.  An Irish person <Col N="177" /> is now UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  I thank Senators for their contributions and I hope my comments were of some benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for attending.  This request is a plea from the heart.  It gives me no satisfaction to raise this matter. Last Tuesday I received a number of telephone calls from constituents in Dublin North informing me that the Mary Queen of Ireland national school, Toberburr, St. Margaret's, had to close and send the children home because there was no heating oil.  The problem that day was oil, it could have been electricity on another day.  The principal was fortunate to receive a capitation grant late last week or early this week and oil was delivered on Tuesday night.  Thankfully, the school is again open.  There is major concern in Toberburr as the school cannot keep going financially on the basis of the capitation grant it receives.</P>
      <P>There is a perception that St. Margaret's is an affluent area.  However, the main catchment area for this school is a local authority estate of 173 houses.  A high percentage of the parents are unemployed and few are in a position to make voluntary contributions to the school.  The school has been broken into on a number of occasions. The Department is aware that fencing is required. However, the lack of such fencing has resulted in insurance costs going sky high.  This a major problem for the board of management which is facing an ongoing financial deficit.  Various boards have made efforts to eliminate this deficit by organising raffles, sales of work and so on. However, they cannot reduce the main deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The annual education budget is £2.5 billion.  I am not playing politics but we are talking about the education of 93 children.  Parents wish to see the Department of Education and Science assisting them.  Could the Minister arrange for his officials to meet the board of management and apprise themselves of the situation?  The Minister should use any loophole in the existing mechanism to make a once-off offer of assistance to relieve the school of its debts.  Toberburr has socio-economic problems and should qualify for the disadvantaged areas scheme or Breaking the Cycle.  These schemes have been reviewed. However, through these or any other scheme, I plead with the Minister to help the board of management of this school.  If this was done the parents <Col N="178" /> would put their shoulders to the wheel to ensure that the school prospered.  This would remove the possibility of closure in the weeks and months to come because of an outstanding bill. The school is prospering educationally and I plead with the Minister to see what can be done to help it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that my Department had no advance notice of the closure of the school in question.  However, I have requested my officials to investigate the circumstances which gave rise to the lack of heating and the consequent closure of the school.  I can assure the House that I would be seriously concerned at any suggestion that the closure arose from an inability on the part of the school to pay for the necessary heating.  This is particularly so in view of the fact that, in accordance with standard practice, capitation funding amounting to £3,255 was issued to the school in question on 30 January 1998.  This allocation represents 70 per cent of the total annual capitation funding due to the school. The balance will fall to be paid on 30 June 1998.</P>
      <P>Capitation funding is specifically intended to meet schools' heating, lighting and general operating costs.  The procedures surrounding such allocations and the timing of payments are well understood by all schools.  School managements have a responsibility to manage their financial affairs in a prudent manner and having regard to the level and timing of such payments.</P>
      <P>In the absence of precise details on the circumstances surrounding the lack of heating and the closure of this particular school, and in view of the payment to which I referred, there is little point in speculating further on the matter at this stage.  I am aware that Mary Queen of Ireland national school has requested that it be designated as disadvantaged.  The House will wish to be aware that the question of educational disadvantage and my Department's response to this problem has been the subject of detailed study by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Education Research Centre.  One of the key outcomes from these studies was a recommendation that disadvantaged status be confined to 16 per cent of the school-going population.  In this connection, it was noted that the present disadvantaged area supports already extended to more than 17 per cent of pupils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The studies also recommended that a more targeted approach be adopted, with resources being directed towards the most disadvantaged urban and rural areas.  In response to these studies, a pilot project aimed at breaking the cycle of disadvantage was introduced in 1996.  I understand that the school in question applied for inclusion in the element of this project which focused on schools with fewer than five teachers.  Unfortunately, the school was not among those chosen by the Education Research Centre for inclusion in the project on this occasion.  The operation of this project <Col N="179" /> is being closely monitored at present and its effectiveness is being evaluated by the Education Research Centre.</P>
    <P>I should also advise the House that I am currently conducting a review of the range of special support services currently delivered by my Department to combat educational disadvantage. My objective is to ensure that all available resources are targeted to best effect.  I am especially anxious to ensure that educationally disadvantaged children, whether they be in large groups or in smaller isolated areas, are given the <Col N="180" /> supports necessary to enable them to maximise their potential in the education system.</P>
    <P>However, I am aware of the specific concerns of Mary Queen of Ireland National School and I have discussed these issues on a number of occasions with my colleague, Councillor Michael Kennedy.  I assure the House that the needs of the school will be fully considered in the context of any developments which may be undertaken in this area.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 February 1998.</P>
