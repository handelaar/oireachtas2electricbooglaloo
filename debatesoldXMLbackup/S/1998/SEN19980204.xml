      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to appoint as a matter of urgency a consultant for the Lough Lene water treatment plant at Collinstown, County Westmeath, to improve the drinking water supply to north Meath and north Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Brendan Ryan of the following matter:</P>

    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Dan Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve stage four of the north Kerry water scheme.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to establish immediately the Tipperary Rural and Business Development Institute as a company as the failure to do so is hindering the successful completion of the project.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Seán Ryan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the closure of Mary Queen of Ireland national school, Toberburr, St. Margaret's, County Dublin, due to lack of <Col N="3" /> heating and the need for the school to be designated disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Rory Kiely of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine a case involving a charge of dangerous driving which resulted in the death of a person from County Limerick.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senator Cassidy and Senator Brendan Ryan as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Costello, Dan Kiely, O'Meara, Seán Ryan and Rory Kiely may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was with regret that we learned of the death of Patsy Lawlor a former Member of the House.  Although her time in the House was relatively short, from 1981-82, she displayed great commitment in her role as a representative of the people of County Kildare.  She first entered public life in 1974 when she successfully contested local elections.  She became the first woman to chair Kildare County Council and Kildare VEC. She was highly respected for her role in the ICA, another great passion of hers.  She founded the Kill Guild in 1961 and in true form she went on to become its national president.</P>
      <P>It has been said that every generation produces a uniquely gifted and talented person and Patsy was such a person.  One could not fail to be touched by her warmth, humanity and drive to achieve her goals.  She will be deeply missed by the people of County Kildare.  On behalf of the House and Fianna Fáil I extend our condolences to her husband Tony, her daughter Miriam, her sons Kevin, Anthony and Philip and to the Fine Gael Party.  Go ndéanadh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express sympathy to the Gibbons family on the death of Jim Gibbons, a former distinguished Member of Dáil Éireann and Fianna Fáil.  As a member of Kilkenny County Council from 1954-67 he learned at first hand the concerns of his constituents.  His time as a member of the county committee on agriculture, which he chaired from 1955-65 and his membership of the National Farmers Association, now the Irish Farmers Association, served as a good apprenticeship for his two terms as Minister for Agriculture.  As Minister, Jim Gibbons played a key role in the agricultural side of our EEC membership negotiations and in the commencement of the process of the amalgamation of the State's creameries.  During his second period as Minister for Agriculture he <Col N="4" /> successfully solved the problem of access for Irish lamb to the French market.</P>
    <P>One could admire the personal courage he showed in facing down political adversity during his career and, more recently, his calm fortitude in coping with his failing health over a long period.  On behalf of the House and Fianna Fáil I extend our condolences to his widow Margaret and his four surviving sons, especially our colleague, Senator Gibbons, on their sad loss.  Go ndéanadh Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Members I wish to extend our sympathy on the death of our former colleague Patsy Lawlor who served here in 1981-2; her election in 1981 followed on a narrow defeat in the general election.  She had many qualities which she used to the full on behalf of the people of County Kildare and to the benefit of anyone who required her assistance.  Her attractive personality was directed with energy and enthusiasm to the task in hand.  Her life was dedicated to the welfare of others, particularly the less well off. She worked tirelessly on their behalf on Kildare County Council, Kildare VEC, Naas UDC and served in many roles as Chair of Kildare County Council.  She was also one of the first chairpersons of the General Council of County Councils.  Patsy performed with distinction and remarkable variety and possessed an almost inexhaustible talent in speech and, sometimes, in song.  She was also President of the ICA from 1976-9.  Her knowledge and skill were of immense benefit when appointed to the Arts Council in 1975.</P>
      <P>Patsy Lawlor had an extraordinary knowledge of the people and politics of County Kildare and was widely respected throughout the county and country by colleagues of all colours and creeds. This was evidenced by the many people who came from far and wide to her funeral.  She was a great follower of sports whether following the fate of the Lily Whites in Gaelic football, attending race meetings or rugby matches.  Patsy was particularly honoured when her son, Phil, achieved the highest honour in rugby and was capped several times for Ireland.</P>
      <P>Those of us who were privileged to know Patsy Lawlor knew a loyal friend who was steadfast in her views which she expressed fairly and fearlessly when required.  To quote the words of Councillor Michael McWey who delivered the oration at her funeral: &ldquo;There is a void created in the political and social life of the community that will be impossible to fill&rdquo;.  While she is a great loss to her colleagues in Fine Gael and her other friends, the loss is greater for her husband, Tony, and her family, Philip, Anthony, Miriam and Kevin.  We send our sympathies to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to be associated with the Leader's remarks on the late Jim Gibbons who served his constituency and the country as a Minister with honour and distinction.  We extend <Col N="5" /> our deepest sympathies to his son, Senator Jim Gibbons, his widow and other members of his family.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent group I would like to be associated with the remarks made by Senators Cassidy and Cosgrave.  I was elected on the same day as Patsy Lawlor in 1981. She made an initial and sharp impression on this House in which she served for far too short a time.  She was one of the typically unsung heroines of Irish political life who do great service in their communities.  Patsy was elected to many local posts but served in this House for a very short time.  She might have served in the Dáil for a long time if matters had been different.  In 1981 she was defeated by less than 50 votes but she would have made an extremely fine TD had she been elected.  My sympathy and that of my colleagues go to her family.</P>
      <P>I would also like to be associated with the remarks about the former Minister, Jim Gibbons. Everyone knows that he showed enormous integrity in controversial circumstances throughout the 1970s and 1980s.  He was not as successful as others in holding his position in both Houses.  However, he takes his integrity to the grave with him and this is something with which his family can identify and be proud of.  We have great sympathy for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy and condolences to Senator Jim Gibbons and his family on the death of his father and to the family of Patsy Lawlor on her death.  I was not a Member of this House when Patsy served but I knew her quite well as a member of the vocational education committee and the General Council of County Councils.  As an aspiring Senator I had reason to visit her and seek her vote.  She was an extraordinary businesswoman who was interested in local activities and the arts.  She had enormous energy, dedication and vitality and served her country well on a local and national basis.</P>
      <P>I did not know Jim Gibbons personally but I knew him well in terms of that extraordinary period in Irish history in which he was embroiled. He served his country loyally and with integrity during the most difficult of times and I pay tribute to him for his work then.  It must have been a traumatic experience for him and his family.  I extend my sympathy and that of the Labour Party on the deaths of these former Oireachtas Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats and as a colleague of Patsy Lawlor on Kildare County Council I, too, join in the expressions of sympathy.  If one thing above all could be said about her it is that she was a tremendous character and those of us who served with her on the county council will remember her for that.  She was known throughout County <Col N="6" /> Kildare.  She would have been dismissive of eulogies, especially with regard to herself.  It is something that should be borne in mind today.</P>
      <P>It was my privilege to serve with Patsy Lawlor on the county council.  She first came to national prominence as president of the ICA.  She served with great distinction and enhanced the standing of that body.  Her achievements in local government have been catalogued in terms of her chairmanship of Kildare County Council, the VEC and being the first woman to chair the General Council of County Councils.  She could have filled more senior political posts with distinction had the cards fallen for her in that way.</P>
      <P>Patsy Lawlor was a colourful person and was larger than life.  She had little time for pomposity or sham.  She was also fiercely independent in every respect, both personally and in her politics. What one saw was what one got.  She had a definite way of putting people in their place with just a word or two.  There was no better woman to do so at county council meetings or elsewhere. She was a generous and gregarious person and could hold her own with the best when it came to a song or story at some of the gatherings after council meetings.  She will be sorely missed by her colleagues on Kildare County Council and the wider community in County Kildare.  It is good to see that her son Tony will fill her place on the council.  We extend our sympathy to her husband Tony and her family.</P>
      <P>In mourning the late Jim Gibbons and in joining with the expressions of sympathy to his wife Peggy, his son Senator Jim Gibbons, who is with us here today, and his large family we mourn the passing of a patriotic Irishman of the first rank.  He was a representative who gave outstanding public service, a dedicated and effective Minister and a person of shining and fearless integrity.  He was also a man of considerable learning, wit and artistic talents and he carried the gifts he had lightly and modestly.</P>
      <P>I could not improve on the words spoken at the funeral mass for Jim Gibbons in Kilkenny by his colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy.  Speaking on behalf of those who served with Jim at a time of great stress he referred to his exemplary life, its successes and disappointments and went on to say how much they admired his judgment, knowledge, loyalty, scrupulous honesty and shining integrity.</P>
      <P>Jim Gibbons helped to bring this nation through some very dark days and there could have been disastrous consequences without his presence and the presence of some others.  As Minister for Defence he defended the integrity of the Defence Forces and he fulfilled his constitutional duty unflinchingly.  The nation is in his debt.  He was instrumental in introducing third level education for young military officers, which is worth recording as an achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="7" /> We also owe him a debt for the terms he secured with Dr. Paddy Hillery for Irish agriculture under the CAP when he was Minister for Agriculture in the 1970-3 period in the lead up to Ireland joining the then Common Market. He consolidated these gains during his second term as Minister for Agriculture.  He was also a Member of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The courage Jim Gibbons showed in politics was also evident in his personal life and in the way he dealt with a protracted illness.  Another achievement which should be recorded, and of which he was immensely proud, was the transfer of Kilkenny Castle into public ownership and the protection of the building, the parks and the surrounds of the castle.  Other historic buildings in Kilkenny were also preserved and restored under his influence.</P>
    <P>It must have been a matter of great personal satisfaction to him to see his son Martin elected to Dáil Éireann in 1987 and to see his son Jim join us in the Seanad last autumn.  Of the late Jim Gibbons it can truly be said &ldquo;ní fheicimid a leithéid arís ann&rdquo;.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in expressing my sympathy to the Gibbons family. As a constituency colleague of the late Jim Gibbons, I remember the fantastic work he did at local and national level.  His commitment to Kilkenny, Ireland and Europe was massive.  Jim accomplished a great deal in the area of agricultural education.  The Dalton College, initiated by Jim Gibbons, is a shining example of what agricultural education should be.</P>
      <P>Jim Gibbons achieved great success with the military college and the amalgamation of creameries.  He was also involved in setting up Avonmore creamery out of whose small beginnings a tremendous agribusiness has grown. The take-over of Kilkenny Castle was hugely successful and stands as a monument to the foresight of Jim Gibbons.  It would be fitting for that to be remembered in a lasting way by the Office of Public Works at some stage.  Jim Gibbons's interest in Rothe House in Kilkenny is a shining example of how a Minister was able to put his finger on the pulse of what was required to preserve and renovate our older buildings.</P>
      <P>Away from politics, Jim Gibbons was an very well read man.  He often sang in the company of his friends and was an extremely vivacious person.  As far as Kilkenny is concerned, he will be sorely missed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Gibbons family has played an important part in the politics of Kilkenny and Ireland.  A picture was presented recently to Jim's uncle, the late Séamus Mac Gibbiún.  Jim son's Martin served on Kilkenny County Council and in the Dáil and his son, Jim, is a Senator in this House. Both in terms of political life and personal commitment, the Gibbons family has given a <Col N="8" /> huge amount of energy to Ireland.  Jim Gibbons will be remembered at international, national and county level and I join in the votes of sympathy which have been extended to his family on his death.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1, 2 and 10, motion 13.  Item 1 is to be taken without debate.  Item 10, motion 13, is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. If the proceedings on the Committee Stage of item 2 have not previously concluded, they will resume at 8 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. Will the Leader facilitate the Opposition groups by letting us know what business is to be taken a couple of weeks in advance?  It is very difficult for the Opposition to organise properly when we are told the business on the Thursday or Friday of the preceding week.  If, as was done in the previous Seanad, he could give an outline list of the business for the next two or three weeks rather than the 100 Bills which are promised, it would enable the Opposition to prepare better for their duties.</P>
      <P>A specific promise was made during the previous Seanad that the foreign adoptions Bill would be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  I have raised this on a number of occasions but I have held off from taking any action because I was told legal advice was being sought from the Attorney General.  Has that advice been received?  Does it differ from the advice given by the previous Attorney General?  What is going to happen in regard to this Bill?  I remind the Leader and the Government parties that a specific promise was made by the parties now on this side of the House that the Bill would be a priority and would be put on the Statute Book at the earliest moment.  We on this side of the House have been very patient but we are asking for action now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much of what was said by Senator Manning, especially in regard to giving the Opposition notice of business.  I also support the points made about the foreign adoptions Bill.  When Senator Manning was the Leader of the House he gave a commitment that if he had any influence with the new Government he would see the Adoption (No. 2) Bill was introduced.  The then Leader of the Opposition gave a commitment that Fianna Fáil would do the same.  I fully concur with the points he made.  It <Col N="9" /> is crucially important that the legal advice sought is received.  Many people are very insecure about adoptions and await the outcome of this proposed legislation.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange a debate on industrial relations as a matter of urgency?  It is fair to say his party has a strong record for introducing legislation in this area.  The Taoiseach introduced the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.</P>
      <P>The House has previously discussed the question of semi-State bodies and we argued for many years about the support needed by such bodies.  I argued against the expansion of Ryanair, although I accepted its importance. However, it is important to recognise that Government decisions gave Ryanair its routes to Stansted, Zurich and Liverpool, on which a great deal of work had been done by the semi-State company, Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>We have all worked to restrictions.  We have always said industrial relations are for everyone. It is beyond belief that Ryanair, with its huge profits, to which it is entitled, should deprive the workers of articulating their views.  This debate must take place as a matter of urgency.  There is a great deal of unhappiness and worry in the trade union movement about the outcome of this matter.</P>
      <P>I realise I have said more than I should at this point.  However, it is important that an issue be examined when even Senator Ross and I agree on it.  Ryanair is to be condemned for its contemptuous attitude towards the industrial relations structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that we should have an early debate on industrial relations.  One of our last debates before the recess was when the Tánaiste came to the House to discuss Seagate and we found there was quite a vacuum in Seagate in terms of industrial relations.  We now find that, despite making enormous profits, Ryanair is contemptuous of its workers.  I am in wholehearted agreement with the call for an early debate on that issue.</P>
      <P>The Labour group will not be supporting item 1 on the Order of Business.  The House rarely exceeded the curtailed time for the Order of Business which was suggested for the weeks prior to the Christmas recess.  It would be better if we were to operate with a guideline rather than a guillotine. The Labour Party is very unhappy with the fact that we come tenth in any debate, whether on a Bill, a motion or any other matter before the House and the manner in which we are treated in terms of time allocated to us.</P>
      <P>It was decided before the recess and at the suggestion of Senator Norris that we visit St. Ita's in Portrane.  I suggest we do that at an early stage because of the controversy which has arisen in the past month over letters sent out dealing with the treatment of patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="10" /> Can we have an early debate on Northern Ireland?  I know there was a special request that there be a debate in the other House on this issue. The peace talks are reaching a critical stage, there will be an inquiry into the events surrounding Bloody Sunday and, over the Christmas period, a tremendous number of deaths and attacks of a sectarian nature took place.  It is appropriate for the House to condemn what it sees as the obscenities which have taken place and to lend its support to the peace talks and other positive developments.</P>

      <P>A report issued in recent weeks confirms an alarming increase in the number of women and children fleeing from violence in the home and seeking succour in women's refuges. This is an appalling indictment on a society which deems itself to be civilised and Christian.  Will the Leader organise for the appropriate Minister to outline to the House what new initiatives this Government proposes to take to tackle and confront this appalling and unacceptable situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the offer of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, to concerned parents to inquire into the abuse of young swimmers over a long period.  If the findings of any such inquiry are not to the satisfaction of the families who have suffered great trauma &mdash; the first report was in 1981 and the man concerned was only sentenced recently &mdash; will the Minister then proceed by way of judicial tribunal to inquire into that awful matter? Will he also extend our sympathy to all the people involved, parents and children?</P>
      <P>I also welcome the Government's positive response to Deputy Shatter's Bill on the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  I am very pleased with that.  I am interested in hearing the Leader's response to my request concerning the tribunal of inquiry.</P>

      <P>Under current regulations, an applicant for a small public service vehicle licence, be they a taxi, hackney or minibus driver, must make a declaration that he is available for work 40 hours per week.  As a consequence, it is not possible to grant such a licence to a person who continues to work in another employment. The situation up to now was that part-time licences were granted and renewed, but no new part-time licences have been granted over the past number of years.  This has arisen from an interpretation of the Attorney General's Office. It makes life almost impossible for small time taxi and hackney owners because they have to employ full-time drivers and they cannot afford it.  Who will then relieve them when they want a break or holiday?  Will the Leader convey my concerns and those of Members and have the relevant amending regulations introduced?</P>

      <P>Will the Leader write to the chairpersons of all Oireachtas committees to tell them that 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday is not an appropriate time for an important meeting?  Yet again these matters have clashed, and it betrays the contempt of the Upper House.  The Order of Business in the Dáil does not clash with the meeting of a significant committee.  This happened with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs today.  I protested and was told it would not happen again, but it does.  I support Senator Manning's comments on the foreign adoptions legislation.  I have received correspondence on this matter.</P>
      <P>I refer to item 9 on the Amsterdam Treaty.  Is this the form in which the House wishes to discuss this matter?  It seems to include a section found offensive in the Dáil and which was removed from the Dáil Order Paper.  The section states:</P>
      <P>The State may exercise the options or discretions provided by the Treaties referred to in subsections 3º, 4º and 5º.</P>
      <P>I understood that this was dropped in the other House after consultation.  Will we discuss this text or will appropriate amendments be made to it?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader provide time for a debate on Algeria?  My colleagues on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs would be interested in such a debate.  I have tabled a motion on this, but it should be taken as an all-party motion rather than one from the Independent group.  I would also be grateful for a debate on genetic engineering.  I raised this matter in the last session with reference to Monsanto, and I was assured it was a once-off event.  The company now proposes to carry out another ten experiments.  That is exactly what those of us against these experiments predicted.  This is a most unreliable firm which is not welcomed anywhere in the world.  It would be a great shame if Ireland became a dumping ground for these genetic experiments.</P>
      <P>I welcome the support of my friend, neighbour and colleague Senator Costello for my suggestion that we visit St. Ita's Hospital.  I have been in touch with the Eastern Health Board, and I would be happy if an arrangement could be made for us to visit the hospital, formally or informally. The endorsement of the Seanad for this investigation would be welcomed.</P>

      <P>Before the Christmas recess I requested a debate on the dispute between communities and those erecting pylons for telephones and other purposes.  This matter has become very serious.  In my county Esat Digifone has resorted to working at night in order to build in spite of the community.  Democracy must be seen to work.  People are asking for a tribunal on this matter.  Have the Garda authorities come to an agreement with Esat Digifone?  That company is planning to erect a mast to carry a telephone line within ten feet of a house in Castlefin in <Col N="12" /> Donegal.  I want an honest debate on this matter. It is of national importance.  There is no point in saying we will have a conference and give people tickets to attend it.  This is a matter for Parliament.  Has a deal been made behind the community's back?  If so, we want to know what it is.</P>

      <P>Like Senators Costello and Norris, I expressed concern before Christmas about St. Ita's.  In view of the most recent developments I do not think a visit by Members would be sufficient.  If they visit they will find a very bad situation, but I assure them that conditions have improved considerably when compared to the situation when I first visited there 25 years ago.</P>
      <P>During the Christmas recess guardians and parents were asked for permission to allow patients to take part in a drugs trial.  There is no evidence of any protocol being produced for the board.  I wrote to the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health and Children to ask if the hospital had an ethics committee to which trials would be referred before being undertaken. I have not had replies to either letter.</P>
      <P>The inspector of mental hospitals produces an annual report which is never debated in this House.  The most recent report before the Houses of the Oireachtas is for 1995.  Such important issues are not brought before the Oireachtas for debate while reports on hake, monkfish, etc.  are. I wonder why the inspector bothers to visit the mental hospitals.  On reading his reports Senators would find they contain very useful information which could be applied very well to St. Ita's.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader organise for the Minister for Health and Children to produce the 1996 report and to come before the House to debate these reports and let us know the status of the mental health Bill?  It is ridiculous that we are working on regulations which are 43 years old.</P>

      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Leader to a statement made by the president of the Irish Farmers Association that it intends to monitor the big supermarket chains to ensure they honour the commitments given in regard to purchasing from Irish suppliers. I would like the Leader to take up this matter with the appropriate Ministers with a view to encouraging dialogue with the supermarkets and to show the just claim which exists among Irish producers and customers to have this matter examined.  We are all aware of the ever increasing control of overseas supermarkets on the Irish retail sector.  Last year Tesco, the supermarket giant, purchased 25 per cent of the grocery trade <Col N="13" /> in Ireland.  Overall, Tesco has four times the total grocery trade in Ireland that it has in other countries; it is 18 times bigger than its nearest competitor in Ireland.  I would like the supermarkets to be asked to demonstrate their loyalty to the country, the customers and the producers.  They are making substantial profits from the Irish market.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader provide for a debate on health matters, something for which I have called on numerous occasions, particularly in view of ongoing concerns about the possibility of transmission of new variant CJD through the blood supply?  The Leader gave a commitment that we would debate this matter in this session.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator McGowan's statement in relation to concerns in many communities regarding the possible health effects of mobile telephone transmitters.  I remind the House that a number of months ago we tabled a motion, No. 10 on the Order Paper, calling for a debate on this issue.  I would appreciate if the Leader would take account of this and the concerns expressed on his side of the House and facilitate an early debate on the issue.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I have serious difficulty understanding why item 9 &mdash; to have one question put to the people in the referendum concerning ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty &mdash; appears on the Order Paper.  The proposal is that there would be two clauses, one to ratify the Treaty and the other to give wider discretion to the State to engage in actions at European level without referring to the Irish people.  There should be one simple question on the ratification of the Treaty.  If the question is put in the form which is presented here many people who might like to support the Treaty will have to vote against it because of the second subclause.  My party leader put this forcefully to the Taoiseach on Monday and I am glad the Government has taken account of our view and has decided to withdraw the proposed wording in the Dáil.  In the light of that I fail to understand why the proposal is still before this House.  It is said that a good start is half the work but I am afraid that a good start has not been made in this matter . I hope that the success of the campaign has not been jeopardised.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to withdraw item 9 from the Order of Business, to inform the Seanad when the new wording will be put before the House and to ask the Taoiseach for a commitment that adequate time will be allowed for a debate both in the Houses of the Oireachtas and in the wider community.</P>

It is tagged on as an afterthought to <Col N="14" /> the Environmental Protection Agency legislation which is the only legislation we have.  Serious ethical questions arise but the most exciting advances in relation to disease control and cure will come from this area.  We need an informed and open debate.  We would do a great public service by having such a debate.</P>
      <P>Can the Leader consider a discussion on the potential cost and chaos caused by the millennium bug?  Can he ask the Minister for Finance to come into the House to report Government plans to adapt public sector technology to the change of date?  There will be huge implications if we do not get this right.  I ask for a discussion, not sterile statements and not a charged debate.  Members could listen to the Minister and he could then answer our queries.

      <P>We have observed the most extraordinary and sickening brutality unfold in the United States ending at midnight last night with the execution of Karla Faye Tucker.  This was the most brutal spectacle I have had to witness in recent years. There is a feeling of revulsion in our society and throughout the western world outside of the United States at the death penalty in general but this exercise, carried out 15 years after the offence was committed, has caused a particular level of revulsion.  This House and the parliaments of all civilised democracies &mdash; to which the US has a decreasing right to belong &mdash; must state that a country cannot be included in the company of civilised nations if it continues to indulge in the spectacle of judicial murder in the name of vengeance.

The House should express its regret that such justice is meted out to prisoners in this day and age.  No democracy or free society should carry out such a practice in the name of justice. The dramatic news of the execution stirred many people in Ireland.  It is a most uncivilised occurrence in a free democracy and in a country that has such high standing on the international stage. The United States is a world power which has done a great deal for people in other countries and this judicial practice is not in its best interests.</P>

Rather disturbingly, an IDA spokesman was quoted in the local press as having said that the building might be broken up and disposed of. That would be a tragedy for the area.

      <P>In view of the Seanad's decision to invite distinguished visitors to the House from time to time, it might be appropriate for the Cathaoirleach to invite the American Ambassador to the House to explain why the United States still approves and carries out judicial killing.  It would be doing us a great service if Mrs. Kennedy-Smith, who comes from a great liberal family, came to the House to tell us why this goes on and the justification for it.  I would welcome her presence in the House and perhaps the Leader could put that on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and issue such an invitation to the ambassador.

I suggest the Leader allocate time tomorrow to deal with the matter so that those who want to contribute may do so by way of brief statements.</P>
    <P>It should be said, as a matter of considerable satisfaction, that we do not and have not had the practice of judicial murder for a consider length of time.  It should also be said that there are states within the United States which do not practise capital punishment.

I call for a debate on unruly, difficult and problem children who form a small section of our community. Many women with problem children have taken to the national airwaves crying out for help. Despite all the psychiatrists, psychologists and services available, nobody seems to be able to do anything for this small number of young people who are disruptive in school and at home.  We should have a debate on this matter and come up with a solution to help those people.  There should be a secure place for and professionals to deal with these young people rather than allow this terrible disruption continue and have mothers cry out for help over the airwaves.</P>

I also support the other remarks on the need for a debate on this issue. While it has been highlighted that this was the first woman to be executed in the State of Texas for about 150 years, what is most abhorrent in this and other cases of judicial murder is that she spent a number of years in a correctional institution and has been murdered despite showing that she has changed since her conviction.  That makes the execution all the more inhumane and outrageous.</P>

I welcome the Tánaiste's efforts after the initial shock announcement, when she went to Clonmel to meet the workers. There is now grave concern within the county, <Col N="18" /> particularly among the workforce, that nothing positive has happened other than the setting up of a task force.  While that is welcome, these unfortunate workers are concerned about where they will get other jobs.  Will the Leader contact the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste about this matter?

President Yeltsin spoke today not of a Middle Eastern war but a world war, so we should discuss that as a matter of urgency.  We should discuss the genocide in Algeria but equally we should discuss Palestinian-Israeli affairs.  People are beginning to talk not of the Middle East peace process but of a war process.  Those matters are in a particularly dangerous phase so we should have a foreign affairs debate to cover those items.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Ridge in congratulating the Minister on his efforts.  There has been a number of highly publicised cases against individuals and the parents of abused children will be met. However, institutionalised violence has been committed against orphaned children, who were physically and sexually abused for many years and had no parents to whom to turn for comfort and solace.  Institutionalised violence was not confined to a small number of incidents &mdash; in my home town, great depravity took place in institutions for many years.  This is being addressed through the courts but we must face it as a society.  This did not only happen in swimming clubs, it occurred in GAA clubs, rugby clubs and every sporting circle.  The publicised cases may result in the IASA being taken to task, which would be beneficial to a small group of people, but we should remember that as a society we have failed orphans and those placed in the care of institutions.  We should not discuss only one instance, we should address the broader issue of how we care for children in our society and how we can ensure that children in institutions are not abused.</P>
      <P>I agree we should have a debate on capital punishment but it would be better to have it tomorrow. I have been highly critical of such punishment for many years.  If we have such a debate we should also address the practice in Saudi Arabia, Iran, China and elsewhere because America is not the only country where institutionalised murder takes place.  In discussing last night's highly publicised murder, for that is what it is, we must consider all places where capital punishment exists.</P>

      <P>I support the call by Senator McGowan and Senator Gallagher for an early debate on telecommunications masts, attended by the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke.  During the last session I twice called for such a debate.  At that time Esat sought to impose masts on two communities in Donegal and as Senator McGowan said there are two more such cases at present.  As regards the two previous cases I was assured by the Minister's office that there would be a conference in March and legislation would be introduced in the autumn, but that does not address the genuine fears of communities which are threatened with the imposition of these masts on a weekly basis.  The Minister should intervene to halt the erection of these masts at least until after the conference.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should also intervene in light of the recent agreement between the Garda authorities and Esat.  People have genuine fears and while there may be no danger to health, it is not good enough for the Minister's office to say the issue is being monitored on a regular basis, because people do not believe that.  The erection of masts should be postponed until people are reassured there is no danger.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of Northern Ireland, which I mentioned on a number of occasions during the previous session.  I want the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House as soon as possible to update Members on the current position.  As Members are aware, the situation there deteriorated drastically over Christmas.  While I congratulate the British Prime Minister for announcing the establishment of a new inquiry into Bloody Sunday, I am sure Members were astounded by the performance of Mr. Trimble in the House of Commons.  He should slow down and stop running away.  He should face the reality of the situation in Northern Ireland.</P>

I remind the House that members of the GAA helped to calm the situation and to solve problems after the foundation of the State.

People are concerned that such abuse is taking place and they welcome the action of the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation. However, the community wants longer mandatory sentences for such offences.  In addition, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should make the Judiciary aware that victims of these crimes need empathy if they wish to give evidence in court.  The community wants the support of the Judiciary in that regard.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, the fact that the Guardian PMPA insurance company increased its car insurance rates for people in County Louth by a massive amount recently? Despite the fact that the PMPA promised the previous week that it would reduce loading for younger drivers and make it easier for them to get insurance, it levied a 30 per cent increase on new business in County Louth.  This is disgraceful.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask if a meeting took place between Guardian PMPA and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, or the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Treacy, about these increases?  Were they discussed with the Ministers before they were announced?  If so, what effort, if any, did the Ministers make to dissuade the company from imposing the increases on people in County Louth, especially since two-thirds of accidents in County Louth are caused by drivers from outside the county?  While I acknowledge that County Louth has the highest rate of fatal road accidents, the people of the county are being penalised for accidents which they do not cause.</P>

    <P>Senator Ross requested a debate on EMU.  I will facilitate him at the earliest possible opportunity. Such a debate was held recently, but if Members want a discussion on particular aspects in the near future, I will arrange it.</P>

      <P>Senator Lanigan asked for a debate on foreign affairs and I will arrange time for that.  Senator Burke raised the issue of local authority funding, an issue of great concern to local authority members.  Debate on the Appropriation Bill may allow him to raise his concerns.  Senator Ó Murchú raised the supermarket chains and family shops; the Appropriation Bill may provide the first opportunity for the Senator to highlight his concerns.  Senator Gallagher sought a debate on CJD and I will facilitate him.  Senator O'Toole and Senator Avril Doyle sought a discussion on the millennium bug.  I will contact the Department of Finance to arrange time to discuss their concerns.</P>
      <P>Senators Brendan Ryan, Chambers, Dardis, Ross, Jackman, O'Meara and Quinn referred to yesterday's events in the US.

      <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 42 are related and will be discussed together by agreement.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 16 and 17, to delete subsection (2) and substitute the following subsections:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Part 1 and section 34 shall come into operation on the date of the passing of this Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 provides that the transitional arrangements set out in Part VIII of the Bill will come into effect one month after the Act is passed.  As the Bill now stands, the transitional board shall stand established on the day of the enactment of the Bill.  This gives rise to practical difficulties with regard to the operation of the selection procedures envisaged under section 36 which provides for the membership of the transitional board.  The main purpose of this amendment, therefore, is to allow time for the nomination arrangements envisaged under section 36 to be brought into effect.  It would be more practical, for example, for the election arrangements for members of the Judiciary to be carried out after the enactment of the relevant provisions.</P>
      <P>I assure Senators that while I am satisfied that this amendment is necessary for the reasons I have outlined, I do not envisage it delaying, in any significant way, the establishment of the transitional board or ultimately the courts service. Much informal preparation in respect of the membership of the transitional board will be carried out before the Bill is enacted.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 42 is a related amendment. Section 36 provides that provisions of the Act relating to the board or the service will also apply to the transitional boards and references to the establishment date in those provisions are to be construed as references to the date of the passing of the Act.  The reference to the date of the passing of the Act must now be adjusted as, under amendment No. 1, all of the transitional provisions will come into effect one month after the passing of the Act.  This amendment inserts the new reference in section 36 which will now be a reference to the date of coming into operation of Part VIII of the Bill relating to the transitional board.</P>

      <P>Government amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), line 3, to delete the definition of &ldquo;the Service&rdquo; and substitute the following: &ldquo;&lsquo;the Service&rsquo; means the body established by section 4(1);&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a drafting one which is consequential on amendment No. 6.  Amendment No. 6 provides for the name of the service in the Irish language, &ldquo;An tSeirbhís Chúirteanna&rdquo;.  Senators will doubtless agree that provision should be made for the Irish language name of the new courts service which the Bill establishes.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara's amendment No. 7 also seeks to provide for the Irish name of the service. There are some technical difficulties with the change proposed in that the definition section of the Bill would still refer to &ldquo;the Service&rdquo;.  In any event, the main aim of the Senator's amendment is achieved in the Government amendment which is the standard approach to the provision of the Irish name of a body in legislation.  In those circumstances, while thanking the Senator for the amendment, I would, nonetheless, ask her to withdraw it.  This amendment and, more particularly, my next amendment to section 7 of the Bill is a strong indication of the importance this Government attaches to the role of the Irish language in the provision of public services.  I am of the view that the Irish language is of particular relevance in the context of the provision of court related services and, as has been acknowledged by the courts, in the area of legal proceedings.  I will return to this subject again in the context of my amendment to section 7.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated earlier that the establishment day for the transitional board would be a month after the enactment of the Bill. What time scale does he envisage in relation to the establishment day and what discussions have taken place on this?  I have heard it said that measures will be in place prior to the legal new year which starts next autumn.  Without giving specific dates, what time scale is the Minister working towards?  Obviously, certain teething problems will have to be sorted out.</P>

      <P>As Senator Cosgrave will be aware, the Bill does not mention any time frame for the designation, by order, of the establishment day.  However, the key function of the transitional board will obviously be the appointment of a chief executive designate.  After the operation of a short period of between four and six months, I would hope to move to bring the remaining provisions of the Bill into effect pursuant to section 1 (3).  In short, I anticipate that we should be in a position to move on within four to six months of the operation of the transitional board.  I trust that answers the Senator's question.</P>

      <P>As Senator Cosgrave pointed out, the estimated cost associated with the chief executive is £150,000.  Most of the other costs already exist under the Department and I anticipate they will be provided for in the Estimates. However, I cannot give the Senator a ballpark figure other than to indicate that the costs will be covered.</P>

Will any extra costs be associated with the establishment day?  I am not saying there will be ceremonies and parties but it appears there may be further charges.  Can the Minister enlighten us in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has apparently already indicated to the Seanad office that extra charges will <Col N="28" /> be involved.  I do not know if the office received any further details but we were given a general indication of potential charges.  Will the Minister expand on the extra charges which the Department has indicated to some staff members of this House?</P>

      <P>In addition to the charges which I mentioned there will obviously be some expenses for the members of the board.  However, they will be minuscule in terms of the overall budget.  I do not envisage any charges in addition to those I have already outlined.  Obviously, if additional charges are essential to the proper functioning of the board they will be discharged.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service is, as I said, already an expense to the State.  The functions of part of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are being transferred to the independent Courts Service, with the axiomatic transfer of the funds required for the running of that service.  We have specified that the salary and associated costs of the chief executive will be in the region of £150,000 and that some expenses will be incurred by the board members in the performance of their functions.  I trust that outlines the position in full.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(b) to establish and manage a statistics <Col N="29" /> unit to compile and publish statistical data on court proceedings,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment seeks to insert a new paragraph into the section to ensure the establishment and management of a statistics unit to compile and publish statistical data on court proceedings.  This was recommended by the first report of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham's courts commission, the recommendations and fine reports of which have formed the basis of this legislation and have been praised in this House, particularly on Second Stage.</P>
    <P>This is a very important amendment in that compiling data supplies us with an extremely important mechanism to study the operations of the Courts Service and, as legislators, to ensure it is effective and that required changes can be made.  I urge the Minister to take the amendment on board, particularly as it is in accordance with the first report of the courts commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The section provides that the functions of the service shall include the requirements to &ldquo;provide, manage and maintain court buildings&rdquo; and to &ldquo;provide facilities for users of the courts&rdquo;.  Many courthouses are in the ownership of local authorities.  Does the Minister envisage that all those facilities, including the courthouses, will be handed over by the local authorities and that the Courts Service will be responsible for their maintenance and upkeep for which the local authorities have been responsible heretofore?</P>
      <P>Will the Department of Finance provide substantial extra funding for the maintenance and upgrading of those facilities?  I am sure the Minister is aware from his political and legal experience that many of those facilities have become run down over the years.  A substantial amount of money is required for their maintenance and upgrading to user friendly facilities.  Will the local authorities receive substantial funds for the handing over of those courthouses and other property currently in their ownership?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this worthwhile amendment which the Minister should take on board.  It ties in very clearly with section 5(c) which states that one of the functions of the service shall be to provide information on the courts system to the public.  The amendment, which calls on the service to establish and manage a unit to compile and publish statistical data on court proceedings, ties in very well with that subsection. It will be useful that such statistical analysis and information will be available from the county registrars' offices from the point of view of general information, policy and policy decisions and the allocation of personnel.  It would outline the areas in need of attention and priority.  This is a <Col N="30" /> commendable amendment which I support and second.</P>
      <P>On the section, Senator Burke raised an important point about the transfer of the maintenance and management of courthouses and properties from local authorities to the new Courts Service.  It is important local authorities, which in many instances were put under financial pressures and had difficulties meeting maintenance costs, are financially reimbursed for the transfer of properties to the service.  While it is appreciated they are in public ownership, it is also realised that local authorities provided a service and due compensation would be more than justified in this instance.</P>
      <P>Also on this section, the Law Reform Commission and various Oireachtas committees made recommendations over the years relating to facilities for court users &mdash; clients, solicitors, barristers and judges.  Section 5 deals with the provision of services for judges and other users of court facilities. While it is appreciated that much improvement has taken place in the courts in recent years, especially in family courts, some court facilities are still antediluvian, to put it mildly.  I hope the Minister will direct the new Courts Service to prioritise the provision of proper, up to date and modern utilities and facilities for users of the courts.  I also hope priority will not just be given to the large urban areas which in many instances receive priority to the exclusion of more isolated rural areas.  A balanced and focused approach needs to be taken and I hope the Minister, when appointing this body, will ensure there is an even-handed and level approach.</P>
      <P>It comes down to the fundamental question of cost.  This new service has a wider cost factor and I want to know how funding for administering its functions will be put in place.  If it were to be done effectively and properly, it would incur a substantial cost.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment proposed by Senator O'Meara relating to the compilation and publication of statistical data on court proceedings.  It is a necessary part of the information service we need relating to crime.  I was surprised a few months ago when I asked the Garda for certain up to date figures on drug crime to be told they could not let me have them. The amendment is important in the function of providing &ldquo;information on the courts system to the public&rdquo; as section 5(c) states.  It is eminently reasonable for Senator O'Meara to table this amendment to tie down that function and give meaning to it.</P>
      <P>As regards the wider aspect of the Courts Service in the sense of its management of the service of the courts and all that relates to it, last Monday I, along with a friend, attended at the Four Courts to see how the courts system works and to familiarise myself with the role I play here.  I spent half the day there going from the District Court to the Supreme Court to the High Court.  I was amazed at the level of chaos which exists in the premier court.  Part of my knowledge of courts is from reading Charles Dickens when I was a young fellow.  He gave wonderful portrayals of what 19th century courts were like in Great Britain.  These were similar to the send-ups Gilbert and Sullivan gave in their comic operas of the courts and judicial system in the UK in the late 19th century.  Looking around me on that visit to the Four Courts, I wondered how much had changed.  There is a lack of user friendliness. Some of those appearing on charges appeared to me to be treated like wretches, given the language used, the contempt with which they were treated and the lack of sympathy shown.  The Courts Service must examine that area.  The attitude which exists in the courts does not seem to have changed since the 19th century, especially in terms of the language used, although I know it is very precise.  It seems it is often meant to intimidate the accused, as it would have in the 19th century. It may not be for the Minister to give instructions to the new Courts Service board. Nevertheless, the courts system is archaic and has not changed.  I did not speak on the issue as I was not in the House when it was debated, so I make the point now, although it may not be appropriate to do so on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the thinking behind Senator O'Meara's amendment but I am not convinced it would be appropriate.  Section 5 sets out the proposed functions of the Courts Service.  The first is to manage the courts.  This amendment would include the establishment of a statistics unit to compile and publish statistical data on court proceedings.  I do not believe it is helpful to try to prescribe in detail how the Courts Service is to be managed.  I would go so far as to say it would defeat the purpose for which the Courts Service is being established.  If it is to <Col N="32" /> be stated in the Bill that a statistics unit is to be established, it would look odd if it did not also state that there should be a finance unit, technology unit or personnel unit.</P>
      <P>That is not to say I do not appreciate and recognise the need for comprehensive and up to date court statistics.  I recall as Opposition spokesperson on justice in the Dáil being often greatly frustrated at the absence of statistics relating to certain matters.  However, I believe the function of comprehensive court statistics is comprehended by the function of managing the courts which is already enshrined in the Bill.  It should also be borne in mind that under section 8 there is a requirement on the Courts Service to submit an annual report to the Minister which, in turn, will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. Those reports shall include information on the performance of the functions of the service during the year to which it relates and other information in such form as the Minister may direct. Such reports would include statistical information as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>I wish to make it clear that I accept that over the years the criminal justice system has unquestionably suffered from a lack of adequate research.  This was very frustrating when I was Opposition spokesperson on Justice.  The ESRI was commissioned by my Department to look at the issue of research and, in the light of their findings, for the first time I have included £250,000 in the Estimates for my Department for carrying out research into criminal justice issues.  It is important that that research be done, which is why I appreciate the thinking behind Senator O'Meara's amendment.</P>
      <P>I envisage the research being carried out by outside agencies such as research departments in universities, and we are drawing up a list of priorities.  This is further evidence of the commitment of the Government and the Department to comprehensive and high quality research in the criminal justice area.  One of the key issues in this matter is the keeping of statistics by the agencies involved in criminal justice.  While I understand the thinking behind the amendment, I have difficulties with it as it is proposed.  First, I do not think it is necessary for the reasons I have given. Second, it could distort the balance of the Bill if we sought to include provisions to micromanage how the Courts Service should function.</P>
      <P>Senators mentioned the transfer of courthouses to the Courts Service.  This is dealt with in section 26.  The Minister of the day, who I hope will be me, may &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Payments to local authorities arising out of those vestings would be inappropriate.  It might be seen by local authorities as fully appropriate, but it would not be possible to have the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform paying local authorities or the commissioners arising out the vesting of properties in the Courts Service. The courthouses and other premises are obviously being vested in another statutory body. We are to hold the properties in trust for both compliant and non-compliant taxpayers.</P>

It would send a very strong signal that we place a high premium on the regular availability of accurate information. That is not to say that what the Minister says about the organisation's annual report will not be the case.  He says that that report will include matters as directed, but that does not specify the compilation and publication of statistics on court proceedings.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that getting information when in Opposition is not easy. Hardly a week goes by without reference being made to living in the information age, and it is important that our legislation sends a strong signal to both new and old institutions that we place a high premium on the availability and publication of accurate and accessible information.  I will not be withdrawing the amendment for that reason.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister is shying away from the term &ldquo;statistics unit&rdquo;.  He should not be intimidated by this. Senator O'Meara's concept is straightforward.  At the end of each court day or the following morning someone should type in the number of cases and classify them as assault, larceny, etc.  Half an hour each day would be enough to deal with this. That information could then be fed to a central computer and at the end of every quarter an overall picture of the classification of cases could be given.  One could then see the most common and most serious crimes.  The information would be available to the Minister, the Department, the Government and any other interested organisation. This is not a major issue.  It is a matter of getting the available information without making <Col N="34" /> a big deal of it.  The Minister is sensible and will see the sense in this proposal.  He should not think of a big statistics office such as those in St. Stephen's Green.  He should review his position.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised at his response about the local authorities.  Kerry County Council, from which he emerged, will be disappointed that he is not prepared to make a financial contribution for the properties they will be transferring to the Courts Service.  These are all public buildings vested in various statutory bodies for the use of the public.  In the interests of recognising what has been done it would have been opportune to show some gratitude to the local authorities for the work they have done in the past.  The Minister should review his position on the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn has covered many of the points I wished to raise.  I appreciate that buildings and facilities must be upgraded.  We need consultation rooms and other facilities in our courts.  Does the Minister agree that, when the Courts Service is in place, many rural courthouses will be closed?  This is the death knell for rural courthouses and facilities.  It will cost an enormous amount to bring rural courthouses up to the standard of those in larger towns.  Such upgrading, including the provision of facilities such as consultation rooms, is necessary. However, I cannot envisage such provision in rural areas.  If this is the case and the board, in its wisdom, decides to reduce the number of courthouses in a particular county, it could sell those properties and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would receive a windfall. The Courts Service or the Department should hand back to local authorities courthouses which are outdated and will be no longer used. This is a reasonable suggestion and I would like to hear the Minister's views on it.  Should an amendment to that effect be brought forward?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has already addressed this issue as regards courthouses and their conditions, etc., most councils, including my own in County Cork, would be glad to hand over responsibility for these courthouses.  Out of ten or 11 courthouses in my constituency, only three are owned by councils.  Others are community halls which are leased for two or three hours every second month.  I see no difficulty with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of Senator O'Meara's amendment, but the thrust of the Bill is to reform the courts system &mdash; we should not lose sight of this &mdash; and to bring the system from the 19th into the 21st century.  This Bill will achieve this by setting up a board and by the appointment of a chief executive. It is my understanding that the chief executive and the new board will have responsibility for statistics and the proper correlation of such matters.  The chief executive is obliged to lay an annual report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, ensuring all these matters can be <Col N="35" /> dealt with.  Responsibility will rest with the chief executive and the board both of whom are answerable to the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this legislation is the distancing of the day to day running of the courts from the Minister.  The Bill provides for a severe derogation of power to the board and the chief executive. It is their function to ensure that, over the next few years, there will be state of the art technology and statistics available in courthouses, to the Garda and others who administer the courts. The Minister has responded appropriately to the amendment and I hope Senator O'Meara withdraws it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House.  I join with Members on this side of the House who have spoken in favour of Senator O'Meara's amendment.  What is sought will not cost much money or trouble.  The amendment refers to information technology and the proper keeping of information.</P>
      <P>In the context of court archives, we should ensure that a comprehensive bank of information is kept which will eventually become an archive. About 1850 an ancestor of mine engaged in legal action with the local landlord in the High Court.  I was amazed that I was unable to find any archival material relating to the case.  It is extremely important that court archives are well kept.  The keeping and publication of good information is related to Senator O'Meara's amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Burke said that in certain areas there could be a threatened loss of court sittings; for example, there was a threat that High Court and Circuit Court sittings would be removed from certain provincial towns.  The centralisation of the courts system in the Four Courts has proved chaotic.  We need to decentralise the system.  In conversation today Senator O'Donovan made the valid point that a High Court judge should be designated to certain regions and sit permanently in, for example, the western region, the southern or south western region, etc.  This would replace the present position of all cases being dealt with in the High Court.  The High Court goes on circuit throughout the country but this is not adequate. A number of trivial issues end up in the High Court in Dublin, clogging the entire system.  This was the clear indication I got from examining the system over a day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We are establishing a new Courts Service to manage the courts.  The last thing I wish to do is to tie the hands of the service by including in the legislation specific provisions such as a statistics unit.  If I follow that route I will interfere with the independence of the service. The philosophy behind the legislation is that the Courts Service should be independent of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and, consequently, of the Minister.  The Minister will remain accountable to the Houses of the <Col N="36" /> Oireachtas for the courts and the legislation includes mechanisms to ensure this.</P>
      <P>The Courts Service is intended to be well equipped to manage the courts.  If we cannot trust the service to keep statistics and to keep up to date in the context of technology, I humbly suggest we are wasting our time.  There is no logical reason I should send out signals regarding statistics and not send out signals concerning technology, personnel, etc.  The third report of the working group on a courts commission recommended the establishment of a statistics unit as part of the management process of the service. It also recommended the establishment of other management processes, including audit, computerisation, etc.  The working group did not recommend that we legislate for a statistics unit.</P>
      <P>The thrust of this amendment is comprehended by the broad management functions set out in section 5.  Section 8 of the Bill requires the service to make an annual report to the Minister on its activities.  Section 8(1) states that the report must be laid by the Minister before both Houses of the Oireachtas while section 8(2) provides that the report shall include information on the performance of the functions of the service and other information which the Minister may direct be included in the annual report.</P>
      <P>The annual report requirements, with other provisions of the Bill, are intended to support the obligation of the Minister to be accountable to Dáil Éireann.  Section 8 will provide that the Minister may obtain information from the Courts Service in relation to specific matters and matters of general policy to allow the Minister to fulfil the role of being accountable to the Dáil.  Clearly, that would include the entire question of statistics and other information which might be required by Members of the House.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of closures of court venues, it is true that the Bill enables the Courts Service to designate court venues.  It would be incongruous if the legislation did not provide a Courts Service intended to manage the courts with the power to designate court venues.  This function is at present carried out by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to the District Court.  The service will determine whether a court will sit in a particular location. This does not mean that the issue of possible closure by the service of court venues arises in that context.  The Bill does confer on the Minister significant powers in relation to the formation of the Courts Service's strategic plan and I would suggest that any concern which may arise in this area could be dealt with in that context.  I do not wish to direct the Courts Service as to how they should manage the courts.  If I do that I shall be defeating the purpose of the legislation and telling the Courts Service that I do not trust them.  What would be the point in establishing a Courts Service if the Minister did not trust the service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to statistics, I am satisfied that the new Courts Service which is being formed to <Col N="37" /> manage the courts will use whatever technology is required to gather and disseminate the sort of information of which Senator O'Meara has spoken.  Notable cases are dealt with in reports which can be obtained in law libraries.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 6, paragraph (d), line 36, to delete &ldquo;and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the operation of the courts through the medium of Irish.  They ensure that, instead of paying lip service to the the use of Irish and to the rights of Irish speakers, we enshrine those rights in legislation.</P>
      <P>In 1993 the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, issued guidelines to all Departments and State organisations stating the necessity of ensuring that all public services were made available through the medium of Irish and English.  It is clear that guidelines are not sufficient.  Irish speakers who live in Gaeltacht areas and elsewhere cannot depend on guidelines to ensure that State agencies will provide an effective level of service through the medium of Irish and that the rights of Irish speakers are guaranteed.  Delivery of State services in Irish must be given legislative effect.  This is the purpose of this series of amendments. It seems extraordinary that a Bill must be amended to ensure that linguistic rights are underlined.  One would have thought it could be taken for granted that service in Irish would be available from all State bodies to those who wish to use it as their first language, but it cannot.</P>
      <P>In most parts of the country the demand for service in Irish in our courts is not great.  In Gaeltacht areas, however, the linguistic rights of Irish speakers are not being protected.  The present practice in Gaeltacht areas is that courts operate through English and are only obliged to hear cases in Irish if that is the wish of the plaintiff or defendant.  This situation should be reversed. Courts in Gaeltacht areas should function through the medium of Irish as a matter of course and court users should not have to insist on their right to use Irish.</P>
      <P>We recognise that linguistics rights are human rights.  To be allowed to conduct one's business in one's native tongue is a basic right.  A Bord na Gaeilge report has established that the public will not use Irish in their dealings with State bodies if they perceive that the quality of the service is not of an acceptable standard.  State bodies must take a pro-active approach to the delivery of services through the medium of Irish.  This will only be ensured if it is given legislative effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="38" /> Amendment No. 13 will ensure that planning for the delivery of both Irish and English will begin immediately.  An earlier amendment attempted to give the Courts Service an Irish title but it was not accepted.  I urge the Minister to end long years of paying lip service to the Irish language and to recognise the fact that a voluntary code and a set of guidelines is not sufficient in ensuring the linguistic rights of our citizens.</P>

      <P>At a time when there is a great deal of discussion about minority languages, particularly in the European Union where Ireland is one of the member states seeking recognition for such languages, it is important that this issue be raised in the context of the administration of justice in this country.</P>
      <P>Fluency in the Irish language should be a factor in the appointment of court officers.  Irish is supposed to be our first language, although it is only in recent years that it has become trendy to be fluent in the language.  That is a welcome development.  It is equally important that officers appointed to the Courts Service should be fluent in Irish, particularly if they are dealing with Gaeltacht areas.  Judgments in certain cases could conceivably depend on the understanding between the presiding judge and those before the court. Fluency in Irish is an important factor in such cases and a requirement of fluency merits serious consideration.  I hope the Minister will give these amendments such consideration.</P>
      <P>Irish is our first language and all citizens are expected to have a measure of fluency, particularly as everybody has spent about ten years studying the language in primary and second level education; some of us have even studied it at third level.  Despite this, however, our level of fluency leaves much to be desired.  What that says about our education system is a debate for another day.</P>
      <P>As Senator Connor pointed out, the Irish language version of the Constitution takes precedence over the English version when its provisions are being interpreted.  That is an extremely important consideration and it can be the deciding factor in substantive decisions with regard to the Constitution.</P>

Tá sé an-tábhachtach ach go mbeidh athrú san Bille seo chun ár dteanga a chur ar aghaidh agus chun cinn. Tá sé an-tábhachtach do na daoine atá ina gconaí sna Gaeltachtaí agus daoine eile a bhíonn ag labhairt na Gaeilge de ghnáth.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their comments on behalf of our native language.  I agree that the Irish language should be recognised in this legislation.  It is important not only for the sake of the language but also for the sake of people who live in Gaeltacht areas and ordinarily speak Irish and for those outside Gaeltachta who prefer to speak Irish.  My amendment seeks to insert a new paragraph (d) to section 7(2) which provides that the strategic plan of the Courts Service should have regard to Government policy on promoting bilingualism.  It requires in particular that regard should be had to the need to ensure that an adequate number of staff at the service are competent to provide service in Irish as well as English.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the Bill recognises the importance of the right to use Irish in legal proceedings which have been recognised by the courts and the need to ensure that persons who wish to use Irish for official purposes should not be inconvenienced any more than those who use English.  Senators spoke strongly about the need for the Courts Service to provide in the Bill for Irish language services.  I have consulted with my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, and I am satisfied that the amendment I propose is the most effective way to ensure that the Courts Service has a statutory responsibility to provide services through the medium of Irish in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 provides that the strategic plan of the service must be submitted to the Minister and laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  The Minister has the power to approve the strategic plan with or without amendment.  This provision gives the Minister a significant role in relation to the strategic plan.  Under the criteria set out in paragraph (c) relating to the best use of the service's resources and under the proposed paragraph (d), provision of an Irish language service must be observed in the formulation of the service's strategic plan.  A particular concern in this regard is the provision in the plan in respect of the delivery <Col N="40" /> of service in Irish in court offices serving areas where Irish is in general use.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara's amendments are the same as those proposed and circulated by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.  They seek to ensure that all the services and facilities of the courts are available through the medium of Irish and English and that courts operating in Gaeltacht areas function through the medium of Irish; that the strategic plan of the service should contain details of how the service intends to ensure the effective delivery of its services and the services of the courts through the medium of Irish to residents of the Gaeltacht and to Irish speakers who live outside the Gaeltacht; that there will be represented on the board a person who, in the Minister's opinion, has relevant knowledge and experience of the effective delivery of services through the medium of Irish and who is nominated by the Minister after consultation with such bodies as the Minister considers are representative of such interests in the State and that the board should ensure that the number of staff appointed in each grade should include a sufficient number whose competence in Irish is such as to ensure that the service can effectively deliver all its services through the medium of Irish and English.</P>
    <P>The Government amendment is similar to amendments Nos. 13 and 32 in that it seeks to underpin the Government policy to promote bilingualism and, in that context, to ensure that staff can provide a service through Irish and that this is done in the context of the service's strategic plan.  The other amendments proposed by the Senator would make it mandatory for the service to provide all its facilities and services through Irish as well as English.  This might be interpreted to mean that every court in the country would be equally in a position to provide services through Irish or English.  While this is a desirable objective, it would place too great a burden in the short term on the Courts Service.  If the Department had to ensure that the Courts Service would be in a position to comply with those requirements, the effect of accepting the amendments might be likely to delay for a considerable time the establishment of the Courts Service.</P>
    <P>I am reluctant to amend the constitution of the board in the manner proposed by the Senator. The board comprises members who are representative of groups or bodies with a direct function and relationship with the Courts Service.  The new requirements proposed to be inserted in section 7 will, of themselves, ensure that the board will have the effective delivery of services through Irish on its agenda.</P>
    <P>Overall, my response to Senator O'Meara's amendments is that I consider that the current legislative provisions and the case law relating to the use of Irish in legal proceedings taken together with my amendment to section 7 are sufficient to ensure that persons wishing to conduct their business through Irish in the courts can be <Col N="41" /> appropriately facilitated.  In particular, the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, provides that as far as practicable a district judge or judge of the Circuit Court assigned to an area which includes an area where the Irish language is in general use shall possess such knowledge of Irish as would enable that judge to dispense with the assistance of an interpreter when hearing evidence in Irish.</P>
    <P>My amendment arises from consultations with my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, who has responsibility for both the Gaeltacht and the State's policy on bilingualism.  What I propose goes a long way to meet what I describe as the understandable concerns which have been raised and which I share.  I propose a practical recognition of the importance of the Irish language. The approach would not result in delays in the establishment of the Courts Service which would be the unintentional effect of Senator O'Meara's amendments.  In the circumstances, I ask the Senator to consider withdrawing her amendments.  Tá mé an-bhuíoch don Seanadóir as ucht an méid atá ráite aici ar son ár dteanga inniu.</P>

The Minister was correct to say they are guided and proposed by Comhdháil Náisiúnta na hÉireann, representatives of which were here this afternoon to listen to the debate.  A plan is largely aspirational and the legislation sets out a laudable one in terms of what it might include.  I thank the Minister for including proposals on the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of resources of the service.  On the use of the Irish language, the strategic plan does not go far enough in terms of what we are trying to achieve.

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister about the general management of the courts, particularly those of which I am sure the Minister is well aware.  I am sure Senator O'Donovan would agree with me on the general condition of courts.  I refer to the functions of the service in managing the courts, providing support services for judges, providing, managing and maintaining court buildings, providing facilities for users of the courts and providing information on the courts system to the public.  I am sure the Minister is aware that appearing in court can be a frightening experience for witnesses &mdash; I am not talking <Col N="42" /> about doctors or other experts who will have probably been to court a couple times &mdash; who have not been to court previously and who must appear as a witness on behalf of a plaintiff or defendant.</P>
      <P>On facilities for the users of the courts, call-overs take place in the District Court in Dolphin House.  I am sure the Minister will agree that at times some of these courts are grossly overcrowded. Will he talk to the chief executive and others to ensure these difficulties are resolved?  I am sure the Minister has been in a court where, if the appropriate fire officer was as vigilant as he should be, business would not be allowed to continue, which is not helpful to judges, the practitioners, solicitors or barristers and people in the court.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to elaborate on where he sees us going from here.  Some courts are in good condition, some need general improvement while others need much work.  Does he have a plan in relation to section 5 and on how the Courts Service will operate?  Some of the matters I raised were mentioned on Second Stage.  The Minister might enlighten us whether he agrees with some of the issues I raised and if he believes the matters mentioned will be dealt with when the Courts Service comes into operation.</P>
      <P>On providing information on the courts system to the public, does the Minister envisage providing information to schools or a better system? Some people, including those on traffic summonses, who have not been to court before and who, hopefully, will not be again, do not know where to go.  Perhaps the Minister will expand on section 5.</P>

      <P>The functions of the Courts Service are set out in section 5.  Part of its functions is the maintenance, provision and management of the court buildings.  I envisage the Courts Service making its own decisions on how best courthouses should be maintained and provided, and I anticipate that the Courts Service will have this as one of its main functions.  I do not envisage any interference from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I accept there are courthouses which are, to say the least, inadequate for the purpose for which they are used.  I hope to see the Courts Service improving courthouses and facilities generally.</P>
      <P>I trust this explains section 5 in so far as it relates to the provision, management and maintenance of courthouse premises and responds to the queries raised by Senator Cosgrave.</P>

      <P>I am here not to state categorically what money might or might not be forthcoming in the context of this legislation but to have the Bill passed.  However, I want to be as helpful as possible.  The Courts Service is being set up to manage independently the courts and many of the questions which the Senator properly poses can only be answered by the service.  There was discussion of section 5 (c) because it was considered by the courts commission.</P>
      <P>In due course, the question of how to disseminate this information will be decided by the Courts Service.  In addition, an information officer in the Four Courts has been appointed recently.  The implementation of the provisions in section 5 is a matter for the Courts Service and it would be wrong of me to seek to interfere with its independence by suggesting how it should do its business, especially since the functions set out in the section relate to the service, not to me.  I am confident the service will carry out those functions in a professional, efficient and effective manner.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister will not interfere with the Courts Service but he is introducing the Bill and I presume he will have an input through appointing a member to the board, etc.  Does he accept that appearing in court for the first time can be a daunting experience for someone who is, for instance, a witness to a traffic summons or appearing for himself in a minor case where he does not want to incur extra costs? Should there not be a system of information available to him?  In some cases, a local Garda sergeant also acts as information officer.  One hopes that such a person's first experience in court will be his last but it can be a daunting ordeal and the system could be improved.  Will the Minister communicate my concern about this matter, without interfering with the Courts Service?</P>

      <P>Section 5 (c) recognises the problem highlighted by Senator Cosgrave, that is, the public's lack of information about the courts system.  The provision has been inserted to give the Courts Service the power to inform the public about the system.  I agree with the Senator that going to court can be traumatic and the provision of information should alleviate people's concerns in this respect.  How the Courts Service disseminates the information is a matter for itself but section 5 (c) is designed to ensure the service will provide information and I have no doubt it will do so successfully.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke briefly about this point on section 5 but was not happy with the Minister's reply.  Section 6 (a) and (f) provide that the board can hold and dispose of property and can designate court areas and venues.  The Minister is a reasonable man; does he envisage that any properties which close would revert to local authorities?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention of the legislation to close courthouses, no more than it is intended to close court venues.  I have addressed the question of vesting courthouse premises in the Courts Service &mdash; the service will become the owners of the properties in question and, as such, will have rights of disposal over the property, just as any other State agency has such powers.  It would be wrong of me to circumscribe those powers in a manner which would oblige the Courts Service to pay local authorities or the commissioners the proceeds of such sales.  I envisage improvements to courthouses and the provision of further courthouses by the service but do not envisage the closure of courthouses by the service.  Any such proposals would be part of the strategic plan and I have outlined the input which the Minister of the day will have.  I hope that deals comprehensively with the Senator's concerns and that he is now satisfied there will not be a unilateral closure of court venues.  It is my sincere hope that any disposal of courthouses or premises would be for the purpose of acquiring or building new premises where that is seen to be desirable by the Courts Service.  The legislation is designed not to close court venues or courthouses but to improve our courts service.  In that context, the improvement of courthouses is one of the matters I wish the Courts Service to address. Undoubtedly it will address it, given the widespread powers which will be conferred on it by the Bill, through the exercise of its independent functions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) A report under subsection (1) shall include information on the activities of any committee having functions in relation to the making of rules of court during the year to which it relates.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is consistent with earlier amendments on the subject of information and deals specifically with the inclusion of information on the activities of any committee having functions in relation to the making of rules of court during the year to which it relates.  It is straightforward and self-explanatory.  However, it is important when reports are made that the activities of any additional committees or sub-committees, particularly in relation to the making of rules of court, are included.  I urge the Minister to take the amendment on board.</P>

      <P>Section 8 provides that the Courts Service each year will report in writing to the Minister on its activities.  I outlined this matter earlier.  The Bill provides that the report, which will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas, shall include information on the performance of the functions of the service during the year to which it relates and such other information in such form as the service thinks fit or the Minister may direct.  The amendment seeks to impose a requirement to deal with one specific issue in the annual report relating to court rules committees.  I have two difficulties with the amendment.</P>
      <P>First, for good reasons, the section as it stands does not purport to contain a comprehensive list of headings under which that report is to be compiled. In those circumstances, to include only one specific heading &mdash; in this case to court rules committees &mdash; would distort the balance of the section.  Second, the Bill does not alter the statutory basis on which the court rules committees operate.  In those circumstances, including the amendment would place a statutory requirement on the Courts Service to report on something for which it is not directly responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> There is a wide range of information which is expected to be included in the annual report of any State body.  However, it is not desirable to specify those in great detail in the Bill.  In these circumstances, if the requirement was included as the amendment proposes in relation to one specific issue, it would raise obvious questions why a whole range of other headings are not included.</P>
    <P>The general approach taken in the Bill is correct. It provides the broad framework in which the Courts Service will operate rather than adopts a prescriptive approach.  The Bill also includes a fail safe mechanism that the Minister may direct certain information to be included in the annual report.  In all the circumstances, I cannot support the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 24, after &ldquo;judges&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or County Registrars&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 9 states:</P>
      <P>No function conferred on or power vested in the Service, the Board or the Chief Executive, under this Act shall be exercised so as to interfere with the conduct of that part of the business of the courts required by law to be transacted by or before one or more judges or to impugn the independence of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a judge in the performance of his or her judicial functions, or</P>

      <P>This is a most important section and this side has tabled a number of amendments on the position of county registrars. It was stated on Second Stage that county registrars have a specific role in the judicial system and in terms of the Courts Service.  They have specific quasi-judicial functions and it is most important that legislation does nothing to diminish, dilute or impinge on them.</P>
      <P>These functions are enshrined in legislation. They emanate from the essence of democracy governed by the Constitution and they are fundamental to the rights of citizens and the democratic system.  This aspect relates to the fundamental issue of democracy versus bureaucracy which must be addressed.  It is time the Minister and politicians in general took a stand and stated that democracy and elected politicians must take precedence over bureaucracy.  We are the elected representatives of the people and we are accountable to them in this and the other House.  We are accountable, but bureaucracy is an arm of Government working in the interests of the State in general.  When bureaucracy supersedes democracy we will be in a very serious situation.</P>
      <P>Any proposal in any legislation which attempts to dilute the role of county registrars is a fundamental attack on the essence of democracy.  County registrars hold a specific semi-judicial function in every county.  The Minister as a politician, lawyer and public representative is aware of the extended roles and functions of county registrars. The day county registrars are not appointed by a Minister, irrespective of party, will be a sad one for democracy.  Politicians should stop kowtowing to the media and bureaucracy and apologising for our existence.  A few of us have sinned in the past, but this does not mean we should all be tarred with the same brush and that that we should transfer the powers vested in us under the Constitution, the rules of this House and legislation elsewhere.  It is vital that we do not do that.  It is time for the elected Members of the Oireachtas to take a stand in the interests of public representatives and democracy.</P>
      <P>The appointment of county registrars is vested in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the 1926 Act.  We have tabled an amendment to section 10 of this Bill which is being taken in this group of amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann calls on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to introduce the measures necessary to ensure <Col N="48" /> that Limerick city has the same smoke-free status as is currently operating in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>I could pepper my contribution with statistics but the people of Limerick do not need to hear the statistics to know that the air quality is deteriorating steadily.  In my work as a public representative and as a teacher I have become aware of this problem.  When one approaches Limerick city from any of the national routes a pall of smoke is visible over the city, particularly on frosty nights.</P>
    <P>I have taught geography for many years and it is ironic that my geography students would typify those who are most at risk from smoke emissions yet who are also most aware of why we should not have such harmful emissions.  I have noticed over the past few years that levels of absenteeism among children who suffer from asthma have increased.  I do not have statistics on these children but many of them attend their local GPs and it can be a costly affliction.  However, it is an issue that is raised regularly with me.  It is particularly noticeable among those who have moved to Limerick, who may have had mild asthma which has worsened.  They have asked me to propose smoke-free status for Limerick.</P>
    <P>A deterioration in air quality in Dublin was allowed to continue unchecked in the late 1980s and the failure to act then led to chronic smog levels and consequent health risks.  The 1996 EPA air pollution statistics for Limerick city show that the air quality has deteriorated significantly since the beginning of the 1990s.  Air quality is monitored at four locations in the city &mdash; Moyross, Southill, Ballykeeffe and in the city centre at the Todds-Roches Stores intersection.  Limerick is now in a similar position to Dublin in the late 1980s.  There is a smog problem waiting to happen and now is the time to take firm action to prevent a similar situation to that in Dublin developing.</P>
    <P>There are benefits to declaring Limerick a smoke-free zone.  Poor air quality presents risks to everybody.  Those most at risk are children and those who suffer from respiratory illnesses.  It is only anecdotal evidence which suggests that Limerick has a higher incidence of asthma than any other part of the country.  The Mid-Western Health Board should conduct a comprehensive survey to establish whether this evidence is supported by the facts.  Smoke filled air, caused by burning coal, seriously aggravates the condition of many asthmatics.</P>
    <P>Parents often tell me that when they send their children to the local shop in the evening, the children return with their clothes smelling of smoke. Those children would be more alert to these problems than our generation.  They realise they are at risk and want their parents to do something about it.  We must take action to protect their health.  I await the results of a survey by the health board to confirm the anecdotal evidence that there are higher levels of asthma in Limerick than elsewhere.  As I said, as a teacher I have <Col N="49" /> noticed an increase in absenteeism among younger children.</P>
    <P>We know that prevention is better than cure and now is the time to make Limerick a smoke-free zone.  In 1990, in response to a public clamour for action on Dublin's smog problem, regulations prohibiting the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in the built up areas of the city were made under the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  Since then there has been a dramatic improvement in air quality, an improvement to which all Dubliners would attest.  Smog poses a greater threat to Limerick than to Dublin.  Limerick is in a similar position to that in which Cork city found itself in 1994 when the Corkonians decided to extend a ban on bituminous coal to that city.  The problem was tackled in Cork before it got out of control.  I am sure Senator Cregan will allude to the positive effects of Cork being declared a smoke-free zone in 1994.</P>
    <P>The EU intends to lower the acceptable levels for air pollution in the near future.  Statistics for air pollution recorded in certain parts of Limerick, including Ballykeeffe and Moyross, show that they would be in breach of the new minimum air quality standards and they are fast approaching the new limit.  It is time to take preventative action and extend the regulations to include Limerick city.  I am aware that this cannot be achieved overnight.  However, there is a need for an initial public awareness campaign to educate people about various alternative fuels.  A special grants scheme must be made available to assist householders make the necessary conversion to smokeless fuels.  I will be demanding an effective system for monitoring the price of smokeless fuels.  If there is any danger of a price cartel emerging I will be insisting that the Director of Consumer Affairs investigates the situation with a view to imposing price controls.  The consumer should not have to pay extra for being environmentally conscious.</P>
    <P>The creation of a smoke free zone in Limerick city does not require complicated legislation but an order by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  We must learn from the experiences of Dublin and Cork which point to the dangers of allowing the problem to go too far and the benefits of preventative action.  Limerick city is growing rapidly.  Many new housing and industrial developments are under way.  The projected population for my area &mdash; Castletroy &mdash; is 20,000 in ten years time.  Now is the time for the Government to take the necessary steps to protect the health of the population.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I second this motion.  The quality of air has improved in Dublin city since it became a smoke free zone as a result of the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  It improved dramatically since the ban on the marketing and distribution of smoking or bituminous coal.  This improvement has resulted in a substantial reduction in the levels of smoke <Col N="50" /> and sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere.  This is particularly noticeable in the winter when heating demands are at a peak and the weather conditions are conducive to poor air quality.</P>
      <P>I recently studied a graph which provided a historical review of the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide concentrations in milligrams per cubic metre between 1982 and 1997.  Smoke levels were at their highest in 1986-7 with an average reading of 60.  They were at their lowest in 1996-7 with an average reading of 10.  Sulphur dioxide levels were at their highest in 1983-4 with an average reading of 60.  They were at their lowest in 1996-7 with an average reading of 8.  These figures illustrate the downward trend in smoke and sulphur dioxide levels since 1987.  Results have continued to improve so that the levels of smoke and sulphur dioxide now comply with EU limits.  Before the ban we were often in breach of those limits. The monitoring stations now indicate that these levels comply with the more stringent World Health Organisation guidelines.</P>
      <P>Prior to 1990, 80 per cent of the smog problem in Dublin was caused by the burning of bituminous coal.  The Government decided to go to the heart of the matter to ensure that clean air would prevail throughout the city by making an order banning the sale of bituminous coal.  In certain areas, the special control order imposed requirements on householders to change their method of heating.  Smokeless fuel is more expensive than bituminous coal so the Government made funding available to low income earners and those on social welfare to ensure that the extra cost would be minimised.  As a result of this policy, Bord Gáis and the ESB, in particular, continue to make substantial inroads into the home heating market by offering highly competitive conversion packages. This has resulted in a substantial number of customers converting to gas and electricity heating thus improving air quality.</P>
      <P>All these measures have improved the air quality in Dublin.  We all have experience of this, particularly those who suffer from respiratory diseases. When smoke and sulphur dioxide levels were at their highest in 1987, especially in cold weather, many elderly people were admitted to hospital suffering from respiratory problems and, unfortunately, there were some casualties.  This is now unheard of.  The smoke free environment has made it possible for the elderly and those with respiratory diseases to live normal and happy lives.  I would like Limerick city to share the benefits which Dublin has experienced over the past few years.  I have pleasure in seconding this motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;welcomes the commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium to extend the <Col N="51" /> ban on bituminous coal to major urban areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment will encompass Senator Jackman's wishes.  Both sides of the House wish to ensure that people live in a healthy environment which is not polluted by any substances, including bituminous fuel emissions.  Those who enjoyed reading <i>Angela's Ashes</i> may have given consideration to conditions in Limerick.  Workers spent much time in unacceptable conditions on the coal ships which came up the Shannon.  The Limerick Steamship Company was the biggest importer of coal.  I remember being at Limerick docks and seeing the dirt and dust in the city.  People burned this coal creating many of the health problems associated with bituminous coal emissions.</P>
    <P>The atmosphere in Dublin has improved dramatically since the ban on bituminous fuel. However, it does not appear that the monitoring of the situation is satisfactory.  I do not know if anyone has been brought before the courts for selling or burning bituminous fuel since the introduction of the ban.  Quite an amount of cheap coal is coming into the country.  It is called &ldquo;cheap coal&rdquo; but, in fact, it is low grade fuel.  Quite an amount of this fuel has been coming into County Limerick for years.  One can see the different qualities of coal in different parts of the country and the different emissions levels from cheap coal as opposed to high quality fuel.</P>
    <P>This amendment is complementary to the motion.  An extension of the ban to major urban areas through the Action Programme for the Millennium will include Limerick city.  It would take until the new millennium to pass legislation banning this fuel in Limerick.  Senator Jackman should agree to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to underline the fact that air quality in Ireland is generally good.  However, I also recognise that improvements can be made and are desirable in respect of certain areas and certain pollutants.  Constant vigilance is required to protect and, where necessary, improve our air quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Awareness of atmospheric pollution first developed from recognition of the local effects of winter smog on human health, usually in urban or heavily urbanised areas.  The acute nature of this problem in other countries has meant that effective action had to be taken many years ago. For example, the Clean Air Act in the UK came into force more than 40 years ago.  Then came an appreciation of regional influences on air quality and of the transboundary environmental damage caused by acid rain due to man-made emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  Awareness has also developed of photochemical pollution related to high growth in road traffic. Ireland now has a national network for monitoring <Col N="52" /> ground level ozone and a public alert system in place should levels warrant it.</P>
    <P>More recently, the importance of global impacts have been recognised and, at this scale, the adverse impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, are now causing widespread concern.  Indeed, at Kyoto last December, the developed world at last agreed to binding reductions on greenhouse emissions of over 5 per cent below 1990 levels by 2008-12.  The EU legally binding target for this global effort, to which Ireland will contribute, will be the achievement of an overall reduction of 8 per cent of greenhouse gas emissions in this period.</P>
    <P>We are also likely to face increased international obligations in the future arising from the negotiations at EU and UN levels on reduced ceilings of emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  Ceilings on emissions to the atmosphere of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are also being developed under the aegis of the UN Economic Commission for Europe.</P>
    <P>We are committed to meeting our obligations at international level to assist in the task of combating global climate change and the impacts of transboundary atmospheric pollution.  We are equally concerned to maintain and improve our air quality at national and local level.  We must, therefore, target appropriate policy and actions at the different levels and quality issues.  That is why the commitment to extending the ban on bituminous coal to major urban areas is part of our programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Good air quality is essential to human health and well being.  Air quality and emissions to air also influence the quality of both the natural and the built environment.  Air quality standards which are intended to protect public health have been set both nationally and at EU level on the basis of research and analysis undertaken by the World Health Organisation.</P>
    <P>These standards are set by reference to both the longer term impacts and the impacts of shorter, more acute incidents of severe pollution. The limit values for smoke are expressed in a number of ways, the most relevant for assessing urban quality being the winter median daily of mean values, set at 130 microgrammes per cubic metre, and the 98-percentile of daily mean values, set at 250 microgrammes per cubic metre.  The 98-percentile limit allows only a total of seven values exceeding the 250 microgrammes per cubic metre limit in a full year and there is a further requirement that more than three such values on consecutive days would also mean a breach of the limit.  There are guidelines set by the EU also, intended for the further protection of human health and the environment.  These are set at 40 to 60 microgrammes per cubic metre in respect of the annual mean, and 100 to 150 microgrammes per cubic metre in respect of the maximum daily mean.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of these standards in health and environmental terms.  Excessive <Col N="53" /> levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere can create conditions which are extremely uncomfortable and unhealthy.  International experience and independent Irish research have shown that they are associated with increased hospital admissions, increased morbidity and a peak in mortality.  Acute effects may include immediate irritations to the eyes and throat or hospitalisation, or even deaths from respiratory failure or heart attacks.  Chronic effects may include decreased pulmonary function, and there are specific high risk groups, such as the elderly, people with asthma and people with diseases of the lungs.  Research has identified a clear link between lung and respiratory related hospital admissions and peaks in poor urban air quality.</P>
    <P>Environmental effects include the blackening of stonework in our cities by smoke in the atmosphere, and the attack on that stonework by the associated acidification of rainfall by sulphur dioxide.  We have spent substantial sums of money on cleaning and repairing the damage to buildings caused by smoke in the past and we need to be vigilant to ensure that the damage is not repeated.</P>
    <P>Air quality in Dublin was a major problem in the past.  For example, smoke levels were as high as 1,800 microgrammes per cubic metre on occasions, over seven times in excess of the EU limit value of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre. These levels were reached during particularly adverse climate conditions.  During inversions, including when the weather is particularly cold and still, smoke cannot rise high into the atmosphere and is not dispersed by the wind; pollutants sit where they are emitted.  These are the kind of conditions in which excessive smoke can impact on health and on the fabric of urban areas.</P>
    <P>The prevalence of smoke and its impact on air quality is monitored by local authorities.  There is an extensive network of smoke monitors in urban areas.  Apart from Dublin and Cork, there are 16 other towns and cities, including most major population centres, where the levels of smoke in the atmosphere are monitored.  In Limerick, the corporations has monitors in Southill, Moyross and at Todds.  The county council has a further monitor in the urban area, situated at Ballykeeffe on the Dooradoyle side of the city.  Monitoring results from all local authorities are received in my Department and are also sent to the Environmental Protection Agency.  The agency analyses the data on a regular basis and publishes the results.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;State of the Environment Report&rdquo;, published by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1996, concludes:</P>
    <P>Overall, air pollution associated with. smoke emissions from stationary combustion sources has been almost eliminated in Ireland. There is now widespread compliance with national air quality standards and EU limit values.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> With regard to Dublin, the report notes:</P>
    <P>For the first time in ten years, there was no exceedance of any Directive smoke limit value in 1990/1991 and there were none for any reference period in the three subsequent years.</P>
    <P>The report also noted that there was a 70 per cent decrease in smoke concentrations overall in Dublin in terms of the 98-percentile and the winter median value.</P>
    <P>A further report by the Environmental Protection Agency, entitled the &ldquo;Air Quality Monitoring Annual Report 1996&rdquo;, published in December 1997, confirms this trend and notes:</P>
    <P>. concentrations of smoke . were very low during the 1996/1997 annual period at all monitoring sites and were very much in compliance with current Irish air quality standards.</P>
    <P>With regard to Cork, the 1996 report shows the heartening result that the smoke levels in the city have come down significantly since the introduction of the bituminous coal ban in 1995.</P>
    <P>The smog problem in Dublin was successfully overcome by banning the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous coal in the city from the start of the heating season in October 1990.  A dramatic and immediate improvement was experienced over the following winters.  In the four years after 1990-1, the 98-percentile smoke value averaged 77 microgrammes per cubic metre compared with 256 microgrammes per cubic metre in the four years prior to this.  The corresponding levels for the 1996-7 period was 41 microgrammes per cubic metre.</P>
    <P>The successful approach in Dublin was repeated in Cork in February 1995.  The air quality in these two cities has now improved to the extent that the 98-percentile smoke levels for the 1996-7 heating season were in the range of 41 to 66 microgrammes per cubic metre, with no station recording a 98-percentile reading of 84 microgrammes per cubic metre.  This is well below the EU limit value of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre.  Thankfully, we do not expect the levels of smoke in Dublin and Cork to rise again towards the historic levels at any time in the future.</P>
    <P>The systematic monitoring of air quality by local authorities and the annual analysis of the results by the Environmental Protection Agency now consistently show that all urban areas are well within the statutory air quality standard for smoke.  The results also show that the quality of air in Dublin and Cork is generally better than that in a number of other cities and towns.  I am conscious, however, of the fact that there is some public concern regarding the continued use of bituminous coal for urban home heating purposes.</P>
    <P>There is a clear appreciation that public health and environmental conditions require our current good air quality to be maintained and smoke levels to be kept well within the widely accepted safety limits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="55" /> The Government is committed to a clean air policy.  We want to see improvement, on a precautionary basis, in certain urban areas where smoke levels are higher than the average.  The bans in Dublin and Cork have had a very beneficial effect on air quality and on the quality of life in these cities and the Government now wishes to secure improvements in air quality in other urban areas which could most benefit.  This objective is in line with one of the strategic objectives for air quality outlined in &ldquo;Sustainable Development &mdash; A Strategy for Ireland&rdquo;, published in April 1997, which sought to &ldquo;maintain and, if possible, improve local air quality, particularly in urban areas, so as to minimise any health risk to the urban population and improve the quality of urban living&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My Department is now considering the financial and other implications of extending the ban on bituminous coal and I intend to make decisions in this regard in the near future.  I will base my final decisions on the analysis by the Environmental Protection Agency of urban air quality up to the 1996-7 winter heating season.  I have already detailed some of the EPA findings. I will also be reviewing data for some areas not included in the 1996 report, such as County Wicklow, where additional data are available to me.</P>
    <P>It will be important to ensure that any extensions of the ban are properly determined so as to maximise the positive impact on urban air quality while ensuring that no undue burden is placed on householders, local authorities, the solid fuel industry or the Exchequer.  It is my intention, therefore, to give careful consideration to all the issues involved.  I am aware that the solid fuel industry would need a reasonable lead time to allow for proper forward planning or purchase requirements and to put contracts in place.  Local authorities would also need time to plan for their enforcement requirements.  Therefore, I would hope to be in a position to conclude this process in the next six weeks or so, in view of the lead times involved prior to the 1998-9 winter heating season which commences at the beginning of October next.</P>
    <P>The current winter heating season has been kind to Limerick so far.  There were only two days, at the beginning of December, when the concentration levels reached approximately 75 per cent of the 250 microgrammes per cubic metre limit value.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, Limerick is one of the areas under consideration in the context of the Government's commitment in regard to the extension of the ban on bituminous coal.  While well within air quality limits, smoke levels in Limerick in recent years have been somewhat above those in Dublin and Cork over the same period.</P>
    <P>Other comparisons show that in 1995-6, the 98-percentile smoke levels in Dublin were at 55 microgrammes per cubic metre and at 107 in Limerick. This level of differential was more marked <Col N="56" /> for 1994-5 with Dublin at 28 and Limerick at 101. In 1996-7, the last year for which data are published, Limerick was at 99 compared to 41 microgrammes per cubic metre for Dublin.</P>
    <P>The highest reading for smoke in Limerick in 1996-7 was 225 microgrammes per cubic metre at Ballykeeffe.  The highest readings in the city area were lower, 173 microgrammes per cubic metre at Moyross and 145 microgrammes per cubic metre at Todds.  The highest reading so far this winter has been 196 microgrammes per cubic metre at Moyross in December, 153 at Todds, 79 at Southhill and 70 at Ballykeeffe.  These are all readings for one day only and for the rest of the time readings are substantially lower.</P>
    <P>Banning bituminous coal has implications for the fuel industry.  The solid fuel industry throughout the country recognises its continuing decline as people move to more convenient fuels.  Experience has shown that the introduction of a ban on bituminous coal accelerates this kind of change.</P>
    <P>While figures are not readily available and it is not possible to give a breakdown between the amounts of solid fuel sold in Limerick and in the surrounding areas, it is estimated by the trade that in the region of 15,000 to 20,000 tonnes of solid fuel are sold annually in the urban area.  The main fuel is coal, with trade split between a limited number of distributors.  Figures for coal trade employment in the Limerick area are not readily available, given its fragmented nature.</P>
    <P>In regard to costs, all recipients of the weekly £5 national fuel scheme in the coal ban areas of Dublin and Cork receive a £3 weekly &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; smokeless fuel allowance.  These are the longer term disadvantaged and include most categories of long-term social welfare recipients.  In addition, some categories of shorter term social welfare recipients also receive the £3 allowance in Dublin and Cork after three months, in certain family circumstances. These include categories such as disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment allowance and family income support. There are approximately 5,800 recipients of the national fuel allowance scheme in Limerick city currently, with another 500 who could qualify for the &ldquo;top-up&rdquo; after three months if the ban were extended to Limerick.</P>
    <P>As I have said, my overall assessment of financial and other implications associated with extending the coal ban is not yet concluded. While final decisions have not been made, I am examining the appropriateness of a bituminous coal ban in Limerick.  In this regard, I am conscious that air quality in the city is lower than the air quality now achieved in Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to assure this House that the quality of urban air is an important issue for Government.  It is one I am pursuing as a matter of urgency, and I look forward to continuing improvements over the coming years as a result of the action I am planning in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>As a resident of central Dublin, I noticed that the changes in the air quality following the ban on bituminous coal were remarkable. I would like to see the ban being extended to other urban areas such as Limerick and I welcome the commitment the Minister of State has given on that.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that the cost implications of a ban must be taken into account.  However, that cost must be measured against the enormous cost implications of the continuous use of bituminous coal in the coming years.  It might be cheaper to recompense traders or those people who would have to change their domestic heating equipment than to continue burning coal.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the enormous increase in the incidence of asthma on a global basis.  I cannot offer absolute reasons for that but there is strong evidence that air pollution is a very important factor in the increase in the incidence of asthma which, in Irish children, has increased almost ten fold in the last generation.  Even allowing for better diagnosis of asthma, that is an extraordinary increase.</P>
      <P>One must also consider the number of cases of pneumonia occurring in older people who are city centre dwellers and who would perhaps not have developed the disease after a flu or common cold were it not for the very high level of air pollution in the vicinity of their homes.  We are inclined to forget the huge impact of lung disease on the development of cardiac disease.  We see that in the way cardiac facilities have been extended in Dublin, Galway and probably Limerick as well. While the developments which have been made in treating cardiac disease are important, we must recognise that, together with cancer, this is our major killer.  One must query the connection between the disposition to get emphysema and bronchitis and the development of cardiac disease in these areas.</P>
      <P>If one cuts open a sheep's lung it is pink but a lung of a person opened in a <i>post-mortem</i> is grey. This is because the sheep spends its life on a mountain and does not breathe the polluted air we must breathe.  It is a fascinating index of what happens to our lungs during our lifetime and how fibrous tissue is laid down which leads to difficulties in the heart having to pump through the pulmonary circulation.  There is an enormous increase in cardiac problems associated with lung disease.  It is important that we take lung disease into account in our efforts to combat cardiac disease. We must take urgent action in this regard. I know there are cost problems but when action was taken in Dublin it had a dramatic effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome some other initiatives which have been taken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I am slightly worried that the amendment and motion concentrate solely on bituminous coal.  We assess air quality on only the general measurement of sulphur dioxide and smoke particles, although some <Col N="58" /> stations are measuring carbon dioxide emissions and lead and fuel particles.</P>
    <P>It is very important to address the pollution in cities from the vastly increased number of cars. The Minister said efforts are being made to decrease air pollution on a global basis.  In 1987 the production of carbon dioxide in urban areas in Ireland was about one third the level of global production.  I wonder what it is now &mdash; it could be more than half the global level.  Bituminous coal is a major source of pollution but we must also look at the serious effect on air pollution of the increase in cars, trucks and lorries on our roads.</P>
    <P>The introduction of lead free petrol has made a great difference to the level of lead in the atmosphere.  However, we must not forget about the pollution caused by carbon dioxide and fuel particles.  The scheme to encourage people to update their cars to ones with more satisfactory internal combustion engines, which produce less pollution, was very important.  It is good to see fewer cars spewing out fumes.  I regret to say that State owned vehicles can sometimes be at fault in this regard.  The huge increase in the number of trucks on our roads has greatly increased the level of pollution, which must be addressed.</P>
    <P>However, to end on a cheering note, I was glad to see the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, implemented EU directives on volatile organic compounds last September.  These compounds must now be collected at service stations, oil terminals and so forth.  That pollution was addressed without any public protest.</P>
    <P>Let us hope the Department of the Environment and Local Government realises we are extraordinarily supportive of the measures it is introducing to improve air quality.  People sometimes think that because we are not heavily industrialised or urbanised air pollution is not likely to be a problem for us.  However, this is not so because Third World countries which have very little industrial pollution have very heavy domestic pollution, particularly due to the burning of unsuitable materials which produce a great deal of smoke.  It is important not to be sanguine just because we are on this lovely island in the Atlantic with the west wind blowing across us.  The issue must be addressed, not just on an all island basis but also on a local basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  There was a coalyard in Newbridge called Wallace's Coalyard but I do not know if the Minister of State has any connection with that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy to support the amendment, not because I disagree with the principle that there should be a ban on bituminous coal in Limerick but because other areas should also be looked at and because I am aware of the commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium which I am sure will be honoured in line with all the other commitments.  The Minister said he will be <Col N="59" /> examining the matter in the coming weeks.  The matter obviously requires a lead-in time but the measure could be brought in before next winter.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of considerable satisfaction for the Progressive Democrats that the original measure in Dublin, which was so successful in markedly reducing the level of pollution as the Minister explained, was implemented by the Tánaiste when she was Minister of State in the Department of the Environment with responsibility for environmental protection.  We can recall the situation in Dublin before that measure was implemented and the effects on air quality and human health.  We have almost forgotten about that because the air quality is now so good.  It is quite noticeable on days when we have this so-called air inversion that the air over Dublin city is clear but when I turn back towards Limerick I can see the smog over Naas and Newbridge.  That is a very dramatic turnaround in the space of a few years.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat the figures which the Minister of State cited.  According to figures I have seen, between 1989 and 1993 there was a five to sixfold decrease in the level of smoke in the atmosphere. I am sure that dramatic effect is welcomed by the citizens of Dublin.  The figures show the beneficial effects of introducing the same measure in Cork in 1995.</P>
    <P>This has resulted in the levels in Limerick being higher than those of Dublin and Cork, which are much bigger cities.  The levels are undesirably high and should be dealt with.  In 1996-7 Moyross had the second highest level of micrograms of smoke per cubic metre of air in the country.  If one is to proceed with the cleaning up of cities Limerick is the logical next step, which I know is the Minister's intention.</P>
    <P>There was a motion before Limerick Corporation in December 1994 which called on the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, to introduce this measure for Limerick.  The motion, which was in the name of the then Lord Mayor, Councillor Dick Sadler of the Progressive Democrats, was carried by 14 votes to one.  It is surprising to see a motion before this House calling for a measure which could have been implemented in 1994 when the previous Administration was in power.  It should be recognised that there was an opportunity to do it, that a motion was passed almost unanimously by Limerick Corporation but that nothing happened on foot of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the cost.  One of the reasons the measure was so successful was the amount of money available under the fuel scheme was increased from £5 to £8.  It was stated earlier that the level of compliance in Dublin is very high.  I know the increase in the payment was of critical importance in that.  I suggest the Minister look closely at a similar measure for Limerick to increase the payment.  As far as I know, it has not increased over the past few years.  It would be reasonable to examine a figure of £10 as opposed <Col N="60" /> to £8 for the fuel scheme in the context of the coal ban.  It is something I know Councillor Tim O'Malley, a Progressive Democrat candidate in Limerick, is &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Councillor O'Malley recommended the measure, as do I to the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Minister contrasted the situation with Cork.  It is a Government priority to extend the measure and I know it will happen.  As far as I am aware, the levels are still very high in Belfast.</P>
      <P>One point I would make to the Minister in respect of WHO standards and draft directives from the European Union is that, while they are guides, I do not believe they should be used as absolutes.  It should be our intention to have standards lower than those set by WHO and the EU. Our environment is very important to us in terms of job creation and attracting companies, such as Dell with 3,000 jobs for Limerick.  The quality of the environment is extremely important not just from a health point of view but also in terms of inward investment.</P>
      <P>I am pleased the Minister spoke of the precautionary principle.  That is something which should be applied in general environmental matters and not just in dealing with smoke.  We should act on the basis of taking precautions rather than having to clean up our act.  I look forward to the commitment in the programme being delivered on.</P>
      <P>One final point concerns figures quoted in technical terms.  There should be a consistent standard whereby people can make comparisons. In this case it is microgrammes per cubic metre of air.  I have struggled with the figures for the rate of flow on the River Liffey.  One can find oneself dealing with many different parameters of which gallons per minute is one.  It becomes extremely difficult for the layperson to make valid comparisons, and I believe that is sometimes intentional.  When dealing with measurement, a common standard should be used so comparisons can be made.</P>

      <P>Bituminous coal is a danger to the public.  That has been discovered already in Dublin and we are very much aware of it in Cork.  The problem of eliminating it has been solved in the Dublin and Cork regions with the help of the traders and others.  I see no reason it should not be done in Limerick, and I fail to understand why a long discussion must be entered into on it.  Why is a regulation being implemented in two large urban areas, Dublin and Cork, and immediate <Col N="61" /> consideration not being given to implementing it in all other urban areas, not just Limerick?</P>
      <P>People spoke of the potential cost to the Department.  I have known the Minister a long time and I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well.  It is the first time I have had the opportunity of speaking to him in this House. I know he is sincere.  At the same time, we should seriously question the repercussions of changing the situation in Limerick.  I believe they would be the same as they were in Cork.  The local authority there met many traders, who made recommendations to it which it accepted and this led to the measure being very successful.  The problem is not completely solved.  Cork is in a valley, unlike Dublin which is flat.  The Minister is aware of that.  In one area both of us represent, Black-pool, there is still a problem when there are bland days in the city, but we are trying to solve it.</P>
      <P>What incentives are being given?  What promotions are being carried out?  What recommendations are being made to people?  There is a top up on the national fuel scheme for people using smokeless fuel in specific areas.  Why is it not applied to the people of Limerick?  What would it cost?  There are 5,800 recipients of the national fuel allowance scheme in Limerick with another 500 who could possibly qualify for the top up after three months if the ban were extended to it. That is not an enormous cost.  If a regulation is implemented in Dublin and Cork, it should be implemented in the entire country.  Traders selling fuel have only to look at what happened to traders in Dublin and Cork and they will know how to cope.</P>
      <P>What promotions are being carried out?  What is Bord Gáis being asked to do in the Limerick region?  Moyross and Ballykeeffe are the two areas where smoke pollution is particularly high. Moyross is an area where many people are unfortunately unemployed, like many parts of Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not deny that.  Many of these unemployed people require heat all day as do elderly people living in these areas.  Pollution is being created all the time, unlike in the upper class areas where central heating, be it gas, oil or whatever, can be turned on and off.</P>
      <P>The Minister said consideration will be given to extending this measure.  I know if he says in six weeks' or two months' time he is seriously considering doing that, he will do it.  However, I understand what Senator Jackman is saying.  One cannot blame her if she believes no consideration is being given by the Government to Limerick. There is no reason a recommendation should not be made now that the same measure will apply to Limerick as to Cork and Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any way an incentive can be created for people in Moyross or Ballykeeffe?  Why can consideration not be given to financially assisting these people to change the fuel they use?  Why is <Col N="62" /> Bord Gáis not asked to take the same initiative in Limerick as it did in Cork and Dublin?  It worked very well in those areas.  I would sit by a coal fire all night, like many others here.  I also have natural gas central heating.  However, it is very hard to beat the natural resource available in Ireland and which also comes at a very reasonable cost.  It would be cheaper for the people of Moyross to burn it over the winter than coal or another type of solid fuel.  It would also be cheaper for the State.</P>
    <P>Has this been investigated?  Are we prepared to say to Senator Jackman that we will give an incentive to her local authority region to implement this measure? We should lead by example as it would cost very little.  We should give the people of Moyross an extra £3 per week not to burn certain types of fuel.  It is as simple as that.  There is no reason that cannot be done.  Serious consideration should be given to Senator Jackman's proposal. She has made a very strong case.  There has been a 30 per cent increase in the number of cars on the road in the last five years and by taking less excise duty, we are giving people an incentive to buy unleaded fuel.  That is important to us, to our children and to the environment.</P>
    <P>Senator Jackman is correct in saying the younger generation will speak out more about the environment than any of us.  They are telling us what to do, and they are right because they want to live in a health environment.  Does anyone here know what it is like to be in Cork and to see State buses spewing out fumes?  People will not put up with this any longer because they are learning how important the environment is from the television and in schools.  Little did I think I would be speaking about the importance of environmental matters, such as trees in our cities.</P>
    <P>Nobody would believe there is a smoke level regulation for Cork and Dublin but not for Limerick. Why not have that regulation in Limerick, Naas, Tullamore, Portlaoise, Waterford and Galway? There is no reason why it cannot apply to those places.  Neither is there a reason fuel suppliers in these areas cannot learn from the fuel suppliers of Dublin and Cork.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and congratulate him on his election.  A legislative framework for pollution control and abatement was provided by the Air Pollution Act, 1987.  Many of the legislative controls introduced under the Act in relation to air purity and emissions are derived from a need to comply with EU legislation.  In this regard, air quality standards for several pollutants centred on the pollution potential of some fuels and a licensing system to control polluting emissions from industrial plants are among a range of specific measures introduced by way of regulation under the Act.  The Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, provides for integrated pollution control licensing by the agency in respect of major industries and other <Col N="63" /> activities with a significant potential to cause pollution, including air pollution.  Regulations introduced under road traffic legislation give effect to the variety of EU Directives aimed at reducing emissions from motor vehicles.</P>
      <P>The most important national initiative in air pollution control has been the introduction of smoke control measures to alleviate problems of winter smog in the larger urban areas.  These measures take the form of a ban on the marketing, sale and distribution of bituminous fuels in designated areas.  They were introduced in Dublin and Cork in 1990 and 1995, respectively.</P>
      <P>We know that banning the sale of bituminous fuels in these areas has been most successful and has improved air quality.  The Governments that introduced the Environmental Protection Agency were Fianna Fáil led &mdash; in 1990 it was the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government, and in 1995, it was a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
      <P>I welcome measures that would ensure smoke-free status for Limerick similar to Dublin and Cork, and I am confident that the Government will treat Limerick as a priority area in this regard.  The Minister stated that air quality in Dublin was a major problem in the past, with smoke levels as high as 1,800 microgrammes per cubic metre on occasion, which is over seven times the EU limit of 250 microgrammes per cubic metre, although those levels were reached in particularly adverse climatic conditions.  Levels in Limerick are not that bad, but we are anxious that measures be taken to ensure that the city be smoke-free for the health of its people, as Senator Jackman said.</P>
      <P>Limerick's pollution levels are lower than the EU limit, but the rising population may make smoke-free status necessary.  The Limerick levels are reasonable because much of the heating is provided by gas and oil heating.  That might not be the case in Moyross and Southill because people may not be able to afford the best fuel. Bituminous fuels cost £6.50 per bag, and smokeless coals cost £7.50 per bag.  In addition to being cheaper, bituminous coal is sold in 50 kg bags while smokeless coal is sold in 40 kg bags, confusing people as to the size of the bags.  People are being charged the same price for both bags; this should be examined.</P>
      <P>Senator Jackman suggested that the Mid-Western Health Board should carry out a survey to establish the damage done to people's health, particularly in respect to asthma, which I would welcome.  The Government is conscious of Limerick's need for smoke-free status and I am confident that the matter will be addressed.  Senator Cregan stated that this should be done immediately. A motion was passed by Limerick Corporation by a margin of 14 to one in December 1994 on this issue, but the Government did nothing about it.  Senator Jackman should have pursued this matter since then, but now that there is a by-election the matter is being debated.</P>

I also wish to acknowledge my own role in bringing in a smoke area order in Dublin County Council prior to the Minister introducing the legislation.

      <P>Many surprises are pleasant, but I do not know whether this one was.  I always thought this Chamber was one where gentler forces prevailed and where support comes from the Opposition rather than the railing we have seen.</P>
      <P>I do not see why Limerick should be discriminated against on the issue of clean air, particularly with so many fine by-election candidates.  I am old enough to remember Dublin in the rare old times when it was called &ldquo;dirty Dublin&rdquo; for a very good reason.  Layers of soot clung to every building.  I hardly recognise some of the buildings I knew as a child and which are now clean and white.  Obviously a clean air policy works.  There was even a romantic attachment to smog and fog when one remembers Laurence Olivier and Vivienne Leigh on Westminster Bridge.  My mother told me about that film which I saw recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early 1980s 3,650 local authority houses were built in north Clondalkin.  Unbelievably, none of them had a central heating system installed.  Everybody burned coal.  The area has <Col N="65" /> the doubtful claim of having the highest pollution levels in the country in 1988.  I remember one December in particular when there were six days when the level of pollution was above the limit. It was dreadful.  There was no wind and a pall of smog hung over the area.  A specialist from St. James's Hospital spoke on the radio about the urgency of solving the problem because of the significant increase in the number of children and elderly being admitted to hospital with asthma.</P>
    <P>I remember the initial problems regarding traders, referred to be Senator Cregan, but I am sure they have been solved.  One of the reasons people were reluctant to change was that smokeless coal burned the fire basket necessitating the replacement of grates in a great number of houses in north Clondalkin.  The coal has been refined and this problem does not occur anymore.  I accept Senator Cregan's point regarding the availability of natural gas.</P>
    <P>I do not see why all Members will not support the motion.  Like virtue, it is not possible to be against it.  We are entitled to breathe clear air and I hope the motion will receive the full support of Members.</P>
    <P>I read the Minister's speech with great interest and noted the references to the near future.  Perhaps I am being cynical, but this may refer to the period before the by-election.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion and trust that we will have the support of my esteemed colleagues in the Government parties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a big improvement since the introduction of smokeless coal in Dublin. Congratulations are due to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment who took on those who opposed her actions.  At the time there was great opposition to her proposals. We were told ranges would be burned out; that much damage would be done; that the suggested timescale was not possible and that many people would be put out of work because of the fall off in sales of bituminous coal.  However, such predictions were proved wrong and the city is much cleaner and better because of her actions.</P>
      <P>Exhaust fumes from trucks, buses and cars are a further problem, the biggest problem being with CIE buses which are spewing out smoke and exhaust fumes at an awful rate.  Many people talk about dumping toxic waste, but what is more toxic than the fumes being emitted by some of these vehicles?  It is unbelievable that we do not seem to have regard for the problem.  I thought we had rules and regulations preventing such emissions, but the standards that have been set do not seem to be working.  I would like to see more action being taken to ensure cleaner air, including the use of catalytic converters.  Much work is being done on diesel engines, which are clean if the pumps and injectors are serviced, to ensure lower emissions.  Bad servicing is the cause of diesel vehicles emitting such an amount of toxic waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="66" /> The Government has always been positive in ensuring the environment and the air are kept clean.  We are known as a green and clean country because that is what we are.  We have more blue flag beaches than any other country in Europe which proves our waters and environment are clean.  The Government is committed to correcting the problem in Limerick.  The problem should be corrected to ensure this lovely city is clean, clear, smoke free and pollution free.  In its Action Programme for the Millennium the Government stated that the regulations will be extended to Limerick and that it will be a clean air city.  Irrespective of the number of resolutions passed by the Seanad, the work of the Government will not be done any sooner.  In a little over a year Limerick will be a smoke free city.  I do not see the rush in insisting that this be done tomorrow; that would be impossible.</P>
    <P>This Government and previous Governments, including all Fianna Fáil Governments, have been very conscious of this issue.  It was a Fianna Fáil Government which established the Department of the Environment.</P>

      <P>The smog in Dublin was cleared in a short period and I have no doubt that Limerick will be cleaned up in the same way.  I am confident that the Government and the Minister will honour their undertaking in the Action Programme for the Millennium and that Limerick has no need to worry.</P>
      <P>I would like to see tighter controls on the level of pollution from trucks and buses.  Buses are the most significant polluters of the air.  CIE should be warned and asked to clean up its act and to service its vehicles.  It should be advised that dirty exhaust from buses is not acceptable.  Truck owners who drive long distances throughout Europe have, in general, very good quality vehicles which comply with EU regulations.  CIE, however is guilty of pollution.  We remember the time when every building in Dublin was, to use a colloquialism, as black as your shoe.  We now have a clean capital city and I have no doubt that, by the year 2000, Limerick will be just as free of pollution.</P>

      <P>I am happy to support this resolution. The impact of altering the status of Limerick, while of great benefit to the citizens, will not have an immense global impact.  It is, however, part of a necessary psychology.  We must deal with these difficult problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="67" /> I do not intend to get involved in the question of the forthcoming by-election.  One of the benefits of being totally independent &mdash; for yourself in your august position as chairman of debates and permanently for me, a Chathaoirligh &mdash; is that I do not take sides.  I can award a palm of honour to the Progressive Democrats in the person of Mary Harney who tackled the problem of pollution in Dublin.  It was a very serious problem. Various hospitals reported large numbers of cases of asthma , leading in a number of cases to death, every winter.  While not as bad as London, Dublin had very thick and unpleasant fogs largely contributed to by the domestic burning of bituminous coal.  Senator Farrell has referred to the dirt of buildings in Dublin.  Even in the 1950s and 1960s, when I was young, attempts were made to clean them but the minute they were cleaned they instantly started going black again.  Considerable damage was inflicted on the architectural environmnent by the various techniques employed in cleaning, scaling, sand blasting and so on.  We recognise the fact that this is a significant and difficult problem.  While it is important that these measures be extended to cities such as Limerick we must bear in mind that this is a very modest step in terms of impact on the global environment.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentions 16 other towns and cities. I would like to know more about these and their status.  In Dublin we now burn rather boring compacted coal.  It never really blazes and you have to burn wood with it.  I presume it is legal to burn wood and turf which I certainly do.  This gives a satisfactory blaze because the other fuel is just boring.  What are the smoke pollution levels in the 16 urban areas mentioned by the Minister? Where are these 16 towns?  I imagine the list includes towns such as Mallow, Kilkenny and Sligo.  The figures quoted by the Minister give clear cause for concern with regard to Limerick. He says, rather modestly, &ldquo;smoke levels in Limerick over recent years have been somewhat above those in Dublin and Cork&rdquo;.  This is a rather modest statement of the case because, according to the figures quoted by the Minister, in 1995-96 the 98-percentile smoke levels in Dublin were at 55 microgrammes per cubic metre and in Limerick at 107.  I would have thought that Limerick's level of twice that of Dublin was a little more than &ldquo;somewhat above&rdquo;.  Readings for other years were four times the amount.  In 1994-95 Dublin was at 28 and Limerick at 101.  That is quadruple the Dublin figure.  Limerick's pollution levels are considerably higher than those of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I note the question of cost, particularly in terms of employment and of income generation for the fuel industry.  Will the Minister tell the House what have been the effects on Dublin?  I assume that some departmental studies were done in the aftermath of the implementation of the Dublin clean air plan.  If this was not done in Dublin then it should be done in the case of Limerick.  If such <Col N="68" /> studies were done in Dublin then I imagine that the impact on employment and on the fuel industry was examined.</P>
    <P>There are additional effects from the burning of fossil fuels.  One of them is acid rain.  One of the most serious examples of the impact of acid rain on the environment is the city of Athens where buildings such as the Acropolis have been very seriously affected.</P>
    <P>We must extend this debate beyond the narrow confines of a clean air policy for Limerick.  I would like to put some thoughts on the record from the proceedings of a climate change conference in the German Bundestag in Bonn on October 16 and 17, 1997.  Professor Stephen Schneider says:</P>
    <P>the sustained globally averaged rate of natural temperature change is 1 per cent per thousand years.  We want to compare that rate of change to the rate of change we are expecting over the next century: the IPCC forecasts an increase in temperatures of 1 per cent to 3.5 per cent.  Sea level rises could be in the range of 15 to 90 centimetres, threatening coastal dwellers and island states around the world.  Severity of storms could dramatically increase and associated insurance damage could seriously threaten the viability of the global insurance industry.</P>
    <P>We are facing an extremely dangerous situation. I will put two paragraphs dealing with carbon fuels on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>There are over 4,000 billion tons of carbon in reserves of fossil fuels, about 1,000 billion tons of which are economically recoverable.  If we were to limit the increase of greenhouse gases to an equivalent CO2 doubling, we could burn 700 billion tons; if we were to adopt the EU's limit, we could only burn 400 billion tons. The UNEP' guidelines allow us even less.  Business as usual emissions over the next century are likely to be about 1,400 or 1,500 billion tons.</P>
    <P>Whichever measure we choose to adopt, any of those budgets is less than half of the business as usual scenario.  A delay in industrialised countries taking measures doesn't actually change the budget much: if we fail to take action, we will only reduce the amount of carbon for the developing world to use later on.</P>

      <P>Senator Jackman ably represents Limerick East both in the Seanad and on the local authority.  In that capacity, she has tabled a motion which relates to an issue of concern to the people of that constituency.  The Minister of State gave a detailed outline of the problem of smoke pollution in Limerick city.  I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his well deserved appointment after many years of service in the Lower House.  His experience will be of great value to the Department of the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>The debate so far has focused on national and international problems with air quality, pollution and so forth.  However, the motion relates to Limerick. The Minister of State quoted figures that indicate there is a serious problem in certain areas of Limerick such as Southill, Ballykeeffe and Moyross.  The same problem arose in Dublin in 1990 when the current Tánaiste, who was then a Minister of State, introduced an order to deal with it.  It was unfortunate that she did not also introduce a similar order to apply to Limerick city.  The then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government discriminated against Limerick and did not take the necessary action.  I hope this motion will prompt the new Government to take positive action on this occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said he will take action shortly.  He should do so immediately.  This problem arises in areas of the city with concentrated corporation housing.  Many of them have a high rate of unemployment and suffer serious social disadvantage.  Priority must be given to these areas and a specific plan to deal with the problem must be put in place.  The Department's action in Dublin was extremely successful.  Perhaps the Minister of State would consider applying the same measures in Limerick city.  There has been a huge increase in the incidence of asthma, bronchitis and chest complaints in young children and elderly people and that is borne out by medical records.  Any assistance that can be given by the Minister of State should be given immediately.</P>
      <P>The figures for smoke pollution in Limerick are frightening.  The highest reading in 1996 was 225 microgrammes per cubic metre at Ballykeeffe. The reading was 173 microgrammes per cubic metre in Moyross.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole would not be interested in this area because there would not be many votes there during his election.  He can afford to make jibes on this issue.</P>
      <P>The reading at Todds was 145 microgrammes per cubic metre.  That figure is interesting because it refers to a business area, yet the reading is relatively high.  The figures are disturbing and are much worse than those for Limerick and Cork. The action taken in those areas has proven quite effective.  Senator Jackman seeks positive action in Limerick city and I appeal to the Minister of State to respond to her call.  He is a decent man, unlike some of his colleagues who have sought to make this a political issue.  He has dealt with it in a responsible fashion and I hope his partners in Government will support him.  They, too, might have an interest in achieving positive action in Limerick city in forthcoming months.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Jackman on thinking so highly of her electorate as to table this motion.  I support it and I would like to see it extended to Kerry.  I am sorry Senator Taylor-Quinn did not seek to extend it to Clare and surrounding counties.</P>
      <P>Limerick has a mixed history with regard to the burning of coal.  Senator Taylor-Quinn must be aware that coal merchants in Limerick city were less than helpful to County Clare a few years ago when they refused to allow the largest coal importer in Ireland to sell coal in Limerick city and other places.  That created much unemployment in the Senator's constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixty years earlier the same traders got very upset when the same company, which is now selling coal in Senator Taylor-Quinn's constituency, decided to dam the Shannon at Ardnacrusha and build the most advanced hydroelectric power centre in Europe.  On that occasion the traders feared they would not sell enough coal if people started using electricity.  The city has had a chequered history with regard to coal.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Jackman has taken a more general approach in that she simply wishes to clean the air in the city.  I wish her well in that, as well as in the by-election.  Undoubtedly, by tabling this important and progressive motion the Senator is positioning herself for the forthcoming by-election.  She is entitled to do that and there is no need to hide the fact.  This motion is as important as an election address and if good things result from it, that is all to the good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there is a broader issue involved in the motion which relates not just to the quality of the air but also to the water that flows through the city.  How many towns' sewerage systems along the River Shannon are dumping their contents into the river which is flowing through the beautiful city of Limerick?  It is also extraordinary <Col N="71" /> that underprivileged areas appear to have some of the highest pollution figures.  That raises a question about our priorities.</P>
    <P>The Senator wishes to have the measures introduced in Limerick city.  However, a national approach should be adopted.  Walls cannot be erected around cities and counties so a national approach is important.  Discussions on problems such as this should include the entire environment. This debate has focused on air quality and the burning of coal but the issue is the type of fuels we should use.  There was a healthy debate in this country 20 years ago when it was proposed to locate a nuclear power station in County Wexford.  At the time people considered the issue of nuclear power.  They also discussed the potential impact of the coal burning generating station at Kilkee when it was proposed.</P>
    <P>I often drive past the cement factory in Limerick city.  Although a great deal of work was done to improve the surrounding area, grass would not grow within half a mile of the factory.  The same material that stops the grass growing is in the air but one cannot hold one's breath for the ten minutes it takes to drive past the factory.  A great deal must be done about the quality of the air in Limerick.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Grass does not grow within half a mile of the cement factory in Limerick even though the owners of the factory have made a huge effort to landscape and improve the area.</P>
      <P>It is not only a matter of the Government introducing legislation, which is important and the reason I will support the motion but it is important to keep pressure on the Government. Why did the previous Government not take action given that the figures the Minister gave show that the highest readings took place during the period of the last Government?  For those of us on the Independent benches, it is not a matter of who is in Government but rather the health of people.</P>
      <P>We need to take a wider view and look not only at the impact of burning coal but other substances. Senator Norris mentioned the impact of acid rain.  We have seen that even rain can impact on us.  What part did we play internationally at the two global conferences held in the past ten years to address the issue of acid rain?  We must ensure the quality of our waters, rain and air are satisfactory before we can look at the impact of these issues on the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to Senator Jackman that there is nothing to stop the air in County Clare or in Counties Cork, Kerry or Tipperary spreading across and polluting Limerick.  The Senator may say these are not conurbations and the same problems do not arise but it is an issue which needs to be addressed nationally.  I support a <Col N="72" /> national approach to the problem.  I support this motion because there is nothing wrong with it and it puts pressure on the Government to act.</P>

The Minister made a comprehensive speech in which he outlined the position nationally and not only in County Limerick.  Senator Jackman's proposal is excellent and timely and I hope the Government will effect what she wishes, that is, to make Limerick an area in which bituminous coal cannot be used.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to facts which were not mentioned in the Minister's statement perhaps because it was not within his remit but that of the Department of Health.  There is an index of deaths from various causes, particularly respiratory causes, which is done on a county basis. County Louth has the highest number of deaths in the country from respiratory illnesses.  I do not know where County Limerick comes on that list but it is important the people of Limerick get those facts from the health board because it is difficult to talk in the absence of medical knowledge. Mortality statistics are available for County Louth.  The amendment mentions a commitment to extend the ban to major urban areas and I ask that be it extended to County Louth, particularly the major towns of Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>
      <P>To measure air pollution, stations must be located in different areas.  The problem is that the majority of people who burn coal live in working class housing estates and do not have the money to buy gas or oil, although many are installing gas. It is important we select areas which represent the worst areas nationally, including the largest working class estates, to measure the impact of the environment on the health of the people.</P>

      <P>The tenor of my speech related to health as I am spokesperson on health and children.  As I said, I anxiously await the Mid-Western Health Board survey on asthma suffers. According to anecdotal evidence, the number of such cases is higher than in other areas and this will be backed up by the Mid-Western Health Board's survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Health must be put first.  The Minister said the Government is conscious of these standards in health and environment terms and that excessive levels of smoke pollution in the atmosphere can create conditions which are extremely uncomfortable and unhealthy.  He said independent Irish <Col N="73" /> research has shown that they are associated with increased hospital admissions, increased morbidity and a peak in mortality.  I argue that the costs which will ensue on a daily basis if we do not address the issue of Limerick will be far greater on the Government in terms of hospital admissions.  The Minister stated this and referred to acute effects, including immediate irritations to eyes and throat, hospitalisation and even deaths from respiratory failure or heart attacks.  Senator Henry also referred to these effects.  Other effects include decreased pulmonary function and there are high risk groups such as the elderly, people with asthma and people with diseases of the lungs.  The Minister also said research has identified a clear link between lung and respiratory related hospital admissions and peaks in poor urban air quality.</P>
    <P>There has been pressure on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, to reduce hospital waiting lists.  I am trying to reduce these for the elderly and children by extending this ban to Limerick.  We have seen the positive effects of this ban on Dublin and Cork.  Much as the Minister is proactive and anxious to facilitate me, I cannot accept the vagueness in the amendment which welcomes the commitment in the Action Programme for the Millennium to extend the ban on bituminous coal to major urban areas.  According to my research, Clonmel and Wexford are also risk areas.</P>
    <P>We want the Minister to make a ministerial order in which a specific date would be set to do the preparatory work.  We want a specific commitment <Col N="74" /> in relation to Limerick now.  I have not received such a commitment and I cannot accept the amendment because it is not specific.  On Senator Dardis's comments, we all admired the Tánaiste, who as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, brought about a smog free Dublin.  Senator Avril Doyle who was a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment with responsibility for natural resources in 1987 prepared the heads of Bills and had done the preparatory work which made it easy for the Minister to designate Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is a high level of unemployment, particularly long-term unemployment, in Moyross.  The majority of people remain indoors during the winter and do not go out to work.  The long-term unemployed and elderly burn fires because they have no other income with which to provide themselves with an alternative source of heating. The Minister agreed that area is most at risk because of low quality air.  On the weekly £5 national fuel scheme, we know a bag of coal costs £6.50, about which I spoke in relation to the budget.</P>
    <P>As regards the amount of funding required, the potential costs are minimal in relation to the costs which will accrue if people, particularly in disadvantaged areas, are hospitalised as a result of recurring health problems.  I ask the Minister to introduce an order designating Limerick immediately. Other major urban areas may be included in the future.  Limerick is at risk at present and I cannot accept the Government amendment which is vague in terms of implementation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is a fundamental and important part of the Bill and a number of amendments to it have been tabled.  Amendment No. 18 seeks to insert a new section.  It states:</P>
      <P>The appointment of County Registrars shall remain as in accordance with section 35(2) of the Court Officers Act, 1926.</P>
      <P>It is most important that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained. It was stated earlier that county registrars have administrative and quasi-judicial functions. This aspect was debated at length on Second Stage.  Proposals to transfer their administrative functions, in so far as they relate to the Circuit Court office, are acceptable to county registrars. However, the position regarding their quasi-judicial functions is a horse of a different colour. It is most important that the independence of county registrars is fully maintained and in no way interfered with, inhibited or restricted by the Bill.</P>
      <P>The fundamental issue is that democracy supersedes bureaucracy.  Under the current legislation, the appointment of county registrars is a ministerial function. The Minister's predecessors appointed registrars and I hope, with his help, his successors will also do so.  It is most important that the quasi-judicial functions of county registrars are maintained.  The quasi-judicial functions of the Master of the High Court were recognised and accepted on Second Stage and in the Bill. Provision is made for them.  Unfortunately, the Minister did not recognise the quasi-judicial functions of county registrars on Second Stage or in the Bill.  I hope he will rectify that position during this debate.</P>
      <P>Most county registrars are qualified solicitors with many years experience as practising lawyers before their appointment.  Barristers are also eligible for appointment as county registrars.  It is important that people appointed as county registrars in the future come from the practical end of the legal profession and have experience of working on the ground with the public and fellow legal practitioners.  They should be familiar with all aspects of the law at all levels.  At present county registrars come from this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> As part of their quasi-judicial functions, county registrars act as county sheriffs and adjudicate on various issues which are obviously within their remit.  It is important that they retain these powers and are not subsumed in the overall Courts Service proposed by the Bill.  It would be a retrograde step to subsume county registrars.  It would not in any way assist the judicial system or the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The administrative functions of country registrars are different from their quasi-judicial functions. There is no clear indication in the Bill who will appoint the county registrars once the Bill is enacted.  I raised this issue on Second Stage and it has not been addressed.  We have tabled an amendment seeking to ensure that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and that appointments continue to be made under the Court Officers Act, 1926.  The situation of those already appointed and those to be appointed in the future will be somewhat different.  The Minister must address this issue to our satisfaction.</P>
    <P>A number of amendments have been tabled and one might suggest that the matter might be dealt with by the amendments.  However, those amendments are open to a variety of interpretations. We want a clear and specific provision which does not alter the <i>status quo.</i>  As a professional lawyer and a politician the Minister must recognise the value of the arguments put to him and the importance of addressing the issue.</P>
    <P>Politicians should not constantly pander and react to the media profile of them which seeks to diminish our power as Members of Oireachtas or Government.  The Minister and his colleagues should not reduce the powers vested in them.  It is not good for democracy to take power from elected public representatives sitting at Cabinet. The Minister should keep his powers in this regard.</P>
    <P>The general administration is a different issue from the matter in hand.  The party allegiance of the Minister who makes the appointments is irrelevant; it is sufficient that they are elected Members of the Oireachtas.  The power should not be given to a bureaucratic commission or board which is only accountable to the Oireachtas through the Committee of Public Accounts or another Oireachtas committee.  That is not satisfactory. As public representatives we are accountable to the people and the Cabinet is accountable to the Oireachtas.  In the final analysis, that is where accountability rests as defined in the Constitution and it should remain so with regard to this issue.  I hope the Minister sees the wisdom of our arguments and ensures that the <i>status quo</i> is maintained.</P>
    <P>The Bill suggests that future appointments of county registrars would be made by the Civil Service Commission.  That would not be satisfactory. Since there is a quasi-judicial function in question, that must be dealt differently.  It requires recognition similar to that of the Master of the High Court.  The independence of county registrars <Col N="77" /> must be maintained and I depend on the Minister to respond positively on this matter.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments proposed by Members on this side of the House. Amendment No. 34 from the Labour Party proposes to allow county registrars to make limited orders in proceedings subject to appeal to the Circuit Court.  There is a similar provision in the 1995 Act with regard to the Master of the High Court. Our amendment would extend the same principle to the Circuit Court.  I agree with Senator Taylor-Quinn's comments on the role and function of county registrars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the arguments put by my colleagues.  The independence of the county registrars should be maintained.  As Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Connor pointed out, they carry out quasi-judicial functions.  They have carried out several roles to great effect over many years, including those of county sheriff, compiling registers of electors and acting as returning officers at elections.  In my experience they have always acted independently when carrying out those functions.  I urge the Minister to accept our amendments.</P>
      <P>The third report of the working group on the Courts Service, chaired by Mrs. Justice Denham and comprising other eminent judges, recommended that established statutory positions such as the Master of the High Court, county registrars, taxing masters and examiners should be maintained, except where, to date, they had a formal statutory relationship to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The working group set up by the previous Minister, Deputy Owen, recommended that the office of county registrar should be on the same basis as taxing masters and the Master of the High Court.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to accept our amendments and maintain the right to appoint county registrars. If not, will he outline who will appoint them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions.  These amendments relate to the position of county registrars under the Bill.  I listened carefully to Senators' contributions on Second Stage, in particular, to the concerns expressed on all sides about the position of county registrars.  In the main two concerns were expressed &mdash; first, that the Bill conferred the status of civil servants of the State on county registrars for the first time and, second, that the Bill may not have safeguarded adequately the independence of county registrars, particularly in the exercise by them of their quasi-judicial functions and their non-court functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I propose take account of the arguments made by Senators and the amendments they have tabled.  They also follow from discussions between the Department and the representatives of county registrars, with whom I <Col N="78" /> met.  Amendment No. 45 has the effect of removing the reference to county registrars from the First Schedule.  This has the effect of disapplying in respect of county registrars section 24 of the Bill which transfers staff to the Courts Service on the establishment day.  Amendment No. 31 deletes the provision of the Bill which confers the status of civil servants of the State on county registrars.  The combined effect of these amendments is that county registrars will not be categorised as staff of the service and that their current status as non-civil servants will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Without the addition of further amendments, the effect of these two amendments would be to exclude county registrars from the operation of the Courts Service.  That would be inconsistent with the thrust of the Bill which is to bring the management and administration of the courts into a single, cohesive structure, namely, the Courts Service.  The exclusion of county registrars would not be satisfactory as it would exclude a substantial area of court administration from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that, in addition to courts administration work, county registrars exercise a wide range of quasi-judicial functions as well as certain functions such as returning officers which are unrelated to court functions. The purpose of amendment No. 38 is to ensure that county registrars will be part of the Courts Service but only in so far as their functions relating to the administration of their court offices are concerned.  Their quasi-judicial functions are excluded from the effect of this provision by reference to section 9 which ensures that the service, the board or the chief executive will not be in a position to impinge upon the independence of a person who exercises such limited judicial functions conferred on them by law.  A county registrar is such a person.  The amendment also safeguards the independence of county registrars' non-court work as it makes it clear that they will be part of the Courts Service only in so far as their function is related to a function of the Courts Service.  This excludes non-court work.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 28 provides that county registrars will be answerable to the board through the chief executive only in so far as their court related administrative functions are concerned.  The overall effect of my amendments is to confer no change of status on county registrars.  The only change in relation to their functions is that their courts administrative work alone will become part of the work of the Courts Service and in that connection alone would county registrars be responsible to the board of the Courts Service. This represents the minimum change necessary in respect of the position of county registrars which is consistent with the thrust of the Bill.  The amendments proposed by Senators Connor, Cosgrave, Taylor-Quinn and Burke seek to achieve the same objective as my amendments in a slightly different way.  For that reason I ask them to withdraw their amendments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> Senator O'Meara's amendment does not directly address the relationship between county registrars and the Courts Service.  However, I accept that it attempts to recognise the special position of county registrars.  Her amendment seems to restate the position under the Constitution and the law that county registrars may exercise quasi-judicial functions and that in the exercise of these functions their decisions will be appealable to the Circuit Court.  The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, provides for a wide range of quasi-judicial functions which county registrars may exercise and which are appealable to the Circuit Court.  Subsection (2) of the Senator's amendment would confer additional powers on county registrars corresponding to the powers of the Master of the High Court.  The powers of county registrars in the area of quasi-judicial business are being kept under review.  The Court and Court Officers Act, 1995, represented a major overhaul and extension of the functions of county registrars.  It would be premature to further extend these powers until the full impact of the powers conferred under the Act can be assessed.  It is also doubtful that additional quasi-judicial powers could be conferred by way of rules as the amendment seeks to do.  I ask the Senator to withdraw her amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill, with my amendments, will make no changes to the arrangements for the appointment of county registrars.  This power is conferred by the Court Officers Act, 1926.  It would be superfluous to repeat the provisions of that Act in this legislation.  What is now proposed is that county registrars would be part of the Courts Service only in so far as their powers and functions in relation to courts are concerned.  They would maintain their independence in so far as their quasi-judicial and other powers are concerned. They will not become civil servants and will continue to be appointed by the Government.  This meets the concerns expressed by Senators on Second and Committee Stages.  It also meets the concerns of county registrars.  My amendments are illustrative of democracy at work in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.</P>
      <P>He has gone a long way to meet our concerns. However, we are concerned to ensure that this clearly appears in the Bill.  Section 9 states:</P>
      <P>.</P>
      <P>(a) a judge in the performance of his or her judicial functions, or</P>
      <P>(b) a person other than a judge in the performance of limited functions of a judicial nature conferred on that person by law.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 states:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 24, after &ldquo;judges&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or County Registrars&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="80" /> If adopted, this would clearly indicate that section 9 specifically refers to county registrars.</P>
    <P>The Minister could improve on his own amendment No. 38 which states:</P>
    <P>In page 18, before section 30, but in part VII, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>Subject to section 9, every County Registrar shall, on the establishment day, be transferred to the Service in respect of those functions of County Registrars which relate to a function of the Service.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister should word this amendment as follows:</P>
    <P>Subject to section 9, every function of a County Registrar shall, on establishment day, be transferred to the Service in respect of those functions of County Registrars which relate to a function of the Service.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned that the doctrine of the separation of powers in relation to a judicial function is fully protected and that this is specifically stated.</P>
    <P>I appeared before a county registrar exercising a judicial function when a former member of this House sued me for libel.  I made an application in the Circuit Court for discovery of documents against the individual.  This application was not dealt with by a Circuit Court judge as I expected. The order for discovery was given to me by the county registrar carrying out a judicial function. Both I and the other party to this suit wished to know that the county registrar, acting in such a manner, was fair and impartial and acting in the same independent manner as a judge.  Will the Minister consider my position on amendments Nos. 15 and 38?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is making a serious attempt to meet the concerns expressed. However, the issues addressed by Government amendment No. 38 are already addressed by Government amendment No. 28, which proposes to delete subsection (1) of section 20 and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Notwithstanding any other enactment, the Chief Executive shall manage and control generally the staff, administration and business of the Service, including the functions of County Registrars in so far as such functions relate to a function of the Service, and shall perform such other functions as may be conferred on him or her by or under this Act or by the Board.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The administrative aspect of county registrars is already dealt with here.  There is a danger in introducing amendment No. 38 because it proposes to transfer the post of county registrar for inclusion under section 9.  This difficulty could be resolved if this amendment were amended to read as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> In page 18, before section 30, but in part VII, to insert the following new section:</P>
    <P>30.&mdash;Subject to section 9, every function of a County Registrar shall, on the establishment day, be transferred to the Service in respect of those functions of County Registrars which relate to a function of the Service.</P>
    <P>This transfers the function rather than the post. As it stands, the transfer of the post is inherent in the amendment, subsuming it completely under the service.  That is dangerous.  What the Minister seeks to achieve here is already achieved by amendment No. 28 to section 20.  I do not see the necessity, therefore, for amendment No. 38. The matter can be addressed by being specific on every function of a county registrar in so far as it relates to the function of the service.  In this way the post is kept separate.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's proceeds down this route, the post of the county registrar is subsumed under the service.  The question then arises as to who appoints the next county registrar, say in County Kerry, when the present registrar retires or resigns?  Who will appoint county registrars in the future?  As the Minister's predecessors made such appointments, I hope he and his successors will. The matter rests in his hands.</P>
    <P>This amendment is fraught with danger because the post rather than the functions is being subsumed.  If the Minister insists on proceeding with amendment No. 38 he should include the functions of the country registrar.  The administrative aspect is dealt with here.</P>
    <P>This is an important matter.  It is also important to note the meetings that have taken place in the Minister's Department, especially with Mrs. Justice Denham who presided over the special report commissioned by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  Mrs. Justice Denham is of the view that the current manner of appointing county registrars should remain.</P>
    <P>The Minister must reconsider amendment No. 38 in addition to our amendments, which are specific and straightforward.  One of them would easily resolve the problem.  Amendment No. 18 is clear with regard to the appointment of county registrars.  It provides that &ldquo;The appointment of County Registrars shall remain as in accordance with section 35(2) of the Court Officers Act, 1926&rdquo;.  The Minister has not addressed this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined what the package represents and I have explained what I am trying to achieve.  Why can it not be said that while the functions of the county registrar in so far as they relate to the Courts Service should be transferred to the Courts Service, those not related to the Courts Service should not be so transferred?  We must tell the dancer from the dance.  I have no alternative but to transfer the <Col N="82" /> county registrar, in so far as the powers relating to the courts are concerned, to the Courts Service. Not to do so would be anomalous.</P>
      <P>To a large extent it does not matter whether the amendments are in Swahili provided they achieve the objective which I, the House and many county registrars have set.  I have made it clear that the power of appointment of a county registrar is pursuant to the Court Officers Act, 1926.  I have also made it clear that I intend to retain the provision of the 1926 Act in so far as they relate to the appointment of county registrars. It is axiomatic that the power to appoint county registrars into the next millennium, and certainly under this legislation, will remain with the Government of the day in accordance with the provisions of the 1926 Act.  There is no need for me to repeat those provisions in this legislation because following upon these amendments, it does not amend the provisions of the 1926 Act. It would be repetitious, naive and foolish of me to enact into law that which was enacted into law 72 years ago.  Perhaps I did not express the point as clearly as I should but I trust that Members now accept that this is the effect of what I am doing.</P>
      <P>The independence of county registrars is inherent in their appointment as they exercise quasi-judicial functions.  A county registrar who would not exercise such functions independently would not be worthy of the name, irrespective of which political party was in office at the time that individual was appointed.  There may be small concerns among sections of the Seanad regarding the proposed amendments, but I propose that amendments Nos. 31 and 35 be accepted as well as Government amendments Nos. 28 and 38. These proposals meet the concerns of county registrars and Members in a reasonable way.</P>
      <P>I ask Senators to accept the package I have presented.  If, on reflection, they still have concerns, they would be very welcome to express them on Report Stage.  They will obviously have the opportunity to table further amendments to the legislation at that stage.  We share the same approach to this issue and I have met the concerns of Senators on all sides of the House.  I believe the amendments I have tabled are solid, reasonable, achieve the desired objective and reflect the concerns of Senators as expressed before Christmas and here this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The small print in legislation can sometimes be different from its initial objective. We witnessed that recently with the appointment of judges in drug cases.  We tabled two amendments as did the Minister and it would seem that we have all set out to reach the same goal.  The Minister's amendments are confusing to a degree. I cannot understand why he has tabled two amendments to two different sections to reach the same conclusion.  Is the Minister saying that a county registrar will report directly to the chief executive officer on the court functions he or she <Col N="83" /> would carry out?  In regard to the other quasi-judicial functions concerning the register of electors, returning officer and the sheriff, will the registrar carry these out independently and will the chief executive officer have no function whatsoever in that regard?  I understand that the registrar will report to the Minister and Government of the day on these matters.  That is my interpretation of the Minister's comments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister did not specifically refer to my question on section 9.  The Bill is very clear and specific on protecting the independence of a judge in the performance of his judicial functions.  Why not add &ldquo;or County Registrars&rdquo; in section 9 to ensure they are also protected?  Amendment No. 43 to section 39 also deals with this and, again, we ask the Minister to insert &ldquo;or County Registrars&rdquo; at that point.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that amendment No. 31 would somehow remove county registrars from part of the Courts Service as far as their administrative functions were concerned.  We are willing to withdraw that amendment as we realise that county registrars must be answerable to the Courts Service for their administrative functions. However, in relation to judicial functions, we want to ensure that the Bill states that when county registrars are acting in their quasi-judicial roles, they are independently protected.  We want to protect the doctrine of the separation of powers. That is a fundamental point.  We will gladly forego the amendments which the Minister feels may, in some way, attack that part of the Bill which transfers the functions of a county registrar to the Courts Service as those functions are essentially court services and are non-quasi-judicial or non-judicial.  I urge the Minister to add, by amendment, &ldquo;or County Registrars&rdquo; following the word &ldquo;judges&rdquo; in sections 9 and 39.</P>

      <P>I do not doubt that the Minister is attempting to meet the concerns which have arisen.  When we are all six foot under and this legislation is on the Statute Book, people will have to examine and interpret it.  The Minister has clearly stated that nothing in this Act amends the Court Officers Act, 1926 and that he intends to retain the power of appointment of county registrars within his ambit through the relevant section of that Act.  There is nothing to suggest that, if the Minister's amendment No. 39 to section 30 proceeds, not only will the administrative functions of the county registrar be encompassed but the actual post of county registrar will be encompassed under the auspices of the service. That would move the goal posts significantly and create a whole new ball game.  The Minister's earlier amendment No. 28 to section 20 also deals with that and Senator Burke correctly pointed out that there does not really seem to be any necessity for the second amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> Thirty or 40 years from now there will be a different Minister and different advisers in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Will this legislation be open to a different interpretation then from that which the Minister has outlined this evening?  We must ensure that this issue is clearly copperfastened and that the position on the appointment of county registrars is clearly stated in this Act.  As things stand, it is not.  Where the chief executive, membership of the board and others are concerned, all of these positions and their manner of appointment are clearly identified but the position of the county registrar is not.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke made an important point on the administrative and quasi-judicial functions of the county registrar.  There is no problem with the administrative functions as these refer to the Courts Service.  What is the position in relation to the quasi-judicial functions?  Are they strictly a matter for the Minister and the Cabinet or will they also be referred to the commission?  That is not clear.  These are basic flaws in the Bill as it stands.  While the Minister is attempting to go part of the way, there are inherent dangers in his amendments, particularly in amendment No. 38. The matter needs to be addressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Burke's interpretation of the situation is, for the most part, correct. The functions of a country registrar, in so far as they relate to his or her court role, are transferred to the Courts Service as it is being set up to manage the courts.  One of the integral parts of the management of the courts relates to the functions of county registrars in so far as they relate to the courts and it is appropriate that these functions be transferred to the Courts Service.  It would be ludicrous to do anything else.</P>
      <P>In regard to the independence of county registrars in their quasi-judicial role, the independence of the Judiciary and those exercising quasi-judicial roles, such as the Master of the High Court and the county registrars, is protected under article 35 of the 1937 Constitution.  In the same way, this legislation, in so far as powers and functions are conferred on the board and the chief executive of the Courts Service, ensures the exercise of those powers will not interfere with that independence.  Section 9(b) states that the section applies to a person other than a judge in the performance of limited functions of a judicial nature conferred on that person by law.</P>

      <P>It follows that county registrars and the Master of the High Court are covered by that because of the quasi-judicial functions conferred on them by law.  What Senator Connor is seeking to achieve, that is, an expression of the independence of county registrars in the exercise of their quasi-judicial role, is <Col N="85" /> contained in the Bill in section 9(b) because county registrars are quasi judicial personages in that they exercise quasi-judicial powers in some instances.</P>

      <P>What is his objection to inserting a section to state specifically state that &ldquo;the appointment of County Registrars shall remain as in accordance with section 35(2) of the Court Officers Act, 1926&rdquo;?  It would not hurt him to include it or cause him any major distress.  It would just mean an extra few lines would have to be typed in the Department.

      <P>Section 9 (b) refers to county registrars by virtue of the fact that it refers to people who exercise quasi-judicial functions conferred on them by law. I hope that explains the situation.  I am convinced I am right, and I would be very foolish if I thought otherwise, but the Senator seems to be convinced he is right.  If the Senator wishes to bring his amendment forward on Report Stage, I will re-examine it.  However, a man convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.</P>

      <P>Section 11 sets out the composition of the board of the Courts Service and includes a practising barrister nominated by the chairman of the Bar Council and a practising solicitor nominated by the president of the Law Society.  Amendments Nos. 19 and 21 propose that, rather than using the nomination procedure provided for in the Bill, it should be specified that the members of the board concerned should be elected by the Bar Council and the Law Society. Amendments Nos. 20 and 22 propose that it should be stated in the Bill that nominations would be made after consultation with the respective councils of the two bodies.</P>
      <P>The current provisions are of the standard form used in other legislation and I see no reason to depart from that approach.  For example, they mirror the provisions in the Courts and Court Officers Act, 1995, concerning appointments to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It seems reasonable to me that it should be left to the Bar Council and the Law Society to make their own arrangements concerning their representation on the Courts Service board.  In those circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate that the legislation should specify that these people should be elected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also seems unnecessary to include in the legislation a requirement that the chairman of the Bar Council and the president of the Law Society consult with their respective councils.  It is clear <Col N="89" /> from the Bill that these people would not be operating in their personal capacities but as the heads of the organisations they represent.  It would be fanciful to suggest they would make the nominations concerned without carrying out the necessary consultation within their organisations. If there was dissatisfaction among the members of the Bar Council or the Law Society as to how these organisations nominated people to serve on the board of the Courts Service, members could pursue it within their respective organisations.</P>

    <P>Section 11(1)(m) provides that one of the members of the Courts Service board will be a member of staff of the service elected by staff members.  However, the Bill does not provide any mechanism to regulate the manner in which the staff member is to be elected to the board.  It is appropriate to provide for such a mechanism by way of regulation.  The need for such regulations could be reviewed in light of agreement among members of staff of the Courts Service about the person to represent them.  I will monitor developments in this regard in the context of industrial relations discussions involving my Department and unions representing courts staff which are ongoing in connection with the establishment of the service.</P>

Social workers provide a great service to the courts and carry out much work given to them by the courts.  They should have an appointee on the board because that would be worthwhile.

The formula in the Bill is a standard one and I see no good reason to depart from it.  By definition, allowances for expenses are intended to compensate for expenses incurred.  I see no point in specifying that these enable functions to be carried out effectively.  Who is to be the judge of that?  The section specifies that these allowances will be determined by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for Finance, which is also a standard provision.  If the amendment is intended to tie their hands, that would also be unacceptable.  Such allowances as would arise would be based on public sector practices, and I have indicated that the provision is in standard form and I would not be happy to make the amendment.

The Government accepted that recommendation, which envisaged that the necessary legislative steps would be taken after the Courts Service had been established.  In this context it was intended to address the matter in a future courts Bill.

      <P>Government amendment No. 35:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 26 but in Part VI, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.&mdash;(1) (a) The Minister may by order appoint a vesting day in respect of any land (or a part of any land) used solely for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate or partly for the purposes of the Commissioners and partly for the purposes to which the functions of the Service relate and which immediately before the vesting day was vested in or leased by the Commissioners.</P>
      <P>(b) On the vesting day, the land, the subject of the order, and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such land shall &mdash; (i) where used solely for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate &mdash; after consultation with the Commissioners, and</P>
      <P>(ii) where used partly for the purposes of the Commissioners and partly for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate &mdash; with the consent in writing of the Commissioners,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>but without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment, be vested in the Service for all <Col N="94" /> estate, term or interest for which immediately before the vesting day it was vested in the Commissioners, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the land subsisting and capable of being performed.</P>
    <P>(2) (a) The Minister may by order appoint a vesting day in respect of any land (or part of any land) used solely for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate or partly for the purposes of the local authority and partly for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate and which immediately before the vesting day was vested in or leased by a local authority.</P>
    <P>(b) On the vesting day the land, the subject of the order, and all rights, powers and privileges relating to or connected with such land shall &mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) where used solely for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate &mdash; after consultation with the local authority, and</P>
    <P>(ii) where used partly for the purposes of the local authority and partly for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate &mdash; with the consent in writing of the local authority,</P>
    <P>but without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment, be vested in the Service for all estate, term or interest for which immediately before the vesting day it was vested in the local authority, but subject to all trusts and equities affecting the land subsisting and capable of being performed.</P>
    <P>(3) The Minister may, by order, appoint a day on which land which is vested in the State or an organ of the State and which is used for purposes to which the functions of the Service relate shall become subject to the occupation, management and control of the Service for the purposes of its functions and on that day it shall accordingly become so subject.</P>
    <P>(4) The Minister may on his or her own initiative, and shall on the application of the Service, issue a certificate in respect of specified land stating, as the Minister thinks proper, that such land vested in the Service under this section, or did not so vest, and the certificate shall be evidence of the facts so stated.</P>
    <P>(5) Every right and liability transferred to the Service by this section may, on or after the day it has been transferred, be sued on, recovered or enforced by or against the Service in its own name and it shall not be necessary for the Service to give notice to a person whose right or liability is transferred by this section of the transfer.</P>
    <P>(6) Section 12 of the Finance Act, 1895, shall not apply in respect of the transfer under this section of land to the Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="95" /> (7) (a) Subject to paragraph (b), on the establishment day the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, shall stand repealed.</P>
    <P>(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a), where immediately before a vesting day appointed under subsection 2(a), a person stood appointed as a caretaker or an assistant to a caretaker in respect of courthouse accommodation under section 5 of the Courthouses (Provision and Maintenance) Act, 1935, which accommodation is the subject of that vesting, then that section shall continue to apply to the person as if he or she had been so appointed by the Service.</P>
    <P>(8) In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;the Commissioners&rsquo; means the Commissioners of Public Works in Ireland;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;local authority&rsquo; means the council of a county, a corporation of a county or other borough, a council of an urban district or commissioners of a town.&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section replicates the policy underpinned to substitute a section with a number of changes mainly of a minor, technical or drafting nature.  The changes are easily assimilated in the new section rather than by way of piecemeal amendments.</P>
      <P>The first change is the substitution of the term &ldquo;land&rdquo; for all references in the substituted section to &ldquo;premises&rdquo; and &ldquo;property&rdquo;.  The section is dealing with court buildings as distinct from other types of property, which are dealt with in section 27.  The most satisfactory definition is of the term &ldquo;land&rdquo;, as this would allow for the vesting in the Courts Service of not just the court building but also the grounds, including car parks and green areas attaching to the court building.  The substituted section provides for the transfer of courts from the Commissioners of Public Works and councils to the Courts Service but dealt only with buildings vested in those authorities.  It is necessary to also take account of court buildings which are leased as opposed to vested in those authorities. The second change extends the scope of the Bill in that regard.</P>
      <P>Section 26(1)(a) now makes it clear that land vested in or leased by the Commissioners will vest in the service, and section 26(2)(b) makes it clear that land vested in or leased by the local authorities will vest in the Courts Service.</P>
      <P>The third and fourth changes relate to the manner of the transfer of properties vested in or leased by the Commissioners of Public Works to the Courts Service.  The new section 26(1)(b) now distinguishes between a court building vested in or leased by the Commissioners of Public Works which is used solely as a court and a building which houses a court but which is also used for different purposes by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is similar to the distinction made in the next subsection in respect of property vested in or leased by a local authority.  This part of the <Col N="96" /> new section also provides that a court building vested in or leased by the commissioners will vest in the service after consultation with the commissioners. In the case of a building in mixed use, the consent in writing of the commissioners will be required to the vesting in the services of the land.</P>
    <P>This amendment introduces provisions which correspond directly with the consultation provisions of subsection (2) relating to property vested in or leased by local authorities.  I am satisfied that it is reasonable and wise to provide for similar arrangements relating to the vesting of all court buildings in the service.</P>
    <P>New subsection (4) is an essential technical amendment.  The section being substituted makes provision for the issue of a certificate by the Minister stating whether property or premises, now to be referred to as land, did or did not vest in the Courts Service.  Such certificates may be required in connection with proceedings relating to the ownership of court buildings, and in this context such provision is desirable.  Corresponding provision is made in the Bill in relation to certificates of evidence in respect of the transfer of property other than land to the service under section 27 and the transfer of contractual rights and liabilities under section 28.  Furthermore, the amendment is consistent with similar provisions of other enactments transferring property to State agencies.</P>
    <P>The final change is contained in new subsection (8) which substitutes a definition of local authority for the definition of council contained in the Bill as published.  The revised definition is a more appropriate description of the various local authority entities concerned with the vesting of court buildings.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 36:</P>
      <P>In page 15, before section 26 but in Part VI, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;26.  The Board will establish that every office to be rented in the Service has the appropriate planning permission to enable the functions to be carried out therein.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the embarrassment caused recently when courts were held in buildings which did not have proper planning permission does not recur.  We remember what happened in Donegal when courts were <Col N="97" /> held in community halls without proper change of use planning permission.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister is trying to accommodate us on this matter through amendment No. 39.  It is important that what is stated in amendment No. 36 be included in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 39 is to provide that temporary courthouses will be exempted developments for the purpose of the planning Acts and that it will be necessary to make a notification only once regarding the use of temporary courthouses.</P>
      <P>Section 2 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act provides for the developments which are exempted from requirements relating to planning approval.  Such developments include courthouses but the Act does not explicitly include temporary courthouses.  Recent planning decisions have pointed out the desirability of ensuring the exemption which already applies to permanent courthouses should equally apply to temporary courthouses.  The amendment achieves this by redefining courthouses to include temporary courthouses.  The 1993 Act provides, by way of regulation, for public notification procedures in respect of exempted developments such as courthouses.  The Government amendment also provides that, in relation to temporary courthouses, it shall be necessary to comply with these notice procedures only once.  The effect of this amendment is to ensure there will be no requirement to make public notice regarding the use of a venue on each occasion a temporary courthouse is used.  I am satisfied that this is a highly practical and necessary change.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 36 also relates to planning matters in the context of court offices rather than courthouses.  The law only provides for exemption from planning in respect of courthouses. Amendment No. 36 appears to do no more than reinforce existing planning requirements in relation to non-exempt developments and, as such, I suggest it is unnecessary.  Accordingly, I ask the Senator to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>Bells start to ring in one's head on hearing about exempted developments and temporary courthouses.  Concerns are constantly expressed on the Order of Business about masts and exemptions from planning permission. Senator Connor's amendment is very worthy and we should pay great attention to it.  How long is a temporary courthouse a temporary courthouse? There is no time limit.  How long can a prefab, erected as a temporary court building while a permanent building is being constructed, be considered a temporary building?  Nobody would be too bothered if the period was a month or six weeks.  However, a much longer period to time would be a matter for concern.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the view of the Government <Col N="98" /> that the Burren interpretative centre was an exempted development.  Somebody took the matter to court and it was found that the Government had no right to embark upon a development of such scale without planning permission.  Mr. Justice Costello said the Government should apply for planning permission for all developments on the same basis as private citizens.  On that basis the Burren project failed at huge cost to the State.</P>
      <P>Somebody will bring the issue of temporary courthouses being exempted developments before the courts and probably prove, as was proved in the case of the Burren interpretative centre, that the provision is constitutionally wrong. Planning permission should be applied for in the normal manner to ensure there is not a repeat of what happened in Donegal.  Developments there necessitated emergency legislation being brought before the House to give legal effect to decisions in cases over a period of years which had been heard in community halls, etc., which did not have planning permission.</P>
      <P>It is desirable that court sittings be held in courthouses which have planning permission. Holding court sittings in temporary buildings should be avoided as far as possible.  We are proposing this amendment to ensure we do not have a repeat of the occurrences outlined.</P>

Having listened to what Senators said, I strongly suggest they defer further action at this stage and that the Minister, with the Senators' approval, revisit this matter on Report Stage.  From the views expressed, it seems there is food for thought and we should be cautious.  Raising it on Report Stage would give the Minister and his officials an opportunity to provide the various assurances necessary in the context of this amendment.  I ask the Senators who have spoken and who have tabled the amendment to defer the issue until Report Stage.  Perhaps the Minister will agree.</P>

      <P>This amendment inserts a reference to the commissioners and the local authority in section 27 of the Bill which transfers property other than land to the Courts Service. The section as published would only allow for the vesting in the service of property other than land which, before the vesting day, was vested in the Minister.  An example of the property in question would be equipment such as court furniture located in courthouses.  It is more consistent with the general principle underlying this Part of the Bill that all such property should vest in the service. It would be somewhat incongruous if, for example, the Bill provided for transfer under section 26 of a particular courthouse to the service but not the transfer of other property attaching to that courthouse.  I, therefore, move this amendment as being necessary for consistency with the general policy of this Part of the Bill and for all practical purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I call on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to appoint, as a matter of urgency, a consultant for the Lough Lene water treatment plant at Collinstown, County Westmeath, to improve the drinking water supply to north Meath and to north Westmeath.  Lough Lene is the only inland lake in Ireland to be awarded a blue flag.  The current quantity of water supplied from this source is close to 700,000 gallons per day or 255 million gallons per year.  It supplies 1,250 households.  A further network extension in this area is being put into existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The north Westmeath group water scheme, phase one, is under construction.  This scheme will provide water to a further 400 households.  Algae blooms occur very frequently, usually after two or three days of calm, dry weather.  The water is currently fluoridated and chlorinated.  With no water treatment at the site, particles of algae are taken into the water supply and when acted upon by the chlorine disinfectant, give rise to a very <Col N="102" /> severe taste and odour problem.  There is a very strong smell from the water supply coming from the household taps.  It is extremely difficult to have confidence in the safety of this drinking water although Westmeath County Council safe to drink.</P>
    <P>The solution in this case is the provision of a water treatment plant which will incorporate a filtering process, thereby preventing algae particles from entering the water supply.  The first stage in achieving this objective is the appointment of a consulting engineer whose brief it would be to prepare a preliminary report on the various treatment options and to recommend the most appropriate one for this site.</P>
    <P>Taking the long term county wide view, the intention would be to have three major sources of supply treated in the way that they should be for human consumption.  The Lough Lene water supply is very important for the entire midlands. A water treatment plant is in place at the Shannon intake.  A preliminary report has been prepared for the Lough Owel intake.  It is now time to advance proposals for the Lough Lene water supply.</P>
    <P>Lough Lene is in the constituency of the Minister of State.  He is very familiar with the local geography and with the needs of the area.  This is the lake district of the midlands and we are immensely proud of it.  Lough Lene is the only inland lake in Ireland to be awarded the blue flag. The economy is buoyant and money is available for projects such as this.  Drinking water is one of the basic necessities of daily life.  It must also be borne in mind that there are two hospitals in the area in addition to a large young population.  The midlands have always been proud of their clean environment but a problem has arisen with regard to this lake.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to make this consultant available so he can inform the Department and the local authority, Westmeath County Council, on how we can proceed to eliminate this problem at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cassidy for raising this important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a couple of broader aspects of the matter to which I wish to refer.  The standards and parameters for measuring the quality of water intended for human consumption are set out in EU Directive 80/778/EC.  The operation and maintenance of water supplies is a matter for the local authority concerned.  It is also the responsibility of local authorities to monitor drinking water for the 13 mandatory parameters specified in the directive and to monitor additional parameters such as fluoride, iron and heavy metals on a regular basis.  The Environmental Protection Agency co-ordinates and analyses the results and produces an annual report on the quality of drinking water in Ireland.  In its most recent <Col N="103" /> report, relating to 1996, the agency pointed out that the general quality of drinking water in Westmeath is satisfactory and represented an improvement on the position in 1995.</P>
    <P>The 1998 water and sewerage services investment programme, which was announced on Monday, is providing almost £185 million this year for water and sewerage services.  This represents an increase of over 13 per cent on expenditure on these services in 1997, which was also set at a high level, and is solid evidence of the continued commitment to improving the country's environmental infrastructure and to meeting the existing and projected needs arising from residential, economic and other development.</P>
    <P>This year's water and sewerage investment programme provides for schemes in Westmeath amounting to over £6 million to proceed to construction. These include the provision of sewerage facilities in the west bank area of Athlone, a water conservation and leakage detection scheme for Athlone and the construction of a reservoir at Annagh-Baylin.  Work is already under way on two further schemes with a combined cost of more than £6 million.  These schemes involve the provision of sewerage facilities for Moate and the extension of the Mullingar water supply scheme to serve Tyrellspass.  It can be said that County Westmeath is getting its fair share of the funding available this year.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter raised, Westmeath County Council sought the Department's approval last July to appoint a consultant to investigate and report on a problem concerning an unpleasant taste in drinking water sourced from Lough Lene.  The lake is the source of the water supply to Castlepollard.  About 3,000 cubic meters per day are supplied.  This water is chlorinated and treated.  The current problems with the water sourced from Lough Lene arise from regular and intense algal blooms on the lake.  My Department has sought a more detailed report from the local authority in support of the proposal and this is awaited.  On receipt of this report the matter will be considered further.  I hope this clarifies the position for the Senator.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is still a source of considerable annoyance that he is not present.  He is part of the problem.  His Department has turned a non-crisis into a crisis and an issue which could have been resolved with humanity has been turned <Col N="104" /> into one which is in danger of causing enormous embarrassment to the State, as evidenced by the appalling spectacle of the queue of people outside the Department some months ago.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise one aspect of the Department's performance in dealing with this issue.  In response to a non-crisis which was fuelled by hysteria and imagination rather than reality, a large number of gardaí were seconded to stem a non-existent wave of illegal immigrants.  Regrettably, they have shown, at its kindest, a lack of sensitivity in carrying out their business.  This lack of sensitivity has been reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> as consisting of questions such as: &ldquo;Are there any blacks on this train from Belfast?&rdquo;, a question which was asked of Iarnród Éireann officials at one railway station.  This should never happen.</P>
      <P>The House is entitled to know how these members of the Garda Síochána were picked and, if they were selected to undertake this duty, what training they received and what criteria they were told to use in deciding which people they would delay and perhaps detain for further information. The suspicion is that skin colour is a major criterion for selecting people to be detained.  Everybody in this country who has been involved with the developing world is aware of people, who have the most eminent qualifications and who come to this country on legitimate business, being held up by the immigration service not because their documentation was incorrect but because they came from a poor country and the colour of their skin rendered them suspect.</P>
      <P>How does the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform train the gardaí who, in response to a non-existent crisis, have been stationed at our ports, airports and in railway stations which serve trains from Northern Ireland to spot illegal immigrants?  What criteria do they use?  They cannot stop everybody.  Northern Ireland and the Republic are free travel areas and people are not required to carry passports.  What language skills do these gardaí have?  Is anybody who cannot speak English immediately suspect? Do the gardaí have interpreters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons one might come to the conclusion that sensitivity and training are not being offered to members of the Garda Síochána is an incident which Senator Norris described in a rushed fashion during the Order of Business.  He described the experience of a Sudanese doctor who was travelling on a bus along College Green. He was on his way to the mosque on South Circular Road.  The doctor and an Algerian colleague were hauled off the bus by two uniformed members of the Garda Síochána, questioned about where they came from and were accused of having false documents.  They were taken into custody and were required to sign a document which declared they had not been ill-treated before they were released.  If that is the attitude of the Garda Síochána to people whom it suspects of being illegal immigrants, will the Minister tell the House and the public how it ensures that such <Col N="105" /> people do not end up at our borders intercepting people whom they suspect are illegal immigrants? That is the reason we need to know what they are being told and how they are being trained.  We do not need fuzzy answers and denials of racism but explicit and detailed accounts of the positive training which should be offered to members of the Garda if they are to be put in this most sensitive position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ryan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I apologise for the Minister who was in the House for most of the day but who, unfortunately, had to go abroad.  The Minister was anxious to be here for this Adjournment matter.  I am conscious that immigration matters generally are the subject of increasing interest and, sometimes, controversy.</P>
      <P>Members of the Garda Síochána who operate the immigration controls which travellers encounter at our ports and airports, and who attend to the registration of non-nationals and the enforcement of immigration law within the State, operate within the command structure of the Garda itself. They are answerable as is any other member of the Force to their superiors within the Garda hierarchy and ultimately to the Garda Commissioner. They are not seconded to an immigration service answerable directly or indirectly to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>It is accordingly the Garda authorities who are responsible in the first instance for the training and day to day operational criteria of members of the Garda in carrying out the functions of immigration officers.  The Minister is informed by the Commissioner that training for members newly assigned to duties as immigration officers consists principally of on the job training with experienced immigration officers.  In addition, in-service training courses are provided on an ongoing basis in the area of the aliens legislation and in the specialised area of detecting false and forged documents.  In this connection, Irish immigration officers participate regularly in training courses for immigration control personnel organised at EU level on false document recognition, funded partly by the Commission's &ldquo;Sherlock&rdquo; programme.</P>
      <P>One of the aims of this programme is to keep immigration officers up to date with advances in forgery techniques, which are generally thought to be only about six months behind the development of newer and more complex security features in genuine documents.  The Minister is also aware of the regular training exchanges between our immigration officers and our nearest neighbours in the United Kingdom on false documents and other matters of common interest in the immigration area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A particularly sensitive area of the work of immigration officers is in recognising and dealing <Col N="106" /> with claims for asylum made by persons entering the State.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is the international custodian of the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees, to which Ireland is a party. Through its offices in London, UNHCR provides a regular training programme in asylum law and practice to staff of the Department and to immigration officers.</P>
    <P>The operational criteria for immigration officers are set out in the Aliens Act, 1935, and the series of orders made under that Act.  In particular, article 5 of the Aliens Order sets out the grounds on which an immigration officer may refuse leave to land to a person arriving here.  These are as follows: the person has insufficient funds; although wishing to take up employment in the State, the person has no valid work permit; the person is suffering from a specified disease or disability; the person has been convicted of an offence punishable by one year's imprisonment or more; the person is not the holder of a valid Irish visa where needed; the person is the subject of a deportation order; the person has been prohibited from landing by order of the Minister under the Aliens Act and the person is not in possession of a valid passport or other document which establishes his or her nationality and identity to the immigration officer's satisfaction.</P>
    <P>It is the job of the immigration officer to apply these criteria to all persons arriving in the State, except those arriving from the UK.  As a special facility for EU nationals, including our citizens, arriving from EU ports and airports, there is in place at most of these ports a &ldquo;blue channel&rdquo; where the checks on those in possession of EU passports or national identity cards need not be as rigorous, although officers need to exercise vigilance at all times to ensure that there is no abuse.</P>
    <P>In the case of arrivals from the UK, there has been for many years a Common Travel Area arrangement between the two neighbouring states.  The purpose of this arrangement is to facilitate Irish and UK citizens by relieving them of the requirement to be in possession of a passport or other travel document when moving between the two jurisdictions.  It does not relieve nationals of other countries from the need to comply with the immigration criteria which I mentioned.  During late 1996 and in particular the first half of 1997, it became clear that there was widespread abuse of these arrangements by persons not entitled to use them.</P>
    <P>As a result of an amendment to the Aliens Orders at the end of June 1997, immigration officers now have power to carry out checks, applying the statutory criteria which I set out earlier, in order to detect illegal entry from the UK.  Persons so detected are refused leave to enter the State and are returned to the UK.  If such a person applies for asylum, however, whether the person can be returned or not depends on the application of the Dublin Convention (Implementation) Order, and the person <Col N="107" /> remains in the State until those procedures, including any appeal, are completed.  The sort of things being checked for are exactly the same as those on inward journeys from Paris, Zurich or New York, for example.  The only difference is that on such arrivals there are systematic checks. On arrivals from UK, not everyone is checked.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that immigration officers have a difficult job to do in implementing immigration controls.  They are under instruction to carry out their task with courtesy.  Members of the public are not being needlessly checked.  There is an illegal immigration problem which, like other types of crime, requires at times the co-operation of law abiding members of the public.  Immigration officers appreciate such co-operation and express that appreciation to individuals who, on being checked, are found to be entering the country legally.  There have been a number of assertions in the media that individuals have been wrongly refused entry or otherwise and improperly dealt with.  The Minister understands a very small number of such complaints have been made to the independent Garda Síochána Complaints Board.  He is also aware of a small number of complaints which have been made to him.  While any complaint is cause for concern, such a number is hardly indicative of the widespread or systematic abuse of their powers by immigration officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> Having regard to the large scale movement of persons between the United Kingdom and here on a daily basis, the Garda authorities have been reminded of the need to ensure that immigration officers operating this legislation are kept aware of the need for discretion and courtesy in carrying out this difficult task.  While recognising the difficulties involved for immigration officers in carrying out the important task of dealing with the serious problem of illegal immigration, the Minister is concerned generally to ensure that there should be no occasion where controls are exercised in an unreasonable discriminatory fashion or without an acceptable level of courtesy.</P>

      <P>As regards random checks, it is a matter of regret that the Minister did not explain how they pick people who come through the &ldquo;blue channel&rdquo;.  Is skin colour one of the criteria they use?  The Minister has not said so.  Do I draw the obvious conclusion that it is one of the criteria?</P>
