      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to ensure that school buses are required to be provided with seat belts.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give greater recognition to substitute teachers who have given long service to the primary education system in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to direct the local authority to issue a special amenity order for the Tolka valley.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Norris's and Gallagher's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business will be items 1 and 2 and item 18, motion 33.  Item 1, Second Stage, will be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes; Senators may also share time.  Item 2 to be taken at 2 p.m., statements on the Shannon River Council with the contributions of Senators not to exceed 15 minutes.  Business will be interrupted from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. to allow Senators attend the other House for the reading of the budget.  Item 18, motion 33, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I compliment the Leader and the Independent Senators for having arranged for us to have a very speedy debate on the budget this evening.  The debate will be under way before the debate in the Lower House has taken off.  Will the Leader facilitate a debate on developments in the North between now and the end of the session?  It is six months since we last debated this issue.  A great deal has happened, a great deal is happening and a great deal has not happened.  Members would like an opportunity to review developments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that a number of issues will be dealt with over the next few days, including a debate on the budget tonight and the high profile discussion of the Shannon River Council.  Motion 19 tabled by Independent Senators states: &ldquo;That Seanad Éireann takes note of the First Report of the Joint Committee on Education and Science and Literacy Levels in Ireland.&rdquo;  I would like to make Members aware of this report as we will be discussing literacy tomorrow.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges has tried time and again to draw people's attention to the importance of having reports of Oireachtas committees debated in the House.  This report covers those issues as well as primary education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  They seem to have reached an impasse.  A debate would be valuable in teasing out the position and giving Senators the opportunity to make recommendations.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to the High Court case yesterday when a young boy was detained in an unsuitable remand centre because there was no alternative accommodation.  The Eastern Health Board received a substantial sum of money to provide suitable residential facilities but has not made any specific proposals in that regard.  It is a disgrace that, while money has been made available, no action has been taken.  There is a huge shortage of suitable accommodation for young people at risk, especially at this time of the year in the run up to Christmas.  It is disgraceful that money made available to a State agency is left unspent in such circumstances.  I ask the Leader to bring the matter to the attention of the appropriate Minister to ensure that specific proposals are put forward at an early stage so that measures are taken to alleviate the problem of unsuitable accommodation for children at risk, especially in this city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  Experience of dealing with the issue in the House confirms that we tend to be reluctant to debate it when one is needed, yet we tend to debate it at times when there have been achievements.  Democratic debate contributes <Col N="679" /> to the resolution of all problems; it does not exacerbate them.</P>
      <P>It appears we are encountering a pattern of Ministers being less than direct or perhaps misleading with regard to information they provide to the House.  Senators are aware of the controversy Fine Gael Members have had with one Minister.  In last week's debate on overseas development aid a clear impression was given to the House that next year's budget for ODA would be increased.  Subsequent press briefings confirmed it would be frozen.  I believe the House was improperly misled by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I am not used to this from Ministers.</P>
      <P>We hold debates with Ministers.  The Minister for Education and Science made much of his commitment to children with severe and profound mental handicap.  However, he omitted to tell us that the budgetary provision for next year would not meet the requirements of all those children, therefore, the constitutional guarantee will not be implemented.  He also omitted to tell us that his officials were telling parents of those children that it would not happen in the way he was advising this House.</P>
      <P>I find such developments regrettable and a departure from the standards I have become used to over the significant number of years I have been a Member of the House.  It is not the way we do business.  If Ministers cannot be relied upon to give accurate information to the House and to be frank and truthful with Members, we may forget debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It would be timely and beneficial and may be helpful in progressing those matters which appear to be in stalemate.</P>
      <P>This is European Day for the Disabled.  I am wearing the emblem associated with the day.  I hope the Minister for Finance will give due consideration and financial support and resources to the disabled.  I also hope this will be a good day for the supportive groups who provide the disabled with tremendous services, such as centres for independent living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the concerns expressed by my colleague, Senator Ryan.  I also took part in the debate on overseas development aid.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs is very good.  She is a very courageous person and apparently battled for her interests at the Cabinet.  We all got the impression that the matter had been resolved.  I said I had been unable to follow the figures clearly because they were put in a confused way, but that I was relying on the assurances by the Minister of State.  It was astonishing to find the next day that Trócaire, who had briefed me extensively and much of whose material I did not put on the record of the House because I assumed all its concerns had been met, made a very strong statement saying <Col N="680" /> that its concerns had not been met, especially with regard to emergency aid for situations like the flooding in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>I am not sure if the House was misled, but matters were misinterpreted, which is very damaging. A group of Roman Catholic bishops made a very strong statement indicating they were still concerned. We require a further explanation.</P>
      <P>I was unable to attend the House yesterday because I was in Cork attending an event by the Cork Aids Alliance.  I understand this matter was not referred to in the House, which is a pity.  Will the Leader arrange a debate on the subject of AIDS because I am concerned that young people may have lost touch with the reality?  There was a dangerous article by Paddy O'Gorman challenging received understanding of the fact that it has now passed as a major infection into the heterosexual community.  The House has a responsibility, which it has lived up to in the past, to alert the public to the continuing dangers of this tragic infection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland and I ask the Leader to arrange it as soon as possible because it would be timely.  Much good work has been done and much still needs to be done.  A debate would support the good work of the Taoiseach on the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I draw the attention of the Leader to the position of local authorities, especially urban district councils, regarding the local elections next year.  He may recall that in 1994 local authority areas were extended for voting purposes only with the intention that subsequent administrative and geographic changes were to take place which would bring the areas within the jurisdiction of the local urban district councils. Subsequently, nothing has happened and no administrative and geographic changes have occurred.  As a result, local urban district councillors have been representing areas over which they have no jurisdiction.  People voted for them in these extended areas.  The position has not been clarified for the forthcoming local elections.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to clarify the position of urban district councils in these elections?</P>

      <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It is a timely issue.  I also congratulate the Leader for arranging a debate on the budget.  Given that it is to commence at 6 p.m., would it be possible for the spokespersons on Finance to receive a copy of the Budget Statement to enable them prepare?  It is important we use well the opportunity presented to us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of an urban council I support Senator Caffrey's remarks.  On the question of overseas development aid, I was not misled by anything said by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in the <Col N="681" /> debate last week.  She announced that the link between GNP growth and growth in overseas development aid has been broken.  It is a retrograde policy step.  The excuse is that the country is now too rich to keep up with our commitments; it used to be that we were too poor.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would call it a spin and if the text of the speech by the Minister of State was read carefully nobody would have been deceived. Will the Leader arrange a debate on the decision to increase by £10 per month the cost to the public of the drugs scheme?  It is a despicable decision that will affect many of those who are just above the medical card income threshold and suffer from diseases such as diabetes and asthma.  It justifies the cynicism with which people anticipate budgets &mdash; the Minister gives with one hand and takes away with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader give an indication when item 25 on the Order Paper, dealing with the health effects of microwave transmitters on telephone masts, will be taken?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be brought into the House to deal with this matter. I attended the conference in Dublin Castle earlier in the year and, while I had my own opinions on the effects of microwaves on health, it was clearly felt that masts should not be erected without local consultation.</P>
      <P>I raise the issue today because the item has raised its ugly head in Donegal this morning, in a picturesque village called Kerrykeel, where one of the mobile phone companies moved in this morning and closed off the town.  I believe that people have been arrested.  I would have thought that the mobile phone companies would have learned that the only way forward is to consult with the local population.  I am particularly concerned that local people have been so inhibited this morning.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Manning's call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I have every confidence that the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair can resolve the deadlock in the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  I am, however, particularly concerned with the lack of facilities being made available to the relatives of those murdered on Bloody Sunday and the delay in the inquiry. It is being pushed back all the time and it is an important issue which should be resolved.</P>

      <P>In relation to urban renewal status, various local authorities submitted plans earlier this year to the Department of the Environment and Local Government for their towns. No decision has yet been made and there are concerns about the delay.  I ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come before the House and tell us which towns will be designated.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago I asked the Leader to arrange a debate on planning for the future in the psychiatric services.  The House will be aware of a policy document which was introduced some years ago and which has been carried on by successive Governments.  The time is now opportune to have a debate on the matter and examine the important aspects of the document to see how it has provided services to the psychiatrically ill.  I would welcome a debate on the issue as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Norris's call for a debate on the AIDS virus.  I do not know the man in question, Mr. Paddy O'Gorman, but I pay tribute to him on a well written and researched article.  I believe a debate here would be important in allaying many of the fears and exploding many of the myths surrounding this disease.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Ryan, O'Brien, Leonard and O'Toole called for a debate on Northern Ireland.  I will see if time can be left aside for this before the Christmas recess.  The issue referred to by Senators O'Toole and Costello can be taken tomorrow with the literacy statements.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris and Gallagher called for another debate on overseas aid.  The Minister dealt comprehensively with the issue last week in this House but if the Senators feel that we should have a further debate on this, I will have time set aside for it in the next session.  I will pass on the request made by Senator Caffrey to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and see if any progress can be made with his query.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Leonard's request, I will endeavour &mdash; it will not be easy &mdash; to make available to spokespersons a copy of the Budget Statement as early as possible this afternoon.  I agree with the thrust of her request and I will do what I can to facilitate Senators who are leading for their parties this evening.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator Gallagher, I will arrange for a debate on the drugs scheme.  I know he was very impressed with the contribution of the Minister for Health and Children in this House last week. It was an experience with which I was most impressed and I know Senator Gallagher is looking forward to another visit to the House by the Minister in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="683" /> I will certainly arrange for another debate on mobile telephone masts.  I suggest to Senator Bonner that he table the issue as a matter for the Adjournment tomorrow, when he may be facilitated in discussing this pressing item in his area.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes called on me to find out the present position regarding urban renewal.  We are awaiting agreement in Brussels and when I hear more I will contact the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn called for a debate on the psychiatric services and I will arrange this at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senators Norris and Farrell called for an urgent debate on AIDS and I will facilitate that request.</P>

    <Title>Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Voluntary Health Insurance board to act as agent in the making available of health insurance to persons who will be resident outside the State for temporary periods.</P>
      <P>The VHI board advised the Minister, Deputy Cowen, that it must be able to offer an international health care plan to corporate and individual clients as soon as possible if it is not to be vulnerable to competitive challenge.  This legislation, which will facilitate the board's wishes, entails a limited amendment of the VHI Acts to give the board an additional power to act as agent in specified circumstances, which relate to the making available of health insurance cover to persons while abroad.</P>
      <P>The VHI was established in 1957 as a not for profit body to provide health insurance cover.  At that time 15 per cent of the population did not have an entitlement to public hospital services. In the early days VHI's role was, primarily, as a provider of cover for those who did not have an entitlement to hospital services, and, as time passed, as a provider of health insurance to all those who wish to avail of private health insurance irrespective of their eligibility for health services.  Its role, and importance, in relation to our health care system has expanded considerably since its foundation.  The environment in which it operates has become more demanding and sophisticated over the years, particularly as regards the expectations of its members in terms of quality of product and service. It has provided a solid and valuable service to members of the public over many decades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Currently membership of VHI is at an all time high of 1.45 million people, representing 40 per cent of the population.  More than 1,000 members join every week and it operates 6,700 group <Col N="684" /> schemes throughout the country.  In the half year to August 1998 a total of 33,882 new members joined VHI &mdash; an increase of 12 per cent on the same period in 1997.</P>
    <P>The evolving competitive market has elicited an enthusiastic and vigorous response from the board, management and staff of VHI.  Membership continues to grow and, where it previously had five main plans on offer, it now offers the consumer the choice of ten plans, following the introduction of its new options plans at the beginning of the year.</P>
    <P>Typically, VHI returns in excess of 95 per cent of its premium income to members in meeting claims costs.  For the financial year ended February 1998, VHI's premium income amounted to £304 million while £294 million was returned to members in the payment of benefits arising from claims incurred.  Between March and August this year, VHI paid out more than £156 million on 170,920 claims.  Its reserves stood at £76 million at the end of February and the Minister is aware of the board's commitment to strengthening them further.</P>
    <P>In common with other sectors, the health insurance market was opened to competition pursuant to EU directives.  Prior to the introduction of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, VHI operated as a statutory monopoly.  That Act, and the associated regulations, provided a framework for a competitive private health insurance market, while maintaining the key principles of private health insurance in Ireland &mdash; open enrolment, lifetime cover and community rating.</P>
    <P>Following the establishment of this framework, the British United Provident Association &mdash; BUPA &mdash; the largest private health insurer in the UK market, decided it would enter the Irish private health insurance market.  The Government is glad that a significant international player has entered our market and hopes that more players will enter and further enhance the competitive environment.  There is a considerable challenge involved in securing this desirable objective while maintaining, in an effective way, the core principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover which have traditionally characterised and sustained our socially beneficial system.  No one can seriously argue that insurers do not have a strong financial incentive to engage in preferred risk selection or cherry picking.  In fostering competition we must exercise great care and skill not to engineer a market which could lend itself to practices that would undermine our core principles and the ethos of inter-generational solidarity.</P>
    <P>The broader environment has also undergone dramatic change since VHI was founded.  Ireland as an open economy has embraced global change, international trade and foreign investment.  Central to this process is the ability of people to move from Ireland to other countries in a free manner. In the modern economic global village an increasing number of Irish people employed by export companies, multinational companies and State <Col N="685" /> agencies will live abroad for significant periods during their working lives.</P>
    <P>Up until now VHI members who have spent time living abroad as part of their job, have relied on the public health system in the foreign country or have arranged private health care insurance overseas &mdash; something that may prove awkward or inconvenient to arrange.  Market research by VHI identified a demand among its members for a health insurance product that would provide those who reside temporarily outside the State with comprehensive cover for their health care costs.  The Bill enables VHI to meet that demand by acting as agent for the sale of an international health care plan.</P>
    <P>At present VHI provides a worldwide emergency service for members who travel, known as VHI Assist.  This offer limits cover for VHI members going abroad in respect of treatment arising from unexpected illness or accident, but does not aim to cover longer stays.</P>
    <P>The provisions in the Bill are comparatively brief.  They are essentially concerned with enabling the board to provide its members with access to an additional product which takes account of expressed customer need.  Arrangements to be put in place by VHI on foot of the proposed legislation will put an additional service at the disposal of members to form a seamless continuation of their VHI membership on their return from residing temporarily abroad.</P>
    <P>The Bill is by no means the main piece of legislative work to be done in relation to VHI.  There is the fundamental consideration of the optimum future corporate status of VHI to be addressed. The position is that the broader issue of the appropriate corporate status of VHI going forward is being actively considered in the context of the preparations relating to the proposed White Paper on private health insurance.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the VHI board to have the power to act as an agent for an insurer in the sale of an international health care plan.  The section provides that the board will simply require the Minister's consent to exercise its power to act as agent in the terms specified in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains a definition empowering the VHI to hold an appointment as agent for an insurer.  The section also sets a reasonable limitation on the type of undertaking in respect of which the VHI may act as agent.  It defines an &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; as the holder of an authorisation within the meaning of the European Communities (Non-Life Insurance) Framework Regulations, 1994.  This means the insurer concerned will have been duly notified to our central competent authority for insurance business, having already satisfied the competent insurance authority in the member state of establishment of its capacity to conduct the class of insurance business concerned.</P>
    <P>Section 1 defines an international health care plan in terms of providing for the making of payments in relation to costs incurred in the provision <Col N="686" /> of medical, surgical or related services.  It further defines such a plan as being applicable to persons who will reside outside the State for such periods as the board may specify therein.</P>
    <P>Since the Bill's initiation, the definition of an international health care plan has been broadened. It can now accommodate more diverse benefits which the insurer may deem attractive to the consumer.  This is considered to be a positive move from both the business and consumer standpoint.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that the board, for the purposes of the powers granted under the Bill, will be subject to Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989. The VHI Act, 1957, provided that the board was not to be subject to the provisions of the insurance Acts.  However, as the Bill proposes to assign to the board the power to act as agent for an insurer, it was considered, and is provided for under section 2, that it must comply with the provisions of Part IV of the Insurance Act, 1989, which provides for the regulation of insurance intermediaries.  The board has advised that it does not envisage any difficulty in complying with this provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 contain standard provisions relating to expenses and citation, respectively.</P>
    <P>As I already stated, the purpose of the Bill is to enable the Voluntary Health Insurance board to act as agent in the making available of health insurance to persons who will be resident outside the State for temporary periods.  The Bill is being introduced because it is necessary to amend the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 and 1996, to empower the board to act as agent for the making available of an international health care plan.  An international health care plan, made available pursuant to the legislation, would be based on an agreement between the board and a major international insurer.  Under the plan, responsibilities and liabilities involved in providing the benefits covered would fall exclusively to the international insurer.  The premia applicable under the plan would be primarily a matter for the international insurer.</P>
    <P>The proposed plan would be available to people who intend to live and work outside the jurisdiction for periods of typically more than six months and up to five years.  The plan's main features will be medical insurance cover, evacuation and repatriation services and medical assistance services.  As the plan's principal purpose will be insurance against the cost of health care delivered outside the State, it will not be subject to the provisions of the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>People currently insured with the VHI will be able to transfer to the international health care plan without waiting periods or pre-existing illness restrictions, providing they have served out the restrictions applicable under their existing cover.  They will be transferred back to their former VHI plans on the same terms when they return to Ireland.  The VHI will market the international health care plan through its existing group scheme network and it will be available to <Col N="687" /> both group and individual members.  The provision of easy mobility for people between VHI membership and cover under the plan would be a particularly customer friendly arrangement for people who must reside outside the State from time to time in connection with their employment.</P>
    <P>The board's wish to offer an international health care plan is the only issue being addressed in this Bill.  Its provisions represent a full response to a specific request made to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, by the board in relation to what it regards as a potentially significant disadvantage in the conduct of its business.</P>
    <P>In accordance with commitments contained in the Government's action programme, the White Paper on private health insurance will address the options open in relation to the VHI's future, including the question of a strategic alliance.  The Minister, Deputy Cowen, has made it known, on a number of occasions, that all options are being considered in relation to the most appropriate status and corporate structure for the VHI into the future.  This matter has been the subject of extensive consultation between officials of the Department and senior management of the VHI. Consultation with outside interests which was undertaken to facilitate the preparation of the White Paper has now been completed.  It is hoped that the drafting of the White Paper will be completed by the end of the year and that, subject to Government approval, it will be published early next year.</P>
    <P>The VHI cannot undertake the role as insurer in relation to the plan because it is not authorised pursuant to the relevant non-life insurance regulations. The VHI Act, 1957, provides that the board is not subject to the Insurance Acts.  The EU non-life insurance directives include the VHI among a number of undertakings across Europe to which the directives provisions shall not apply. The converse of this situation is that the VHI, in its present form, has a limited scope of operational capacity.  The arrangements set down under this Bill, therefore, represent a practical way forward in the matter.</P>
    <P>In the competitive environment in which it now operates, the VHI must be empowered to compete effectively.  As well as meeting specific customer demands, the capacity to make available an international health care plan will ensure that the VHI is equipped to consolidate its existing business in the corporate sector by putting it on the same footing as other insurers which can offer plans of the kind involved.</P>
    <P>As I stated at the outset, this is short, but important, legislation.  It provides the VHI Board with a specific power it requires at this time to enhance its competitive position.  It is indicative of a private health insurance market that is growing in complexity and sophistication.  This reflects how the needs of our people are changing in tandem with the social and economic development of our country.  The arrangements to be put in <Col N="688" /> place by the VHI on foot of the legislation will serve the expressed needs of the modern consumer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and I support the Bill.  This straightforward Bill is indicative of the powers the Minister for Health and Children and the Department have over the VHI.  It is ridiculous that a Minister must come to this House to give a very basic additional power to the VHI to enable it to act in a particular way.  It is a clear indication of the great need to overhaul the health insurance system.  The Minister and the Department must look seriously at the operation of that system and possibly consider securing a strategic partner for the VHI and loosening the Minister's ownership of it.</P>
      <P>It is invidious for the regulator of the health services, who is the Minister for Health and Children, to be also the main shareholder in the VHI. That is a fundamental conflict of interest which is contrary to a variety of European laws and directives, particularly those relating to competition law.  I hope the Minister and the White Paper will address this issue very clearly because the current situation, where the Minister has a combination of conflicting powers, does not enhance health insurance or health care facilities but leads to problems.</P>
      <P>The Minister decides the cost of private beds in all public hospitals.  He recently increased that cost and a few months later the VHI announced an increase in insurance costs.  Such matters should be decided by an independent body.  It has been recommended in a variety of reports that this matter should be adjudicated upon by the Minister for Public Enterprise.  The Department of Public Enterprise adjudicates for all other insurance companies &mdash; why should health care insurance be any different?  It would be in the best interests of consumers, practitioners and the health service for this matter to be moved from the Department of Health and Children to the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health and Children has made many announcements recently and has a great deal to say for himself.  However, the reality is that the health care service has dramatically disimproved since he took office.  Waiting lists have increased substantially by up to 17 or 18 per cent, which is unsatisfactory.  Endless advisory committees and groups have been set up to report to the Minister but we have heard no specific recommendations from any of them.  We have heard selective mention by the Minister of particular recommendations on occasion, as he saw fit, but we have not seen any complete and final reports from any group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme made very strong recommendations, particularly in regard to the conflicting functions performed by the Minister.  Have the Department or the Minister addressed these issues and do they intend to follow any particular line of action in that regard?  That group also recommended <Col N="689" /> that an independent health insurance authority be established as a matter of urgency.  These are fundamental issues on which no action seems to be taken.  That authority is vitally important as it would have specific responsibility for the financial monitoring of the health insurance system and for licensing.  The Minister would be better off providing a health service and leaving insurance to the outside group under the Department of Public Enterprise.  This would considerably reduce the conflict of interest which arises.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister or the Department at any time seriously considered a strategic partner, given the opening up of the market and the free competition legislation?  BUPA is providing services in Ireland and we can only hope other insurance companies will enter the market and provide insurance services.  Over 40 per cent of the population is insured.  The real problem for many of these consumers is that they do not understand the fine details relating to the variety of insurances provided under the various plans and the differences in what is provided by the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>There is need for greater clarification and simplification of the health insurance scheme and the Minister should ensure there is a very straightforward, simplistic and easy form provided to consumers so they do not suddenly get a bill after a period in hospital for services for which they thought they were insured.  It is necessary that this issue be addressed.</P>
    <P>The health service is increasingly diverse with a greater number of professionals involved in it.  Psychiatrists are covered by VHI as are all consultants, but psychologists are not covered by VHI despite the fact that they provide real health service to the public.  It is fine for those who can afford to privately pay for a psychologist, but there is a dearth of psychologists in the public health service, an issue which must be addressed.  VHI insurance does not cover those who pay psychologists in a private capacity.  Health insurance should cover the professional fees of psychologists as, to a certain degree, they and psychiatrists work hand in hand. I ask the Minister to investigate this matter.  Dental care is also not covered by health insurance; perhaps the Minister will also examine this matter. These issues must be dealt with.  We hear nothing about how this will be done or what the future holds for these areas.</P>
    <P>We have a problem regarding the position of the Minister and his supervisory role.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine the issue.  Over 40 per cent of people are insured for private health care.  Why is this high proportion of the population insured?  I understand that all research and studies which have been carried out establish that many people insure themselves in the belief that they can advance through the waiting lists much quicker through private health insurance in comparison to public waiting lists.  This matter has been discussed in great detail in the other House. It is sad that people, who are entitled to the public health service, feel compelled to take out <Col N="690" /> private insurance to get a speedier and more effective health service, although perhaps the term &ldquo;more effective&rdquo; is not correct as the service provided to both private and public patients in hospitals is similar.  However, the reality is that 40 per cent of the population have private insurance. If the economic trend changes dramatically in three of four years time, which it could and as it has in other parts of the world, people may not be in a financial position to continue to subscribe to private health insurance and we will be faced with greater pressures being put on the public health insurance system.  This is something the Department and the Minister must seriously examine.  The reason there is not huge demand and pressure on the public health service is that 40 per cent of the population is privately insured. These are fundamental issues which must be very seriously addressed.  If the Celtic tiger changes and the economic boom comes to an end there could be a very serious crisis in the health service. The Minister and the Department must be ready and alert to this issue.  To put it mildly, the Minister would want to take out an insurance policy.</P>
    <P>Luckily we are currently experiencing a huge return of people who emigrated.  Immigrants are coming in also.  This increase in population will put further pressure on the private and public health service.  This matter must also be addressed.  One must acknowledge that health practitioners are providing a very fine health service in circumstances which are restricted for many.  This is particularly true of hospital staff who in many hospitals are stretched and working under very difficult conditions.  This especially applies to those in casualty who work very hard and extremely long hours.  Young house doctors do extraordinary work for very low pay.  All these matters must be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Nurses work extremely hard and I hope the Government and the Minister will take a very sympathetic approach given that issues concerning nurses are up for discussion.  For many years nurses were left very much in the background and were almost taken for granted by the powers that be.  I often wonder whether this was partly because the overwhelming majority of nurses were female and that males in more senior positions, such as consultants, were in a much stronger bargaining position &mdash; I see Senator Fitzpatrick has a smile on his face.  I am delighted the nurses are putting their foot down &mdash; and not before time.  Over the years I have encouraged many of them to be a little more assertive, regardless of which party was in Government, because they work very hard.  Nurses work in hospital wards and provide real service on the ground and I do not think they have received adequate recognition over the years from the powers that be.  If all nurses were male I believe everything would be different and we would get a different response from the Department of Health and Children and various Governments.  I wish the nurses well and I hope the Minister responds in a positive way and recognises the professional service <Col N="691" /> they provide.  They have done good work and it is time they got proper monetary recognition for it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to take some of the matters I have raised on board and to recognise that there is a real need to change health insurance and to remove from the Department of Health and Children the conflict of interest that arises in relation to the powers of the Minister in providing health insurance.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill which could be described as technical, allowing the VHI to provide services to its members overseas.  I was not laughing because I was amused by Senator Taylor-Quinn's references to nurses.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I was more amused by the latitude given to a Second Stage speech.  The only thing we missed was the hospital facilities in Clare, and I am sure we will hear about those on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Taylor-Quinn said about nurses.  It would be remiss of Members to fail to recognise their sterling worth and hard work.  In my time nurses were mainly female, as were the ward sisters.  They made up middle management in hospitals in my day, and woe betide any junior doctor who crossed the sister of a ward or a senior nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Life could be difficult to say the least.  I remember a sister in a ward during my callow youth who could use the word &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; as if it was a reflection on one's personality.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  We all know that the VHI and private health provision operate in a rapidly changing milieu.  When the VHI was started the emphasis was on providing services at a very low price to people who were outside the public health services.  That has changed over the years. Senator Taylor-Quinn referred to the insurance aspect of the provision of health care in the private sector.  Private health insurance companies are reducing the emphasis on the community rating more and more, and I congratulate the previous Minister, Deputy Noonan, on insisting that the community rating be kept.  If that was not kept we could not have allowed all competitors a level playing field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should refer to private sickness insurers. They do not provide health services; they provide sickness services to people who need them urgently.  They do not have an interest in healthy lifestyles, as that is not within their remit.  That is a matter for the Department of Health and Children. They do not provide long-term illness cover either, and they do not wish to provide it.  They shy away from areas like mental handicap and psychology.  They deal with the short, sharp fix, <Col N="692" /> where one gets the patient in, treated and out. Governments and politicians cannot work like that, but there is a place for the voluntary health insurers.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the White Paper promised by the Minister for Health and Children which will deal with the place of private health insurers within the entire health care sector.  When that comes out there will be much in it to exercise politicians' minds.  Politicians must have a different point of view from doctors, nurses or insurers. Our business is to look after the common good, and community rating is part of that.  If we remove community rating, we might find the taxpayer subsidising private health companies &mdash; VHI and BUPA &mdash; to an even greater extent. That would allow them to pick the type of illness and patient to treat.  We cannot allow that.  It would hold the general public to ransom.</P>
    <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn looked for clarity of product description, and I could not agree more. Because of the range of health insurance products choosing one is like choosing a mobile phone. There is a plethora of programmes on offer, and it would require a barrister to explain clearly what one gets from them.  The White Paper will mean that the small print in VHI and BUPA insurance policies will have to be clear, descriptive and unambiguous.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why VHI and BUPA cannot include dental care in their plans.  The most difficult and competitive private health care market in the world is in the United States, where competition between different voluntary health insurance providers is cut-throat, yet each offers a dental health care package.  I hope the White Paper addresses the issue of dental care, in addition to psychology, mental handicap and other matters.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is not contentious.  It is a technical Bill that should be passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I agree that this is not a contentious Bill; that is a matter of opinion. Anything to do with the VHI can be contentious. It is indicative of the difficulties that the VHI finds itself in that, when it wants to sell a new product or to enter a new field it has to come before this House.  Legislation must be produced and debated, and that is part of an indication that this body is under the stranglehold of the State. It should be released from that stranglehold; it is absurd and archaic that if the VHI wants to give insurance to people who have temporarily moved abroad, a single Bill, taking up time and money, must go through both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody could reasonably oppose this Bill.  Obviously the VHI must be given the freedom envisaged by it, but we should ask some questions about why the Bill is coming before us and why it is taking so long to do something about the acute problems the VHI now faces.  Some of those problems are of its own making and some are not.  I should declare an interest, or the opposite, in that in another <Col N="693" /> capacity I am in a position of disagreement with the VHI on a matter that will probably go further. It would only be honest to say that, though it does not inhibit me in any way from having a political opinion on what is happening to the VHI. However, I have an ongoing dispute with the VHI which has not been resolved, and it is only fair to say so to the House.</P>
    <P>My problem is that the VHI is a body under political control and that, as a result, it is not commercially viable.  I do not know if that is recognised by the House but it has had particular difficulties because of that political control.  It seems to have been a vehicle for all parties to make appointments that are not made on the basis of people's knowledge of health or insurance.  The board of the VHI is a body that is very obviously identifiable by political allegiances.  That is not something rare in this State; it is very common, but it is a pity.  It is difficult to identify in many cases the knowledge that members of the board have of either health or insurance, qualities I would have thought absolutely paramount in a body of this sort.  It is very easy to say that some people have particular allegiances to Fianna Fáil and that some have particular allegiances to Fine Gael.  I am being restrained here because of the difficulties I face.  In that particular sphere, it makes one doubt their ability to take decisions on the basis of commercial viability and a great deal of insight or knowledge into the business which they direct.  That is a problem which all parties will have to face in all areas.  I have had a difficulty with this for a long time because membership of State boards is not awarded on the basis of merit but more on the basis of political allegiance.  This appears to be a rampant problem in the VHI.  That is because the entire board, as is stated so coyly in its annual report, is non-executive. It actually means that it is appointed by a Minister and is a political appointment. These political appointees have a double allegiance to the VHI and the Minister who appointed them.  They cannot be blamed for that.</P>
    <P>The result is that many semi-State bodies are not run along exclusively commercial lines.  The VHI is one of the worst cases because it was a State-run monopoly for many years and as a result the consumer did not get a look in.  The consumer was told what he was charged every year.  He paid and that was the end of the story, otherwise, he could not get health insurance.  That has ended but similar to all monopolies of this kind it will take a very long time for its grip to be broken.  It has not been broken yet and one can see from the latest accounts that the VHI is still increasing its membership superficially.  However, that is part of our culture.  Those who want health insurance automatically go for the brand name with which they are familiar and which is ingrained in their minds &mdash; VHI.</P>
    <P>The accounts speak for themselves.  The chairman said that the situation in terms of commercial solvency ratios is inadequate.  Nobody seems <Col N="694" /> to address that.  It appears that the return on premiums is only 1 per cent, which is absolutely deplorable.  The VHI is not a healthy commercial organisation and is facing a crisis.  It is amazing that it has taken so damn long for anybody to accept that.  It is more amazing that BUPA, which has entered the field, has not made more inroads. The VHI is very lucky that the psyche in Ireland is so attuned to going automatically to the State's insurance company rather than the private enterprise one, which has not had a good run or received good press.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that this is a specific Bill.  What is the Government's thinking on the future of VHI?  It is all very well to say the Government has an open mind about it but that is a cop-out.  There should be an early discussion, pre-White Paper, because it is an urgent matter. To say that the Government is looking at all options, such as a strategic partner or privatisation, is not enough.  It would be more interesting to know what is the Government's thinking on this matter.  The annual report states that the company needs £60 million more in capital.  That is very little money.  The Minister could give the company £60 million in capital today and resolve the problem but it is much more long term than that.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the VHI is entering a competitive market for which it is not properly equipped, and resolving the solvency ratio problem will not equip it.  I ask the Minister to outline the Government's thinking in this regard.  Does it want to privatise the VHI, find a strategic partner, which is part-privatisation, or inject capital, or will it not make a decision until the last minute when competitive factors force it to, which is probably what will happen?</P>
    <P>In the intervening period there should be a great deal more transparency from the VHI about its operations and particularly how its board functions.  It is in this area that I am in conflict with the company.  Apparently, a mystery surrounds semi-State boards.  The interesting aspect about semi-State bodies is how they are run and what their directors do, if anything. There is a requirement on public companies that they publish not only the names of board members but also their role.  I am open to correction on this but there is such a code, it is not a legal requirement.  This is very important because the VHI is a significant company.</P>
    <P>The VHI may be unique in the semi-State sector in that it publishes blandly just the names of the board.  Who are these people?  It does not tell us anything about them &mdash; they could have been picked out of the air.  I suspect the reason for that is if one were told a great deal about them it would have to be revealed that a large number of them are prominent mostly for the fact that they have political affiliations.  It is easier to publish their names and leave them as a mystery.  If one of them is a doctor, publish that fact.  It is a nice title and adds a certain amount of status and respectability.  There is nothing controversial <Col N="695" /> about being a doctor.  However, there is no information about these people.  I am sure there is nothing wrong with any of them but information about them is absolutely paramount.</P>
    <P>The VHI is a public company which requires transparency.  The ESB publishes information about its directors, as do most companies, but for some reason the VHI does not.  I suspect it is because it is the most politicised body in the semi-State sector.  I do not know but I guess so.  I have had experience of asking board members questions in another sphere and they were very defensive.  They are not willing to produce a great deal of information about how they operate.</P>
    <P>I made inquiries recently about the appointment of an acting chief executive.  Nobody would tell me who was on the interview board that selected him, which is a legitimate question from a member of the public.  Nobody would tell me what was the package and how much was being paid.  That involves public money but it is a secret. All that information was kept secret.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us those facts.  How much is paid to the acting chief executive, who has been appointed?  How were the interviews processed? That is a legitimate matter of public concern.  It is not as though one has an agenda.</P>
    <P>These are not secret organisations.  It is similar to asking RTE such questions.  If one asks RTE about the attendance of board members, it shuts up like a clam.  It will not tell the public, while other semi-State bodies, such as ABT, publish such lists.  However, RTE, the guardian of transparency in Ireland, will not give that information, but it will ask the Minister of State or myself how many times we have attended this House.  We cannot say that we are not telling the public, but RTE will say it is none of our business if it is asked the same question.  We keep that secret. The VHI reminds me of that as well.  It is very protective of information which should be in the public arena and which I suspect under the Freedom of Information Act could at some stage be revealed.</P>
    <P>I also asked &mdash; and the Minister might reply as it is a legitimate public concern &mdash; about the number of cars given to executives at the top of the VHI as I had heard it was rather large.  It had been put to me that it was excessive so I questioned them about the number and models of cars being used by executives in the VHI.  Perhaps the Minister of State could answer this.  I do not know the answer.  I do not have a clue.  How much does it cost the taxpayer?  This is a legitimate question. The answer I received was absolute mumbo jumbo.  It answered a question I did not ask.  It told me who did not have cars.  Only two people did not and neither was an executive.</P>
    <P>I am pleading for openness and transparency. Let us be up front about what the money is being spent on.  When semi-State bodies refuse to answer questions, one becomes more suspicious and I am sure that is unjustified.  This is possibly the worst offender.  As the VHI enters the competitive <Col N="696" /> market and presents itself as a commercial organisation in the future, the least we can demand are two things.  First, it should be taken out of the political arena and political appointees should be made on the basis of merit and not have such obvious political affiliations.  Second, a semi-State body of this sort should give the transparency we are entitled to demand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the VHI to act as an agent for an authorised insurer in the sale of an international health care plan.  This legislation is being introduced on foot of representations received from the VHI Board and entails a limited amendment of the VHI Acts to give the board a specific additional power.</P>
      <P>The Government also received advice from the Attorney General pertaining to this.  This is the reason the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Moffat, and others are bringing this Bill before the House.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not deal with the appropriate corporate status of the VHI.  This is being actively and comprehensively addressed in the context of the Department of Health and Children's preparations relating to the proposed White Paper on private health insurance.  This legislation concerns the effective conduct of the VHI's business in the immediate term.  The board considers it imperative that the proposed amendment be enacted as quickly as possible to enable the VHI to compete more effectively.</P>
      <P>The VHI was founded in 1957 as a not for profit body.  The success the VHI Board has made of fulfilling its role within the health care system has been widely acknowledged.  Its role and importance in our health care system has expanded considerably since its foundation.  The environment in which it operates has become demanding and sophisticated over the years, particularly as regards the expectations of its members in terms of quality of product and service.  Today, membership of the VHI is at an all time high of 1.45 million people which represents 40 per cent of our population.  It has more than 1,000 members joining every week and operates 6,700 schemes throughout the country.</P>
      <P>As a not for profit organisation, the VHI aims to return to its members the greatest possible proportion of its income while maintaining a sufficient reserve.  In the five year period to the end of February 1998, there was a payout of 99 per cent of subscription income on members' claims.</P>
      <P>Pursuant to EU directives, the health insurance market was opened to competition.  Prior to the Health Insurance Act, 1994, the VHI operated as a statutory monopoly.  It is important and gratifying to have an insurer of the vast experience of BUPA providing competition to the VHI.  It is imperative that this competition exists, especially when we consider the consumer.  The Government feel it is important that other players enter the field and thereby increase the competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="697" /> Until now, VHI members who have spent time living abroad as part of their job, have either relied upon the public heath system in the foreign country or have arranged private health care insurance overseas, something that has proven and may continue to prove awkward if the Government had not taken this action.</P>
    <P>As an open economy, Ireland has become part of the global village.  International trade and foreign investment are a major part of everyday business life.  Central to this process is the ability of people to move from Ireland to other countries and back.  Market research by the VHI identified a demand among its members for a health insurance product that will provide those who reside temporarily outside the State with comprehensive cover for their health care costs.</P>
    <P>This short Bill is essentially concerned with enabling the board to offer an additional product to its members, which takes account of expressed customer needs.  Arrangements to be put in place by VHI on foot of the legislation puts an additional service at the disposal of members in order to form a seamless continuation of their VHI membership on their return from residing temporarily abroad.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to amend the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts, 1957 and 1996, to empower the board to act as agent to make available an international health care plan.  The VHI Board made strong representations that it must be able to offer an international health care plan to corporate and individual clients as soon as possible, if it is not to be vulnerable to competitive challenge. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, on the alacrity with which he has responded to this need.</P>
    <P>I wish to briefly refer to comments made by my colleague Senator Fitzpatrick pertaining to dental services.  It is high time the VHI provided dental cover to its members.  It has been a bone of contention with me for many years.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick also commented that one can talk about almost everything on Second Stage of a Bill.  A reference was made to nurses.  I would like to endorse the sentiments expressed by Senators Taylor-Quinn and Fitzpatrick.  I support the just demands nurses have made, but I would also like to point out that, since the advent of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the situation has changed dramatically for male nurses, especially those in psychiatric services.  Under the old promotional system, many people did not get promoted. We are not only talking about downtrodden females.  We should also spare a thought for males because in certain circumstances they have not got a fair crack of the whip.</P>
    <P>I have worked with both male and female nurses and I have the highest regard for them.  It is a great pity that when Senator Taylor-Quinn's party was in Government she or the Minister did not respond to the manner in which those who have built up the service, that is retired nurses, were refused parity of pension, enabled by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  I am <Col N="698" /> pleased to say that we put our money where our mouth is.  Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Finance, ensured, arising from a promise we made before coming into Government, that we would honour parity, as we always have done.  I am glad this has taken place.</P>
    <P>I again welcome the Minister to the House and I again state that this is a brief but very important Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to take account of the comments Senator Fitzpatrick and I have made.  Perhaps he would liaise with the VHI Board to include dental benefit as part of its cover.  Míle buíochas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill before the House.  However, it is really absurd that the VHI has to come before the House in this manner to introduce an international travel plan, which I understand it identified as being necessary several years ago.  This is not the Minister's fault, it is part of the legislation under which the VHI was established and there is a great deal of sense in modifying it totally. Incredibly, the chief executive officer is paid a high salary on a consultancy basis because the rules on payment to semi-State chief executive officers do not allow such payments to a person in a permanent position.  Much needs to be done to the legislation governing VHI.</P>
      <P>This is precisely what people need when working abroad.  As Senator Glynn said, the world is much more of a global village. People work abroad at times during their careers and it is difficult for them to get health insurance in other countries. This is frequently the case for people who have been in America &mdash; I constantly receive the most complicated forms for patients seeking health insurance in the USA, and they will be grateful that they can continue their health insurance there.</P>
      <P>The VHI has been a successful organisation but I take Senator Ross's criticisms of its current financial position.  Medical inflation in the past 15 years has been extraordinary, as the Minister knows all too well &mdash; it is up to four times greater than general inflation &mdash; and it is difficult for health insurance to keep up.  The increase in charges for private beds in public hospitals will add to the VHI's expenses.  It is interesting that BUPA has not made more inroads into the sale of health insurance in Ireland.  Given the VHI's success, could we not sell some of its expertise abroad, perhaps to eastern European countries which will surely be setting up their own private health insurance companies?  Aer Rianta has done well in helping establish duty free shops and this is another area where our expertise could be of benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The newspapers have reported lack of co-operation from Departments in the setting up of North-South bodies but in the health area co-operation is forging ahead.  Perhaps in his reply the Minister will indicate whether patients resident here will be covered by the VHI if they opt <Col N="699" /> for health care in Northern Ireland rather than in the Republic.  This is important because co-operation between the North-Eastern and North-Western Health Boards and Northern Irish health boards is, quite rightly, progressing at a great pace and consultants are being shared &mdash; dermatology and ENT appointments have been made on a North-South basis.  It is nice to see such good co-operation in this area.  The Institute of Public Health, which was opened last month, is headed by a Northern woman.</P>
    <P>Community rating is extremely important for the success of the VHI.  Everyone pays the same rate so that younger subscribers are, in a way, subsidising older subscribers because the latter are far more expensive for an insurance scheme. The amount spent on health care in the last two years of a person's life is roughly equivalent to the total spent in the rest of his or her life.  Community rating must continue, otherwise we would have risk rating, as operated by some UK health companies, under which older people must pay much more than the young, at a time when they have less income.  We should remember that we all get older and will benefit from the younger subscribers.  Risk equalisation is supposed to apply when BUPA obtains a certain percentage of the market and I presume this is being carefully examined.  BUPA is more likely to have a majority of younger subscribers at present but when it obtains 2.5 per cent of the market I presume older people will be in a position to subscribe.</P>
    <P>When we discussed waiting lists there was a heated debate about consultants' private lists being much shorter than their public lists.  I have checked this and while they are shorter, some of them are not that much shorter &mdash; waiting lists for orthopaedics, dermatology and ENT are nearly as long on the private lists as on the public lists.  Perhaps the Minister will take this back to the Department.  It is sometimes thought that consultants in public hospitals are not fulfilling their duties but a survey some years ago discovered that only 2 per cent could be described as not giving adequate service to their public patients. In any field of employment one will find 2 per cent of staff who are not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>There is a serious shortage of consultants in Ireland; to bring us up to the levels of many European countries we would have to immediately appoint between 700 and 900 consultants. Even Northern Ireland has a much higher level of consultants than we do.  Our health service is consultant-led and there is a great deal of sense in a &ldquo;consultant provided&rdquo; service.  It might be more economical to allow the public to see a consultant at every appointment rather than being referred by an experienced general practitioner to see a junior hospital doctor in training, and to have to make several visits before seeing a consultant.</P>
    <P>The Tierney report should be studied again and a determined effort made to put in place a &ldquo;consultant <Col N="700" /> provided&rdquo; service.  Sub-consultants are not the answer &mdash; it was tried in Great Britain and the results were poor.  One can appoint enthusiastic, clever people at age 33, but by the time they reach 38 they will not be so enthusiastic, if still clever. They will see themselves becoming professorial acolytes for the rest of their lives and dissatisfaction will set in.  Last week I attended a conference in London on the NHS, and one of the most important points made was that there was great dissatisfaction when sub-consultants were appointed rather than increasing the number of consultants in an area to provide adequate cover.</P>
    <P>The Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, was right to take the initiative on a 48 hour week and to apply it to junior hospital doctors.  This is essential for the health and welfare not just of those doctors but of patients.  The Minister and Senator Fitzpatrick may remember a horrific case in England in which a young anaesthetist was charged with manslaughter when he mixed up the gases and a patient died on an operating table.  It was discovered the anaesthetist had been on duty for three and a half days without a break.  A truck driver would not be allowed to work for that long without a break, yet someone working under those conditions was allowed give anaesthetic.  I congratulate the Commissioner on this move. Training periods may have to be longer but the area where there will definitely be trouble is the amount of work done by non-consultant hospital doctors.  Rather than greatly increasing their numbers, we should seize the opportunity to increase the number of permanent consultant posts.  The lack of non-EU doctors, especially outside Dublin, is causing trouble already.</P>
    <P>Consultants do not seem to be popular with the Department.  Figures in a recent survey on the length of time consultants drew their pensions have stuck in my mind.  It must be a stressful job because those who retired at the age of 62 drew pensions for seven years but those who retired at aged 65 drew pensions for 18 months.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I congratulate the VHI on its work.  It is interesting to note that the VHI started in 1957 when the health services were run by county councils.  At that time there were no waiting lists.  There were never queues in the surgeries of dispensary doctors. What has gone wrong in the intervening years?</P>

      <P>Millions of pounds have been spent on health services so something must be radically wrong.  Are people being encouraged to be ill?  Is that the name of the game rather than the prevention of illness?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that up to 40 per cent of the population are members of the VHI.  When this figure is added to the number of people who are members of other schemes such as BUPA, up to <Col N="701" /> 70 per cent of the population must have private health insurance.  If only 30 per cent of the population is in public care, where is all the money in the public service being spent?  In view of the money put into it, our public health service should be the best in the world.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross mentioned accountability and said people should know the names of members of boards and what they are receiving.  This is necessary.  The issue of accountability should be considered.  We should know the cost of every procedure and how many are necessary.  The amount of money being spent in this area worries me.  In this age of transparency and clarity, politicians are always questioned about what they receive.  They must be up front with the details. Much public money is spent on many areas by different organisations, but there is no accountability. We do not know what people are receiving or the percentage of money given to organisations that is spent on the relevant areas.  We do not know on what the money allocated in the budget for public health services is spent.  We do not know the exact cost of items.</P>
    <P>The VHI should be commended for staying in business.  The Minister said that almost 171,000 claims cost the VHI more than £156 million.  This is a huge cost for 171,000 claims.  What were the people involved charged?  How much was the cost to each person?  How much did it cost each person?</P>

      <P>I was a member of a health board for 20 years and it has always been a riddle to me that the more money spent on health services, the longer the waiting lists became.  Every Government over the past 20 years has said that it will solve the problem of waiting lists with extra money.  However, the more money that is allocated to dealing with waiting lists, the longer the lists become.  Where are the millions of pounds allocated to health services being spent?  Why were there fewer problems in the health services before the health boards were established in the 1960s?</P>
      <P>I was listening to the radio today and the biggest complaint was that, while general practitioners give a great service, people are bored with long waiting lists in their surgeries.  How has society become so sick?  Why is there so much bad health given the amount of education, good food, good living, better jobs and the money spent on creating a better environment for workers in recent years?  This problem is like Frankenstein; it has got out of hand and gone mad.  I do not know where it will end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI is doing a very good job.  I am glad that it is able to stay in business given the competition from private companies.  We were told before BUPA came to Ireland that the VHI was charging too much and cover could be much cheaper.  However, BUPA is now in Ireland but people are not running to it.  I compared figures <Col N="702" /> with people and they decided to stay with the VHI rather than go to the unknown because there was not a big difference.</P>
    <P>Years ago, the cost of car insurance was supposedly very high so PMPA was established. Ownership was to be in the hands of the people and the cost of car insurance was to be low. PMPA has changed hands but car insurance has become increasingly expensive.  The many things done over the years to provide services to people appear to have fuelled the flames.  There has been no improvement.</P>
    <P>I took exception to the comments of Senator Ross.  I have great respect for the Senator and I read his impressive newspaper articles.  However, the Senator implied that people associated with politics should not be members of boards.  Is he suggesting that he should not be on boards?  The Senator is a good businessman but he is also in politics.  There are many great people in politics and the Senator's remarks should not have been made.  If many of us had not entered politics, we would be much richer now.  Ireland is now a wealthy country.  When things were bad and businesses failed, politicians were blamed.  The country is flying now and there is an abundance of everything, but people say this would have happened anyway and it was nothing to do with politicians. This negative attitude is encouraged and inspired by men of the calibre of Senator Ross. He should desist because it is wrong.  The Senator is accusing himself of not being capable of being a politician.</P>
    <P>The Bill is technical.  Its purpose is to allow the VHI to join with another company in the future if it wishes.  Long ago the words &ldquo;rationalisation&rdquo;, &ldquo;amalgamation&rdquo; and &ldquo;conglomeration&rdquo; were flavour of the month.  Now, the terms &ldquo;mergers&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint ventures&rdquo; are flavour of the day.  The VHI must be in a position to become involved in that regard if necessary.  However, the health services must be considered in-depth.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a person who is now an MEP was a member of our health board.  A discussion was ongoing at a particular meeting about the money spent on tablets.  He said they were so plentiful that they were being fed to hens in parts of the country.  If that person was a member of the health board now, he would wonder to what they are now being fed.  The bill for drugs is another of my hobby horses.  Professional and dispensed drugs were the forerunner to the illegal drug business in Ireland today.  We were carried away by the availability of drugs.</P>
    <P>I attended a seminar some time ago where a lady said Ireland should be careful.  She said she had returned from abroad where the focus was on the new health service in Ireland.  She said she was working for a large pharmaceutical company and all such companies saw Ireland as virgin territory where big bucks could be made.  Pharmaceutical companies have made huge money in Ireland. It was always said that more Colman's mustard was left on the plate than was used; pharmaceutical companies are making more money from <Col N="703" /> drugs which are thrown on shelves and never used than from drugs which are used.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill although its terms are limited.  In light of the more competitive environment in which the VHI operates and given that people are being offered more and more private health care options, I wonder why the Bill is so limited in its scope.  If the VHI wishes to provide another product next year, which does not come under the terms of its original legislation or this amending legislation, will we have to draft further legislation to give it the freedom it requires to operate in a more commercial and competitive environment?  I would have preferred to see enabling legislation which would give the Minister and the VHI greater freedom to respond to the emerging challenges in the health insurance market without giving them <i>carte blanche.</i> Such legislation would allow the Minister and the Government to respond, by way of resolution or regulation, to requests from the VHI initiated by demands from the public.</P>
      <P>In the future, health insurance companies, in order to address many of the issues of cost which have been referred to, will start to consider actions and interventions to promote healthy living. They should be free to make the broadest possible response to enable prevention.  I would prefer if the VHI were enabled to do that through broad legislation rather than through the narrow focus of this amending legislation.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments on the White Paper on private health insurance.  He has given a commitment that the White Paper will be drafted before the end of the year and, subject to Government approval, will be published early in the new year.  I look forward to debating that important matter at an early stage following its publication.</P>
      <P>In light of this debate and the Private Members' motion tabled by the Labour Party last week, it would be timely for the Government to consider drafting a White Paper on the health services generally.  I am aware that the national health strategy, which was formulated by the Department, has been in place for a number of years.  The Government should consider preparing a White Paper on the health services as it would clarify the Government's long-term intentions in regard to health services.  Is it the Government's intention to continue to spend more and more money with questionable increased effect on public health services and at the same time preside over a situation where more and more people feel they must, in spite of their public entitlement, purchase private health insurance?  Is it the Government's intention to continue with a two tier public-private health service and, if so, how will those tiers be managed and made accountable to the public?  How will they be clear about the health care roles provided?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> On the one hand, we have a fast track system, funded through private health insurance, where one can get the consultant one requires in the hospital of one's choice when one wants him or her.  On the other hand, we have a slow track system where, in spite of paying for health services through taxes, PRSI and health levies, a patient has to wait up to two or three years in some cases to be seen.  Having been seen, one then goes on a long waiting list to await treatment and when one eventually gets into hospital, one is dealt with by registrars and house officers rather than the consultant nominally in charge of one's case. People cannot understand how their contributions to health care funding provide only a second class service.  In the eyes of the public, the scheme provides entitlement only if one can afford to wait for a number of years and if one's health problem is not urgent.</P>
    <P>I do not regard it as evidence of any great achievement or development to learn that membership of the VHI is at an all-time high.  Neither do I regard it as a mark of achievement to see more and more people being driven into the arms of BUPA.  A total of 40 per cent of the population is covered by VHI and the percentage covered by BUPA is increasing all the time.  We are rapidly approaching a situation where 50 per cent of the population feels the need to purchase private health insurance in order to be assured they and their families will get the treatment they require. A fundamental review of the health services is necessary.  This is not simply a question of funding. It is a question of how additional money is spent, managed and accounted for.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the whole issue of costs and subsidisation.  Last week, the Minister increased charges for private beds in public hospitals.  I support that principle.  However, a report earlier this year pointed to a contradiction in the Minister's role.  The Minister is the owner or figurehead of the public health service; he provides finance to the health services to help them meet their obligations on an annual basis.  The Minister also determines costs within the health services and is owner of the VHI.  There is a clear case for independent regulation of costs, particularly in regard to private health insurance, and for greater transparency of costs in the health services.</P>
    <P>We should not await publication of a White Paper to appoint a regulator.  I would like to see legislation introduced to set up an office of regulator, which would be accountable to the Oireachtas for the implementation of policy set by these Houses.  We witnessed a controversy earlier this year in regard to the telecommunications regulator and her accountability or lack of it to the Oireachtas.  A regulator of costs in the health services, particularly in regard to private health insurance, should have clear legal accountability to these Houses.  The Minister and the proposed regulator should not only look at the straight subsidisation of private beds by public hospitals but should also examine the issue of <Col N="705" /> cross subsidisation within health care plans.  Subscribers to plans A and B in the VHI and the equivalent options in BUPA are, in effect, subsidising those in higher plans.</P>
    <P>The public have a right to know if that is the case.  People are confused about whether they should buy private health insurance, which company they should go to and which plan they should purchase.  Sales pitches are designed as much to confuse as to illuminate and there is clearly a role for the protection of consumer interests in this area.  This is another reason the independent regulator needs to be set up with a close link into the work of the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also needs to address the area of quality.  As Senator Farrell said, it is difficult to believe that so much money is being spent for so little effect.  A lot of attention has to be given to the question of patient management.  Members have stated that the health service is consultant led.  The health service is consultant dominated. Any waiting list will be nominally passed across the consultant's desk but if you are a public patient you will never meet the consultant.</P>
    <P>The criteria for entry on to the waiting list, the contact between the general practitioner and the consultant that should take place to be seen in the first place, the question of assessment, the question of discharge following treatment and the follow-up treatment, are very much neglected in our health service.  It is terrible that members of the public feel they have to approach public representatives and believe we might have some role to play in moving them up a few places on a health board waiting list.  The standard reply I get when I contact the health board is that it is a matter for the general practitioner and the consultant. If the general practitioner thinks it is urgent enough to let them contact the consultant, they contact the consultant's office and the consultant is unaware of the patient because it has been dealt with in an administrative fashion within the hospital supposedly in the consultant's name but the case has never been dealt with by the actual consultant.  Similarly, in respect of assessment, a patient is referred to a clinic but the patient never sees the consultant.  Yet it is the first doctor who sees the patient who decides that one should see a consultant or that one can join the hospital waiting list.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the discharge of patients because I am dealing with a case which involves the Midland Health Board.  In practice, there is little or no liaison, despite what is on paper, between consultants, nurses, other hospital staff and community care staff in determining whether a patient should be discharged and if services are in place at home to ensure that the treatment which they are supposed to have received in hospital to make them better is given effect by the back-up and support provided for them when they go home.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> I hope the White Paper will not be used like a Trojan horse to dismantle the system of risk equalisation and community rating that was legislated for a few years ago prior to the entry of companies like BUPA into the market.  It is a long established principle of private health insurance that risks should be borne equally, that the young should not get cheap insurance while the aged have to pay through the nose for it.  This principle is accepted in our community despite the efforts of some prominent writers in the media to rubbish concepts such as community concern, responsibility and solidarity.  It is a principle which the people have supported over the past 40 years and it should continue.</P>
    <P>I support the limited measure that is before us today.  It would have been more advisable to have more broadly based enabling legislation that would allow the VHI to respond in time, effectively and keenly to the competitive environment that exists.  I hope we will have a debate early in the new year following the publication of the White Paper.  The Government must address a far more fundamental question about what direction our health service will take over the next 20 years. To that end I urge it to engage in a consultative process with a view to publishing a White Paper so that we can decide what direction our health services will take as we enter the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Someone has to dispel the mist of nostalgia that Senator Farrell introduced about the glorious life of 1957.  I suspect in those days of primitive dispensaries and health care for a large proportion of our population that the infant mortality rate was probably between 25 and 30 per 1,000.  It is now about 6 per 1,000 which is a good measure of progress in our health care.  To have achieved that at our relatively low level of economic performance until recently was one of our great achievements and one that is directly attributable to the quality of the public health care system, even with all its faults.  It was also due to the quality of service provided by the medical staff available.  I also suspect that in 1957 our life expectancy was ten years lower on average because infant mortality rates correlate with life expectancy.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell was concerned about the payment per claim.  It is about £850 per patient.  That is not an enormous amount of money.</P>
      <P>It needs to be said that what we have done with the health system in the past 40 years has been good.  We have been imaginative because we have tried to link together numerous aspects with various ways of provision.  With all the limitations thereof, and all the inadequacies Senator Gallagher highlighted that need to be addressed, we have done a reasonable job of providing a level of health care which the average citizen in the United States, which is nominally about four times richer than us, would be delighted to have access to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="707" /> On the other hand, we do contradictory things which impose enormous bills on us.  It is insane that the EU is still subsidising the tobacco industry on a grand scale.  If we could eliminate the damage to human health caused by tobacco and the use of it, we would save the health care system a sum of money that would eliminate all of our funding crises for at least another 30 years. Similarly, in the US there are tax breaks for tobacco growers.  We need to sort ourselves out.  We are talking ourselves into situations which are caused by spiralling health care concerns while we subsidise the production of goods that cause those problems.  We need to be realistic.  Tobacco will kill 20 times more people in the EU this year than all the illegal substances put together.  That is not to make any small issue of illegal substances.</P>
    <P>I work in the Cork Institute of Technology which has a total workforce, including part-time staff, of well over 1,000 but we do not own one motor vehicle.  The VHI employs 433 people and according to its balance statement it has spent £789,000 on motor vehicles.  On the basis that each vehicle cost £30,000 the company owns 30 to 40 motor vehicles.  While it is not a huge figure, for what does the company need them?</P>
    <P>Premium income increased by 1.5 per cent in 1998 while the number of people at work in the VHI increased by 10 per cent.  I do not object to public service employment, but we ought to know the reason for these increases.  In this regard I agree with Senator Ross's views on transparency and accountability.  It is not often I can read the Senator's mind, but he was not saying that those with political affiliation should not be appointed to bodies.  He said people should be appointed to bodies not only because of political affiliation but because they have a contribution to make and have individual skills to offer.  I agree with him.  People should not be disqualified from taking part in anything because of political activity but neither should they be regarded as qualified simply because they were, in one case for instance, the general secretary of a major political party moving on to better things.  I do not believe people join the board of the VHI for the £4,000 per annum they get as directors, but there is prestige and status involved and I question that.</P>
    <P>The great thing about the VHI is its success.  It has been successful because, so far, nobody has allowed ideology to get in the way of reality.  As one of the long established members of the Left in this House, I have always said that the fundamental basis for all of my Left wing beliefs is that they work and that the basis for everything is pragmatism.</P>
    <P>The belief that a competitive market will reduce the cost of health care is an ideologically driven position which is not based on reality.  The US has perhaps the most competitive market in the area of health care.  Yet, as a percentage of GNP, it spends twice as much as any country in <Col N="708" /> the EU and still ends up with a worse infant mortality rate than any of the less developed countries of the EU &mdash; it is significantly worse than ours &mdash; and with a life expectancy which is not much better than the EU average and is probably below that of some of the countries that would have the least competitive marketplace, such as Scandinavia, especially Sweden.</P>
    <P>Let us get real and not deal with health care as if it was a commodity that can be sold in the marketplace.  There is an infinite demand for health care and if an untrammelled commercial marketplace is created where there is infinite demand people will pay more in the belief that they are getting something better.  If people believe they must pay to stay alive they will pay more and more.</P>
    <P>The promised White Paper will be published at a time when the EU is obsessed with competition as the remedy for everything.  The same problem applies to the electricity market.  The price paid by the average domestic consumer in this country is less than in any part of the UK after privatisation. In the telecommunications market we are now observing that mere mortals who have telephone bills of less than £100 can forget about any of the benefits: Telecom Éireann will be left to carry the can.</P>
    <P>We must be careful about competition.  It is good if there are two television dealers selling televisions in the same small town, but we should not carry this into areas where it does not apply. Health care is one of them.</P>
    <P>I endorse Senator Gallagher's view on the need to ensure that there is no dilution of the principle of community rating nor of the other characteristics of our unique form of health care.  If such things are introduced the VHI and the system we have will fall apart and we will get the system that operates in the US.  A recent opinion poll showed that approximately 90 per cent of Canadians were happy with the quality of health care they had.  A similar survey in the US produced a figure of below 50 per cent.  That is not surprising, given that probably one-third of the population in the US does not have any health insurance and must, therefore, depend on a fairly primitive service.  It is an astonishing experience for Europeans to watch American television programmes about hospitals and see people say they cannot get treatment for their cancer, etc., because they do not have insurance and they cannot afford to pay for treatment.</P>
    <P>While there is much that is wrong with our health care system, nobody in the State is denied access to drugs, medicines, radiotherapy or chemotherapy because they do not have insurance and cannot afford to pay for them.  We should stand back in astonishment and tell people it is a good system.  It has a number of faults, it is under-funded and poorly managed, but it is still a better way to go.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry is right to remark that the idea that we need legislation to allow the VHI to do an obvious thing like this measure suggests that <Col N="709" /> the legislation is far too restrictive.  The system has created anomalies and is unfair to some. However, it is less unequal and unjust and fits together into a network of health care provision which is much better than the model behind many of the demands that are now being made on us. Competitive markets will destroy any kind of decent health care as they have done in the US. I ask the Government not to allow itself to be moved an inch in that direction because it will not do anybody any good.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Dr. Moffatt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Senators who contributed to this debate.  As usual, we have strayed away from the task before us.  Nevertheless a good representative view on the health system and voluntary health insurance has been made.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the views of Senator Taylor-Quinn regarding the need for a comprehensive review of all our markets, processes and strategies. This is why the Minister for Health and Children initiated a broad ranging review in preparation for the White Paper, which will set out detailed views on the consultation process.  It will also address the views put forward by the advisory group on the risk equalisation scheme in its report to the Minister earlier this year.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators, especially Senator Taylor-Quinn and Senator Ross, raised the issue of strategic partnership.  The Minister is looking at all options with regard to a strategic alliance and the matter is being fully considered at present.</P>
      <P>Access to health is an important motivation for the purchaser of any private health insurance.  It is, however, one of a number of considerations involved in choice with regard to hospital doctor, convenience, etc.  Private health insurance gives access to a private hospital system as well as private accommodation in public hospitals.  The Health (Amendment) Act, 1991, provides, through the bed designation arrangement, the means for the Minister to secure the position of the public patient.  This is matter of which the Minister is mindful with regard to private/public mixes.  The matter was also raised by Senator Gallagher.</P>
      <P>The request that health insurers should be required to provide benefit in respect of treatment by psychologists gives rise to range of considerations involved in issues relating to commercial freedom, financial capacity, customer preference, competition and appropriate legislative intervention.  There are, of course, significant and obvious implications to the State intervening in the decisions of private health insurance undertakings as regards what service they can and should cover in a competitive market.  I am sure this will be looked at again in the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome Senator Fitzpatrick's comments on the importance of community rating.  A number of other Senators raised this issue.  I do not <Col N="710" /> believe there is any risk to community rating at present, but there will always be those who say it should be different and that the young should not have to pay as much as the old.  At present, however, we are pleased to restate our view on the issue and to keep it in place.</P>
    <P>The comments made on clarity are important. What services are people getting?  As Senator Fitzpatrick remarked, it is difficult at times to know what one gets for what one pays.  I am sure that will be addressed in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Our health insurance system does not have a tradition with regard to dental care.  This has been highlighted by Senator Fitzpatrick.  It should be looked at again, but dental treatment can be very expensive.  The Senator said it was available in the US and other countries.  It will be dealt with in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross made wide-ranging comments on the Bill.  He was somewhat paranoid at times in some of the things he said.  Under the Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1996, the board was expanded from a membership of five people to 12 people, including the chairman. There is a wide representation of interests on the board.  Many of those on the board have wide experience in various areas of health and other issues.  There is nothing wrong with politicians sitting on the board provided they have the necessary background and ability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>The point has been made on a number of occasions in this House that politicians should not be involved in these areas but if they have the competence I see nothing wrong with it.</P>
      <P>I cannot give Senator Ross specific answers on cars and other matters about which he asked but if he tables a specific question he will get the relevant answers.  I agree there should be openness and transparency, although the Senator took a different line from other Senators when he said that competition is <i>sine qua non.</i>  Other Senators would not agree that it leads to better insurance or health services <i>per se.</i>  If we contrast our system with that in the USA, competition can be seen to be ineffective at times.</P>
      <P>The VHI Board has appointed Mr. Oliver Tatton as acting chief executive for an initial period of 12 months, with effect from 1 December, on a consultancy contract.  Senator Ross also mentioned that he is not happy with the presentation of the accounts and that the board members are simply listed while their backgrounds are not revealed.  He is unhappy with the lack of transparency in the workings of VHI.  VHI has done a good job.  Its running costs are around 6 per cent, a figure which contrasts well with that of any group in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry is unhappy about some of the patient facilities.  She mentioned that there is no great difference in the waiting times for private and public patients in certain areas.  That is often <Col N="711" /> apparent when a patient seeks an appointment but, on the whole, private patients are on the fast track, as Senator Gallagher said.</P>
    <P>The Minister is examining the situation regarding waiting lists, not on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis; he is looking at this on an ongoing basis for the first time.  If the problem is tackled in a particular fashion over a number of years it should be possible to deal with it but everyone must work together in the system.  Money must be invested in a strategic fashion and I have no doubt that we can make improvements, particularly with the economy growing in a manner which allows us to invest more money in this area.  I hope the budget will prove me right and that we will start an initiative which will see waiting lists cut.</P>
    <P>Waiting time is more important than waiting lists because many people can be on waiting lists for elective procedures which are not urgent. That is the problem.  Some people used to think that hospitals with large numbers on the waiting lists would get more money from the Government, but that day is gone.  We will be looking strategically at the waiting lists and we will make progress on that.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned Northern Ireland. At present VHI deals with two hospitals in the North, but this will have to be looked at in the White Paper.  With the development of North-South bodies, much more will be heard about that and I am sure the White Paper will deal with it.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher asked why the Bill is so limited in scope.  The provisions of the Bill represent a full response to a specific request made to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, by the board about what is regarded as an existing significant disadvantage in the conduct of business.  That is what we are dealing with today.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell compared what is happening in the health service now to the situation in 1957, when the local county councils dealt with health and there were no waiting lists.  Senator Ryan answered his queries about that.  He highlighted certain issues which are worth looking at &mdash; the overuse of drugs and placing more emphasis on prevention.  He disagreed with Senator Ross about politicians being on boards and gave good examples to demonstrate the reason.  He is unhappy about the drugs bill and pointed out that we should place emphasis on prevention.  Senator Ryan's point about smoking was related to this. Where we can effect prevention we will do so.  As Senator Gallagher said, there is a place for VHI in the preventative aspect of health rather than dealing with sickness alone, as it does at present.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher asked for a White Paper on the health services in general.  That is a good idea. The time has come for us to take an overall look at our health services because we are a changed society.  The fast tracking system must be looked at.  We should strive for the public and private patient to have the same access to health services. It will not be easy but that is what we should aspire to.  If we get the waiting lists correct that <Col N="712" /> will ensue.  We must remember that people who pay for their health respect it in many ways. Cross-subsidisation should also be looked at and I agree with many of the Senator's comments on that.  Patient management, from the consultants' and the GPs' points of view, should be examined. There must also be follow up of patient care.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Senator regarding the tobacco issue.  The average person spends £800 on VHI payments.  I believe this is money well spent because the VHI provides a good service.</P>
    <P>Transparency and accountability is nothing new and should be the policy of all semi-State bodies.  Senator Fitzpatrick suggested a debate on semi-State bodies and how they operate in the modern context.  This might also satisfy Senator Ross.</P>

The Senator said that he is aware of a case where 1,000 people are employed and there is no car available.  I am glad the Senator acknowledges that the VHI has been successful. The ideology of competition to which he referred does not always lead to the best services and structures.</P>
      <P>The debate today has resulted in a valuable overview of the health service.  I thank Senators for their contributions.  I will bring the salient points raised regarding the improvement of the service to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen.  I hope this will lead to more clarity on some of the issues raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded by this debate to comment on the position in relation to water quality generally, and in particular in the River Shannon catchment.  I propose to outline the measures in place and being developed to protect and improve water quality in this catchment.  I am confident Members will agree that these measures are the most appropriate and effective arrangements for the purpose. Members will be aware that statutory responsibility for the protection and improvement of <Col N="713" /> water quality lies with local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts.  The Environmental Protection Agency is also responsible, in the context of activities licensable by the EPA and the general functions of the EPA in relation to environmental protection.</P>
      <P>The Government fully recognises the importance of our inland waters to the economic and social well being of the country.  The generally high environmental quality of Irish lakes, together with the absence of serious pollution from our rivers, are significant national assets. Unlike many EU countries, we depend very heavily on our surface waters for the production of drinking water.  In the region of 75 per cent of our requirements are sourced in this way.  This contrasts sharply with, say, Denmark which sources over 95 per cent of its requirements from groundwater.  The success of the Irish agri-food sector in terms of international trade has been based, among other things, on our green image abroad.  Our reputation for high quality water has played an important part in the promotion of this image.  The general availability of plentiful supplies of high quality water has also been a factor in the attraction of significant levels of foreign industrial investment in recent years.  In addition, our waterways play a key role in attracting visitors to Ireland.  More than 250,000 visitors to Ireland annually are principally drawn by active water based pursuits, such as fishing, cruising and sailing.  Angling alone accounts for more than 130,000 foreign tourists annually.</P>
      <P>The bulk of Irish surface waters are of good quality and are suitable for the most sensitive uses.  The latest available EPA report, covering the period 1991-4, showed that 71 per cent of river channel length and 77 per cent of lakes surveyed, came within the unpolluted category. Serious pollution had been reduced from about 6 per cent of river channel length over 20 years ago to less than 1 per cent.  This major decrease in serious pollution results from our considerable success in dealing with point source discharges, primarily those from sewage and industry.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, however, there has been an increasing tendency over recent decades towards the enrichment of waters beyond natural levels. The phenomenon, known as eutrophication, has primarily resulted from excessive phosphorous loadings from a range of sources.  The main sources are agriculture, sewage and industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the levels of slight and moderate pollution to some 28 per cent of river channel length during the period 1991-4 represents the biggest challenge in terms of water quality management in Ireland.  In its report, the EPA ascribed, for the first time, the proportion of slight and moderate pollution generated by different sectors.  This information has been fundamental to the development of pollution prevention and control strategies.  Agriculture was identified as the single biggest contributor to both <Col N="714" /> slight and moderate pollution levels, with sewage and industry also significant contributors.</P>
    <P>The Private Members' Bill on the River Shannon Council, in early 1997, quite rightly focused attention on the River Shannon catchment as an important national resource.  This catchment drains the centre of the country, covering approximately one-fifth of its land mass.  It is important in economic terms in that it supports a wide range of agricultural and agri-based activities: it is a valuable source of drinking water and has major income generating capacity from tourism and recreation.  There is understandable concern, therefore, to ensure that the catchment is managed in a sustainable manner.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the debate in this House on the Second Stage of the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, my Department launched a national strategy to combat the eutrophication of rivers and lakes.  Its primary objective is to redress the deterioration in water quality caused by excessive inputs of phosphorous.  The strategy provides a clearer focus on, and a more systematic approach to, the problem of eutrophication.  It emphasises the importance of good water quality to the sustainable development of river and lake catchments in terms of agriculture, tourism, industry and other economic activity.</P>
    <P>The strategy provides for no further disimprovement in the quality of rivers and lakes, the setting of interim targets for phased improvements in the condition of rivers and lakes affected by pollution and pursuance of the overall objective of eliminating pollution from all rivers and lakes.  The strategy identifies, for the first time, a framework for an integrated approach to water resource management.  It endorsed the catchment as the most appropriate basis for the integrated planning and implementation of measures to improve freshwater quality.  In addition, it emphasised the need for greater co-operation between local authorities and other interested parties in terms of overall management.  The strategy also provided for a wide range of measures to address the various sectors which contribute to the eutrophication problem.</P>
    <P>Within my Department, we are engaged in a major programme of investment to upgrade sewage infrastructural facilities throughout the country. Total investment under this programme is estimated at £1.3 billion up to 2005 and is substantially supported by EU Structural Funds.  The Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchments, in effect the entire River Shannon catchment, are a particular focus of this investment programme.  Both lakes have been identified as sensitive areas for the purposes of the urban waste water treatment directive, on the basis of being eutrophic.  Overall investment in the Shannon catchment will be nearly £50 million and will entail substantial upgrading of facilities at 17 locations.</P>
    <P>Turning to agriculture, the Government is committed to pursuing a wide range of measures designed to reduce nutrient losses to waters. These measures address issues such as farm practices, <Col N="715" /> nutrient management and deficiencies in storage facilities.</P>
    <P>A code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution was launched jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food in July 1996.  The code is being actively promoted among the farming communities by local authorities, Teagasc and the main farming organisations.</P>
    <P>Nutrient management planning has also been substantially developed in recent years and is an important element in our drive towards more sustainable agricultural practice.  The objective is to achieve the correct balance between water quality protection and nutrient requirements for optimum crop production.  This must take account of nutrients already in the soil, nutrients available from animal slurry as well as the recommended application rates and nutrient requirements for different crops.</P>
    <P>Nutrient management planning is a requirement under REPS.  Some 40,000 farmers currently participate in the REP scheme and it is hoped to extend the scheme to an additional 10,000 farmers by the end of 1999.  Nutrient management planning is a requirement under the improved capital allowance scheme for pollution control investment which was introduced under the Finance Act, 1997.  It is also obligatory in respect of IPC licensed intensive pig and poultry production.</P>
    <P>The Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts were amended in 1996 to allow authorities require farmers to prepare nutrient management plans where this is considered necessary in the interests of water quality protection.  In August this year I published guidelines for local authorities on how to maximise use of these new provisions in order to achieve maximum benefit for water quality.  In December 1996 Teagasc revised downwards its recommended application rates for phosphorous fertilisers for grassland.  These new rates are being promoted actively.</P>
    <P>Under the control of farmyard pollution schemes operated by the Department of Agriculture and Food, it is estimated that over £500 million will have been invested by the end of 1999 in respect of new and improved waste storage and animal housing facilities.  The Government recently announced that it is committed to reopening a more focused scheme in 1999.</P>
    <P>All of the above measures are already beginning to show results.  In the past two years it is estimated that there has been a 20 per cent reduction in the use of phosphorous chemical fertiliser, down from 62,000 tonnes per year to some 50,000 tonnes.  I am confident that the combination of measures I have outlined will help to reinforce this downward trend.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, the strategy against eutrophication set out targets for the reduction in phosphorous levels in rivers and lakes.  These targets were given statutory effect in July this year when I made regulations prescribing <Col N="716" /> national water quality standards for phosphorous. The regulations establish clear targets and a clear timeframe for implementation.  First, as a minimum, specified levels of improvement in the condition of rivers and lakes must be achieved within a ten year timeframe.  Benchmark conditions will be as recorded by the EPA.  Second, local authorities and the EPA are required to take all such steps as may be appropriate to secure compliance with the quality standards.  This includes a requirement to review all licences involving discharges into water.  Third, the EPA will have an overall supervisory role in relation to the exercise by local authorities of their responsibilities under the regulations.  By 31 July 1999 each local authority will be required to submit a report to the EPA on the measures to be taken to implement the standards.  This will be followed by biannual progress reports by local authorities on implementation of these measures.  The EPA will be required to prepare and publish biannual national progress reports on overall implementation.</P>
    <P>My Department will monitor progress in implementing the regulations.  Our intention will be to adopt new standards towards the end of the ten year period with a view to achieving still further improvements in water quality conditions.</P>
    <P>One of the key concerns identified during the Second Stage debate on the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, concerned the effectiveness of arrangements for water quality management in the Shannon catchment.  This concern was understandable given the background of deteriorating water quality conditions in Lough Derg and Lough Ree.  Equally, there was concern at the time at the extent of the remit proposed for the council.  In particular, there was a need for further examination of the implications of the role envisaged for the council for existing statutory arrangements in areas such as pollution control, fishing development, habitat protection, environmental management in general and inland waterways management.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in terms of the catchment based approach to water resource management have addressed a number of concerns in this area.  Central to this has been the identification of the catchment as the appropriate focal area for integrated water quality management and protection. The catchment based approach has now been firmly established in Ireland with considerable success.  The catchment based approach, for example, provides an effective framework for the delivery of investment in waste water treatment facilities.  This approach has been the basis of applications for Cohesion Fund assistance. Already, applications have been approved in respect of seven catchments throughout the country, namely, Loughs Derg, Ree and Leane and the Rivers Liffey, Boyne, Suir and Barrow.  Total investment in these catchments will be approximately £130 million.</P>
    <P>The major programme of investment in the Shannon catchment involves the upgrading of facilities at 17 locations.  Major improvements <Col N="717" /> have already been completed at Athlone, Ballinasloe, Birr, Nenagh and Tullamore.  In all cases, phosphate reduction facilities are in place.  In addition, work is under way at Ballyjamesduff, Boyle, Moate, Monksland, Portumna, Roscrea and Roscommon.  Again, phosphate reduction facilities are being provided in all cases.  Schemes are at an advanced stage of planning in respect of Ballaghaderreen, Ballymahon, Granard and Longford.</P>
    <P>The level of investment in the Shannon catchment is impressive by any standards and reflects the Government's commitment to tackling the phosphorous contribution from sewage in the catchment.  It is estimated that this investment programme will reduce the phosphorus loading from sewage in the Shannon catchment by approximately 78,000 kilogrammes per annum, representing a reduction in the order of 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>The results of this investment are already beginning to have a positive impact on water quality.  The EPA review of water quality in the Shannon catchment for 1995-7 indicates that there has been a marked reduction in phosphorous concentrations in the River Shannon between Athlone and Shannonbridge and in the lower reaches of the Nenagh river.  These improvements can be directly attributed to the phosphorous reduction facilities which have been installed in both the Athlone and Nenagh sewage treatment plants.  In addition, monitoring of Lough Derg has indicated evidence of a considerable improvement in water quality, particularly in the middle and lower sections of the lake.  The improvement in the overall quality rating for the lake from strongly eutrophic to moderately eutrophic is a positive sign that current strategies are taking effect.</P>
    <P>The nationwide measures which are focusing on agriculture and which I referred to earlier are being extensively promoted throughout the Shannon catchment.  In so far as industrial discharges are concerned, local authorities and the EPA are now required to review any licence in respect of a discharge to a water body affected by the requirements of the phosphorous regulations. Local authorities and the EPA have been advised of the need to identify at an early stage the measures required from licensees so that licensees can put in place the planning necessary to ensure the targeted reductions in phosphorous levels can be achieved over the timeframe allowed for compliance with the quality standards.</P>
    <P>The question of the phosphorous contribution from detergents is also an area I am currently addressing.  In this regard, I hope very shortly to finalise a voluntary agreement with the Irish Detergents and Allied Products Association.  The agreement will provide for targeted reductions in the use of phosphate based detergents.  It will involve a twin track approach which will have both a national and catchment based focus.  The Lough Derg catchment is one of a number of <Col N="718" /> catchments where actions under the agreement will be concentrated.</P>
    <P>In terms of water quality monitoring, an extensive and co-ordinated programme is being developed.  Some 15,000 river, lake and effluent samples will be collected throughout the Shannon catchment each year in order to measure the effectiveness of the catchment management programme. The project partners have established a single, centrally located laboratory based in Roscommon town to undertake the routine monitoring needs of the project.  This collaborative approach will ensure the efficient use of personnel and the focusing of resources on sample collection and analysis.</P>
    <P>A computerised management system has been developed for the overall catchment.  This will provide water quality managers with a powerful facility for monitoring environmental change.  It will provide baseline data with which to assess and respond to future developments.  Four river sub-catchments have been selected for detailed monitoring.  The catchments concerned are Nenagh, Hind, Camlin and Brosna.  These were selected on the basis of having the highest export rates of phosphorous to Lough Derg and Lough Ree. The overall monitoring programme has been designed to deliver accurate estimates of the nutrient loading to the Shannon system and to establish baseline water quality conditions throughout.  The monitoring and management project will extend over a three year period and consultants have been appointed to carry forward the work in association with all relevant interests.</P>
    <P>The lead local authorities are Clare County Council and Roscommon County Council.  Implementation of the project is being overseen by an operational management group which is representative of the statutory interests.  The participants in this group include the nine relevant local authorities, Bord Na Móna, the Central Fisheries Board, my Department, the ESB, the EPA, the Shannon Regional Fisheries Board and Teagasc. Direct consultation has been taking place with a wide range of bodies and groups.  Efforts are also being made to promote public awareness of and support for the project.</P>
    <P>I wish to conclude by assuring Members that the catchment-based approach being adopted in respect of Loughs Derg and Ree provides a well-structured and co-ordinated approach to river catchment management.  All of the concerns underlying the proposals for a River Shannon Council are addressed without the need for the cost, or separate formalised structure, of such a council.  The catchment-based approach provides a well focused and balanced framework for water quality management.  It involves a clear, lead role for the local authorities which have statutory responsibility for water management.  It includes the direct involvement of the EPA, which has specific licensing functions in relation to discharges by industry, and it facilitates participation by all the relevant statutory authorities, voluntary groups and other local community groups.  An <Col N="719" /> extensive monitoring programme is in place and is being further developed, and a very substantial capital investment programme is under way in relation to water services.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements represent the most effective response to the water quality management requirements of the River Shannon catchment in the interests of environmental protection and the legitimate economic aspirations of the local communities.  For my own part I assure the House that I am fully committed to delivering on all the commitments in our catchment-based strategy, and I am confident that these initiatives will deliver on their objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I do not have the same experience and knowledge of this matter as some of my colleagues, particularly Senator O'Toole, who will speak after me. He has intimate knowledge of the river and over many years he has gained many insights into its resources.</P>
      <P>This Bill seems to be a total contradiction of the Bill that was introduced in the Seanad early last year.  I feel strongly that the Shannon is an entity and a resource in itself.  If a local authority at the upper level breaks the regulations, that impinges on other local authorities further downstream. For that reason I support the Bill moved by Deputy Michael O'Kennedy when he was a Senator.  He is now a Deputy, and though I am not saying his elevation to the Lower House was a result of that Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sure it had some effect on it.  He did not introduce that Bill light-heartedly; it is very difficult for Opposition Members to get Bills through.  He did so because he believed strongly in the concept of a single regulatory body looking after a single resource.  This is a resource which is underutilised and undermarketed.  It could bring in anglers, boat users and people interested in water sports. Nevertheless, it would be possible to market the river if one had a single organisation involved in development and marketing.  Such a body should have resources to ensure that local authorities, farmers and industry could be taken to task and fined if they continued to pollute or if they did not reduce their pollutants over a particular period. However, based on what the Minister said, it is now left to individual local authorities to do this.  I am a great supporter of local authorities, but I see the Shannon as a single resource to be managed singly.  Local authorities can work for their own areas but they cannot guarantee that their neighbours will do their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other pollutants that the Minister of State did not mention.  Bord na Móna owns 20,000 acres of peatland that is contributing to all sorts of polluted soils.  In some areas one can barely touch the edge of the lake.  The Minister <Col N="720" /> of State did not say what is to be done about that. I commend the Minister of State on the REP scheme, in so far as 40,000 farmers participate in it and it demands that they reduce the nutrients they are spilling into the Shannon.  The Minister of State hopes this scheme will be extended to 10,000 more farmers in coming years, but there are many farmers who are not touched by this.</P>
    <P>I recently had a conversation with a person involved in the construction industry and he informed me that concrete in slurry pits deteriorates over time, which is something one would not think of.  This means that existing slurry pits are a cause of pollution, and the Minister of State did not say what is to be done about that.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole has a wealth of experience of boating on the Shannon and I asked him about the pumping stations.  In the 1997 debate former Senator Howard said that there would be ten pumping stations installed within a short period of time.  Senator O'Toole informed me that there are pumping stations installed, but none of them is working.  It should be possible to introduce a system of licensing boats over a certain size, not with a heavy charge but a minimal sum.  That licence would be provided only where a boat had its own holding tanks and did not allow effluents straight into the Shannon.  The licence could be used by an inspectorate to ensure that any boat over a particular size had a holding tank.</P>
    <P>During the debate on then Senator O'Kennedy's Bill, the then Minister, Deputy Burton, referred to the EPA, saying, as the Minister of State did today, that it had identified eutrophication which is caused by excessive enrichment of waters brought about by inputs of phosphorous from agriculture, the major polluter.  She said that the EPA was developing an ecological early warning system at a cost of over £1 million which would alert water quality management to incipient eutrophication problems.</P>
    <P>By chance, I came across an Internet article by Earthwatch recently.  That body looked at all the counties in the country with reference to water pollutants and stated that the World Health Organisation's standards were much higher than those accepted by the EPA or the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  The Minister of State should say if this is correct.  The article claimed that we are not carrying out the number of examinations throughout the year that the WHO demands and that a substantial amount of the pollutants we test for are left over.</P>
    <P>I am aware that Earthwatch wrote to the EU for a reaction, but I have not heard if they got a response.  The allegation that we are not measuring enough or all pollutants would be a very dangerous one to make unless there was some substance to it, and I do not think Earthwatch would have made this allegation unless there was substance to it.  Earthwatch is saying that the EPA is not doing its job.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister of State on some of the means he has for reducing pollutants, but this matter would not be debated if Senators Manning, <Col N="721" /> O'Toole and Taylor-Quinn had not put forward a Bill on this matter.</P>

      <P>And Senator O'Meara.  I am sorry; I could not think who the fourth person was.  They did not introduce this Bill light-heartedly. They strongly believed that there should be an authority.  I am not sure whether it should have responsibility for development and control &mdash; the Senators involved will outline their thoughts later in the debate.  However, as this is a single unit, it is critical that a strong means is put in place for monitoring and ensuring that the pollutants in the water supply are reduced, if not eliminated, by a specified period.</P>
      <P>During the debate on the Bill, former Senator Howard stated that, in regard to its functions, the Bill was limited.  I am sure the Minister of State might agree given that he dismissed the Bill out of hand.  Senator Howard's constituency, Clare, touches the Shannon as do 26 out of the 32 counties. He said that he was concerned that such a system were put in place there would be a certain amount of overlap.  However, this overlap could be overcome by directing responsibility to the committee and not having self-monitoring.  I am sorry the Minister of State decided to dismiss his party's Bill and I hope that when the new Bill comes before the House, the Minister will take the opportunity to review it and reconsider his position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House to discuss this important topic. Undoubtedly, our waterways are a great natural resource and the deterioration of many of them, particularly in the latter part of this century, is a matter of concern to everyone.  It is important that the necessary initiatives to improve water quality are undertaken and I welcome the Minister of State's remarks in that regard.</P>
      <P>Having read the debate of May 1997, I acknowledge the initiative taken at the time by Senators O'Kennedy and Daly, who are now Members of the Dáil.  They showed tremendous innovation in suggesting that a Shannon river council should have been set up in order to tackle the continuing deterioration of the Shannon waterway.  The Department has since taken initiatives with regard to this, which should be welcomed.  The structure of how it is achieved is not nearly as important as improvement in water quality in the short term.  The Minister set in train initiatives which will focus on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other waterways are much in need of attention and I am more familiar with the River Barrow than the River Shannon.  One hopes a similar focus will be concentrated on them in the years to come.  The Bill illustrated that the primary function of the council would be to propose policies and priorities for protecting and enhancing the environment, water quality and the natural habitats for birds and fish within the catchment <Col N="722" /> area.  It was a commendable policy to co-ordinate local authority activities in this area.  It was also to make regulations to control water pollution and that is particularly important because there are many areas of pollution along the Shannon which need to be addressed individually.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State dealt at length with untreated sewage and the investment of £50 million that will result in significant improvements, as he illustrated.  The phosphorous levels are to reduce by approximately 80 per cent.  The EU, through Cohesion Funds, has made a considerable contribution to this, and the monitoring group set up by the Minister, which will obviously source much of that funding in order to improve the Shannon Estuary, should be acknowledged. Agricultural effluent is a major factor in the pollution of our waterways.  It is much more difficult than other pollutants to control.  The sources of untreated sewage are easily identified and, therefore, can be targeted for remedial action but because of the continuing use of artificial fertilisers, etc., in the agricultural sector it will be much more difficult to tackle that problem.  That needs to be done if there is to be an improvement.</P>
    <P>Industrial and chemical pollution is another source which can be identified.  Domestic detergents and peat silt, to which Senator Coogan referred, are also significant pollutants.  It must be ensured that each of these is addressed in an effective manner.  There must be an all-encompassing and comprehensive approach to improving the environment of the Shannon and, indeed, our waterways in general.</P>
    <P>Senator Coogan emphasised heavily &mdash; I imagine other Opposition speakers will also &mdash; the establishment of the Shannon river council. The Minister of State identified that a monitoring and management system is in place, which includes a steering group comprising representatives of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Clare and Roscommon County Councils and the Environmental Protection Agency, all of which have an interest in ensuring that the Shannon is restored to its previous condition.</P>
    <P>It probably raises the question why other local authorities along the Shannon are not represented because local government has a specific responsibility in ensuring that the environment is protected.  With regard to natural resources and amenities, such as the Shannon, the Barrow and the Slaney, it is obviously in our interest to ensure that they are protected, preserved and improved. Our waterways need to be protected not just for environmental reasons, but also for good commercial reasons.  The Minister of State said that 75 per cent of our water abstraction comes from surface water supplies.  Portable water is dependent on rivers and lakes being in a good, clean condition.  If that is not the case, then there obviously is a danger to public health and there is also a huge cost involved in treating water.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="723" /> It is essential, in terms of tourism and leisure activities, whether swimming, game course angling or pleasure cruising, which is a major contributor to the tourist industry in the Shannon hinterland, and for ecological and botanical reasons that the issue is addressed so that in future these activities will be sustained and we will have a river of which we will be proud.</P>
    <P>The Minister has put in place, through the monitoring and management system, an alternative to the Shannon river council whose remit is very similar.  I applaud my colleagues, Deputies O'Kennedy and Daly, for their efforts in placing greater emphasis on the improvement of the Shannon, which no doubt was a catalyst to accelerate such improvement.  It has focused attention which was well merited.  Their major concern is improvement of the waterway.  How it is achieved is a secondary consideration.</P>
    <P>I would like to think that given the efforts the Minister has made in establishing this body, it will be effective and successful.  However, I suggest that he does not abandon the concept of the Shannon River Council but defer it for the present and instead monitor the success and effectiveness of the management system he has put in train.  If in the future there is not an acceleration of the improvement we are seeking, the Minister could reintroduce the concept of the Shannon River Council and perhaps extend it to other important waterways.</P>
    <P>The Shannon is probably one of the finest river catchment areas in Europe.  Many people from all over Europe avail of the amenities it provides to enjoy their holidays.  In the European context generally, Ireland has carved out a niche for itself as a green and environmentally friendly country. It is imperative that we protect that image.  Not only should we protect the image, we should protect and improve the substance behind it so that in the future Europeans will look to Ireland as a country which has preserved not only its culture and heritage but also its environment.</P>
    <P>Looking back over history and the part the River Shannon has played in the culture and heritage of the island over the years, with monastic settlements centuries ago and the development of the Celtic civilisation, it behoves us all to place emphasis on it and to periodically and regularly monitor the effectiveness of any system put in place to restore it to the quality it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the words of the Minister of State.  I have no difficulty with the points he made.  I would describe his speech as pretty, but I would also describe it as being very reactive and it does not deal with the issues.  Before the Minister leaves the House, he should state the Government's position on the Shannon River Council Bill.  We are entitled to know and that has to be stated here.  Even if it is a &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; position, that should be done.  We have a duty to respond to needs as we see them.  There is currently a Bill which has passed through Second <Col N="724" /> Stage and those of us who have read and have spoken about it recently, need to decide whether we should re-enter it or if the Government should put forward a Bill.</P>
      <P>I want to make my position on this clear.  This is not about personal plaudits.  I would prefer to see a Bill coming from a Minister than being pushed through in Private Members' time.  A government's job is to govern.  Legislation was put forward last year and I supported it.  It was proposed by two members of the Minister of State's party and with our support on the Independent benches it managed to get through.  We did that because we thought it was the right thing to do, not to take a cheap shot at Government. The same position exists now and all I have learned in the meantime is that there is greater need.</P>
      <P>I know this river.  I have travelled every foot of it from the furthest end of Lough Allen to Loop Head.  It is clear to me that one cannot do business in this way.  It is clear from the Minister of State's speech that he is speaking as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Everything he stated relates to that Department and reflects well on it.  I will say nothing to rubbish his speech.  It is important. The issues he brought forward are hugely important to the river, but they are only part of it.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister in his reply to state how any Government can justify a situation where, if someone wishes to build a marina on the Shannon, the required regulations depend on the side of the river it is built.  If it is built on the Galway side there are one set of regulations and if it is built on the Offaly side there are a different set of regulations.  It cannot be right that grants, encouragement and other matters change from one side of the river to the other.  There is not a holistic plan.  It is an absolute nonsense to take the view in the Bill that each county council or local authority is responsible for the water in its own area and to leave that without telling us what happens next.</P>
      <P>What happens if those on the upper end of the river do not do their business?  What can Limerick, Clare or Kerry County Councils do about that?  Incidentally Kerry County Council also has an interest.  I noticed the Minister of State mentioned nine county councils; I presume that excludes Cavan and Kerry.  Cavan and Kerry also have an interest in this and that might be considered. My point is that there are so many different groups with an involvement.  I ask the Minister of State to hammer the table on this and come to terms with it and what we are about as politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One year ago, the Minister of State's colleagues in this House spoke passionately in favour of this legislation.  They talked of the need for it and the need for an overall plan.  It fuels a sense of cynicism about politicians if these issues die when these people go into Government.  I do not think the Minister should be slavishly bound by the <Col N="725" /> elements of the Bill put forward by his party and passed by this House last year.  However, there is a moral and political responsibility for people to put forward that which they said they were committed to.  That is not happening.</P>
    <P>How many Departments are dealing with this? I do not know.  There would certainly be the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  Four Departments have a core and central interest in what happens in the Shannon area.  I could name more Departments which have more involvement in various other ways.  I could mention many statutory authorities. What is happening is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>For example, if one travels through Limerick city by boat, in approximately 300 yards one passes through at least three areas of responsibility. I say &ldquo;at least&rdquo; because I could be wrong. First, one goes from the Limerick harbour authority, to Mallow Street bridge where one then moves into the area of Limerick Corporation.  I do not know if Clare County Council has responsibility for the other side.  Beyond that there is the area of the inland waterways.  Three different groups have different responsibilities along those areas.  That cannot be an efficient and effective way of doing business.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State can throw away his script and tell us what he feels.  We need political instinct to take over here.  We need people to ask what is the sensible thing to do.  I agree with the comments made about other waterways.  A comment was made about the Slaney and, having looked at this legislation, I certainly agree if the Government decided more waterways were involved than the Shannon.  It is connected to the two canals and the Barrow navigation and there is a much wider issue involved here for all our interconnected waterways.  There is a great case for extending rather than reducing.  This cannot be the case when those involved include ten or 11 county councils, four or more Departments, the Commissioners of Irish Lights and various harbour boards.  I could not even mention all the harbour boards.  Foynes Harbour and Limerick Harbour would have a strong involvement and there may also be some in County Clare.  Who is putting all these together?  Nobody is taking an overall view.</P>
    <P>The Minster may reply that the Environmental Protection Agency has a responsibility for water quality.  Yes it has, but who is going to stand on the bridge in Lanesboro and ask why all the development in the town is only on one side of the river?  Who will go into Richmond Harbour and apply pressure to sort out the connection between it and the River Shannon and ensure those areas are developed?</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention two things which have left him in the lurch.  His Department made <Col N="726" /> a decision, the commencement date of which has passed, that every cruiser on the Shannon should have a sewage holding tank which should be emptied at pump-out stations, but I travelled the length of the Shannon and did not find even one of them working.  They may be in operation now but they were not this summer, in Tipperary, Galway or Leitrim; and even if they were working, no one is insisting that cruisers should empty their tanks into them.  This comes under the aegis of the Minister's Department and nothing is being done about it.</P>
    <P>This year, I travelled through Ardnacrusha power station.  In the upper, deeper lock, of some 60 to 65 feet, I was able to scoop zebra mussels by the handful off the wall.  I thought the Minister would have mentioned this in his speech because it is a serious problem on the river.  I am raising issues which would give force and strength to the Minister's argument for an overall authority.</P>
    <P>In County Clare, the Kilrush marina has received the wrong sort of publicity over the last few years, but it is a vital tourism centre. However, for as long as one cannot get boats through Limerick city, because of the lack of planning and overall control, boats will not go down the Shannon to Kilrush.  That deprives that town, as well as Foynes, Ballylongford and Tarbert, of a new industry.  All it requires is for someone to examine the bridges in Limerick, to install a lock between Kemmy Bridge and Father Matthew Bridge, and dredge down about two feet. That would allow boats to travel through Limerick safely at almost all times, would bring a new industry to west Limerick, south Clare and north Kerry, and create a new tourism impetus in the area.  The problem is, who will decide to do this? No one has the money, it is no one's responsibility, and therefore no one takes the overall view.</P>
    <P>Neither is an overall view taken of water sports.  On beaches in most parts of Ireland there are rules which prohibit the use of water skis and jet skis in certain areas, but no one is co-ordinating or developing those activities on the Shannon. To return to a matter of concern to the Minister's Department, the protection of the corncrake covers more than one county and I do not see why it should not also come under the Shannon River Council, nor do I see why tourism issues, such as enabling people to travel from Waterford to Belleek or Ballyshannon, should not be considered by the council.</P>
    <P>It is unacceptable that the Minister's contribution did not cover the more negative developments we have read about recently.  The Lough Derg group, among others, is issuing statements about the deterioration in water quality in certain areas and the extensive increase in zebra mussels on the river.  These matters should have been dealt with in the speech.</P>
    <P>The main point to consider is how to tackle the problem.  The way to move things forward is not through projects or management ideas as outlined by the Minister, important though they may <Col N="727" /> be.  Those things should be happening but should be accountable to a Shannon River Council.  We need an overall body which would be responsible for doing the positive tasks the Minister has outlined in the speech.</P>
    <P>There will be a fundamental cynicism until people see politicians deliver what they are committed to.  A clear understanding was given by the Minister's party that it was committed to having an overview of this.  In recent times, the Leader of the House made clear it was still being considered by the Government.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position.  Has the Government decided not to do this, in which case we can go to war about it?  Is it considering the matter and will it make up its mind in a few weeks or is it thinking of reintroducing the Bill as it stands?  There are various approaches but a haphazard one is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The River Shannon has such potential for enriching our culture that we should examine this matter.  The town of Banagher has great historic and cultural associations.  O'Sullivan Beara, from the Minister's county, crossed the river near it; the town has one of only two inland Martello towers in Ireland; it is the centre of corncrake protection and river activities; it has connections with the Brontes, Trollope and others.  That small town is one example of the enrichment we can gain from the river.  We must approach the matter in a controlled, directed and holistic way.  It cannot be left to individual county councils &mdash; that is not to put them down, but it is unfair to expect them to be responsible for something over which they have no control, such as the river.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming here and ask him to take on board these issues.  I hope he takes a firm line with people with whom he discusses these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister and thank him for his speech.  I took heart from some new initiatives he made known and measures which it is planned to enact.  The Shannon is important but I am pleased we have an opportunity to discuss water pollution in its own right. Good reasons have been put forward for taking a stronger and more integrated approach to correcting the deterioration of the water quality in the Shannon and its hinterland &mdash; Members have spoken of commercial, recreational and other reasons &mdash; but the most overriding reason for seeking to protect our water quality is that of human health.  Every other reason is valid and ought to be taken into account but from the human health viewpoint it is fundamental that we seek to preserve and improve water quality in all inland rivers and lakes.  This country calls itself the Emerald Isle and promotes itself as a place of clean air and health soil.  No one wants hotels, in future years, to be obliged to have signs stating that the water is not fit for drinking.  This will happen unless strong corrective measures are taken because that is the direction in which we <Col N="728" /> are going.  We can ill afford to be complacent about water quality.  Similarly, we cannot be complacent about the quality of the soil in which the food we eat is grown.  We must devote a great deal of energy, time and expertise to protecting these two important factors in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the points the Minister made. However, I am not as optimistic that the pace of progress is as rapid as it should be considering the degree of deterioration that is well established at this stage.  I refer in particular to a report published recently by the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchment monitoring and management committee. It represents nine counties along a strip of the Shannon, the longest strip of inland waterway in the country.  The committee is far from complacent and optimistic and states in its report that the quality of the water is getting worse rather than better.</P>
      <P>The report underlines and emphasises that the water course there is under a severe and growing threat from sewage discharges, agricultural run-off and industrial effluent.  I welcome the measures outlined by the Minister to tackle sewage discharges and the additional investment in that direction.  However, the measures taken have not been strong enough to deal with phosphate and nitrate enrichment of the soil and slurry spills.  It is fanciful to think that only the water areas along the Shannon are being badly affected. The Minister is aware that for many years there were fish kills every summer on the River Lee. This is unacceptable.</P>
      <P>Long stretches of tributaries of the River Lee have been poisoned because of slurry spills; they will continue to be poisoned for years to come. They are dead rivers which will not support fish life.  These rivers are at our back door and I am not certain that the degrees of surveillance and enforcement or the penalties imposed are sufficiently strong to act as a deterrent or a preventative measure.  If they were strong enough, this practice would not be repeated year after year.</P>
      <P>The Shannon area is not the only one that is very vulnerable to these influences.  The River Lee and the great limestone lakes in the west, including the Corrib and the Cullen, are very sensitive and vulnerable to this type of pollution.  The internationally acclaimed Lakes of Killarney are also affected.  Lough Leane, which the Minister visited, is grievously and seriously polluted.  This is a sad testimony to historic neglect on the part of local authorities and local people who have failed to appreciate the importance of these waters at every level and to take preventative measures to protect them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lough Derg and Lough Ree management committee stated that we still have inadequate baseline information.  Despite all the research carried out and the activities of the EPA, we continue to have inadequate baseline information regarding the exact sources of river pollution. This issue must be examined and, if that argument <Col N="729" /> is sustained, remedied.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The committee also pointed out that a number of the penalties are unworkable.  Some of the penalties are national lottery type figures which will be imposed on farmers if they are found by the EPA to have polluted or to be in breach of a licence.  However, those penalties will not be enforced.  People in Ireland are too decent to put a farmer and his family out of business overnight on foot of one transgression.  This does not happen in Ireland.  Pubs are not closed down even when they are in breach of the licensing laws.  It is not in our tradition.  Therefore, the penalties are fanciful and unlikely to be enforced.  There should be more workable penalties which would be sufficiently strong to hurt people and ensure they would not reoffend, but not to deny a family their livelihood.</P>
    <P>The committee also mentioned the failure to reduce phosphate enrichment from farm sources. The Minister made a big play about phosphates. However, I am as concerned about the presence of nitrates in the soil in which the food I eat, such as root vegetables, is grown as I am about phosphates in the waters from which I take my fish.  I am very worried about nitrates and I am not sure that there is enough information about their source and effect.</P>
    <P>I was reared on the land when times were bad and money was scarce and I do not understand why clever farmers apply more fertiliser to their land than is necessary to achieve the required result.  As the Minister is aware, a survey of the River Lee catchment area found that the amount of phosphate used on the land is 50 per cent more than is required to achieve the optimum yield of grass.  I do not understand why farmers waste that money.  Taxation measures should be introduced as an incentive to farmers to apply only the recommended amount of fertiliser.  I do not understand why we cannot use our taxation system to achieve that result.</P>
    <P>Since she took office the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has sought to use the budget, which was traditionally a fiscal instrument, as a measure to achieve her objective of generating employment by making it attractive for unemployed people to take up work and rewarding them for doing so.  I do not understand why our taxation system cannot be used in a more sophisticated way to achieve better environmental results, particularly in terms of the surplus of fertiliser we are told is being used.</P>
    <P>There are also phosphates from domestic sources such as detergents.  The taxation system should be used to reduce the amount of phosphate based detergents used by housewives at present, many of them in total innocence.  It is not as if there is not an alternative.  Phosphate free detergents are available in Ireland.  As a further bonus, they are manufactured in the constituency shared by the Minister of State and I by Henkel in Littleisland.  I recommend to the Minister that <Col N="730" /> we bring to the attention of the public that alternatives are available.  Additional taxes should be imposed to wean housewives away from the bad old practice of using phosphate based detergents which are a major contributor to pollution of our water.</P>
    <P>It is in the best interest of farmers to ensure we have good healthy soil and clean water.  The farmers are the custodians of the land.  A survey carried out in the Shannon/Nenagh area revealed that two-thirds of farmers had inadequate storage facilities.  That is not acceptable in light of the emphasis on fish kills.  The REP schemes offer some incentives to farmers but farmers must seek advice from Teagasc and other bodies and must be encouraged to seal slurry in order to avoid detrimental run-off into lakes and inland waterways. Stronger measures are required.  It is one thing to outline measures on paper but it is another thing to put them into practice.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced sufficiently strong resources are available to police and monitor the measures we put in place.  Unless strong and radical action is taken quickly, some of the most beautiful and magical lakes in this country will be beyond salvation.  I am unclear whether the objectives of those who drafted the Shannon River Council Bill will be met in the measures outlined by the Minister here today.  I hope they will but I suspect they may not.  I have been long enough in politics to know that what is everybody's business eventually becomes nobody's business.  I invite the Minister to return to this House in a year's time and demonstrate to us how the system is operating in practice and whether it is achieving its desired objectives.  If it is, we will be very pleased and if it is not, we will have to reconsider it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced that Government thinking on this problem is fully reflected in the Minister's speech.  I am concerned that the Shannon River Council Bill is too limited in its focus.  Many waterways and catchment areas are experiencing similar problems to those experienced in the Shannon catchment area.</P>
      <P>Mayo County Council is the monitoring agency for the River Moy and Lough Conn catchment area.  There are natural indicators of eutrophication in Lough Conn.  The disappearance of a species of fish native to Lough Conn for thousands of years was the first indication of eutrophication. A further dire consequence of eutrophication is that trout do not come to the surface; they are dying of old age at the bottom of the lake. That has a detrimental spin-off effect on our tourist industry.  The number of fish caught in Lough Conn this year was disastrously low.  If fishermen do not catch fish in a particular lake, they will not return to that area.  The enrichment in the lakes is so great that trout will not rise for the mayfly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like the Minister to focus his attention on pollution in our lakes and rivers.  I would like him to draft a Bill which addresses the range of problems currently affecting our waterways and <Col N="731" /> rivers, of which pollution is a major one.  The causes of pollution have been outlined here today.  We pay a price for progress and that price seems to be pollution.  Industrial pollution causes major problems in our rivers and there is a lack of enforcement of penalties.  A recent survey carried out on people's attitudes to being caught for offences &mdash; including speeding &mdash; revealed that 85 per cent of the population believe they will never be caught.  Senator Quill referred to farmers allowing effluent flow into rivers and having faulty silage pits.  Occasionally farmers are caught and fined heavily but they are in the minority. The majority of people get away with committing offences.  The Minister must address the issue of enforcement.  It is no good having a plethora of legislation if it is not enforced.</P>
    <P>Farmers have a great deal to answer for in regard to the pollution of our lakes and rivers. They often spread more fertiliser than they need and fail to consult their local Teagasc offices which would advise them on the correct quantities. Fertiliser is sometimes spread the day before a major downpour and 90 per cent of it is washed into the nearest stream, subsequently finding its way into our lakes and waterways.  Those problems must be tackled.  REPS is contributing to the solution of some problems but only a fraction of farmers are involved in these schemes and some do not comply with the regulations.  The Minister should focus on the wider issues.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to water quality.  Much of our drinking water comes from lakes and rivers. We have a great deal of good underground water and aquifers, especially in limestone areas. They are not being tapped although there may not be any need to tap them at the moment.  A few years ago almost every farmer had his own well.  The water quality of these wells was excellent because it came from the natural limestone and was unpolluted.  Grants were given to farmers to enable them to have a natural source of water in their own farmyard.  The Minister should take the issue of incentives on board.  We can solve many problems by offering people incentives to change their ways.  We should also direct more attention at the control of pollution.  We should give incentives to farmers to do things that will improve the quality of our waterways which is an ongoing problem.</P>
    <P>With the current level of industrial and economic activity or the Celtic tiger economy we will have to pay the price in pollution.  Pollution has to be tackled more seriously and on a wider plane if we want to achieve the results that will satisfy the entire country.  Dealing with it on a piecemeal and localised basis will not solve the issue.  It will solve the problem in one area but it will not cater for the needs of the entire country.</P>

    <P>There is no doubt the Shannon is the most important river in this country and it has to be <Col N="732" /> protected.  It is a river of enormous interest from many points of view, particularly for people in the fishing, boating and other water based businesses. It is widely used.  However, there are vast problems as far as pollution is concerned with fish kills, etc.  A lot of work has been done to protect the Shannon and other waterways but a lot more work needs to be done.</P>
    <P>Water quality is the most important issue we have to get right, particularly with regard to water consumption and water treatment in every town and village.  A target date should be set whereby a treatment system will be installed in every town and village that is connected to our waterways. We have to improve our own facilities before we criticise other people.  At the same time we should impose severe restrictions on people who produce industrial waste.  This has been an enormous polluter of our waterways.  I remember when one industry in my county started up the workers were instructed to allow untreated water run into the waterway and it would run into the sea.  This resulted in numerous fish kills That industry has since installed a water treatment facility.</P>
    <P>We must go a step further.  A section of the Shannon runs from Limerick to Tarbert and Kerry Head and the sewage from all the towns and villages situated along its banks is allowed flow into the river untreated.  There is not one treatment plant on its banks in this area.  I welcome the new treatment plants that are being installed upland.  We have to look at this issue in the future because if we are to protect our habitat and wildlife we will have to ensure that water quality is protected.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned Denmark where more than 75 per cent of their water supply comes from wells.  I visited Denmark as a member of a delegation from Kerry County Council and we met various groups who were concerned about the quality of their water supply due to the amount of nitrogen and phosphates that had been used on lands for agricultural purposes.  They are afraid that these chemicals will seep down into the water system and that their wells will be polluted in the future.  I am glad to see there is a reduction in the amount of phosphates and nutrients allowed for use on lands.  Further restrictions should be introduced.</P>
    <P>Many Senators referred to the agricultural sector and said that farmers should install proper slurry pits, etc.  Farmers should receive more grant aid to install these facilities.  All farmers should not be tarnished with the same brush. There is a small number of farmers who pollute the water supply and they should be identified and prosecuted.  When these farmers are emptying their slurry tanks they take the easy route.  If a river is flooded they will empty their slurry tanks into the river under the guise of darkness which solves their disposal problem until the following year.  But there are law abiding farmers who dispose of all the effluent from their farms in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> Extra money should be made available to farmers to install proper controls.  There should also be more rigorous conditions placed on any industries that are being set up here, particularly if they are setting up along the Shannon and any other major rivers.  These measures should be part of the overall environmental impact study that is being presented to the local authority.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Toole that there should be one overall body in charge of the Shannon. The local authorities should play their role in each of the authorities because they are the governing bodies and they are responsible if there is a pollution incident in their county.  They will be the ones to suffer and they will pay the price at the end of the day.  It would not be suitable to have an agency based as far away as Cavan or Roscommon if a problem occurs in Clare or Kerry.</P>
    <P>With regard the upgrading of sewerage facilities, I am delighted that the Minister will spend £1.3 billion on these facilities up to the year 2005. I would like this scheme to continue after the year 2005 because there should be an ongoing programme to upgrade our sewerage treatment plants.  One of the biggest problems facing my local authority is the cost of servicing the treatment plants.  The capital costs is one thing, but the running costs are becoming a problem and a deterrent.  A way will have to found around that. If people want proper water facilities they will have to pay part of the cost.  They cannot be looking to central government all the time.  It is one thing to provide services but thereafter it is for the local authorities or the people living in the area to pay.</P>
    <P>I welcome the numbers in the REPS and the announcement by the Minister of State of an additional 10,000 people coming into it.  That is a move in the right direction.  I also welcome his announcement that improvements in the condition of rivers and lakes must be achieved within a ten year time frame.  That is very important.</P>
    <P>Last year we encountered a very serious problem with one of the lakes in Killarney.  We addressed the matter and are monitoring it very closely.  The lakes of Killarney are very important to my county.  They are used for drinking water and for fishing and tourism.  I compliment my local authority for the work it has done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the announcements made by the Minister of State.  If they are followed through in a proper fashion, there will be good drinking water and there will be proper facilities on the River Shannon.  It will then be a clean river &mdash; it was always known as one &mdash; and one of which all living along it can be proud, whether it be in respect of sporting activities or the quality of <Col N="734" /> drinking water.  I welcome any money spent in this area and the Government should allocate any extra funding at its disposal to ensure that the quality of water in our waterways, especially in the River Shannon, is of the highest level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for comprehensively setting out the initiatives undertaken by his Department in the area of water quality, monitoring and management in the River Shannon catchment area.</P>
      <P>I join with Senator Dan Kiely in thanking Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Daly for their initiative in bringing forward the Shannon River Council Bill when they were Members of this House.  I was not a Member when the Bill was introduced.  However, I have, to an extent, succeeded Deputy O'Kennedy in representing the constituency of Tipperary North in this House.  It was at my initiative that Second Stage of the Bill was reintroduced.  In this I have the support of Senator Taylor-Quinn on behalf of Fine Gael and Senator O'Toole on behalf of the Independent group.  There is, therefore, support for the Bill on all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>I do not believe the Minister of State is engaging in a cynical exercise in attending this debate. However, is the Government serious about this Bill and this council?  I and other Members have concluded it is not.  Will the Minister of State put us out of our misery and let us know if the Government is serious about the Bill?  It is time the Government stopped engaging in a cynical exercise of pretending that it will at, some stage, introduce this or similar legislation to establish a river council, authority or some body which will have a proactive, developmental and monitoring role on water quality on the River Shannon.</P>
      <P>The Shannon River Council Bill is a fine Bill. It reminds me of the Western Development Commission Bill, which the House passed last week. The Western Development Commission also establishes the role of a chief executive and gives the commission power to co-ordinate strategy with regard to development, promotion and integration of that strategy in relation to the west.</P>
      <P>The point was made &mdash; it has also been made with regard to the Shannon River Council Bill &mdash; that in establishing the Western Development Commission under a legislative framework the House was duplicating a range of responsibilities already present under law in a number of agencies, including the local authorities.  That argument is made in reverse with regard to the Shannon River Council Bill, that there is no need for the proposed Shannon River Council because of the existence of local authorities, the EPA and regional authorities, although the latter has no teeth or authority thanks to the lack of enterprise by Fianna Fáil in the past.  If that is the case, there is no need for the Western Development Commission because it is performing a similar function with regard to a different issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, a Shannon River Council Bill is required.  Indeed, I have suggested to my colleagues <Col N="735" /> on this side of the House that we meet to consider publishing a new Bill, a Shannon Authority Bill, because something more than a water quality monitoring agency is needed.  What is required is an authority with powers that will be proactive, not only on water quality, but on tourism, agriculture and other matters, and will also have a co-ordinating role.  Given that a number of agencies, Departments and existing authorities have functions on water quality, tourism and agriculture as it affects the River Shannon, there is a need for a central body to co-ordinate and ensure that all elements of strategy, development and activity are carried out.  That is not happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>There is a political issue here.  It was political pressure and support by all the political parties which led to the establishment of the Western Development Commission.  It was political lobbying by those involved in western development, including Marion Harkin, that ensured the introduction of the Western Development Commission Bill.  Ultimately, it will be political will that decides if we have an authority for the proposed Shannon River Council.  It is lacking at present.  A Bill has been published by two senior members of the Minister of State's party, yet the Government has paid lip service to the notion of an authority throughout the life time of this Seanad.  I have raised the matter on more than one occasion but the Government has prevaricated and has tested our patience.  It is time that came to an end; perhaps we should publish our own Bill.  It is time the Government declared that the Shannon River Council Bill, as published initially by Deputy O'Kennedy and subsequently republished by me and other colleagues, is effectively dead.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues regarding environmental matters on the River Shannon to which the Minister of State referred.  Two weeks ago I raised an Adjournment matter on phosphates. This had been publicised on a number of occasions by SOLD &mdash; the Save Our Lough Derg group &mdash; based in Dromineer and with whom I work closely.  The group has been campaigning for a ban on phosphates in household detergents. The current Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, gave a clear undertaking when in Opposition that he would ban the use of phosphates in household detergents.  Now he is in Government that, like many other issues, has been forgotten.</P>
    <P>We hear once again from the Minister about a voluntary code.  The voluntary code is useless because it lets the industry off the hook.  This is a multinational industry which is able to sell phosphate-free household detergent in Germany but appears to be unable to sell it in this country. Phosphate-free detergent is widely available in other parts of Europe but a voluntary code has not made it available to householders here.  A ban is necessary and the Minister should fulfil the promise he made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Judging from the Minister's speech, one would imagine that Lough Derg, the lake with which I am familiar, is in pristine condition, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Lough Derg is still seriously polluted.  I ask the Minister to respond to Senator Quill's comments about the report of the monitoring and management committee of Lough Derg and Lough Ree which states that the pollution problem is worsening. The impression he gives is that nutrification is on the decrease.  From the evidence of fishermen and the people who live on Lough Derg, this year was no better than any other.</P>
    <P>The Minister was correct when he said that a number of sewage treatment plants are improving the water quality of Lough Derg.  There is still, however, a considerable number missing.  Kerry-glass, which is situated on Lough Derg and was the winner on a number of occasions of Tidy Towns Village of the Year, still has not been approved for a sewage treatment plant.</P>
    <P>There is a voluntary approach to reducing the amount of phosphates and nutrients being put into the lake and the catchment river area of Lough Derg by farmers.  We have been told that Teagasc, in conjunction with the farming population, is reducing the amount used.  There is a voluntary code, but what happens if the amount is not reduced?  I do not understand why farms overspend on nitrogen.  Senator Kiely said that grants should be available to encourage reductions in its use.  He asked for grants to be given in order to spend less.  That is a contradiction. I ask the Minister to return to that issue. The Department of the Environment and Local Government, in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and Food should put forward serious proposals to deal with the single biggest cause of nutrification in our lakes.</P>
    <P>Zebra mussels were not referred to once in the Minister's speech.  This issue is a major problem in Lough Derg and the surrounding area.  I have raised this in the Seanad and the attitude of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources is to ignore the problem.  These mussels are clearly causing a problem.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, on his strategy against nutrification, that he made regulations in July prescribing national water quality standards for phosphorous.  In that context he said that local authorities and the EPA are required to take all such steps as may be appropriate to secure compliance with the quality standards.  This includes a requirement to review all licences involving discharges into water.  I have a specific question about this.  Currently there is an application before North Tipperary County Council by a group called Waste Management Ireland, part of a global company called Waste Management Incorporated, for a licence to discharge 1.8 million cubic litres of poisoned water from a pit in Silvermines, six kilometres from Nenagh and within the water catchment area of Lough Derg and the Shannon.  As part of the licence application it is proposed to discharge this water into <Col N="737" /> a stream which would flow into the Kilmastullagh River which flows directly into the Shannon and into Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>I have queried why this licence application has not been sent to the EPA and I have been told that the EPA has no interest in it.  I find that extraordinary.  The elements contained in the water in Silvermines are left over from open cast mining &mdash; not only lead and zinc but phosphorous I would like to know the statutory levels above which the EPA must be involved in issuing that licence.  I have attempted to get an answer but it has not been satisfactory.  This licence application should be dealt with by the EPA in an open and transparent manner.  We face a situation where the decision is being made in an executive manner by North Tipperary County Council.  This is an issue related to water quality in the Shannon and Lough Derg catchment area which is not being dealt with by the EPA, contrary to what the Minister said.  I would like the Minister to respond to that question.</P>
    <P>I welcome the presence of the Minister in the House but it is disappointing that the Government is taking such a cynical approach to such fine legislation which a senior member of its own parliamentary party took the time to initiate.  I look forward in the near future to a River Shannon authority, commission or council to match the Western Development Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Dardis.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Dan Wallace to the House for this discussion.  I compliment Deputies O'Kennedy and Daly for their work on the Shannon River Council Bill.  I live very close to the Shannon and there are many problems in that area.  The main provisions in the Bill are the co-ordination of the environment, water quality, habitats, water management and the activities of public authorities.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are the right bodies to be charged with water monitoring in their areas.  The making of recommendations to regulate and control water pollution, the provision of an inspection and supervisory service and the preparation of water management and pollution control for the entire Shannon catchment area are very important.  Companies are licensed and carefully monitored by local authorities.  That is certainly the position in my county.</P>
      <P>I welcome what the Minister said on improvements to sanitary services in many towns and villages within close proximity to the Shannon.  Villages upstream on some of the smaller tributaries to the Shannon must also be given priority in relation to sewerage schemes.  The Minister of State proposes to allocate money to improve the water quality in these areas.  There is a lot of development in close proximity to towns and villages adjacent to the Shannon.  Local authorities should ensure that large housing and ribbon developments are built closer to villages and towns where services are available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> We must ensure that developments take place adjacent to the River Shannon catchment area. We must get things right in this area because there has been a substantial drop in population in the lower, middle and upper Shannon regions in the past ten years.  This can be redressed by developing services in the area and ensuring that the Shannon River Council Bill is more relevant, particularly in the area of water quality.  Agencies with responsibility in this area include the ESB, the Board of Works and fishing, boating and farming interests.  Boating interests include pleasure boats, row boats and canoeing.  The water quality of the Shannon must be properly monitored.  Fishing on the Shannon has suffered as a result of the pollution that has occurred in the past ten or 15 years.  I welcome the sewerage development that has taken place in the town of Athlone.  This will be of major benefit to the Shannon even though there may still be problems in smaller villages.</P>
    <P>The Minister might consider licensing the spreading of fertilisers.  This is taken into consideration in REPS but some farmers are not involved in REPS.  Farmers can spread slurry if the weather is suitable but heavy rain can cause serious problems.</P>
    <P>Pump-out facilities for boats must be considered. This is crucial because there are many boating enthusiasts with large numbers of boats on the Shannon.  These boats cause serious pollution problems.  This is not always evident because of the vast volume of water in the Shannon. Money should be allocated to local authorities to ensure that these facilities are provided.</P>
    <P>If the situation is not improved in 12 or 18 months, perhaps the Minister will consider appointing one monitoring body to deal with all the organisations involved in this area.  However, the amount of money being spent on schemes adjacent to the Shannon should improve matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Moylan for sharing his time with me.  I am not sure a Bill is necessary to deal with this problem.  However, there must be a determination to sort out the matter.  This can only be done effectively by having one overall agency to deal with all the other agencies with responsibility in this area.  There are far too many such agencies, some of which have contributed to the pollution problem.  It is inconsistent to ask local authorities to monitor water quality when they have created the problem in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulty with the Shannon is that one is dealing with a very large water course where there are large lakes with a slow turnover of water.  I flew over Lough Derg recently and could see the pollution from the air.  I began my angling career at the age of 12 in the town of Banagher from where one could row to Meelick weir and see the bottom of the river.  Bord na Mona's activities put paid to that when silt came down the river to Lough Derg.  I visited Lough Sheelin where piggeries have been erected.  I met a farmer who told me he would put enough slurry <Col N="739" /> in the lake in five years to reclaim it.  Lough Sheelin is one of the premier trout lakes in Europe.  I also visited Lough Ennel which is being polluted by phosphates from the sewage treatment plant in Mullingar.  The same thing happened in Lough Derg.</P>
    <P>The State has been negligent over a long period and is only now beginning to come to its senses. The agencies did not bring us to our senses, the angling clubs, sailing clubs and users of Lough Derg did so, but for them the indifference would have continued.  The EPA, local authorities and fishery boards all have responsibility in this area. The ESB has responsibility for salmon.  The Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands is responsible for the wetlands.  This is a nonsense because there is no coherent plan or degree of protection.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point about the 130,000 people who come to this country to fish.  I remember a time when many Americans came to Lough Corrib for weeks.  They would fly to Shannon, hire a car and hire a ghillie for a fortnight.  They were wealthy people who spent large amounts of money.  Such people will go to the Falkland Islands, Russia, New Zealand or wherever the sport is.  They have the money to travel and we should be attracting them here.</P>

    <Title>Budget Statement: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the principal features of the Budget and the proposals of the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for coming to the House.  I know he has just come from the other House where a critical debate is taking place.</P>
      <P>My immediate reaction to the budget is mixed &mdash; it is very rarely that I have mixed reactions to anything.  However in this case I have serious reservations on some scores and welcome it on others.  My first question is who wrote the budget?  Last year it was quite obvious that the budget was written by the Government, politicians and those who had made commitments in the Programme for Government to various constituencies about tax rates and spending.  They were beginning to fulfil a pledge they had made. This year that does not seem so apparent.  It seems the content of the budget is a concession to the social partners and not to the people who elected the Government.  I was somewhat surprised to see the fleeting reaction just now on television of IBEC and ICTU, which appear to welcome the budget.  When both IBEC and ICTU welcome a budget one should be somewhat suspicious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> The Government has not reduced tax rates as it so loudly promised in the Programme for Government and so loudly promised and fulfilled last year.  There has been a complete change in emphasis from reducing tax rates to a radical change in the method of estimating people's tax liability and giving people tax allowances.  It is very definitely true that in this case the tax focus of the budget is on the lower paid.  I am not sure whether this is a good or bad thing, but it is not the purpose or promise made by the Government. What has happened is that the Minister has conceded to the trade unions mostly, which have pushed very hard for concessions for the medium and lower paid at the expense of everybody else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The rich in other words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>As a result the top rate of tax was not reduced which is a concession to the unions, IBEC and everybody else.  For the moment we will leave consideration of whether this is a good or bad thing.</P>
      <P>I welcome some of the contents of the budget. The changeover to tax credits is a serious radical rethought.  It is a process of education which will assist people in understanding how they are being taxed when they get used of it and which will be far more equitable in the long term.  This is fine and any move which is so radical should be welcomed. This is the time when we can afford to do this and when people will accept it as they are getting great concessions in the budget.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the £581 million which the Minister is giving away is an enormous sum of money which would have been absolutely unheard of some time ago.  The way the Minister is giving it away is something we were not promised and I suspect it is dictated by other than political considerations, namely, by a consensus which exists among the social partners.  I asked who wrote the budget.  I think the Minister said he would refer energy or green taxes, one of the more radical proposals, to the social partners to allow a consensus emerge on how to implement them.  I do not see why the so-called social partners should tell the Minister the type of tax he should introduce: this is a matter for the people who elect him, his parliamentary party and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sick and tired of hearing Ministers, Ministers of State and everybody else funking issues by saying they will refer matters to the social partners and come up with a result.  Sooner or later the social partners will come up with some sort of result, a consensus which may be very good for them but may not be good for many other people or the country.  While some of the practical tactics and strategy are good, the philosophy behind this is doubtful.  I would have thought this was the time for the Minister to say he was going to help those who are really out of work, who are genuinely poor or disabled and who have real problems of poverty, and to take money from those who can afford it, if it had to <Col N="741" /> be taken &mdash; and that includes those in the upper bracket.</P>
    <P>What we have not got is a radical approach to the really poor and underprivileged members of our society.  We have some piecemeal giving of certain amounts of money where the greatest pressure has been imposed on the Minister.  We do not have initiatives to help the long-term unemployed, the sick or the disabled.  There are small amounts of money being distributed in this area, such as £1 million for a homeless shelter in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Thankfully we have not had the kind of political gestures with football grounds that we had last year.  However, this budget would have been an opportunity to attack queues in the health service or the serious problems among those who are rightly identified as marginalised while others move ahead in a prosperous economy.  That has not happened.  Those who are already in positions of some strength are being strengthened further, though I say this with some qualifications.  A large number of vested interests, because they are so well represented on IBEC, ICTU, the IFA and other bodies, will certainly welcome the budget as there is something in it for everybody who is benefiting from the economy.  The problem is that it is very easy to introduce a budget like this, which gives a little bit all round, when one is very prosperous, but there is no foresight for the day when we cannot afford to pay these sorts of sums any longer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's agreement to put over £900 million towards the national debt.  That is a tremendously commendable gesture, as he could have done other things with that money.  He could have spent it recklessly on infrastructure or other pet projects, but he has not.  However, it would have been very courageous of the Minister to say that we now have people who are privileged, secure and well paid at the upper level of society and that there is now an opportunity to tackle the problem there.  I refer unapologetically to public service pay.</P>
    <P>This would have been the day to introduce a public service pay freeze and to say &ldquo;no more&rdquo; to these people.  They have secure pensions and are secure for many years to come.  I refer to the teachers and all those who surround them.  Those are the people who have benefited more than anyone in a permanent way from the Celtic tiger. This was the day to say we are looking after those who do not have that security and that those who have it are going to pay the price.  The structural problems in public service pay is a problem we have, as is the underlying problem of increased pay.  The Minister said virtually nothing about that.  He referred to it at the beginning of his speech when he said, in a very general way, that he was aware of the problems of pay and that those could not go on.  However, he went on to keep just within his target of 4 per cent current expenditure, which to me is very high anyway.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="742" /> This budget has many aspects we can all welcome; its radical approach to taxation is brave. However, it is a missed opportunity to tackle public expenditure.  There is no particular effort to do that.  The structural problems we have in the public service will come back to haunt us.  It is very easy to spend money these days and to keep vested interests happy, as this budget has done. However, people will find that this is the first budget written by the social partners not the Department of Finance or the Minister in question.</P>

      <P>I will begin with a healthily negative point. Spending £1 billion on the national debt was put very well by a person who discussed this with me recently.  What would you do if you had £2,000 to pay off your mortgage and you also wanted to have a hip operation?  Would you pay off the mortgage and hobble around or would you have the hip operation?  Most people would choose the latter.  We have missed an opportunity to reinvest that £1 billion.  I have felt for a long time that the additional money should be used for infrastructure.</P>

      <P>The £1 billion would be better spent on the roads to Dingle and Killybegs so that we can get our fish to the continent quickly.  It should be spent on the rail line to Tralee, Westport, Sligo and elsewhere as well as the roads in many parts of the country.  A dip will come in the economy and we will need our infrastructure to claw our way back out of it.  That is where I <Col N="743" /> wanted the money spent.  The Minister found it useful to pay off debts, and I suppose that is something we all face at some stage.</P>
      <P>However, ten years ago &mdash; I speak directly to Senator Ross &mdash; when we started out on this process of social partnership which is so despised by the Senator, our debt-GNP ratio was 127 per cent, if not more.  It is now in the low fifties.  We have the lowest debt-GNP ration of any European state, and we could have kept our money and invested it more wisely in primary education, health or infrastructure instead of paying off £1 billion of the £26 billion or £27 billion we owe to people we do not even know.</P>
      <P>One thing the Minister has done in this budget is to redress some of the imbalance in last year's budget.  That imbalance was going very much towards the rich.  I have said in the last two months that it would be good if, after the budget, people earning £100 a week or less did not have to pay tax or, at least, did not have to pay tax on the first £100 of their income.  That has been achieved, and it was the view of IBEC and the ICTU.  It was an important thing to deliver.</P>
      <P>When Senator Ross asks at whose expense these changes are being made it is, unfortunately, at the expense of the rich, which is sad, and all of us will grieve about that.  The social partners are the employers' confederation and industry, the trade unions and their members, farming groups and the voluntary and community pillar.  Who is not represented in that group?  Some 95 to 97 per cent of the population is represented.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements for the elderly. Tax credits are an important move forward.  The Minister has increased allowances and standard rated them, and they will be called tax credits in next year's budget.  He has done so in a way which effectively has not cost money.  Whereas those of us who are on the higher rate of taxation may lose out on standard rating, the increase in the PAYE allowance from £800 to £1,000 will be available at the standard rate as opposed to the higher rate which is the case currently.  Those of us who pay the higher rate lose out but are compensated by an increase of £4,000 in the lower tax band.  People who pay the higher tax rate are no worse off and those on the lower rate are significantly better off.</P>
      <P>However, PAYE was introduced to compensate those who pay as they earn as opposed to those who pay at the end of the year.  The increase in the allowance is not welcome because it has eroded that advantage.  The widening of the lower tax band in order to compensate for the reduction in the effective amount of the PAYE allowance will benefit the self-employed.  Therefore, the value of the so-called positive gesture regarding PAYE allowance has been eliminated. People do not lose out in terms of the allowance but in terms of the balance of money collected and what they pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find the proposals on corporation tax hard to accept.  The happenings in the banks have been <Col N="744" /> debated in this House, the Lower House and throughout the news media.  I have not had time to calculate the figures.  What is the value of the gift given to the banks in these proposals?  It must be as much as we might hope to take back from them if the current investigations relating to them bear fruit.  It has been neutralised by the budget and the banks have been given back anything that will be taken from them.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the Minister's commitment to social partnership in issues such as child care.  He is in discussions with people involved on how it should best be dealt with.  I welcome the reduction in off course betting from 10 to 5 per cent.  If that had not been done, it could have wrecked the bookmaking industry because people are able to place bets outside the State.  I regret that the levels of BES for individual investors were not increased as sought by many interest groups.</P>
    <P>This is a budget that more or less balances itself.  It has shown the Government's commitment to social partnership in a year which is crucially important.  I regret the marginal recognition of the role of the PAYE sector, which is being eroded, but I welcome the move towards tax credits. It is wise of the Government to try not to do it too quickly but we will not be happy about what has been done for the banks and self-employed, who have gotten a better deal than PAYE workers.  Nonetheless, the lower paid and the elderly have done well.  These are measures of social inclusion which it would be wrong not to welcome.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate on budget day.  We are facing the new millennium as a proud nation. Since independence successive Governments have nurtured the economy with care and dedication. All of us can recall the past dark days of the economy when Fianna Fáil-led Governments had to take drastic measures to bring it back on track.  Unpopular decisions had to be taken at that time and this did not win votes, but those efforts were carried on by successive Governments and have reshaped the entire economic position of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance rewarded all of us today for the efforts made in the past.  We are making rapid progress in reducing the national debt and the unemployment statistics are evidence of this progress.  We have seen the most drastic reduction in unemployment in more than 20 years.  Interest in Ireland by foreign companies as a place for investment has increased and the economy is being set for the benefit of future generations. It is our responsibility to hand over to our successors a country that is not alone economically sound, but also growing.  Compared to a country similar in size and population in the western world, a standard of living has been achieved which is the envy of other nations.  We can take our place among the nations of the world.  Ireland is the envy of Europe in the way it has handled <Col N="745" /> its economy over the past decade.  We can be proud of our record on all matters of social and economic policy.  A total of 98,000 jobs have been created this year and we must remember the thousands of young people who returned from abroad.  They have taken up employment and enhanced the economy.  Our commitment to education has been to the fore.  Young people have the chance to receive third level education and people enjoy a health service superior to that experienced by those in other countries of similar size and population.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Minister has corrected the imbalance which exists between the PAYE sector and the self-employed.  The budget aims to focus on people with low incomes and to eliminate poverty traps.  It will fundamentally reform the tax system so that people most in need can benefit. People will not pay tax on the first £100 they earn; that is a milestone in tax reform.  The budget will have a bigger impact on everybody's weekly wage packet than any previous one.</P>
    <P>This Fianna Fáil led Government has more than fulfilled its commitments under Partnership 2000.  Pension payments will increase by £6 per week and social welfare personal rates, child benefit and family income support thresholds have been increased.  There is extra cash for improved mental handicap, physical disability, child care and convalescent care for the elderly. More than 80,000 lower paid workers have been taken out of the tax net and £50 million has been set aside for water and sewerage schemes over three years.  There is a £15 million package for farmers and extra unemployment assistance for smallholders.  The Minister is to be complimented on £581 million in income tax relief and levies.</P>
    <P>A sum of £287 million has been allocated for social inclusion measures.  The caring approach of the Minister to the elderly and those in need is very much apparent in the budget.  However, discipline must be maintained in the management of the economy and the public finances so that the success of recent years is continued.  Unrealistic demands for wage increases or improvement in the public services must be avoided, otherwise, we will put at risk the gains of recent years and undermine successful participation in EMU, which is one of the most significant developments since the foundation of the State.  We face into EMU from a position of economic strength, with strong growth, rapid employment creation, low inflation, a balanced budget and a rapidly declining debt ratio.</P>
    <P>The launch of the euro presents us with a historic opportunity to build on the economic and social progress we have achieved over recent years, by promoting accelerated economic convergence and integration of the Irish economy with other EU partners.  The establishment of the euro will yield significant benefits for the Irish economy as part of the wider European economy. A permanently fixed exchange rate will consolidate gains already achieved through the Single Market.  It will enhance overall economic <Col N="746" /> efficiency within the euro area, boosting the sustainable rate of output and employment growth over the medium term.</P>
    <P>The broad national consensus on economic and social policy has underlined our competitiveness. In turn, sound fiscal policies have allowed the Government to reduce taxation and increase spending on key social programmes.  It is essential that budgetary policy remains on track, the consensus remains strong and significant investment is made to support Ireland's future development. I consider this budget a caring one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As an Opposition spokesperson on Finance, discussing the budget or the Finance Bill is about as useful as being a eunuch in a harem, with respect to this hallowed Chamber.  We cannot amend it, effect change or defeat any of the proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When that is required, I will.  It is an area which frustrates me more than many in this Chamber.  Notwithstanding that, much can be said on this and I have only eight minutes to collect my thoughts on a budget delivered less than an hour ago so that somewhat reduces our options.</P>
      <P>The Minster was in a unique position for two reasons.  First, he had a surplus of £1.37 billion to play with.  Never before has a Minister for Finance had that luxury.  Second, there are only four weeks to EMU, when we cede control of our monetary policy to the European Central Bank. Fiscal or budgetary policy will remain our only policy instrument or weapon.  Many questions need to be discussed and debated on this point. For example, if there is a currency crisis in the euro zone, who will be responsible for considering devaluation or revaluation?  Individual countries will have ceded control of that to the European Central Bank, but the European Central Bank would not be responsible in a currency crisis.  The ECOFIN Ministers would be, not all of them but only those who are from the euro zone within the EU.  This area needs teasing out and talking about.  I presume we will have a further opportunity when discussing the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Last week's Book of Estimates and today's budget could end up as an inflationary package. We need more reassurance that the Minister has his finger on this concern.  Five hundred and eighty-one million pounds were given away in tax today and there was an £1,000 million increase in spending &mdash; in round figures &mdash; in the Book of Estimates.  That is approximately 8 per cent year on year.  Taken with the decrease in interest rates, this could add up to a very inflationary package.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week's Book of Estimates showed no evidence of a need to prioritise public spending on specific funding programmes.  We should cut back on some and increase others where the need is <Col N="747" /> evident.  There was no evidence from the Minister that he understood that.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's policy has been to urge the Minister to counter inflation in many ways, one of which he conceded today.  I welcome the raising of the ceiling on contributions to private pension funds which will help soak up consumer demand for spending.  It is another option, rather than buying property and general investment in that area.  We welcome the raising of the ceiling on contributions to private pension funds, but we urge the Minster, if there is a privatisation programme in 1999, that the shares be offered to the public and not just institutions.  That would further help to soak up consumer demand and reduce the risk of inflation.  I urge the Minister to consider this seriously.</P>
    <P>There is still a major gap between welfare payment and wages across sectors and we do not have affordable child care.  There are references to discussions between the various interested groups and representative bodies between now and the Finance Bill and the Social Welfare Bill, but we need to know how child care can be made affordable.  That would release many women back into the labour force, particularly in areas where there is currently a shortage.  There are women willing and able with skills and experience, but the lack of affordable child care means they cannot take that option.  We wait with interest for the Minister to deliver on this area, sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>I welcome the income tax package.  The social welfare changes are very disappointing.  There were three major changes in the area of income tax.  The whole allowance area was standard rated and I welcome the increase in the bands and personal allowances.  However it is game ball and what is given with one hand is taken back with the other.  Those involved will not be better off; I do not think they will be worse off.  I hope I am right in assuming that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Levies have been fiddled around with; there is an 0.25 per cent reduction in the total, and the full 2 per cent now goes on the health levy.  The move towards tax credits is extremely welcome, as is the fact that no one earning under £100 a week will pay any tax.  Our corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent is under pressure from ECOFIN. I hope the Minister is strong enough to hold out and that commitments given will be honoured. Lafontaine is applying a lot of pressure in this area and it is a cornerstone of our economic policy.</P>
    <P>The £6 for an old age pensioner is paltry with a £1.3 billion surplus.  There will be great criticism in this area, so much for social inclusion and reducing poverty in our community.  The Minister had an opportunity like no other Minister to do something serious about that.  Increases of £3 and £4 in child benefit are paltry.  There was an increase of £2 for an adult dependant allowance for those on social welfare, and we talk of social inclusion.  Let us at least be honest about what <Col N="748" /> we are talking about.  As my colleague, Deputy Noonan stated, an old person receives the £6 increase, but £2.50 of that goes on inflation and if he or she is ill and does not have a medical card, another £2.50 goes on drugs as the drug refund scheme has been increased by £12 a month.  Effectively £5 of the £6 has been taken from many old age pensioners.  They are left with a real net increase on the old-age pension of £1 over and above inflation and health care costs. That is not very generous given the huge budget and Exchequer surplus this Minister had.</P>

      <P>What about ODA and the war on poverty abroad?  They have ignored the war on poverty at home.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, threatened to resign and then did not.  A sum of £300,000 was given to Honduras in the midst of the crisis there in recent weeks and, insult of all insults, we are told that there is £1.3 million left over in the ODA Vote at the end of this year. The Minster effectively misled the House in the shenanigans last week.</P>

      <P>There is nothing for the farmers in this budget from the Minister who accused them of hyping up their problem.  I tell the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to get real and understand that there are poor farmers as well as wealthy farmers but there are far more poor farmers and it is they we are concerned about.  They are promised a revamped farmers' dole sometime next April.  That is paltry given the tragedy in the farming community among the vast majority of farmers, particularly dry stock farmers, and the year they have had.</P>
      <P>There is only £8 million for waiting lists, yet the drug refund scheme will increase the Minister's health budget by £20 million.  I broadly welcome the income tax changes, but the health and social welfare areas are a major disappointment from a Minister who had more than any other Minister to address the war on poverty and the lack of social inclusion in our community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to address the Seanad on the 1999 budget, which the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has just finished delivering in Dáil <Col N="749" /> Éireann.  While Senators are now aware of the main contents of the Financial Statement delivered by the Minister, I am certain they will welcome the opportunity to comment on it.  Budgets do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; they are influenced both by the condition of the Irish economy and by what is going on in the European and world economy.  I, therefore, intend to begin my statement by outlining briefly what sort of year the Irish economy has had in 1998 and what is expected to happen in 1999.</P>
      <P>This is the fifth year in succession the Irish economy has experienced strong growth in both GNP and GDP.  In 1998 GDP is expected to increase by 9.5 per cent and GNP to increase by nearly 8.5 per cent.  Employment growth is continuing strongly in 1998 and the general Government budget balance was in surplus in 1998, close to 2 per cent of GDP.  While the reasons for the strong growth in the Irish economy have been widely debated, there is a general consensus that the following have contributed to this performance: the continued prudent management of the economy which has led to lower interest rates and increased investor and consumer confidence; the consensus approach in successive national agreements with the social partners; the reduction in the debt burden; investment in education and training; strong foreign direct investment; the contribution of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds and reform of tax regimes for individuals and business.</P>
      <P>However, I sound a note of caution.  The performance of our economy has given rise to heightened expectations of what the Government can achieve.  This is reflected in the level of demands for additional expenditure measures and also in the demands for tax cuts and extra tax reliefs.  In addition, the performance of the Irish economy is generating certain pressures which, if not dealt with properly, could undermine the recent excellent performance of the economy. These pressures include public sector pay, the tightness of the labour market, increasing house prices, less transfers from the EU in future, the need for further infrastructural investment, slower labour force growth and increased competition both in general and for foreign direct investment.  While I am confident we can overcome any problems that emerge in the Irish economy, this can only be achieved if we all pull together rather than in separate directions.  We need to ensure we have sufficient resources to meet any challenges in the future, whatever their cause.  The conclusions to be drawn from this are clear &mdash; we need to adopt more ambitious budgetary targets than have been achieved over the last decade so that we can address our longer term needs from a position of financial strength.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of taxation and expenditure measures announced by the Minister for Finance, the targets for the 1999 budget are a current budget surplus in excess of almost £2.3 billion; a capital deficit of over £1.4 billion; an Exchequer surplus of £925 million; and a general Government <Col N="750" /> surplus of 1.7 per cent of GDP.  Control of public spending and public sector pay will be central to the achievement of the budgetary targets. The Government is committed to ensuring that, over the lifetime of the Government, the growth in net current expenditure will be limited to an annual average increase of 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>For the remainder of my statement, I intend to concentrate on the main aims and achievements of the budget.  The social inclusion measures are designed to build on what has been committed in recent years.  Partnership 2000 committed the Government to spending £525 million over three years for current spending on social inclusion. The actual amount that has been committed over three years will be close to £1 billion.  This shows yet again this Government's commitment to ensuring that all parts of society can benefit from the continued strong performance of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The major social inclusion measures include the following.  In general, personal rates of social welfare payments will be increased by £3 per week.  The dependants' allowance will increase by £2 per week.  Additional increases are being provided for personal rates for those in receipt of short-term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowances, thereby bringing social welfare rates for all categories up to at least the minimum level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, which I think will be warmly welcomed by everyone in both Houses.</P>
    <P>This year, the personal rate of pensions and related payments is being increased by £6 per week.  This follows the significant increases announced last year.  We are also increasing the rate of the adult dependants' payment by a further £3 per week.  These increases again go a long way towards meeting our promises to the older members of our community.  Child benefit will increase by £3 per month for the first and second child, and by £4 per month for the third and each subsequent child.</P>
    <P>The carers' scheme is being considerably improved.  An extra £200 is being paid each year to recipients as a contribution towards respite care.  The scheme is being widened to cover the carers of children in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance.  The residency conditions will be relaxed, as will the requirement that the carer must provide full-time care and attention.  The family income supplement income thresholds will be increased by £8 per week.  A new scheme of unemployment assistance will be introduced for low income farmers.  It will have child related income disregards and will assess other income at 80 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to reducing the burden of personal taxation.  This is being done to reward effort and improve the incentives to work.  Including the personal tax package of £581 million announced today, so warmly welcomed by Senator Ross, the total amount provided for reducing personal taxation in the last three years is nearly £1,500 million, a significant <Col N="751" /> improvement on the Partnership 2000 commitment of £900 million.</P>
    <P>The major taxation items in the budget included the following.  After careful consideration of the matter, the Government has decided to move towards a tax credit system.  This year this will involve the standard rating of the basic single and married personal allowances and the PAYE allowance.  To ensure there are no losers from the move to standard rating, the standard rate income tax bands are being increased from £10,000 to £14,000 for a single person, and from £20,000 to £28,000 for a married couple.  The new standard rated personal allowance for the single person will be increased by £1,050, from £3,150 to £4,200 per annum, and by £2,100, from £6,300 to £8,400 per annum, for married couples.  The standard rated PAYE allowance will be increased from £800 to £1,000.</P>
    <P>The effect of these changes will be, among other things, to ensure that single people on PAYE will not pay income tax on any earnings under £100 per week.  Again, I think all Members of both Houses will welcome this achievement.  It means almost 80,000 people will be removed from the tax net and the number of people on the marginal rate tax system facing a marginal rate of tax of 40 per cent will fall from just over 82,000 to just under 24,000, a considerable reduction.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing personal rates of the old age pension by a further significant amount, the tax exemption limits for those people aged 65 years of age and over are being unified and substantially increased to £6,500 per annum for single people and to £13,000 per annum for married couples.  This will mean married couples aged 65 or over will be exempt from income tax on income up to £250 per week, a tremendous step forward.</P>
    <P>The blind persons' allowance is being increased and will continue to be available for a qualifying person at the marginal rate of taxation.  Where a taxpayer or his or her spouse is blind, the allowance is being increased from £1,000 to £1,500 per annum.  For married couples where both spouses are blind, the allowance is being increased from £2,000 to £3,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The Government is conscious of the growing wish for a recognition of child care needs in the tax system.  The question of child care tax relief raises important and complex issues.  The Government has discussed this area in some detail and proposes to examine the matter further.  In doing so it will take into consideration the recommendations of the Partnership 2000 working group on child care, which is expected to finalise its report shortly.  We anxiously await the report.  As a means of facilitating and encouraging the supply of child care facilities, the Government has decided that the provision of certain créche facilities by employers will not be subject to a charge of income tax in the hands of employees as a benefit-in-kind.  Furthermore, the Finance Bill will provide for capital allowances <Col N="752" /> to allow for the write off of capital expenditure incurred in connection with buildings or premises constructed or used by employers to provide child care facilities for their staff.  This capital allowances regime will also extend to providers of child care services generally in the community.</P>
    <P>The Government has also decided that the position of those families providing care in the home for a member of the family should be addressed by extending the existing employment of a carer tax allowance.  This tax relief, which applies at the taxpayer's marginal rate for expenses up to £8,500 per annum, will be claimable from April next by other family members who employ a carer to look after a totally incapacitated family member.  This extension will widen significantly the scope of the relief.</P>
    <P>The existing general 25 per cent stock relief for farmers and the special incentive stock relief of 100 per cent for certain young trained farmers are being extended for a further two years to 5 April 2001.  I met representatives of Macra na Feirme and I am sure this move will be warmly welcomed because they were very concerned about this issue for young farmers.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to reducing the corporation tax rate to 12.5 per cent on trading income and to 25 per cent on non-trading income from 1 January 2003.  This year the standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced from 32 per cent to 28 per cent.  The lower 25 per cent rate will remain unchanged but will apply to the first £100,000 of profits rather than the current £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Government has also announced that the standard rate of corporation tax will be reduced by 4 per cent in each of the years 2000, 2001, 2002 and by 3.5 per cent in 2003 to give a standard rate of 12.5 per cent.  I was surprised at Senator Ross's questioning in this regard because the move towards a single rate of 12.5 per cent had been flagged for some time.  I am sure the Senator will agree that this is essential to underpin the economy.</P>

However, in the interests of encouraging people to use public transport rather than cars, it has been decided to exempt from taxation the benefit in kind on monthly or annual <Col N="753" /> travel passes received by employees from their employers.</P>
    <P>The business expansion scheme is being extended for a further two years to 5 April 2001. The limit of £250,000 on the aggregate amount that a company can raise is being retained.  This extension also applies to the seed capital scheme.</P>
    <P>To assist with the provision of student accommodation, it has been decided to continue, for a limited period, section 23 relief for rented accommodation to cover the provision of residences for third level students.  The accommodation must be located on or near campus facilities.</P>
    <P>Vehicle registration tax is being amended in the case of category A cars.  The number of bands for category A cars is being increased from the current two bands to three bands and some of the VTR rates on these bands are being increased. There is no increase in the rate of VTR for cars with an engine capacity up to 1400ccs.  The rates for cars between 1401 and 2000ccs are being increased by 2.5 per cent to 25 per cent.  A new third category for cars with an engine capacity of 2001ccs plus will now have a rate of 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senators will agree that the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is innovative.  Senators will also agree that the effect of this budget has been to focus the improvements on the disadvantaged and the low paid.  These changes, in particular the tax changes, have improved the incentives to work.  I am satisfied that the budget is prudent and will help us to meet any future challenges.  I commend the budget to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the debate and the Minister. I have decided to focus on three areas in the budget.  Having watched an ice skating competition on television some time ago, I have decided to give marks out of ten to the measures in each area.</P>
      <P>I was asked to contribute to a radio programme earlier this week and to outline what I thought the Minister should do in the budget.  I said I wanted his decisions to help the lower paid.  I also wanted him to focus on educational disadvantage and I wanted to know how he would make the company taxation move to 12.5 per cent work.  I feel I am being churlish in picking three areas because the budget contains many good provisions. The Minister has given away many goodies and the budget contains much that is good. Few people would quarrel with any of the spending plans or reliefs proposed by him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the issue is whether the budget meets the three priorities which should be addressed if one takes the longer rather than the shorter term view.  The first aspect relates to the lower paid.  I have difficulty explaining to people that certain jobs do not exist if they cost too much.  I feel I am defending low pay, but I drove past three self-service garages recently.  Customers will not pay extra to have their cars filled with petrol by somebody else.  The garages decide that the cost of employing somebody to fill tanks with petrol is <Col N="754" /> too much and they switch to self-service.  Therefore, those jobs do not exist.</P>
    <P>Minimum pay is fine but it does not coax people into work.  An increased wage does not apply because the jobs do not exist.  Therefore, we must ensure that the unemployed are coaxed into work by creating an attractive gap between what they would receive in social welfare payments and their wages when they are employed. The budget does not go far enough in terms of opening up a real gap between what a person receives in social welfare and from a basic low paid job.  I have always had difficulty trying to convince people that many jobs only exist at certain rates of pay.  Over a certain point, employers cannot afford to employ people.</P>
    <P>We must grasp this notion because jobs are required for the hard core of the unemployed who will never acquire highly valued skills.  These people will be always lower paid because they do not have such skills.  The first £6,000 should be free of tax and PRSI and the next £4,000 should be taxed at 10 per cent so that a single person would not reach the basic rate until he or she earned over £10,000 or a married couple over £20,000.  The budget proposes a higher threshold than £6,000.  That is fine but people are immediately on the full basic 24 per cent tax rate with PRSI bringing the total to over 30 per cent.  Until the threshold for the basic rate is brought up to £10,000, or £200 a week, for a single person, the unemployed will not be given a fair chance. Employers cannot create the jobs these people need and people will not have an incentive to take them.  Therefore, I only give the Minister for Finance four out of ten marks for his measures in this area.</P>
    <P>In the long term education is the only way to ensure that everybody takes part in the thriving economy which we hope will continue.  This is why educational disadvantage is critical.  The current system fails one in six children.  The budget does not show an awareness that dealing with educational disadvantage will need massive investment.  This investment must span not only education but the areas of social welfare, health, justice and others.  It is a community wide issue; it does not only involve schools and teachers.  The £19 million figure is a mere drop in the bucket.  It is unfortunate the Government has not used this time of relative prosperity to make a decisive start on this problem.  The Minister has taken some steps but on the issue of educational disadvantage I am giving him a score of three out of ten.</P>
    <P>The third issue on which I am focusing is company taxation.  I agree with Senator O'Toole on this issue.  The Government plans to reduce company taxation to 12.5 per cent over five years.  It had a choice of methods to do that and I believe it chose the wrong one.  It decided to lob off 4 per cent each year for everyone.  I believe it should have considered the entire raft of companies from big to small and opted to reduce the smallest companies <Col N="755" /> to 12.5 per cent immediately and carry on each year on a staggered basis.  The advantage of that would be that big companies would not reap benefits until the last year.  I am looking at this from a long-term point of view; jobs will come from small companies employing a small number of extra people.  On this issue, my score is zero out of ten.</P>
    <P>By my three measurements, the Minister has only done moderately well.  I stated that nobody would quarrel with the fact the Minister has given handouts in this budget and has done some things well.  When we look back at this budget in years to come we will recognise that, although it did many good things, opportunities were lost in the three specific areas I have outlined.  I regret the Minister was not brave enough to focus on these specific areas which would benefit the nation in the long term rather than spreading the benefits across a large number of people now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It will hardly come as any surprise that I do not agree with Senator Quinn; I give him <i>nulle points.</i>  I agree with some of his observations but not with his overall ratings.  This is one of the most radical and reforming budgets introduced in Dáil Éireann in many years.  In recent budgets, we have seen incrementalism and caution but no radical views on taxes and the manner in which the State's finances should be managed.</P>
      <P>The introduction of tax credits marks a fundamental shift in the manner tax will be levied in this State and ensures that by providing allowances at the standard rate, people who enter at the 24 per cent rate receive the same benefits in regard to allowances as people on higher rates of tax.  There was a considerable difficulty associated with that; to ensure he catered for people at the lower end of the scale, the Minister had to be careful not to penalise those at the upper end. That could have happened had the Minister not expanded the tax bands significantly, thereby squaring the circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not go into the details of the allowances and tax bands as they have been comprehensively explained and are on the record of the House. The Progressive Democrats was the only party to include the idea of tax credits in its manifesto prior to the last election.  The idea of tax credits was derided as a way to proceed by the prophets of doom in much the same manner they stated the reduction of personal income tax rates would reduce State revenue and would result in services being cut.  A few years ago, very few people would have argued that by cutting personal taxes revenue would be increased.  I heard the prophets of doom again this evening stating that this budget might have an inflationary effect.  They said exactly the same thing 12 months ago when the higher and lower tax rates were reduced by 2 per cent.  Yet, inflation has stabilised and fallen. The professional economic pundits never seem to be scrutinised on their prophecies 12 months after <Col N="756" /> making them.  Politicians, quite rightly, are frequently held accountable for comments made in the past and professional economists should also be held accountable.</P>
    <P>It was stated earlier this evening that European central bankers would be very unhappy with this budget.  I welcome that; the more the European central bankers are displeased the better.  The point which needs to be emphasised about this budget is that the best way to combat poverty and to assist people locked in social welfare is to offer them a job.  In that respect, I agree 100 per cent with Senator Quinn.  By ensuring no single person in this country earning less than £100 per week will have to pay any tax, we are creating the incentive to ensure people at the lower end of the scale take up jobs.  I know of people in my own area in garages, bars, farms and so on who cannot get people to work for them.  People are only prepared to work if they get a certain amount of cash into their hands.  There is a wholly unacceptable way to widen this wedge and it is to reduce social welfare payments and increase allowances.  I do not believe anyone would advocate such a measure.  The Minister is moving us towards a position where it makes absolute sense for people to take up jobs.</P>
    <P>There are 93,000 more people in the workforce now than there were 12 months ago.  Almost 1.5 million people are working in Ireland and there is net immigration for the first time.  That is a measure of the success of the economy, success for which successive Governments can take credit. This budget will accelerate that success and ensure the benefits of growth continue to accrue to those who require it.  Pensioners received an extra £5 per week in last year's budget and £6 per week this year.  That is more than previous Governments gave over several years.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if we could work out the Opposition's policies.  Before the general election the Fine Gael Party advocated cutting tax rates. Now the Fine Gael Leader says they should not be cut and we should deal with them by way of allowances and bands.</P>

      <P>I am very glad Senator Costello has intervened at this juncture because he can explain why the Labour Party when in power reduced income tax rates by 1 per cent over the lifetime of the Government.

      <P>Last week we had the latter day conversion of the Leader of the Labour Party.  He previously told us that we could not cut tax rates because it would be anti-social, etc.  Today he advocated the reduction of the higher rate from 46 per cent to 42 per cent.  He has forgotten the old tax bands and allowances argument.  We do not know what the Democratic Left Party want. They probably want to introduce more taxes but we will see what happens when they coalesce with the Labour Party and whether it is the president or the leader who is speaking on behalf of the party.</P>
      <P>This budget takes 80,000 people out of the tax net.  It ensures that a single person earning less than £100 per week does not have to pay tax.  It gives pensioners an extra £6 per week.  It ensures that 15,000 older people will come out of the tax net.  The Minister for Finance has also increased child benefit and provided a carer's allowance of £200 to contribute towards respite care.  From a tax point of view this is the most radical and reforming budget we have seen in a generation and for that the Minister is to be congratulated.</P>

      <P>This budget was an opportunity of a lifetime for any Government because of a <Col N="758" /> surplus of £1.4 billion.  I am afraid the Minister for Finance did take a gamble but he did not do a good job of it.  I do not know what his record is like on the race track but his track record in the Dáil has not been great.  It is a lost opportunity for a number of reasons.  The long-term unemployed received an increase of £3 which is level with inflation.  With all the money in the Exchequer the 210,000 long-term unemployed will consider they have had a miserly throw of the dice from this gambling Minister in relation to the return he has given them.</P>
      <P>The Minister provided a tax threshold of £100. Unemployed people would love to have £100 in their pockets but they only receive around £75. He should have been more generous to unemployed people as we approach Christmas.</P>
      <P>With regard child care concessions, there is nothing for parents who are working or in receipt of social welfare.  The Minister said he would examine this in the future when more study had taken place on the matter but parents are begging for some strategy on child care assistance to be put in place, tax relief on the other hand and financial concession for welfare recipients on the other.</P>
      <P>The Minister has directed a lot of attention to carers but he still is not allowing any concession for existing social welfare recipients.  A person in receipt of social welfare cannot become a carer and get a social welfare allowance.  There should have been a graduated level of benefit on top of the social welfare allowance for social welfare recipients who care for elderly parents, relatives, the disabled or handicapped.  The Minister will not allow people from outside or adjacent to the family home to receive the carer's allowance.  I do not see why we cannot allow friends and neighbours willing to care for people to receive the carer's allowance.  It would be much better than putting them into homes and other institutions where they will not receive the same level of care.  This was an opportunity for the Minister to do that but he did not take advantage of it.</P>
      <P>A miserly £8 million extra has been provided for hospital waiting lists.  There are over 40,000 people on waiting lists and this figure is growing every day.  The Minister for Health and Children had already saved £32 million on last year's budget and he will continue to make savings.  I will wait to see what impact is made on reducing waiting lists in the months to come.</P>
      <P>Nothing has been done for education in this budget.  Education is still a major problem.  We talk about a wonderful education system but it is not all inclusive.  There are massive areas of educational disadvantage.  What has the Minister done to resolve this issue?  What has he done for special needs?  Despite a Supreme Court judgment the severely handicapped do not feature in the new education Bill or the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is only a miserly £3 increase in child benefit.  Child benefit would be of great advantage in keeping children in school and parents would be better able to deal with them in the <Col N="759" /> home.  We expected some vision in this respect in relation to education and putting together a strategy to deal with educational disadvantage. However, no money has been earmarked for educational disadvantage in the budget.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing, we are only getting another miserly 600 new starts even though we have a housing crisis and house prices are spiralling at an enormous rate.  The Minister has given us more tax incentives rather than cutting them back.  He has also extended the period for which tax incentives will be operational and this will attract more speculators into the market rather than young couples trying to buy their own homes.  That is not the way to go about it and this problem will get out of hand.  He has dealt with neither public housing nor private housing.  This is a very unimaginative budget in that respect and this measure will fuel inflation.</P>
    <P>Betting is the Minister's hobby horse and he has reduced off-course betting by 50 per cent.  He has also made a prudent provision of £24 million in a full year for the cost of the reduction in off-course betting and he expects this will be a saving. It will not be a saving because it will cost the Exchequer for the Minister to enjoy his off-track and off-course betting.</P>
    <P>It has been policy to have a gradual reduction in corporation tax.  The standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced from 38 per cent to 32 per cent.  However, while doing that we are providing enormous financial benefits to the corporate sector.  We must devise a strategy to create clawbacks which will benefit society.  There is no social dimension here, despite the wonderful opportunity available to the Minister.  When the standard rate is reduced to 12.5 per cent, will he hand all the money involved back to the banks, even though they are making a fortune, and get nothing in return?  He has not given any indication of his plans in this regard, other than to mention them.</P>

      <P>Last Thursday we debated overseas development aid.  I was not fooled by what the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs put before us.  The link between increasing aid contributions and increasing wealth in the economy was broken.  We were told that we were now too rich to meet our commitments having had years of being told we were too poor.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State accepted increases over the next three years well below the level of GNP. She abandoned the commitment made by her party and her partners in Government a month after she had threatened to resign if the Government did not increase in the budget next year allocation for overseas development aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State now has no option but to do the honourable thing and carry out her threat to resign which she made on 5 November.  She got no support in Cabinet, not even from her party colleagues; and she was fooled by the Minister for Finance.  Despite getting full support from this <Col N="760" /> House, the other House and the overseas development agencies, she has failed.  She made the threat to resign, she must do so now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>It fundamentally reforms the tax system so that people in most need will benefit.  It will have a bigger impact on everybody's weekly wage than any previous budget.  This Fianna Fáil led Government has more than fulfilled its commitments under Partnership 2000.  We have increased weekly pension payments by £6 per week while the thresholds for social welfare personal rates, child benefit and family income supplements will also increase.  There is extra cash for improvements in the areas of mental handicap, physical disability, child care, convalescent care and care for the elderly.  Over 80,000 people will be taken out of the tax net.</P>
      <P>As a member of a Government party I stand in a very difficult position in so far as I am like a visitor to a restaurant where the chef has presented an excellent meal except for one thing. I have difficulty raising this issue, but as a woman Member of the Oireachtas it must be said.  While the budget has done some of the things on childcare recommended by various studies and while it provides that benefit-in-kind will not be applied to subsidised care, and while it has allowed special capital allowances to child care allowances, I agree with those who say it has not addressed the issue properly.  This is not something I am happy about or proud of.  It is the one area in what is otherwise an excellent and caring budget that has not been addressed properly.</P>
      <P>Female participation in the workforce is the challenge for the future.  For many years we have fooled ourselves into believing that men and women in this country are equal.  We have not achieved equality, nor are we close to it.  There is not true equality for either men or women in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Equality means having a freedom of choice and achieving a balance between home and work.  It is a balance between men and women and mothers and fathers.  Many people believe that equality is a women's issue; it is not.  Equality is a men's issue, a family issue, a Government issue and a business issue.  It is only when we accept this that we will make any change in this area. That is our challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to think carefully about next year's budget.  I accept the area of child care is very complex and that the introduction of a measure may take from those who stay at home to look after their children.  I also accept there is a need to recognise the dual roles that are carried out &mdash; the women who stay at home to look after their children and the women who work and need <Col N="761" /> to pay for child care.  Ultimately, it is women who pay for child care most of the time.</P>
    <P>The Government needs to address this issue in the near future.  I call on the Minister to think again about this area.  He has compiled a balanced, effective and fair budget.  It is the only area on which the Opposition will criticise and make political points.  It saddens me that this will become a political issue because it is an issue of equality.  I hate to see people using it as a means to criticise the budget.</P>
    <P>This is a strong, fair and equitable budget.  The only problem is that the Government has not tackled properly the issue of child care.  If the Government wishes to address this issue it needs to do so sooner rather than later.  The Minister said he is waiting for the report of the Partnership 2000 working group, which has to be finalised.  I hope the Government will consider the recommendations of the report before the next budget, will implement the changes that are necessary and that something will be done for the women, men and families of Ireland, for society, for employers who need woman to participate in the workforce and for businesses which need us to continue to make our contribution.</P>
    <P>I stand here as a female Member of the Oireachtas.  I do not believe there are enough of us and if more women were involved in all aspects of politics, including women with families, we would be looking at a different emphasis in the budget.  We would have tackled this issue head on with courage and would have made further changes in this area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was smiling to myself when conjuring up the image of the Minister for Finance skipping along as he whistles a happy tune.  The closing remarks of his Budget Statement referred to what we might do regarding the rainy day. However, given what he has done with the betting tax &mdash; I do not disagree with it &mdash; he might be inclined to have another flutter.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not specify the amount that will be set aside to reduce the national debt.  I welcome the move to tax credits, although it will not happen for some years.  However, the Minister has taken steps in that direction.  It will make it much easier to target specific assistance through taxation measures.  Given the largess that was available, the budget largely meets expectations.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minster's moves to widen the bands and increase the tax free allowances.  This, of course, is a totally altered course when compared to what he did last year.  I welcome that change of heart because, by going for the widening of bands as opposed to reducing rates, he has adopted the policy of the Opposition parties and the approach taken when the rainbow coalition was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister stated that this budget will remove 80,000 taxpayers from the tax net.  I wish he had raised the threshold to £120 per week and <Col N="762" /> taken out many more.  We must help the lower paid and those starting out in jobs.  The Minister could have done more given the circumstances and the amounts which he had to work with.  I welcome, however, the measures he is taking because it will assist those on lower and middle incomes.</P>
    <P>I am worried about the package for farmers.  It is a case of now you see it, now you do not. Nothing has been specified and we have to wait for the social welfare Bill for 1999 before we see the details of the assistance he proposes to offer to them.  There is no doubt that smallholders, hill sheep farmers in particular, have suffered hugely adverse consequences this year but we have to wait to see what will be done for them.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the increases in child benefit and the measures in relation to child care. The Minister has apparently ignored the advice of the expert working group.  The social welfare increases barely compensate for inflation.  It is not a good budget for the socially excluded.  More than 200,000 people are in this category and they have been offered a pittance.  Pensioners should have received much more than £9 per week per couple.  There is an increase of only £3 per week in old age retirement and invalidity pensions and £2 per week in other social welfare payments. That is an absolute disaster for those who have no other income.</P>
    <P>The increase in the PRSI ceiling for businesses is fine for companies which are profitable but it will greatly increase the bills of all companies. There was an extremely hefty increase in VRT.  I do not welcome the increase from 22.5 per cent to 30 per cent.  I accept the case made for introducing variations but 22.5 per cent was enough for larger cars.</P>
    <P>Given the housing situation and the vast number of people on housing waiting lists, we have been offered very little opportunity for new starts in the coming year.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that we would have a more detailed look at the budget in a week's time and it is probably too early to pass a comprehensive judgment.  Overall, however, I am disappointed with the measures outlined for farmers, particularly the more hard pressed.  We must all be disappointed in the package announced for recipients of social welfare.  The Government has paid lip service to those who are socially excluded. This budget does nothing for them.  I am disappointed for the pensioners.  We must await the details of the social welfare Bill to see how farmers, who are trying desperately hard to eke out an existence on the land, will fare.  There are good measures in this budget and I welcome them but there are areas where much more was expected and nothing was delivered.</P>

The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, arose today in the healthiest financial position of any <Col N="763" /> Minister for Finance in the history of the State. For the first time since 1948, the Minister for Finance was able to introduce a budget with an overall surplus.  There was, however, a greater onus upon him to deliver on this occasion than would have been the case had the State finances been in tatters, and he did deliver.</P>
      <P>He delivered the Government's commitment to Partnership 2000 which should augur well for future national wage agreements.  He delivered a caring budget which brought the socially excluded in from the cold so they could share in the wealth of the economy.  He delivered a radical change to the taxation system by commencing a system of credits to replace allowances.  This will be seen as a more equitable system which will give all taxpayers the same tax deductions.  He acknowledged the contribution of the elderly in the development of our society over the decades leading to the good times which we enjoy today. He realised that it was also pay back time for all categories of the less well off and underprivileged who have suffered through social and educational disadvantage in the past.  All taxpayers will pay less and 80,000 people will be removed from the system.</P>
      <P>The Minister was criticised last year for what I considered to be a very good budget.  One or two issues deflected attention away from the main features of an excellent financial statement.  I hope the Minister will be given full credit this year for what he has done in today's budget. Today's budget was one of social inclusion, where those on low pay will benefit more than those on high pay and the vast bulk of resources were allocated to those on lower and middle income.</P>
      <P>There are those who will consider that the Minister's strategy is dangerous, that no effort was made to dampen the economy and that he is playing a high risk game.  As an accountant by profession, the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has always acted in a prudent manner and I am confident he will not be caught out on this occasion.</P>
      <P>There are those who will suggest that the national debt repayment should have been the Minister's priority.  However, with low interest rates, the cost of servicing the national debt has reduced significantly.  A reduction of £1 billion would only have reduced interest payments by £100 million.  There is a need to make inroads into the debt in the present economic climate but there is a greater need to develop infrastructure for the future.  The Minister has done this with a 27 per cent increase in capital expenditure while keeping the increase in current expenditure at 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>A substantial increase in capital expenditure has been announced in the areas of health, housing &mdash; where there is a £4,500 start this year, an increase of £600 on last year &mdash; water and sewerage schemes, particularly rural group water schemes and roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I particularly welcome the social welfare increases.  An increase of £287 million in a full <Col N="764" /> year is the biggest social welfare package ever introduced.  The £6 increase to pensioners, together with the £5 increase announced last year, amounts to an increase of £11 in two years, or 15 per cent, compared to the miserly increases of previous years.  There is an increase above inflation for other social welfare recipients.  Child benefit allowances have also been increased. Income thresholds for those over 70 years of age will be doubled to determine their eligibility for medical cards.</P>
    <P>There has been a fundamental change in the role of carers.  I welcome the £200 respite payment and the relaxing of the rules in relation to family members acting as carers without having to live in the same household.  The free telephone scheme has been extended to all recipients.  Tax claims for expenses up to £8,500 will be allowable to carers.  That can be shared among different individuals.</P>
    <P>It has been a very difficult year for low income farmers.  The Minister announced his intention to revamp the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme at a cost of £15 million.  I am sure when the details are announced the measure will be welcomed and will be regarded as sufficient for those in need.  The Minister also reintroduced the control of farmyard pollution scheme and the installation aid scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the continued reduction in the rate of corporation tax to 28 per cent so that the Government can achieve its objective of a 12.5 per cent rate by the year 2002.  I welcome the increase in the threshold for the lower rates from £50,000 to £100,000.  This will be eliminated when the 12.5 per cent rate is reached.</P>
    <P>An increase of 9 per cent has been announced in the area of education.  It has been suggested that the previously announced capitation grant income of £10 per pupil is not sufficient.  I remind Members that the present Government increased the capitation fee by 33.5 per cent over the two years it has been in Government and there is more to come.  I welcome the commitment to remedial teachers, particularly the increased funding announced for the Association of Children with Learning Difficulties.  I lobbied the Minister on this matter.  There are 15 workshops throughout the country giving assistance to children who are not receiving proper remedial attention.  A small allocation of funding can greatly assist those who are seriously disadvantaged in the education system.  For the first time ever the Opposition was silenced in the Dáil when the Minister announced the increase of £581 million.  This was not expected.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of today's announcements, particularly the increase in the retirement pension allowance for the self-employed, the rural renewal pilot scheme, which I hope will be extended to other areas, and the tax relief on student accommodation.  Students experienced many difficulties in Dublin this year in this regard.  The measure will also release houses to low paid families who cannot afford new houses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> I welcome the extension of the seaside resort scheme which was to cease in June 1999.</P>
    <P>I support Senator Cox's comments on child care.  However, there have been changes, particularly in relation to benefit-in-kind, and I know the Minister will give the matter serious consideration in the future.</P>
    <P>Changes in VRT are a bit severe given that the Society of the Irish Motor Industry lobbied for a reduction in this area.  While this will mean more income for the State, it will have serious repercussions as a result of a lot more imports of lower quality cars from Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a mixed budget.  I am not partisan or a member of a political party.  I welcome certain aspects in the budget but there are a number of aspects I do not welcome.</P>
      <P>We were hoodwinked regarding the matter of overseas development aid.  Perhaps the Minister was also hoodwinked because she threatened to resign.  If one holds up a bank by producing a gun and one is laughed at, one is more or less obliged to pull the trigger, but the Minister failed to pull the trigger.  There is a moral obligation on the Minister to resign because it is clear there is nothing in the budget for overseas development aid.  We were told to bide our time and note what would happen.  There has been a spectacularly mean cut of 1 per cent.  We were briefed by Trócaire and other aid agencies and held back when we heard what the Minister had to say in this House on the subject of overseas development aid.  Now we find there was nothing in the bag and that this multi-annual budgeting was part of another strategy.  I asked specifically if this meant that our contributions would never decrease because it was expressed as part of GNP.  I wanted to be reassured that if we went into a nosedive we would still keep up our payments and that it would not be used to cap our contributions. This is not the case and it is a mean and despicable cut.</P>
      <P>The Minister should resign, not because she has done anything discreditable but because she has been let down by her colleagues.  She is a good, caring and decent Minister but her colleagues did not play fair with her.  That is most regrettable, particularly when one looks at the economic factors.  Money spent abroad is guaranteed not to create inflationary pressure in the economy. Deputy McCreevy is an extremely decent and amiable man but perhaps he has been infected by this attitude abroad at the moment which is to look after our own first.  This is not very Christian. There is a serious problem regarding overseas development aid.</P>
      <P>I am glad Senator Bonner mentioned lobbying by the Society of the Irish Motor Industry.  I was also lobbied by the society which was looking for a reduction in VRT but instead got an increase. The last line of its statement reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> We have two choices.  We can increase employment and Government revenue and decrease emissions by reducing vehicle registration tax or we can have decreased employment and increased emissions as the used cars from Japan and the UK curve their way to our market.  This is the political and fiscal choice.</P>
    <P>The Government decided against that.</P>
    <P>I have a folder that is as thick as the budget containing statements by different interest groups, which we can discuss in more detail another day.  This is a very serious issue involving all voices.  The Upper House, where there is a less partisan atmosphere, is the correct context in which these voices pleading for a share of the national cake can most effectively be raised.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister has produced a centre for the homeless in Dublin.  I applaud this but it is not the entire answer.  There must be a greater injection into this area.  I know the Minister for State, Deputy Flood, is aware of this because he was involved in this area in the past.  Single men find it impossible to get into these homes.  I met a man I knew years ago in Grafton Street.  He had been a prosperous businessman and fell on hard times.  His principal problem was that he had no place to live.  I met another man who returned to Ireland because he was given the impression that he would get succour and shelter from his family. When they found out he had full blown AIDS they threw him out.  He cannot maintain the correct medical regime in a hostel.  This is not good enough.  We have money in the kitty and this is what we should be spending it on.</P>
    <P>Elderly parents who care for those with mental handicaps are worried.  A woman of 81 years, whose 56 year old moderately handicapped daughter lives with her, said to me &ldquo;I do not want to die until Nora gets placed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We will return to these matters in detail at a later date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should be ashamed of itself for freezing overseas development aid, one of the most disgraceful decisions taken by an Irish Government.  In the 17 years I have been an intermittent Member of this House, I have never seen such a contrast between economic conditions and stinginess.  This shocks people across the political spectrum, whether they are on the Left or the Right.  The only correct response to this is for the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development to resign, which she is honour bound to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us not get too tangled up in percentage increases for people on social welfare.  An increase of £3 or £4 a week is the price of less than two pints in Dublin and just more than the price of 20 cigarettes.  The fact that it is 4.4 per cent is not the point &mdash; the point is that in this affluent society it is a pathetically small increase on a pathetically small income.  We expect a couple on social welfare to live on £115 a week at a time when the Government says the minimum tax free allowance for a single person should be £100 <Col N="767" /> a week.  We are saying a single person needs £100 a week to live on and we are offering a couple on flat rate social welfare just £115.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that we could have done better. We do not need a £1 billion surplus every year. It is correct, prudent and sensible to run a surplus &mdash; I have never had any problems with that &mdash; but we did not need one of that scale.  The scale of the surplus is a measure of the conservatism of this Government and of this budget.  This budget could have revolutionised the way people live but the Government failed gloriously to do that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator is welcome to a couple of minutes of my time if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross and I hope I can reciprocate at some stage.  I welcome the main thrust of the budget.  Despite much of what has been said here, it must be recognised that there is a very significant change in income tax in this budget.  There is a very strong emphasis on increasing the number of people who will not reach the 46 per cent marginal rate of tax until they have a reasonable level of income, which is good in many ways.</P>
      <P>It eliminates many of the poverty traps. However, more importantly, it retains the incentive to work.  Many people who moved onto the high rate of tax at £14,000 or £15,000, particularly single people, were finding it was not worth their while to work.  Given the growth in the economy and the increasing demands for labour, it is imperative there is an incentive to work and that we encourage people to participate in the work force.  This is undoubtedly a step in the right direction.  According to my calculations, the changes in the income tax bands and allowances will give an extra £1,400 or £1,500 to someone earning £19,000 or £20,000, which is what many industrial workers earn.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The Minister might examine before the Finance Bill is debated the £250,000 limit on investment in BSE schemes.  That limit could be increased to the previous limit of £1 million. Many small businesses are finding that, given falling interest rates, the bureaucracy attached to raising £250,000 makes it unattractive to do so. That scheme has worked well, particularly for small businesses, and we should continue to focus much of our emphasis on that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross might refer to the area of special investment accounts.  Given decreasing interest rates, people earning a reasonable standard of income and who are looking for a savings outlet could be directed to the stock market.  If people were attracted to investing in the stock market, it would encourage and develop more business and entrepreneurial flair in our culture generally, which should be welcomed.  The increase from 10 to 20 per cent will make special investment <Col N="768" /> accounts unattractive and I do not see the attraction of choosing that investment route over the stock market.  Unfortunately, it is the people who are just dipping their toe into that area of investment who will be most affected.</P>
    <P>Finally, on a parochial note, I welcome the commemoration initiative in the budget which has made a small start by allocating £200,000.  The John F. Kennedy Trust in New Ross has been mentioned as a body which might benefit from that allocation.  I hope it will benefit from the full amount because it is undertaking a major financial project and has cashflow difficulties at the moment.  This project will have a resonance with all Irish people, particularly the diaspora, many of whose ancestors sailed from these shores in the last century, and who will have an empathy with what is being done in New Ross.  I hope this money will be the first of a number of contributions and it will be welcomed by the members of the John F. Kennedy Trust who have worked so assiduously to bring this very good project to fruition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. It is impossible to give a detailed verdict on the budget immediately afterwards because the calculations and equations are sometimes very difficult to work out, but the thrust of the budget is very easy to distinguish.  All Senators helped to flesh out that process this evening.</P>
      <P>I wish to endorse what Senators Norris, Ryan, Costello and Gallagher said about overseas development aid.  There is a misconception that those who are in favour of what is pejoratively known as fiscal rectitude also feel that spending of all sorts is wrong, which is not the case.  We are talking about human life here, which is the most important thing we will ever be able to give a verdict on or influence.</P>
      <P>When one talks about human life overseas and what is happening in the Third World and in Honduras and Nicaragua, everything else sinks into insignificance by comparison.  These ridiculously sophisticated arguments which come before us about the relative taxation of those in different tax brackets are pleasant academic arguments.  They matter to people, of course, but on the relative scale they are absolutely insignificant when one considers them in the light of the problems of the people in Nicaragua and Honduras.</P>
      <P>It is scandalous that we, as one of the richest countries in Europe &mdash; and who rightly boast and are proud of this richness &mdash; cannot give a decent amount of money to save lives overseas.  That is difficult to understand.  If anyone wants me to, I can suggest umpteen ways we can make cuts in order to do this, if that is what we have to do. Senator Ryan said that, while the national debt needs to be cut, we do not need to cut it by so much.  That is not my view but at least he is making a constructive suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="769" /> There is something particularly wrong about arguing the relative merits of who will be a little bit richer when people are dying.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>And to reduce betting tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly &mdash; such frivolities are unimportant, given the scale of the matters we are speaking about.  It is an issue which has emerged today and to which Members on these benches will return.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister in terms of the national debt.  It is courageous of him and good housekeeping to say that the £900 million left over will go to paying off the debt.  The temptation for any politician, including the Minister for Finance, is to tell Europe to stuff it and to tell the central banks in Europe that for the next two or three years he is going to spend his own money as he feels like it and on getting votes for himself and winning the next general election.  This is the temptation for any Minister.</P>
      <P>In accounting terms it is very easy to produce a surplus.  However, this Minister has produced a surplus and has courageously said he will put it aside.  There may be a political benefit in doing this, but it is not as immediate as that which the Minister would receive if he spent it on immediate injections of funds into projects which would give him support in political terms.  We should congratulate the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have mixed feelings about the budget.  There are very good things in it.  The reduction in corporation tax by 4 per cent each year is particularly commendable and very good for business. On the other hand I do not understand why the Minister was so mealy mouthed about the banks in his Budget Statement.  Senator O'Toole, whom I usually use as a litmus test for these matters &mdash; when he goes one way I know it is wrong and I go the other &mdash; and I agree on the issue of banks. This is an opportunity for the Minister to say the banks have not paid their DIRT&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that he is going to take it from them today.  I cannot understand why this was not done.  I think the pressures being brought to bear on the Minister are not all political.  If politicians in this and the other House from all parties had their way the banks would have been made cough up as they can afford to do so and are getting the benefits of the reduction in corporation tax.  Why were they not made cough up? I suspect &mdash; nobody in the House will agree with me, not that it matters &mdash; it is because corporate Ireland, ICTU and IBEC are much stronger than Members of this House either collectively or individually and that they can put greater pressure on the Minister than democratically elected politicians. There is no other reason the Minister did not clobber the banks.  These institutions are <Col N="770" /> breaking the law.  That was a great disappointment.</P>
      <P>There are other disappointments, including the failure to tackle energy or green taxation.  This is not just an EU issue and the nettle will have to be grasped.  The failure to tackle the problem of property prices and the supply of property, and the inability of young people to buy houses, an issue to which we will return, is also disappointing.</P>
      <P>In summary, there are good and bad things in the budget.  I am very doubtful about its overall philosophy and thrust and am very, very worried about who wrote it.  There are real signs that the budget was written and dictated by those who are not democratically elected.</P>

      <P>It is a pleasure to welcome the Minister.  I know he is a fine and caring Minister and has a very positive response to life.  I remember when we shared a platform on &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; in his home city of Cork there was intelligent agreement between us as he recognised that I am not partisan but rather part of the glorious tradition of total political independence. Tonight I offer the Minister an opportunity to avoid a really terrible situation.  We are often told of the dangers of hindsight and how it is easy to see everything with 20:20 vision when a disaster happens.  I offer the Minister an opportunity to avoid such a tragedy, not as a result of any great personal prescience of mine but because I was contacted by a caring mother who is concerned about her five year old son.</P>
      <P>The matter concerns the problem of buses for special schools and the apparent discrepancy in the regulations between CIE buses and buses hired by CIE to cater for special schools.  CIE buses are governed by various by-laws and are required to have safety belts.  According to my information this appears much more haphazard in the case of buses hired by CIE.  It is possible that a real tragedy might happen where there are no rules to cover a situation or where the rules are not enforced and monitored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special nature of these children, who may have a physical, mental or emotional handicap, makes them particularly vulnerable when being transported.  For example, there was a tragedy on the N11 last September when the driver of a special school bus and two helpers were killed. Mercifully I think none of the children was killed and I am not sure any of them were terribly <Col N="771" /> seriously injured.  It was miraculous that some were not seriously injured.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Five were killed in that accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not realise that.  My understanding was that the only people killed were the driver and two helpers.  I very much regret that the accident was worse than my recollection.  I understand the reason there was not such a high level of injury was because seat belts were in use by at least some of the children.  This is not the case with all such buses.</P>
      <P>According to the direct evidence from the mother of the five year old the issue of seat belts and harnesses is dealt with on a completely <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Although CIE hires buses for special schools, harnessing and insurance on school runs is left to the individual initiative of bus drivers. The situation is very nebulous.  My correspondent has described it as a sort of Celtic mist upon the bog and says that when the inevitable tragedy happens, all will run for cover.  As with many of our previous tribunals, much money will be spent but nobody, miraculously, will be held to blame. Nothing will be heard but the rustling sound of the buck being passed.</P>
      <P>This haunts me.  James Joyce wrote a wonderful story entitled &ldquo;A painful case&rdquo; in which a woman is killed in an accident on the railway at Sydney Parade station.  She became a drunkard as a result of a romantic disappointment.  The end of inquest report says &ldquo;nobody it seems was to blame&rdquo;.  We need to avoid this.</P>
      <P>The mother of the five year old child, whom I believe has Down's syndrome, has seen him struggling around in the bus unrestrained, half naked and trying to climb out the window.  This is terribly dangerous.  Many of these buses do not have helpers to assist the drivers who are left on their own and this adds to the danger.</P>
      <P>In summary there is no mandatory minimum harnessing standard for special school buses.  I think there should be such a requirement.  There is no mandatory level of in-transit supervision, an issue which should also be addressed.  There was a major motorway accident in Britain which led to the issue of harnessing for all school buses being addressed by the British Parliament.  I hope the Minister will tell the House that a tragedy of this magnitude will not be necessary before we act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My correspondent suggests that this is an accident waiting to happen, to use a cliché.  As she says, the only blank space needed on this pre-tragedy report will be the location, and she suggests a number of locations, such as the M50 roundabout, the Walkinstown Cross or the Dublin-Belfast road.  The only things missing are the names of those who could be maimed or injured. It is clear that this Minister is on top of his brief, in tune with the needs of young people and sympathetic to the needs of special children.  We have the capacity now to act before there is a tragedy, <Col N="772" /> and I look forward to the Minister informing the House that he has plans in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this issue.  I have some good news.  The Senator's motion referred to seat belts generally, but the Senator's contribution referred specifically to the present position regarding the provision of harnesses and escorts on buses for special needs children.</P>
      <P>I agree entirely with Senator Norris.  It is an appalling state of affairs that we do not have escorts on special school buses.  There was a pilot scheme two or three years ago which employed approximately 100 escorts which was clearly inadequate. We have situations all over the country where the bus drivers on his or her own with up to 15 children with special needs, such as epilepsy or other behavioural problems, on the bus.  As Senator Norris said, the children can climb halfway out the window in some instances.  It is entirely unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I do not want to engage in passing the buck.  I have a responsibility and I am not prepared to stand over this situation.  The special education section of my Department and I ascertained the need and the cost of dealing comprehensively with this issue.  The estimates of the special education section were that £1.7 million would be required to ensure that buses on every school route involving children with special needs would have an escort and harnesses.  I am glad that that £1.7 million was in today's budget package on social inclusion.  From now on we will be providing the necessary escorts and harnesses for all those schools.  It is not before time.</P>
      <P>The system has worked until now by giving grants to schools to employ escorts, and we will increase the rates for escorts.  Harnesses will be fitted as well; they do not cost that much.  It escapes me how this was allowed to go on over the years; it is a scandalous situation we cannot stand over.  If that does not meet the requirements we will provide the resources to meet those requirements.  Those children are entitled to travel in safety.  I was at the funerals of the five people killed in the Arklow crash, and it was a harrowing experience.  The irony of ironies is that the escort was killed and that there were harnesses. However, it focused minds on all the buses that did not have escorts or harnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding overall safety, Bus Éireann's record is superb, though one does not like to boast about good safety records as one never knows when terrible tragedies will happen.  When routes are examined for suitability for various types of vehicles, all the safety procedures, such as safe set down, turning and pick up points are checked out and selected carefully.  Road conditions, traffic hazards and all other aspects of safety are considered. All school transport vehicles operated by Bus Éireann and private contractors meet all the statutory obligations set down by the Department of the Environment and Local Government and <Col N="773" /> are subject to annual roadworthiness checks.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is conducting a review with my Department that will have implications for certain practices such as having three children for two seats.  There will have to be a further tightening of safety regulations because there are now more people on the road, and the net result is that there is more death and carnage on the road.  Children in buses are at risk because of the increased number of accidents on main roads.</P>
    <P>I assure Senator Norris that we are not taking this issue lightly or complacently.  This initiative was not mentioned in my script because we were ahead of the Department scriptwriters.</P>

      <P>It is on the record now and that is excellent.  I thank the Minister.  This is very good news for the lady who contacted me.  The Minister has done an excellent day's work; he was obviously aware of the situation before we drew it to his attention.  He has justified my confidence and by applying political pressure to get this money allocated, he has saved lives in a particularly vulnerable sector of the community.  I thank him for that.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and I appreciate the fact that the Minister himself is here.  I do not expect him to have as much immediate good news for me as he had for Senator Norris, but if he cannot respond fully to my matter he might examine it in his Department and come back to me as soon as he can.</P>
      <P>I raise the need for the Minister to give greater recognition to substitute teachers who have given long service to the primary education system.  In drafting this motion I did not use the word &ldquo;unqualified&rdquo;; the people expressing their concerns to me in my county may not have a paper qualification, but the fact that they have served the system for 20 to 30 years to the satisfaction of school principals, inspectors, parents and students indicates that they must possess fitness and qualification for the work.  That may not be recognised simply by their having done an accredited course. I raise this matter on their behalf because they have approached me.  I understand they have also written to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not aware of the situation in cities, but in rural areas, such as the counties I represent, these people perform a very important service in the primary education sector, particularly in substituting at short notice in the smaller rural schools. They are employed on a flat rate basis and are paid for the hours the principal employs them, often on a daily basis.  Irrespective of their length of service or the effort they put in, there is no incremental recognition in their rates of pay for their work.  Under part-time workers' legislation they are entitled to the same basic pay as any other part-time worker; there is no <i>pro rata</i><Col N="774" /> recognition of their entitlements compared to full time, fully qualified teachers in the system.  There are no sick pay or pension schemes for them, and because they are not represented by a trade union there is nobody to fight their case.  Their numbers nowadays are not very large, so it would now be financially feasible to look at granting them some recognition.  I spoke to one of these teachers last Saturday, and she was phoned by schools in her parish on three occasions last week between 8 and 8.30 a.m. She got her own children out to school, downed tools, went into classrooms, took over with no notes from either the principal or the absent teacher and did a good day's work, as she has done for the last 25 years.  She can be summoned or dismissed at short notice.</P>
    <P>I recognise the measures the Minister is taking to address the supply problem in primary schools, particularly those taken this year to allow people with qualifications other than the B.Ed. to step in.  However, these people are not always interested in going on a supply panel in rural areas.  The Minister's measures will work in the long term, but the present people will be in the system for some time yet.  Their cases should be examined.</P>
    <P>The proof of the pudding is in the eating.  Parents are very happy with the service provided by these people.  I came across an incident last month where one of the higher diploma graduates came into a school and parents complained that the teacher had never stood in a primary school.  They wanted to know why an individual who lived nearby was not called in as had been the case for ten years because she knew the situation in the school.  Parents, principals and students who have gone through the system are happy with the service from these teachers over the years.</P>
    <P>I am aware that in the past courses were put in place to train these teachers but everybody did not have access to them at the time.  People who attended colleges of education were not entirely happy that the level of qualification imparted on those occasions was commensurate with theirs. Initially, it is not just a matter of qualification. The demand in which those people have been over the years is proof enough of their ability to do the job.  I called one of them this evening and she said that they realise they will not be in the system very long but if they are to leave it, they should go with some decency.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to examine their needs and grant them some recognition.  More recognition is given at post primary level to teachers who step in at short notice and cover classes.  I ask him to examine this situation in the primary sector and try to give these people, who have served the education system well, recognition before their services are dispensed with or they reach retirement age.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to address this House on this matter.  There is no <Col N="775" /> need for equivocation regarding the enormity of the contribution which substitute teachers have made within the primary education system.  The entire primary system might be in danger of grinding to a halt without the commitment and dedication of substitute teachers.  They fill in, often at short notice, for permanent and temporary colleagues who are absent on paid leave, of which sickness and maternity are the two main types.</P>
      <P>Having acknowledged the enormity of the contribution of substitute teachers, I strenuously defend any suggestion that substitute teachers have been treated other than very favourably. The overall terms and conditions of substitute teachers employment are good.  They are paid £70.04 per day and, in addition, they qualify for incremental credit subject to a maximum of two years for substitute service given when appointed to a permanent post.  This means that, as a consequence of doing substitute work, they may be placed on the incremental salary scale at up to two points higher than they might otherwise have been entitled.  That obviously does not relate to those referred to by the Senator but it relates to many substitute teachers who eventually enter full-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also introduced a scheme of holiday pay for substitute teachers with effect from 1 September 1998.  In accordance with this scheme, substitute teachers who work for more than 175 days in any school year are entitled to receive a maximum of 15 days paid holidays.  There are <i>pro rata</i> entitlements for teachers who work lesser periods.  Likewise, substitute teachers now also have title to pay for public holidays.  Thus, substitute teachers <Col N="776" /> who work for 40 hours within the five weeks period ending on the day before a public holiday are entitled to receive pay for the holiday.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that historically a number of persons working as substitute teachers were not recognised as fully qualified.  However, earlier this year I introduced measures designed to allow persons who hold a primary degree and the higher diploma in education to work as substitute teachers and to be remunerated accordingly. These latter measures also include provision for recognising as fully qualified for the purposes of providing substitution service teachers trained by the Association Montessori Internationale and montessori trained teachers from St. Nicholas College, Dún Laoghaire, who have successfully completed a three year course, which is recognised by the NCEA.</P>
    <P>The effect of these decisions is to greatly increase the number of persons who will in future be regarded as fully trained and remunerated accordingly.  I am confident the Senator will accept that the position of substitute teachers is fully respected and appreciated within my Department.  I would be glad to hear about individual cases which the Senator has come across. However, I cannot promise anything.  Obviously, such issues are dealt with in wider social partnership agreements.</P>
