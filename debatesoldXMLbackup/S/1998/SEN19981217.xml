      <P>I have notice from Senator Cosgrave that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide additional capital funding to Iarnród Éireann to enable it to extend the operating times of the DART service in view of the recent failure of the company to reach agreement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline his views on the proposals made by the Medical Council on the changes needed to differentiate in the treatment between sick and incompetent doctors.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

All Stages of item 1 will be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons on Second Stage not to exceed 20 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I submitted a motion this morning calling on the Taoiseach to come to the Seanad to explain the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the appeals commissioner, Mr. Kelly, but the Cathaoirleach disallowed it.  I understand the reason for his decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I could not accept the motion at such short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business &mdash; that statements be taken at 12 noon for one hour on the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the appeals commissioner and the consequences of his judgment.  People's confidence in the fairness of our tax system has been undermined.  Unless there are answers to a range of questions, that erosion of public confidence will continue.  I am sure our colleagues in the Progressive Democrats Party and all other parties would like to have these questions answered.  For that reason I propose that the Order of Business be amended to allow for statements at 12 o'clock on this matter.</P>
      <P>I also ask that time be made available for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come into the House to report on the Irish attitude to the bombing of Iraq, to give us an update on the situation and allow Members to make known their views.</P>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday my concern about item 8 on the Order Paper for today &mdash; the taking of a range of regulations without debate.  Since then I have been briefed by the civil servants and was informed that Members of the Lower House were given adequate prior information and briefing on these regulations.  This was not done for the Upper House.  For some reason they did not think it necessary to appraise us, which surprises me since the longest debate on the Freedom of Information Act took place in this House.  They have now, however, briefed all parties and I will have no difficulty in taking that without debate.  I ask the Leader to put on the agenda of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges examination of the manner in which we deal with statutory instruments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a technical point, the Leader has suggested 20 and 15 minutes per speaker on the first Bill.  It may not be possible to grant that amount of time and move on to the next business at 12 o'clock.  That is too long for a short Bill which was discussed in detail earlier this year. Periods of 15 and ten minutes would be quite adequate.</P>
      <P>Leaving party political considerations out of it, there is a widespread lack of trust in regard to the appointment of the appeals commissioner.  It may well be that there is a simple explanation. People's confidentiality must be respected in matters of taxation and finance.  On the other hand, many questions are being asked.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has sought a debate on this matter by way of statements and an amendment to the Order of Business.  I would prefer if that debate were not pre-empted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that call for a debate. People need explanations.  It is better to have matters dealt with openly than have them talked about in corners.</P>
      <P>As regards the Freedom of Information Act, we have not had time to assimilate what the regulations might be.  Before giving any undertaking to agree to those without debate we need time to look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>My colleague, Senator Gallagher, raised the matter of item 8 yesterday.  We are thankful that the officials of the Department of Finance undertook a briefing on it for all the parties yesterday evening.  It should not have to come to that.  The matter should have been clarified in advance so that there would have been an opportunity to make statements if necessary.</P>
      <P>I second Senator Manning's call for an amendment to the Order of Business.  We need the Taoiseach to come before the House.  It is not necessary, however, for the Minister for Finance to come in.  His attitude in his contribution yesterday seemed to condone tax avoidance and tax evasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like a debate in this House with the Taoiseach present.  The matter is being debated fully in the other House today.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the issue of the attacks on Iraq. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will want to express the view of this State, which has already been expressed by Mr. Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, that this was an unprovoked attack.  No report was made by the mission in Iraq monitoring weapons to the United Nations Security Council, and it knew nothing about the attack.  It was a unilateral action by Britain and the United States.  There is a rule of international law which must be abided by.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs should state that loud and clear.  He should come into the House to hear our views.  This is a declaration of war against a country and its people, which is a very serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the calls for a debate on Iraq.  I propose an amendment to the Order of Business &mdash; that we debate this matter this morning. The raids started last night and it is likely that they will continue this evening.  I feel fully justified in having boycotted Mr. Blair's visit to <Col N="1232" /> the House.  This proved what is going on.  I saw him on television last night and he was literally Mr. Clinton's spitting image, parroting the script dictated by Washington.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning has sought a debate on that matter for tomorrow and I do not wish that debate to be pre-empted on today's Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that but I would like to formally propose an alteration to the Order of Business.  In my opinion it is much more urgent than the question of a former Taoiseach's tax affairs.  If that debate does take place, I hope it will be clean and impartial.  This business of dragging in-laws in is utterly wrong.  It is misleading and stirs up the public's apprehension in an unjustifiable manner.</P>
      <P>When civilians in places such as Basra and Baghdad are likely to be killed this evening by those who installed, armed and encouraged Saddam Hussein, that is what we should be discussing, not tax affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the call for statements on the situation in Iraq.  I agree with Senator Norris.  If we have a debate on the present controversy over the payment of tax, it should be conducted properly and the muck spreading which we saw yesterday should not be continued today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the call for a debate on the united approach of Britain and the US in attacking Iraq, I remind the House that if it was not for the intervention of the US in Europe 50 years ago, we might not be in a free, democratic and affluent Europe today.  The US forces paid a high price for that freedom.  Chemical and biological weapons should not be tolerated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's proposal for a debate on Iraq.  Although I am not in accord with the sentiments which he expressed, I agree there is need for a debate on a subject of such urgency and today would be a good day for that debate.</P>
      <P>I thank all those Members of the House who sent me a Christmas card, especially those who signed them, a minority at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Leader of the House will not allow statements on the issue raised by Senator Manning.  Like Senator Norris, I am opposed to holding a debate in the atmosphere which has been created.  I do not want to open a <Col N="1233" /> debate about it but there is a world of difference between what was found by Judge McCracken, the facts, and whether the former Taoiseach has a tax liability.  That is the issue.  It is utterly wrong for this House to use emotions and pander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Leader wish to make a statement on the ongoing and very public differences between the National Treasury Management Agency and the Department of Finance? They are rather unedifying to say the least and they are not in the best interests of the State. There is no doubt that Dr. Somers and the agency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am.  I would like to hear from the Leader.  The agency has more than proved itself.  The Department of Finance needs to get its act in order.  Those who are doing a good job on behalf of the State should be allowed get on with it unhindered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call for an urgent debate on Iraq.  Last night a disaster took place for the people of Iraq.  Mr. Clinton hypocritically stated he is attacking three days before the holy season of Ramadan, in other words, he is saying it is all right to kill people before Ramadan.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the problems in maternity hospitals and I would like the Leader to ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House early in the new year to debate this matter.  I refer particularly to Limerick where a mother had to be separated from her new-born twins because the neo-natal service is not sufficient to deal with emergencies.  At a time when parents are supposed to bond with their new born babies, this is shocking.  We have discussed child abduction.  In this instance the Minister needs to review neo-natal services in hospitals in the light of the increased birth rate, particularly in the areas of high fertility and multiple births.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, I will not risk your wrath by making a long speech but I wish to state that I agree with Senators Norris and Lanigan.  I beg the House's indulgence to congratulate Danny McNamee on his release.  He spent 11 years in jail and what was noticed most was that horses were killed in the event for which he was charged.  There will be a lot more than horses dying in Baghdad tonight and tomorrow and the following night and we will not even see what happens because no one will tell us.  As someone said, it is an act of collective punishment beating by two countries which want to prove themselves to be as macho as everybody else.  I hope we have a debate.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Ross called for an amendment to the Order of Business The Order of Business today is long and lengthy &mdash; hopefully we will finish by 9 or 10 p.m. &mdash; so there can be no change to the Order of Business.  I can consider it for tomorrow but certainly not for today.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris, Finneran, Ross, Lanigan, Ryan and Costello called for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to come to the House for a debate. I will endeavour to have time left aside for this tomorrow.  I will contact the Minister's office after the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>In reply to Senator O'Toole, I can change the time per speaker on item 1 to 15 and ten minutes as he suggested.  In reply to Senators Manning, O'Toole and Costello on item 8, I will put this on the agenda for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges meeting as requested.  Senator Coghlan raised the matter of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I will pass on his views to the Minister for Finance.  Senator Jackman called for the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House early in the next session for a debate on maternity hospitals; I will leave time aside for this.  Senator Ryan welcomed Danny McNamee's release.</P>

    <Title>Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund (Amendment) Bill, 1998: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P> Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to amend of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Act, 1997.  The Bill contains only two sections.  Section 1 provides for an increase in payments into the fund from £100 million to £130 million for the financial year 1998. This is clear evidence of the State's commitment to a substantial, visible and secure investment in high level research in the third level area.  The additional £30 million, together with £20 million already in the fund related to research and development and equipment, will provide the State's capital investment in the initiative and will be supported by tax reliefs and £75 million in private funding.  The current funding side of the programme will include £15 million from the existing allocation for research within my Department's budget.  Added to this will be £7.5 million direct Exchequer funding and a further £7.5 million to be raised by the universities and institutes of technology.</P>
      <P>Section 1 also broadens the scope of the Bill to include research in areas other than science and technology while maintaining the focus on these critical areas.  The humanities and social sciences absolutely fit with the broad approach of this initiative.  An intellectual culture which encourages and supports critical inquiry across a wide diversity of fields has clear benefits which reach well beyond narrow academic confines.  Section 2 provides for an appropriate change in the short title of the Act.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the third level research and development initiative which gives rise to this amendment Bill will also contain two further important elements.  One is the establishment of a climate of collaboration between the public and private sectors and the other is the devolution of key administrative procedures to the Higher Education Authority.  This new initiative will contain the following key elements: first, additional public moneys which are substantial, visible and secure; second, a solid partnership between the State and the enterprise sector; third, a £180 million investment package focused on high level research and fourth, a transparent funding mechanism to be based on the findings of an international assessment board whose membership will reflect the full range of scholarly activity in science, technology, the humanities and the social sciences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators will see, therefore, that this brief amendment will have quite dramatic and beneficial effects on our third level system.  In a wide ranging and stimulating debate in the Dáil on Tuesday, I described this Bill as an important route map for future investment in high level research.  I also said it was a logical development <Col N="1238" /> to the provisions of the Scientific and Technological Education (Investment) Fund Bill passed by the House this time last year.</P>
    <P>Developing a future strategy is of vital importance. It is not sufficient for us to look at recent successes and think that this will continue as if success is a naturally occurring phenomenon.  If we are to maintain Ireland's position at the forefront of technological and business change we must put in place a mechanism for building on our strengths and successes.  In an era when prediction and uniformity are no longer possible in any detail we must reconcile ourselves to the task of constantly reinvesting Ireland's competitive advantage.  Investment in education is the key. Certainly proactive public policies in other areas are also vital but can anyone seriously doubt that the success of the economy is intimately bound up with our capacity to maintain a world class education system?  We have no choice &mdash; there is no standing still, we either keep moving forward or we get overtaken by other economies.  It is that simple.</P>
    <P>One of the many underlying assumptions about management in the public or private sector, which has been out of date for some time, is that there is one right way to organise anything.  Today, strategic planning in the education area, as in any other area, must be flexible and innovative so as to respond to rapidly changing circumstances. Today's one right way is tomorrow's obsolete policy. By placing the focus of this new initiative on high level research we are building on our recent success as an attractive location for high technology industry and consolidating this same success by developing Ireland as a centre of excellence in high level research.  We have every reason to feel confident that this strategy will work.</P>
    <P>The investment fund was a dramatic statement of the Government's commitment to looking outside the accepted paradigms for a solution to the ever present problem of funding for major initiatives in the third level sector.  Senators will be aware that when it was launched just over a year ago here in the Seanad it was rightly regarded as a dramatic and innovative measure which underlined the Government's commitment continually to grow our knowledge base so as to maintain our position at the forefront of technological and business developments worldwide.</P>
    <P>The investment fund was underpinned by three key objectives: first, we wanted to renew and modernise the infrastructure of third level institutions, particularly in the technological sector, and guarantee they would continue to produce high quality graduates; second, we wanted to develop new areas of activities in our institutions, especially where emerging skills needs had already been identified and third, we wanted to invest in promoting the innovation which continues to be so crucial in maintaining and expanding our growth.</P>
    <P>At £250 million the fund remains the largest single capital investment introduced by any <Col N="1239" /> Government.  A tight focus on science and technology also added greatly to its impact.  Simply stated, it was the right measure for the right areas at the right time.  The sectoral allocations provide clear evidence of the scope of the fund: £60 million for completion of the programme of skills development announced shortly after the Government took up office; £20 million towards a sustained programme of investment in the provision of hotel and tourism training facilities in the institutes of technology; £20 million for the vocational education sector, particularly post-leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships; £80 million for infrastructural developments, in particular the renewal and reinvigoration of the technological sector as a crucial and distinct element of our binary system; £30 million for third level equipment renewal grants, tackling in a serious and sustained way equipment renewal in our third level colleges; £15 million to reinforce the research and development capacity of third level institutions, including the transfer of technology and £25 million for the schools IT 2000 project.</P>
    <P>These allocations have made possible the largest building programme in the history of higher education.  As I explained to the Dáil on Tuesday, projects involving capital expenditure of the order of almost £90 million have already received sanction to proceed in Carlow, Cork, Dún Laoghaire, Limerick, Tallaght, Waterford and Blanchardstown Institutes of Technology.  Some £70 million of the cost will be met by the fund with the balance coming from European Regional Development Fund and Exchequer sources.</P>
    <P>In the university sector, projects totalling £30 million were sanctioned last summer.  These included £4.5 million for phase two of the microcomputer building at UCD; £5 million for an extension to the O'Rahilly Building at UCC; £4.5 million for an information technology building at UCG; £3 million for an extension to the Callan Science Building at St. Patrick's, Maynooth; £5 million for an informatics building at the University of Limerick; £5 million for an information technology building at Trinity College and £3 million towards the new computer science building and library at DCU.</P>
    <P>The investment fund is working and has met with overwhelming approval from all interested parties.  Its effects will soon be visible on almost every third level campus in the country.  The concept of the investment fund has been successful in another way also.  The establishment of a fund, parallel and additional to the normal Estimates process, was an innovative measure.  It was designed, at least in part, to send a powerful message to all parties that we were firmly committed to making a very substantial investment which would be additional to other public moneys, clearly visible to all and securely linked to the operating period of the programme.  This mechanism has proven also to be very successful.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> The investment fund, in its aims and its manner of operation, is an excellent model for the achievement of best practice for planned change in our education system.  We must now build on this success.  As Minister, I have been determined to lead the change process whenever necessary. There has been, and will be, no communication gap between my Department and the direct education providers and no unnecessary time lag between the needs of the system and my response as Minister.  I am determined, whenever possible, to anticipate needs in the system and get to the problem before it impacts on our progress.  This requires farsighted and innovative measures of which the investment fund is a good example.</P>
    <P>However, excellence is a journey and not a destination. The day we think we have arrived is the day we start to slip back.  The needs are clear.  It is accepted by all interested parties that the task of maintaining the exceptional performance of the economy requires the availability of people with the requisite skills to meet the needs of high technology industry and also, crucially, to put in place the means of conducting high level research in key areas aimed at encouraging companies to set up in Ireland, encouraging more companies already operating in Ireland to establish research and development facilities here and establishing Ireland as a centre of excellence in high level research.</P>
    <P>The investment fund will continue to play a pivotal role in addressing the skills needs of high technology industry.  However, it is high level research which will consolidate our success. Ireland's competitive advantage is directly linked to the quality of our education system and, in the very near future, our capacity to become nothing less than a centre of excellence in high level research across a variety of disciplines will assume critical importance.  This is a potential problem for tomorrow which must be addressed today.</P>
    <P>The message coming through to me from the experts is that the best thing Government can do is give existing current and capital provisions certainty within a set programme, allocate significant additional funding and establish transparent procedures for allocating the funding which will guarantee that quality and strategic planning will be the only bases for decisions.</P>
    <P>The third level research and development initiative is a tailor made response to the needs conveyed to me as Minister.  This new initiative will redress serious structural shortcomings in regard to research and development in our third level institutions and will do so in direct partnership with the enterprise sector.  I wish to again put on record my appreciation of the response of the private sector in supporting and developing this link with the State in providing the most modern facilities in our universities and colleges.</P>
    <P>If our education system is as fundamental to our material and social well being as we know it to be, as inclusive an approach as possible towards funding and support for the system is of <Col N="1241" /> critical importance.  It is important to note that under the provisions of sections 489 and 843 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, private funds in the order of £50 million have already been attracted into the third level system either through projects already sanctioned or currently being processed.  This is real partnership in action and this new initiative will develop it further.</P>
    <P>With such an excellent initiative in place it makes sense to place the accompanying administrative process as close as possible to the operating environment.  Hence, my decision to devolve certain key procedures to the Higher Education Authority.  Senators can be assured that there will be no diminution of appropriate controls over public moneys, but rather a fast tracking of procedures in line with the Government's strategic management approach to efficiency and effectiveness.  These arrangements will be finalised before the end of January.</P>
    <P>This Bill, and the initiative which follows from it, will underline the State's commitment to continuing investment in high level research, develop the concept of partnership between public and private sectors, give a massive boost to the establishment of Ireland as a centre for excellence in research across a wide range of disciplines and make possible a £180 million injection of resources into the third level sector.  All this builds on past successes and will put in place the foundations of future successes.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is an important Bill and I regret, as acting spokesperson, I did not have the time to invest in research on it.  Nevertheless, I wish to raise a number of points with the Minister.  He referred to private and public partnership.  All of us realise that companies, public and private, spend a great deal of money on research and development.  They do this to keep themselves ahead of competition and at the cutting edge in the global market.</P>
      <P>The Bill offers new opportunities to companies. One of my reservations is that third level institutions and technological colleges, important as they are in the education sector, will get the cream of the funding and important businesses at the cutting edge of research and development will not get sufficient funding.  Extending the scope of the Bill to cover any area of education gives it a wide remit.  The humanities and social sciences were mentioned.  Another reservation I have is that the available resources could be stretched too finely and there possibly would not be sufficient resources for important research and development projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the recent grant allocation to the Belderrig research centre in north Mayo, headed by Dr. Caulfield.  It is a classic example of a rural research and development project dealing with archaeology, heritage and antiquity, which are esoteric subjects confined to the academic area. The spin off in economic terms to a region such <Col N="1242" /> as Belderrig can be very substantial.  I welcome the announcement of grant-aid for this important project.  Belderrig is linked geographically to the Céide fields, which is an internationally renowned centre.  The Céide fields and the possibility of the Belderrig research centre coming onstream next year will give tourism a tremendous boost.  This is a much disadvantaged area on the periphery of north Mayo.  The next stop would be New York if one were heading west, which demonstrates how isolated the area is and how important research and development projects could be for the region.</P>
    <P>I hope more of this type of initiative will be seen in rural areas.  Agenda 2000 and rural development is being examined but unless little pockets of development take place in rural Ireland, we will not progress.  For that reason I welcome the extension of the Bill to cover such areas.  I am particularly interested in auto turning, which may not be highly technological but is a skilled area.  It is a fast growing segment of Irish industry.  Many bigger companies farm out their small requirements to these companies, which produce small machine parts.  However, there is huge skill shortages currently.  Most companies are short of skilled labour and in an expanding sector such as this, money could be devoted to give it a new impetus.  I have spoken to many people involved in the sector who told me that they are trying to get labour from abroad, such is the shortage here.  Investment in training and research and development in that area would be welcome.  As I said, it is not a major technology area and does not have a high profile in the public imagination.  Nevertheless, it is so important for industry that it needs to be looked at.</P>
    <P>In our area we have the nucleus of a project which has failed to get off the ground for the past three years because of a lack of funding.  This does not come within the Minister's ambit, as we are dealing mostly with the Minister for Employment, Trade and Enterprise.  However, will such projects come under the remit of the new legislation? If so, will the Minister inform us how to avail of it?</P>
    <P>The level of investment in our third level institutes must be welcomed.  However, I would not like them to get the cream of the funding available under this legislation, although their buildings must be maintained.  The NUI Galway must use prefabs because of accommodation shortages.  This problem must be addressed.  The number of applicants for third level places is increasing, as is the number of drop-outs.  About 80 per cent of those who enter third level graduate with a degree.  We must examine the many factors for that percentage and try to improve it.</P>
    <P>We have many socially dysfunctional families and there is a widening gap between sectors in the economy.  Funding for this area must be looked at; this would add immeasurably to our total economic well being.  If there are major divisions in our society, they will reflect on us all eventually.  The widening gap which is now emerging is not to be welcomed.  The Minister <Col N="1243" /> should address social funding under the new legislation.</P>
    <P>A recent survey found that 85 per cent of the technical skills shortfall and 50 per cent of the professional skills shortfall will need to be provided by industry led initiatives.  Public and private companies have a function in providing those initiatives in research and development.</P>
    <P>It is important that, while institutes are given research and development facilities, companies should also be invited into the universities, because partnership between business and education is the way forward.  The Minister referred to this in his speech.  We welcome the partnership between education and business and everyone should try to cultivate it.</P>
    <P>There must be a greater integration between business and the education and training sector. The business and education training forum is one area where this could happen.  There has already been a number of initiatives in which businesses have trained their own staff at local educational establishments.  Companies that are recognised by local education establishments should be encouraged to promote business, by allowing people to be involved in education while they are working. The expert skills group sees the need to extend the integration of business and education.</P>
    <P>Providing incentives to business people to invest money in educating their employees will ensure there are sustainable jobs which will remain in this country.  That is where the real growth is.  This applies particularly to Irish companies. The facility of an institute to develop these skills is crucial.  Many Irish companies have great products but they do not have the facilities or money to employ researchers and to invest in R&amp;D, which would take them into the marketplace at a higher level.  Some of the initiatives in the Bill could go some way towards redressing that area.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to social trends.  There are now many single parent families who we are trying to integrate into the education system.  We need to put more emphasis on adult education. There is major new thinking on adult education in my area.  It is promising to see the number of adults taking part-time courses in our third level institutions and what used to be called vocational education committees &mdash; they are all called colleges now.  There is an amazing number of people attending night classes in rural areas.  This new emphasis on adult education is to be welcomed. Sections of the Bill may lead to greater funding for this area.</P>
    <P>We have established a third level institute in Ballina from scratch, which is a daunting prospect at any time of the year.  After four years of intensive work, we launched a third level institute last July.  It is limited in its capability and the scope of its denominational thrust, in that it is a single denominational institute.  This year we have 20 part-time students taking diploma courses in community development and ten post-graduate <Col N="1244" /> students studying theology.  We can see the value of such initiatives in rural areas.  One might say it is a very small beginning and wonder what future it might have; nevertheless, we are convinced that in a few years' time, with the emphasis on adult education and the shortfall in third level places throughout the country, we will have a growing institution in our area.  I am sure our R&amp;D section would qualify under some aspect of the new legislation and I am sure the Minister will receive demands in this regard before the year is over.</P>
    <P>By widening the scope of the Bill, the Minister has opened up new opportunities in many spheres, which is to be welcomed.  As I said, we are currently looking at a privately funded project and any public funding would be most welcome. I welcome the Bill, by and large, with a few reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  He has attended the House on at least a monthly basis. It has meant that I have had to work very hard.</P>
      <P>The Minister has had a number of achievements. The fund which is the subject of this Bill was created in 1997.  The Education (No. 2) Bill was introduced this year and a huge new programme was implemented at second and third level education.  Approximately ten days ago he introduced the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill.  Today we are considering a Bill to increase the fund for scientific and technological education investment.  It demonstrates that once success is achieved it needs to be worked on.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment of an allocation of £60 million for the completion of skills development announced shortly after the Government took office.  The partnership arrangement will enhance the public and private sectors and the promotion of people in business.  This was a core area of the information technology programme launched last year.  It is proving to be a very successful project throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The hotel and tourism industries need to be linked up.  When I was involved in education there was a plethora of courses which lacked a coherent centre.  They were sold badly in second level schools.  I congratulate the Minister for recognising the opportunity to tidy up this area.  I understand from my colleagues that there is now a high degree of co-ordination between that sector and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I especially welcome the allocation of £20 million for the vocational education sector, especially post-leaving certificate courses and apprenticeships. These have mushroomed in every school. Those students who cannot achieve the high number of points necessary to immediately access the academic area now have a chance to take up courses in the Dublin Institute of Technology and the other new institutes of technology.  In addition, those skilled in their trade now have the opportunity to upgrade them and engage in research.  This is a great move.  The post-leaving certificate courses are now working very well. <Col N="1245" /> Many young students are getting the opportunity to take up careers in technology.  I welcome that.</P>
    <P>While the area of apprenticeships is linked to FÁS and is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the provisions in the legislation touch on it.  This area is still the weak cog in the machine.  I spoke at length on the subject in the House last week.  It is difficult for households to find plumbers, decorators, etc.  As educationalists we have a role in the FÁS area in addressing how best matters may be co-ordinated.  This is where partnership between the private and public sectors can be further enhanced.  The Minister has recognised there are not enough skilled people and the need to tidy up this whole area.  In this regard, the input of education to training must be looked at. There is much research into this area and the Minister's allocation of £20 million will help to identify the weaknesses.</P>
    <P>With regard to the allocation of £25 million to the schools, not a school in the country has not praised the Minister for the way he introduced the information technology project.  The introduction of students to all subjects through the computer is working well.</P>
    <P>The idea of partnership is to get the community and business people involved.  The huge numbers of courses available at third level, including the plethora of masters degrees, mean that people with primary degrees have great opportunities to do post-graduate work.  The Minister has recognised this and has expanded the scope for research and development at third level and will expand it further, not only in the scientific and development area but the humanities and social sciences.  That is to be welcomed because many technological skills require an input from the humanities.</P>
    <P>The kind of post-graduate courses coming on stream today must be holistic in their approach in recognition of the fact that students will be required to mix in the world on a partnership basis.  A social dimension is required and an important aspect of the Bill is the emphasis it places on extending research and technology while creating an atmosphere where people can become involved in post-graduate courses that will enhance their way of life.  Success is about how we interact with the public and how we do our business.  If we do not get that right we will fail.  The Minister has acknowledged that by providing for the extension of research into this area.</P>
    <P>The allocation of £30 million will include the buildings in UCD and UCC and information technology at NUI Maynooth and the University of Limerick.  The Minister has got it right in extending the project in such a comprehensive manner.  Hitherto we concentrated on areas in the cities.  We now need to provide for rural development. Education should not concentrate in the bigger cities.  It should allow young people to be educated closer to home to enable them build infrastructures in their own areas.  The thrust of the Minister's approach indicates he is taking the <Col N="1246" /> country into account and not specific colleges and locations.  He is to be commended for that.</P>
    <P>We have started a very fine programme.  Every college has the necessary expertise in the form of our third level professors and educationalists. There are fine young men and women with post-graduate courses coming onstream.  They need to enhance their courses with an extra diploma or certificate course.  These courses exist and money is being invested in them, whether they are run on a certificate or specialist basis.</P>
    <P>We are the centre of excellence in education and we have the young people to prove it.  We also have the variety of courses to reflect the needs that are out there.  Our education system taps into what is needed.  However, we cannot say we will be as successful tomorrow as we are today.  We have the people, the courses, the research, the opportunities and now we have the money to match it.  I commend this Bill to the House and I hope everyone will compliment the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>A 100,000 welcomes to the Minister and the Bill.  I congratulate him on this enormous initiative because the fund was set up in January and now we are getting another £30 million for it. It is also important to point out that the additional money provided in this Bill is specifically targeted towards the strategic research initiative which is being organised through the Higher Education Authority.  This is a very important initiative because it represents a major Government commitment to third level colleges. It also means that the universities have joined together and contributed another £80 million towards the programme, and this will be available to all in the third level sector.  The vision of the heads of the Irish universities should be applauded as well.  This is a great day because this Bill is being processed.</P>
      <P>Last Friday, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Treacy, announced that £4.5 million will be provided for the industrial research support programme. This initiative was most welcome.  The past few days have been terrific for research.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister did not mention one point and I would like to refer to it now.  I thought the Scientific and Technological Education and Investment Fund would emphasise the important problem we have in relation to physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level.  This issue needs to be tackled with some urgency because the numbers who are taking physics and chemistry at leaving certificate level decrease every year.  This is very serious because, no matter how splendid our fund, we need people to take up this type of work.  When the fund was established one of its functions was to address this issue.  I look forward to seeing what progress is being made in this area when the first report issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past few years the State has steadily increased its investment in science and technology <Col N="1247" /> and now we are beginning to see it paying off in terms of the innovative research being carried out in colleges.  Some of the research will pay dividends in terms of the products which derive from them, some will pay dividends in terms of the knowledge gained but all will pay dividends in terms of the graduates it helps to train.  For example, I am sure the Minister is aware of the recent problems with multiple drug resistance in bacteria.  The bacteria used to be easily controlled by antibiotics but they were becoming resistant to many, if not all, antibiotics used in normal medical practice.  What began as methicillin staphylococcus aureus eventually became multiple resistant staphylococcus aureus which is a big problem in our hospitals.  We were reaching a state where we were returning to the pre-antibiotic era.  I am delighted to inform the House that recent developments in the University of Limerick may turn the bacterium's resistance upon itself.  This development by Irish researchers in an Irish university is potentially the single most important breakthrough in the continuing struggle against infectious disease since the discovery of chemical antibiotics in the early years of this century.</P>
    <P>Another example I mentioned when we were discussing overseas aid recently was the problem of vaccination and how frequently vaccinations were ineffective in the Third World because vaccines need to be kept in fridges for a considerable length of time.  Here this problem is being tackled.  The cold chain from production to use has probably been solved.  Irish researchers have been intimately involved in efforts to develop vaccines and vaccine delivery systems which can do away with the need for a verifiable cold chain and provide life-saving vaccinations to children who cannot up to now avail of them.</P>
    <P>Another example is the fundamental work being done on transplant immunology in this country and for which the Irish Research Scientists Association this year awarded its gold medal. Again research has been undertaken on the psychology of suicide in young people which is a very serious problem here.  There is also research into the genetics of inherited eye disorders, etc.  There are numerous incredibly important areas of research where people here have made international breakthroughs.</P>
    <P>Public funds have been available for people to do this work and we have demonstrated that Irish research, with proper support, can play a leading role in international research.  I deliberately used the word &ldquo;investment&rdquo; earlier in relation to this country's support for science and technology because for far too long we have looked on spending on this sector as simply a black hole into which we throw money with no prospect of a return.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have seen an attitudinal change in both public and private perceptions of the reason supporting research is a good idea.  For example, in 1995 the report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council set the <Col N="1248" /> year 2000 as the target date by which industry was to double its research and development spend. We passed that target this year, two full years ahead of schedule.  All I want to say about this sector is that we should be sure the industry knows what is available in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and we had a lot of debate about the serious transport problems experienced by small suppliers and agents.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology, with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, a national institute of transport and logistics has been set up.  Unfortunately, there is one problem and that is it has not filtered through to industry that this help was available.  We need to ensure there is a good publicity campaign for those areas, particularly technology.  <i>The Irish Scientist,</i> edited by Dr. Charles Mullen, is a good publication which brings scientific research to the attention of the public.  Perhaps we are not so good at publicising technology.</P>
    <P>There is also an insatiable demand by industry for technically literate employees in all aspects of industry's operations.  The IDA has identified specific target technologies that it wants to see establish research activities here.  The intellectual capital that our graduates represent is worth more than tax relief or cheap labour.</P>
    <P>The Minister's fund represents the means to satisfy all that demand.  However, we must not lose sight of the need to encourage the development of new ideas that, by their nature, arise in a bottom-up way.  The Minister, the Minister of State and other Ministers &mdash; the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh &mdash; have responsibility for peer reviewed research programmes in their Departments and these are endeavouring to ensure there is maximum support available for projects arising from individual researchers.  This is a very important issue.  We should never be afraid to support good people with good ideas because their ideas are the feedstock that will make the strategic research initiative a success.</P>
    <P>Finally, we have good people in many areas ranging from astrophysics to zoology but, as I have said before, there is a need to set up a postdoctorate research fund so there is equity in the way funding is given to people working in various disciplines.  It is very hard to have people on the same bench when one receives £4,000 while another receives £24,000.  I know the Minister cannot address this issue today or use this fund to do so but perhaps he will ask his officials if public and private funds can be put into a scientific research fund in the way the health research fund is administered where the Wellcome research fund gives the money to the health research board and it is disbursed from there. This would encourage people working in the <Col N="1249" /> area.  This is a great Christmas present for all those involved and I thank the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ordmonde I seem to spend a lot of time complimenting the Minister on his various activities, which is not the natural job of the Opposition.  I welcome the Bill.  I spent the past hour digging out the original Bill to make sure I understand it.  This Bill broadens the scope of the legislation and provides for the necessary funding.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry that we can spend all we wish on equipment, facilities and technology, but if second level pupils are retreating in large numbers from science, particularly physics and chemistry, there will be a serious bottleneck in the area of the pharmaceutical, chemical and related industries.  This is happening at a time when the numbers of young people doing the leaving certificate are increasing.  The pharmaceutical and chemical industry is as big an investor on an annual basis as the information technology industry.  There are no new pharmaceutical or chemical industries coming to Ireland because most of the international players are already here.  Very few multinational pharmaceutical companies do not have a base in this country, therefore, there are no new companies to invite here.  The scale of additional investment undertaken by this industry in any calendar year in recent years has been as big as the scale of investment taking place in the information technology sector.  The unwillingness on the part of students to study physics and chemistry must be addressed because this will present a problem in terms of skilled people to work in the sector.</P>
      <P>I hope we leave room for creative research, not just applied research in partnership with industry to meet a specific objective.  I have no objection to that type of research.  However, there must be room in a large fund for imaginative people, either in the educational or other sectors, who are following an idea.  I teach a first year course in chemical engineering.  In that course I quote a British scientist who spent his entire 40 years of academic life researching the properties of silicon. He concluded that he could see no commercial use to which his work could be put.  In fact, his work became the basis of the microchip industry less than 20 years afterwards.  He thought he did wonderful work, he enjoyed it immensely and he was very glad to have done the work but he believed it had no commercial benefit.  I believe that there never has been a good idea that did not have some use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The history of nylon is of Carruthers being given freedom by Du Pont to poke around his laboratory to see what he could do about making long chains of moth polymers.  No one knew what he would produce, just that he had many interesting ideas.  Out of that came the whole synthetic fibre industry.  This came about because a man with particular talent was given scope and resources to potentially waste money.  There was <Col N="1250" /> a certain sniff from the Department of Education and Science in recent years about some of the funding for research.  We must not put time limits on people with strategic ideas.  Senator Henry mentioned some of these people.  There are people with such a capacity.  Our system of secondary education produces people who go into third level education with a capacity to think laterally. A more narrowly focused second level education such as exists in Britain does not facilitate this.  Our young people leave secondary school with a broad education.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister would take the opportunity to give us a more detailed assessment of the level of development of the projects he announced in the past 12 months.  Some £120 million worth of investment has been announced &mdash; £90 million in the sector in which I work &mdash; but it would be interesting to know the progress of these projects. Many projects have been announced in my area. However, a year after the fund was set up not a sod has been turned.  It would be interesting to know the progress of these projects.  I hope the Minister will not tell me to ask the people of Cork.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his work in this area.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anyone who cannot see the connection between investment in the education system and the current economic prosperity. In a relatively short period we have begun the process of transforming the economy into a high skilled, high tech economy rather than a low paid, low skilled economy.  The problems in Fruit of the Loom should teach us to encourage high skilled, high paid industries.  We are all aware of the transformation that has taken place as a result of free education.  Generations of people have benefited from the broad education system referred to by Senator Ryan.  Many are children of families who would otherwise not have aspired to third level education.  The benefits of this are evident in their pay packets and in their self-confidence and self-worth.  This is reflected also in the present economic climate.</P>
      <P>The Celtic tiger has a high skilled, high-tech appetite.  As a graduate of an arts department, I make a plea for the humanities in that context.  It is important for Government to reflect the voice of industry through the schools in encouraging second level pupils to study computers, science, engineering, physics, chemistry and so on.  We also need people who are more interested in literature and have a creative capacity in areas not related to science or engineering.  They have a considerable contribution to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the setting up of a third level institution in my constituency of north Tipperary <Col N="1251" /> in the TRBDI.  I recently paid a visit, at the invitation of Shannon Development, to Shannon to see the excellent and productive relationship that has developed there between the University of Limerick and industry.  It is the intention of the TRBDI to develop the same close links with local industry.  It will provide incubator units and a high level of support for graduates to promote the skills which are the basis of an innovative economy with high skills industries.</P>
    <P>I will take this opportunity to put my queries to the Minister.  He referred to developing the concept of partnership between the public and private sectors in this area.  To what extent has the private sector already contributed?  I welcome the extension of the fund to regional technical colleges and institutes of technology.  Can the principle of the George Mitchell scholarship fund, under which US citizens might take up positions in Northern Ireland under that educational umbrella, be utilised in this Bill or could a parallel fund be set up to support the excellent principles being put forward elsewhere?</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  It is one of a number of excellent initiatives by the Department in this area.  I wish the Minister well in this and future initiatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their kind comments and for the welcome they gave the Bill. Senator Caffrey and Senator Ormonde referred to apprenticeships.  We have sanctioned the spending of £10 million from the £250 million scientific and technology investment fund on increasing apprenticeships.  There are now about 5,500 apprenticeship places throughout the country, between FÁS and the institutes of technology, a doubling of the number over a two year period.  However, there is still great need for skills in industry.  I will examine the auto turning sector which Senator Caffrey identified.</P>
      <P>Senator Ormonde referred to CERT.  A sum of £20 million from the fund has been designated for a number of the institutes of technology to increase and upgrade their facilities in this area. Senator Ryan is correct that the buildings in some institutes are up and running while in others they are not.  In the case of Cork Instititute of Technology the design plans are nearly finalised.  The people in the catering sector in Cork Institute of Technology are stretching the yard a little.  That is why it is not built yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, the building is a sensitive matter because it relates to the facade of the new entrance.  However, it will go ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Henry and Senator Ryan identified a key issue, science education at second level.  This fund will not address that but we intend to announce an initiative in January on science in <Col N="1252" /> both first and second levels.  The revised primary school curriculum will be sent to me in January by the National Council for Curriculum Assessment. That will see the introduction of science in primary schools.</P>
    <P>In the Estimates we secured funding for teaching science in primary schools.  That will include a capital grant to enable schools to purchase equipment and materials.  A key initiative is also required at second level.  The numbers of students studying science over the past 15 or 20 years have not changed but the percentages they represent are significantly decreasing.  The percentage studying chemistry and physics, for example, has been declining for the past ten years.</P>
    <P>We intend to announce an initiative in the Estimates for science, particularly physics and chemistry, at second level.  It will involve in-service training for teachers and an investment programme in scientific laboratories in second level schools.  It will also involve the creation of more places in the higher diploma in education course and more incentives for physics and chemistry graduates.  A reserve quota of places will be required so these graduates will not be obliged to scramble with other graduates for places.  We started this last year and we intend to progress it further.  Extra capitation for schools will also be required to give them incentives to opt for the chemistry and physics option.  The key element is the revised syllabus which will be introduced in the two subjects next year.  That will be important in dealing with the unfortunate perception of students that physics and chemistry are too difficult for getting points in their leaving certificate.</P>
    <P>Both Senator Ryan and Senator O'Meara spoke about the humanities.  This Bill is about broadening the legislation to include the humanities. There was a spirited debate about this in the Lower House yesterday.  Some Members said I was wrong to move too far in including the humanities.  However, what is involved is the addition of £30 million to an existing fund of £20 million, made up of the £15 million allocated for research last year and £5 million for equipment.</P>
    <P>We are developing a £180 million fund for research.  The institutes and universities are confident that they will raise £75 million.  Over the past three years £50 million has been committed to the fund by the private sector in a number of projects. Dublin City University, for example, has a £23 million project to which the State made a contribution of approximately £4 million.  DCU raised nearly £11 million from the private sector and through tax relief under the Finance Acts.  It demonstrates how the State can stimulate a larger investment by making a certain amount of State funding available.  The institution uses it to attract private funding and utilises the tax relief measures in the Finance Acts.  That is the type of mix we are seeking.</P>
    <P>The humanities, however, is a key area.  I believe that some of the rigid demarcations between the humanities and sciences are beginning to break down.  We would like to see cross-faculty <Col N="1253" /> and interdisciplinary research as well as cross-institutional research.  We are anxious to have the institutes of technology working jointly with the universities in some of the research projects which will be submitted as a result of the establishment of this fund.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators and I hope to be before the House next year with more money for education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received letters from people as diverse as Deputy Alan Dukes, the Leader of this House, Senator Cassidy, and members of all political parties concerning the publication of a commemorative stamp for the pioneer movement. Let me be clear from the outset &mdash; I never was a pioneer and I do not intend to become a pioneer.  However, it is a fine organisation.  I taught history and I know all about Fr. Matthew who set up the organisation and the fine work it did.</P>
      <P>I tried to find suitable quotations to use in this debate and I dug up two.  St. Paul wrote to Timothy saying &ldquo;Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake&rdquo;.  This was echoed many centuries later by G. K. Chesterton who wrote:</P>
      <P>And Noah he often said to his wife when he sat down to dine,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I don't care where the water goes if it doesn't get into the wine.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Both are apt.  My own tipple is wine, I do not take anything else.  I find it is very good with food and conversation.</P>
      <P>The subjects for the annual programme of special and commemorative stamps are selected by the Philatelic Advisory Committee of An Post after wide consultation and are then approved by the board of the company and by the Government. In order to allow sufficient time for design, printing and publicity, each annual stamp programme must be finalised well before the year of issue.</P>
      <P>Each year, on average, approximately 45 special and commemorative stamps are issued. The number of such stamps is limited with a view to preserving Ireland's excellent reputation in philatelic terms internationally.  Apart from regular issues for Christmas, on a pan-European theme and for flora and fauna, subjects are chosen to commemorate important international and national anniversaries or events, and the births and deaths of prominent individuals, each of whom has made an important contribution to society in their lifetime.  In all 84 suggestions were received for the 1999 programme, of which 45 were accepted.</P>
      <P>I understand that the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was one of the many worthy suggestions put forward for inclusion in the 1999 programme but which was not selected by the philatelic committee.  The membership of this committee is as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> Dermot Egan is chairman, formerly with AIB and then President of IMI; Raymond Keaveney, the Director of the National Gallery; Dr. Martin Mansergh, departmental adviser to the Taoiseach; June Mulcahy, a housewife; Geoffrey Megawley, President of the Irish Philatelic Society; Dámhnait Ó Maoileoin, Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands; Jim Treacy of An Post; Maurice O'Connell, an expert philatelist; Liam Ó Reagáin, former Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs; Jean Varga, President of the Stamp Catalogue Producers; Barbara Wallace, public relations; Dr. Pat Wallace, Director of the National Museum; An Post advisers Pat Carroll and Gerry Mooney and Declan O'Leary is secretary to the committee.</P>
    <P>The committee's terms of reference are to advise the company on philatelic matters, to select the subjects for the annual stamp programmes and to formulate the philatelic policy of the company.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that a significant number of representations have been made to me by Members of the Oireachtas expressing the wish to have the centenary year of the organisation marked by the issue of a special stamp, and having regard to the association's extensive membership throughout the country, I have asked An Post to reconsider its decision in that regard.  I have on file all of the subjects which were put forward for inclusion, twice as many as could be fitted in.  There is also the time constraint.  I am aware, however, of the importance of the organisation and I have no doubt it is an honourable organisation with laudable aims and objectives.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be made clear that the association does not &ldquo;hate&rdquo; drink and has no belief that drink is bad for you.  Its members have chosen that path and having done so they hope to attract others to it.  There is, however, no zealotry about it.  It may have been born from a spirit of zealotry which was needed at the time but that intensity no longer exists within the organisation.</P>
    <P>An Post is a semi-State body but it is no longer a matter for Dáil or Seanad Éireann to question its operational matters.  I cannot interfere with the Philatelic Advisory Committee.  That is not within the remit of my job and I do not intend to do it. I have requested that An Post look again at the matter in view of the number of representations made to me.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the words of St. Paul.  He was a wise man and I have always tried to follow his teachings but I understand and hold in high regard those who have espoused and followed the ideals of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have never taken a pint.  I have been a businessman for most of my life and owned four pubs.  The proposal before us that the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association be recognised for the good it has done is right and proper. There is no question or doubt about that.</P>
      <P>However there are wrongs within the association. For example, because I sold drink I am not allowed wear a badge.  The regulations are very strict.  The Minister stated there have been changes within the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association but there have not.  It gives the impression there have been but the regulations have never been changed since its foundation. That should be done.  It is becoming common to knock drink.  The Minister is right.  I do not care what way the water goes as long as it does not get into the wine.  Of course it depends on whether the wine is red or white.</P>
      <P>I would not go on holiday with someone who did not drink; I would prefer to be with a person who drinks.  I find that people who do not drink sometimes expect everybody else to do the same. That is not right.  If I was looking for an English speaking person in Paris I would look for someone wearing a fáinne.  That is a contradiction but that is the point I am making.  While I respect the badge very much, I question why someone who does not drink must wear it at all.  What is the point of it?  One can make a point strongly without wearing a badge.  I am not demeaning the badge or the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association at all.  It was founded in Cork by Father Matthew who came from Golden, County Tipperary; the clerk comes from Golden.  We hold him in high esteem and have a statue of him in Patrick Street in Cork facing one of the finest rivers in the country, the River Lee.  We are proud of that.</P>
      <P>The Minister made a strong point regarding recognition of 45 groups.  This is a very important occasion.  We do not treat things like that easily in Ireland.  The sad thing about Ireland in comparison to Great Britain, is that we do not recognise individuals and groups enough for their achievements.  We should do that, but because the British do it we will not.  We give the freedom but we do not give the recognition of knighthood because we are a republic.  We should do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has shown how life can be without drink.  The Minister stated that people take this on themselves because it is mentioned on their Confirmation day.  It was mentioned on my Confirmation day and I took the temporary pledge.  From that day, I never drank.  Of course I wanted to drink at times.  In particular I would have liked to drink in situations when I was under pressure or sad. Drink is very attractive at that time.  As a former publican I have seen the damage drink can do.  I could always tell if a person should never drink, <Col N="1257" /> but did.  I could also tell if a person was able to take a drink.</P>
    <P>Why did I say that a person who drinks is the most content?  I have seen a tradesman, a general operative, a sheriff's clerk and an accountant all sit at the one table playing cards with pints in front of them and they would be very content. One cannot find the contentment to be found in the drinking trade of Ireland elsewhere in the world.  I have been to many places and people are looking for that contentment.  We have what many are looking for and we should not knock it.</P>
    <P>However let us also talk about what it means to drink in moderation.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association should get the recognition of a commemorative stamp.  The proposal before us is a good one.  The association has done much work.</P>
    <P>There is an impression throughout the world that we drink too much in Ireland.  However one study rated us thirteenth out of 19 countries.  We are not great wine drinkers and we are better off not drinking too much wine.</P>

This is a debate for the drink trade and we should debate it at another time.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association should be recognised by the issuing of a commemorative stamp. It is unfortunate we cannot give recognition to enough people.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has done this island a world of good. I thank God it started in Cork.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank her for taking time from her busy schedule at short notice to hear our debate today.  This debate is the result of a debate on teenage drinking which is a terrible problem in Ireland today.  I thank the Leader for the debate. After the debate &mdash; and this is the strength of the grass roots Pioneers &mdash; my local secretary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association in North Sligo, Irene Feeney, phoned to congratulate me on my statement on teenage drinking and sent me the letter which Father Mac Gréil had sent to An Post seeking a commemorative stamp.  As a result I raised the matter again and, thanks to our Leader, we are discussing this today.  I also thank Senator Manning, Leader of the Opposition who willingly seconded the proposal and stated he <Col N="1258" /> would support it.  In this House there is a fair amount of unity.</P>
      <P>Members of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association are not anti-drink.  There was drink at the marriage feast of Cana.  The abuse of alcohol is the problem.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association is 100 years old.  I could nearly say I did not go to school but I met the scholars and learnt my history from the university of reality. In my part of the country it was always said the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was formed in the days when poteen and shebeen houses were ruining this country and it had reached the stage where, if a child cried in its cradle it was given a spoonful of poteen and a drop of hot water to put it to sleep; the problem had become that serious.</P>
      <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was founded to try to deal with the serious alcohol problem at the time.  It was very successful for 85 or 90 years.  Some say Pioneers are a dying breed. I do not think that is the case.  We will rejuvenate and encourage people because never before has there been such a problem.  I pay tribute to the vintners association, both in and outside Dublin, for its efforts to stem teenage drinking.  They do not want it, nor do the health boards, the Departments of Health and Children and Education and Science, the teachers unions and the National Parents Council.  I thank RTE for giving me time on <i>Oireachtas Report</i> to discuss this.  The Pioneers have been reawakened.  Drink is necessary but must not be abused.

      <P>Pioneers have done much good work, not only in showing good example by abstaining from alcoholic drink but in sports and other activities. Pioneers are fit and well and always give a good performance.  If any other organisation had as good a reputation and track record, it would be recognised automatically.  It is sad that we have to go to these lengths to get recognition.  An old building that some famous man spent one night in would be recognised.</P>

      <P>Yet the Pioneer organisation, which has done wonderful work, has had to go on its knees to get recognition.  I pray that those on <Col N="1259" /> the philatelic committee of An Post will come to see the strength of the Pioneers.  This exercise has proved once again that there is support for this across the board.  I look forward to the Pioneers resurrecting and becoming stronger than ever.</P>
      <P>I said recently that I was disappointed the bishops had stopped giving the pledge at Confirmations. I had a long chat yesterday with Dr. Séamus Hegarty, the Bishop of Derry.  I was delighted when he told me not to make blanket statements, as he still gives the pledge at Confirmations. I hope those bishops who do not give it will follow in his footsteps.  It is a great support and helps children to get to 18 without drinking. They can do it; drink is no addition to them. There are more problems because of alcohol abuse than any other substance.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for using her good offices to recommend that the philatelic committee have a rethink.  She took up the cause of duty free when it was not very practical.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this debate.  I also welcome Father Mícheál Mac Gréil and the committee of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, who are in the Visitors' Gallery.</P>
      <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was founded on 18 December 1898, in St. Francis Xavier Church in Upper Gardiner Street, where I spend much of my working day.  It was founded for the purposes of promoting temperance in the family and community.  The movement has made a tremendous contribution to life in Ireland, and particularly to voluntary organisations.  One cannot have a voluntary organisation, particularly in rural Ireland, without having two or three Pioneer members.  This is true of farming organisations, political parties of every persuasion and the Gaelic Athletic Association in particular. There are terrific examples of Pioneers in the GAA, such as the great Christy Ring, who stayed with us on many occasions in Barry's Hotel. Mícheál Ó Hehir, the greatest broadcaster the country ever had, was a Pioneer, as is his successor, Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh.  There are examples in the House in people such as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy O'Hanlon, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dan Wallace, and former European Commissioner and Deputy Ray MacSharry.  Pioneers put their time to good use in voluntary organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have debated the deteriorating drug situation on many occasions, and we were recently informed that there were 400 hospital admissions of first time drug users in 1997.  That is very alarming, and we are all doing our best to contain and reduce those figures.  However, the number <Col N="1260" /> of admissions for drink related diseases is 7,000 for the same year.</P>
    <P>I do not want to bash those who enjoy a drink; I am involved with three establishments that sell liquor.  However, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has 213,000 members, which is a sizable part of the population, and in the last 100 years there have been two million Pioneers.  It is an Irish organisation and has done a lot of good all over the world.  I have visited many countries in my musical career, and I have met Pioneers in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, America and the United Kingdom.  It would be a great example if this committee reconsidered.</P>
    <P>I differ from Senator Cregan in that I considered taking off the pin for my first drink was a deterrent.  However, it is often said that Pioneers are the most decent people in a bar or hotel, and I have found that to be true.</P>

      <P>I look forward to the celebration on 30 May in Croke Park.  The biggest crowd ever to attend Croke Park was 110,000 people for the 50th anniversary of the Pioneers.  I look forward to starting the parade from the GPO; there will be nothing to do that weekend but celebrate.  The Taoiseach accepted an invitation yesterday and said he would be proud to be there.  I congratulate Croke Park for offering the stadium that is our pride and joy.  I congratulate the GAA on the part it has played in the Pioneer association. When I had the honour to play for my county in the early 1960s our trainer always asked us after training how anyone could drink pints after giving their all in training.  It would defy logic.  He taught us that a fit body means a fit mind, a fit mind gives confidence and confidence can move mountains. That is how counties Clare and Kildare have been successful and how County Westmeath won a minor all-Ireland championship for the first time.  It is all about confidence.</P>
      <P>The young generation is great.  I congratulate many young people for not smoking.  I exhort the committee to re-examine its decision.  I congratulate the Minister for making a request to the committee and I hope it is acceded to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a member of the Pioneer association.  There are two elements to this matter which should be addressed.  The substance that will do the greatest harm to the greatest number of people in the next 25 years of their lives is tobacco, next is alcohol and the illegal substances come further down the list.  I work in the third level education sector.  I am far from being a Pioneer.  The intensity of the promotion of alcohol in the third level sector is phenomenal.  The intensity of the consumption is equally phenomenal but we cannot tell 18 and 19 year olds what and what not to do.  However, we should look at the scale of promotion and subsidisation of <Col N="1261" /> student activities by interests which are purely commercial.</P>
      <P>The figures Senator Cassidy quoted are horrendous but do not include the numbers killed or injured in road or other accidents caused by alcohol abuse.</P>
      <P>The other matter I wish to discuss is the extraordinary decision not to publish a commemorative stamp.  Liberal Ireland, so to speak, has always intrigued me with its extraordinary self-consciousness and the matters it wishes to avoid.  I remember buying a Bosco Christmas book for my children.  In the book Bosco goes out to sing Christmas carols but sings &ldquo;Jingle Bells&rdquo; because liberal Ireland did not want to be associated with what might be regarded as religious.  The book was published by RTE.</P>
      <P>Liberal Ireland has built a self-conscious barrier around itself behind which it retreats from everything that has to do with the way it believes we used to be.  Liberal Ireland would pretend that there are not 215,000 members of the Pioneer association just as it would have us believe that only about 5 per cent of the population go to church on Sunday.  It uses the phrase &ldquo;declining Mass-going&rdquo; as if attendance was between the levels in France and Sweden.  Liberal Ireland would also have us believe that Fianna Fáil was dead and buried &mdash; an aspiration I might share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hasten to add the comment was not personal.  I wish the Minister a long, healthy and happy life.</P>
      <P>Liberal Ireland also had us believe, until the evidence flew in its face, that the GAA was dying. For a long time rugby was supposed to be taking over as the sport of the middle class and then it was soccer when the Irish team did so well.  Now liberal Ireland must face the reality that there is only one sporting organisation that has had the courage and the capacity to build a stadium while the others wanted the Government to build one. Incidentally, the £20 million spent on Croke Park by the Exchequer was necessary and correct.  It constitutes only about 15 per cent of the total cost and any organisation that can put up 85 per cent of the cost of such a project deserves assistance.</P>
      <P>It is a great pity that the centenary of the Pioneer Association is not celebrated as it should be because it is part of our history.  There is nothing to be embarrassed about.  It is a good and necessary organisation which has done a lot of good for many people.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Farrell for raising this matter and the Leader of the House for arranging this worthwhile debate.  We should <Col N="1262" /> highlight the importance of the Pioneer association.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that the request to An Post to issue a commemorative stamp to celebrate the centenary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association was not acceded to.  Many important people and events have been commemorated with stamps.  However, there was never a more important request than to commemorate the Pioneer association.</P>
      <P>The Pioneer association is important.  There are many problems in society because more people are not Pioneers.  I have nothing against people who drink.  There are problems of overspending in the health sector.  One has only to look at the casualty units in many hospitals, particularly at the weekends, to see the number of people hurt in road accidents, a large percentage of which are drink related.  If more people took the pledge or simply drank in moderation many of the accidents would not occur.</P>
      <P>Much working time is lost due to drink and companies experience high levels of absenteeism many days of the week.  Some sporting organisations have difficulties arranging games because of problems with drink and bar extensions &mdash; there is a financial element involved for the organisations in this regard.  In the past people were able to enjoy themselves without getting drunk.  There are many broken homes because of drink.</P>
      <P>I am a Pioneer and my parents were also Pioneers. The association must be frank and admit it is disappointed its centenary will not be marked by a commemorative stamp.  I come from a strong sporting background.  Many successful sports people have proved themselves as Pioneers; on the other hand, there are many people who did not deliver their great sporting potential because of drink.  It was a real scourge for some who could have had a brilliant future.  Many sporting organisations and individuals say they cannot celebrate victories without alcohol but of course they can. I have gone through life in sport and other fields and have had many successes, and I did not have to drink to the extent which some people say they have to do.</P>
      <P>We look forward to a great day next year in Croke Park for the Pioneer association.  I urge people to book a ticket.  For many Pioneers it will be their first time in the stadium because it was impossible for them to get tickets for All-Ireland Finals, but this will be bigger than any of those matches.  There will be a tremendous turn out on that day and tickets will be available for those who want to go.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Garda Síochána for its excellent work to ensure our roads are free of drinking drivers for now and the future.  The Garda is bringing home the importance of not drinking when driving.  If people want a healthy life they should join the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association, even later in life.  It is an excellent organisation with great people and we want it to go from strength to strength.</P>

Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil torthaí na hoibre sin le feiscint ar fud na tíre, agus ní amháin maidir le cursaí ólacháin ach maidir leis an dul chun cinn atá déanta sa tír toisc go bhfuil an cumann sin ag saothrú ar son na ndaoine.  Mar sin tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh athrú ar an scéal agus go mbeidh stampa cuimhneacháin ar fáil, mar bheadh náire orainn uilig más rud é nach dtarlaíonn sé sin.</P>
      <P>I compliment and congratulate the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association which has done magnificent work for 100 years.  It would be sad and would underline our inferiority complex if we did not deem its efforts and results worthy of being marked by the State with a commemorative stamp.  I have no doubt our esteemed Minister will make every effort to reverse this decision.</P>
      <P>The association has much more than a temporal mission, it has a spiritual one also and we should not be apologetic about it.  Those of us who are Pioneers have a particular devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and again we should not feel apologetic for that.  Our country and many of our young people are victims of a spiritual famine.  They resort to drugs and alcohol to fill the vacuum left by lack of motivation and spiritual challenge.  They are easy victims of the purveyors of drugs and those who would glamorise alcohol as a remedy or potion for all our ills and inadequacies.  The PR people of the drinks industry could adopt a much more responsible attitude.  We accept cigarettes are a health hazard; will anyone honestly suggest the abuse of alcohol does not also constitute such a hazard, both mentally and physically?  That message should be included in all drinks advertising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the drunk is often the stock in trade of the community, but he is also a nightmare for a family.  There is nothing particularly funny about a ruined life or a shattered family but that is one result of the abuse of alcohol which we want to hide.  A few days ago we learned, from the results of a survey conducted in a provincial town, that 18 per cent of those under age 13 had experimented with drugs but 40 per cent under that age had taken alcohol.  To me that sounds an alarm bell which this society ignores at its peril. The greatest challenge facing the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association today is one of courage, being prepared to stand up and say what we mean.  If we do not, we leave it to others &mdash; syndicates, big business and those with a vested economic interest but no interest in the welfare of our <Col N="1264" /> young people and society &mdash; to exploit the situation.</P>
    <P>The association makes no inherent criticism of anyone who takes a drink &mdash; or I have never heard it.  I have never encountered any disrespect because I wear a Pioneer pin.  No one has jested at it.  If a round of drinks is being purchased in a public house, the first comment is that the purchaser knows I do not drink.  I have found nothing but respect, and in some ways admiration, but I do not think we wear it for that reason.  It is important to bear witness to what we believe but there is a tendency today to aim for the lowest common denominator.  As a nation with a proud history which overcame so many challenges of oppression and deprivation, we would not do justice to those who went before us if we did not bear witness now, when there is such need for a body like the Pioneer association.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming here at short notice because, in doing so, she has also shown esteem for the work the organisation is doing.  I wish it well for its meeting in Croke Park next year and have no doubt the attendance will be every bit as big as it was 50 years ago.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, here and I welcome her putting her considerable weight behind the request that An Post review its decision.  In a curious way I welcome the decision because without it the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association would not be mentioned in the Seanad or anywhere else.  It gives us an opportunity to highlight its excellent work, so out of evil will come some good &mdash; not that I suggest the group which made the decision did so in an evil way.  It did, however, indicate a lack of understanding of the role, work and involvement in the community at parish, county and national level of the PTAA.</P>
      <P>It might look a little funny that those of us speaking are pioneers but each of us has taken a decision to become such.  I became a pioneer for a specific reason.  The role, participation, involvement, leadership and goodness of the association must be recognised.  A previous speaker said that Pioneers might be a dying breed, but that is not the case.  At a recent function held by the association in west Cork where I come from, one speaker told us that five or six years ago the number of people taking pledges was reducing but it has increased over the past two years.  The organisation has been revitalised and hence good work is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scourge of over-indulgence is the problem created by drink in society.  The four women who sought the establishment of the association 100 years ago saw the destruction of families as the reason for doing so and that remains the case. However, the PTAA also includes abstinence <Col N="1265" /> from drugs for life.  Could one ask for better for young people at an early stage of the development of their attitude to life?  I congratulate Senator Farrell for raising the issue and bringing this debate about.  I also congratulate the Leader and the leader of the Opposition who most forthrightly supported the debate.  I welcome the members of the PTAA to the House.  The Minister has considerable persuasive powers.  The An Post committee made an unenlightened, imprudent decision that was an insult to pioneers.  The Minister should give direction to the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to speak but as no woman has spoken on this and women were behind the start of the campaign, I felt a little gender balance was necessary.  In terms of age it is also important that I speak.  I am proud to say that I am a pioneer and a product of two pioneers. I do not wear my badge, which is the first thing that is noticed, not because I am ashamed of it but, as the Minister will appreciate, when getting dressed in the morning it is not the first thing on my mind.  I wear it on special occasions.</P>
      <P>Senator Cregan discussed the company he keeps in terms of pioneers and non-pioneers and, while it enlightened me to a certain extent, it made me wonder about the friends I keep because I am often asked out by them and I realise now that they appreciate the taxi service I provide at the end of the evening.  I will discuss that with them over Christmas.  I am delighted that Fr. Mac Gréil is in the House as I had the privilege of being a student of his at NUI, Maynooth. It was not due to his influence that I took the pledge a number of years ago.  I got through my student days and a nursing career and can vouch for the fact that quite a number of nurses do not drink.  We do not always wear our pins and while it may not be cool to say that one is a pioneer, the PTAA is not dead because a large number of people do not drink.  Any time we have the opportunity, particularly the morning after the night before, we emphasise the fact that it is great to get up and be as coherent as is possible at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m.</P>
      <P>There are stamps for almost every occasion and I do not see a problem with the committee agreeing to a commemorative stamp to recognise this important occasion in 1998.  As a young person, one is called a freak or a dry in jest but it is important, especially in the alcoholic culture in which we live, that balance is maintained.  It would be a good gesture by the committee to reconsider its attitude in terms of the stamp.</P>

    <Title>Northern Ireland: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before beginning, I am sure the House would wish to join with me in offering our warmest congratulations to both John Hume and David Trimble on their becoming Nobel laureates.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland has benefited enormously from the leadership shown by John Hume and David Trimble in the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement.  John Hume has been, as the Nobel committee expressed it, the principal architect of the structures that now comprise the Agreement.  First Minister David Trimble now has the onerous task, together with Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, of leading on the implementation of crucial areas of the Agreement.</P>
      <P>Today's debate gives us an opportunity to discuss where the Agreement stands now, to review our achievements over the past year and to explore how we might get through our current difficulties.  Quite frankly, I would have wished to be able to report to the House that the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is proceeding on schedule.  After the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement, which so clearly now embodies the will of the people North and South, I would have expected the Executive to be meeting at least in shadow form; likewise, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council to have held their inaugural meetings in shadow form.  I would have expected more significant progress to have been made on the normalisation of the security, including a clearer start on the process of decommissioning paramilitary weapons.</P>
      <P>Many of the Northern parties have done their utmost and have been frustrated at the lack of progress, beyond establishing the Assembly.  All parties need to show a strong commitment to fulfilling their obligations under the Agreement, and not creating unnecessary difficulties for others.  It is highly undesirable to give any impression that a political vacuum has been allowed to develop or that any party would be allowed to hollow out or evade its obligations under the Agreement.  There must be a credibility about the implementation process, which is what we have been seeking to secure over the past few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Similarly, if we continue to focus on what divides and polarises, in terms of the Agreement, it will be difficult to make progress on its implementation. I have, from the moment of the achievement of the Agreement, continuously emphasised that partnership, equality and mutual respect lie at the heart of the Agreement.  To make the Agreement a reality, we must make these concepts a reality.  The Irish Government, in fulfilling its commitments under the Agreement, has sought to do so in a spirit of partnership. We do not see our position on the North-South <Col N="1267" /> aspect of the Agreement as threatening and we have no intention of engaging in a onesided takeover of the areas involved.</P>
    <P>We have always said this is a balanced Agreement. It recognises the substantial difference between equally legitimate political aspirations. We seek to accommodate these aspirations through meaningful institutions, while also believing that the practical benefits of these arrangements are clear.</P>
    <P>The North-South Ministerial Council will bring the Government and those with executive responsibilities in Northern Ireland together in equality.  Council decisions will be by agreement, all operating in accordance with the rules for democratic authority and accountability in force in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Oireachtas, respectively.  The Government in all its dealings on these matters has sought to be realistic and businesslike.  We want the relationship between North and South to be similarly disposed. Were our current proposals in this regard to implementation bodies to be published today, I would defy anybody to conclude that they were excessive or threatening.  They are eminently reasonable.</P>
    <P>However, there must be a balance between the different Strands of the Agreement.  Nobody could fail to recognise this and those who seek to empty Strand Two of substance need to consider carefully the risks they are taking because it is a very important part of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Northern Ireland Assembly, we would wish to see everyone involved in politics there working to the same objective, the betterment of the people of Northern Ireland.  In the ordinary political landscape diversity of view, even healthy partisanship, is to be welcomed.  The basis of political discourse is, of course, people with similar views coalescing and forming alliances to get things done.  It would be a very dull political environment if every party was of the same persuasion.  However, it is very difficult to comprehend politics that has stagnation at its heart.</P>
    <P>In any evolving situation, and the political situation in Northern Ireland has evolved radically in recent years, politics must move and shift with the changing times and this change must be embraced.  As part of this, all violence, political and sectarian, must be in the past.  The Northern Ireland Assembly provides the opportunity for politicians from all the parties to work on behalf of their constituents, for the people of Northern Ireland as a whole and to forge better relations on the island of Ireland and, through the British-Irish Council, between the people of these islands.  In short, we want to get on with it because, ultimately, politics is not about making shapes on the tightrope, it is about delivering a service to the public.</P>
    <P>As Senators may be aware, our negotiations on implementation bodies and areas for co-operation have centred mainly on the areas identified <Col N="1268" /> in the Good Friday Agreement.  I do not intend now to add substantively to what I have earlier or to go into the details of our negotiating strategy, but I will say that a considerable amount of progress has been made and that in so far as full agreement has not been reached, it is not because of lack of enthusiasm, homework or flexibility on the part of the Government.  It is disappointing that full agreement has not been reached yet, but work will continue and we will try and achieve agreement at the earliest time.</P>
    <P>There are many horizontal issues, such as financial, legal and personnel issues on which, again, a considerable amount of work has been done, but until final agreement has been reached on the areas, they cannot be brought to finality, and of course many of the issues will have to be considered carefully with staff interests.</P>
    <P>As has been said many times, in addition to the practical benefits they bring, the North-South arrangements provide institutional expression to the identity that northern Nationalists share with people in the South.  It has been long recognised, going back to Éamon de Valera and other statesmen, that the wishes to belong, both of Unionists and Nationalists in Northern Ireland, divergent as they are, can live together more easily if Ireland and Britain can live closer together too.  Successive Governments have been very conscious of the importance of closer relations and co-operation. The speech by Prime Minister Blair to the Joint Sitting of the Houses of the Oireachtas was a fitting reflection of the new departure in relations between our two countries represented by the Good Friday Agreement.  The British-Irish Council will provide a useful forum to promote the harmonious and mutually beneficial development of the totality of relationships among the people of these islands.</P>
    <P>The conclusion of the Good Friday Agreement was one of the most important developments in these islands and, coupled with the movement towards devolution in Britain, I hope and believe it will lead to a new spirit of co-operation and friendship between the different component parts of these islands.  It will be difficult in future for anyone to take the position that Britain equals England or London.  In future Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have institutional expression of their own distinctive political personalities. The British-Irish Council will have the potential to evolve over time while fully respecting sovereignty, and it may contribute to the more effective representation of regional as well as national interests.</P>
    <P>While naturally, in view of the 31 October deadline, our main focus to date has been on the North-South dimension, the Strand Three dimensions, the British-Irish Council and the Intergovernmental Conference have also received attention and will be further developed in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The coming months will also see activity intensify in the legislative area.  In addition to the legislation necessary to implement Strand Two <Col N="1269" /> arrangements, the Government's legislative programme will include the establishment of the Human Rights Commission, equal status legislation and the amendment of the Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956.  Other legislative measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights may be decided on in the light of the provisions of the Agreement, which requires us to consider the possible incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into law; and the implementation of the recommendations of the committee which will review the Offences Against the State Acts.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the helpful contributions by Opposition parties and party leaders to this process and I would also like to acknowledge and thank Senators, especially the Leaders in the House, for their ongoing support for the difficult process upon which we are embarked.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult process but since it began, there have been many periods where it appears to have stalled and where some began to lose faith. However, it has survived.  At crucial times we have, all of us, been able to take the actions necessary to move on.  We have, on all sides, had to take actions that we did not necessarily want to take and we know, and acknowledge, the pain and suffering caused to others by some of the actions we have taken.  However, all of the actions and all the risks have been taken to consolidate peace and work towards a better future for ourselves and for generations to come.</P>
    <P>With regard to decommissioning, we believed, in concluding the Good Friday Agreement, that we had found a way to provide the conditions and the formula whereby political progress and decommissioning would and could take place, sooner rather than later.  Eight months on from the signing of the Agreement, it is disappointing that the issue could remain an obstacle.  If demilitarisation is the objective, nobody can opt out of making a contribution to it.  Everybody knows the situation.</P>
    <P>I return to what I said earlier.  All the parties to the negotiations, all those who signed up to the Agreement, all those who continue to support the Agreement, must act in a spirit of partnership. We must recognise that for all of us there are difficulties and that stalemate is the enemy of everyone.  The progress we have made, we have made together, bringing our supporters and the people with us.</P>
    <P>On 22 May the people of this island, North and South, gave us their support because they wanted accommodation.  We have a duty to the people to move forward together, to implement all of the Agreement, in the letter and in the spirit, and to build that lasting accommodation.  At all stages of the peace process it was agreed that a normal civil society was the ultimate goal, and on the Nationalist and republican side that this would involve complete demilitarisation.  An armed peace is not demilitarisation.  If the Agreement and its institutions are to work, then their establishment must be accompanied by a tangible commitment <Col N="1270" /> to dismantling on all sides the structures and arsenals of conflict.</P>
    <P>I thank Seámus Mallon for his special contribution. This phase of the negotiations, which is not as high profiled as the earlier ones, started when the 31 October deadline was missed.  The discussions began with a round table session at Stormont on 2 November.  Being the first Taoiseach to visit Stormont since Seán Lemass in the middle 1960s, I knew this phase would be difficult. I did not know it would be so painfully long.</P>
    <P>At this stage I hope we are near to concluding matters, otherwise there will be a break for Christmas without a conclusion.  Seámus Mallon was to attend hospital for a very serious operation last Friday.  He postponed it over the weekend so that we could make progress on Monday.  He then further delayed it but his medical consultants have told him this morning he must stop work after today and undergo the operation first thing in the morning.  This week he has worked every day for 18 to 19 hours.  If I have spoken to him once I have spoken to him 50 times.  I wish to put my thanks to him on the record.  Séamus has been a long time in politics and is not as young as he would like to be.  He has taken a huge amount of pressure in this calendar year and it must now end for him with a serious operation.  I know he feels strongly about his responsibilities to his job, his party and to the island.  He was in horrendous pain this week and last week when he visited Government Buildings.  I hope we conclude the agreement because it has set a deadline and I cannot continue to negotiate without the leader of nationalism and the Deputy First Minister.  We must conclude discussions today and I hope people will remain focused.</P>
    <P>I will clarify what we are trying to conclude today.  There are three important elements; first, the number of departments and their titles so that we can be absolutely clear who gets what under the d'Hondt system &mdash; to put it crudely, it is to make sure that everyone gets a share of the spoils and that people will see their positions.  Then we can say who will make up the executive when it is up and running next year; second, the make up of the North-South ministerial and implementation bodies.  Many people are confused by these words; they mean the bodies that are legislated for and the bodies to be set up on an all-Ireland basis.  For example, if we are talking about tourism, it will be tourism on an all-Ireland basis and legislated for in Westminster and in the Oireachtas, and third, there is co-operation.  This means that in the North-South Ministerial Council ministers from the Executive and from this Government will be working together to make all these things work into the future.  We are trying to negotiate these elements together because, since 2 November, I believed we would never finalise the agreements if we were to deal with them separately.</P>
    <P>It was said in the other House that if we succeed that is good, and then we will move to another stage.  After Christmas we would try to <Col N="1271" /> deal with the legislative measures I have mentioned, the Executive and the decommissioning issues, another phase of tortuous negotiations I have no doubt but at least it would be a clear indication of moving on.  If we do not succeed we must not panic but I would be very disappointed and so would everyone else.  As we all know with the North, it is not one day at a time but one step a week.  It is a painfully slow and tortuous process but that is how it has to be and I believe it will be worth it in the end.  I also want to send best wishes and thanks to Seamus Mallon for his huge commitment this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  I thank him for his full and informative account which has brought us up to date on the current state of developments.  I want to pay special tribute to the Taoiseach because he has made an extraordinary contribution over the past year.  He was a crucial player at all of the key stages.  He made a contribution that was fearless in getting us to where we are here today.  He built on the foundations of his predecessors, all of whom worked to getting us to the position where the Taoiseach helped to bring the Good Friday Agreement to a reality.  I pay a very warm tribute to him for that.</P>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in sending good wishes for a successful operation and speedy recovery to Seamus Mallon.  Mr. Mallon is known to virtually everyone in these Houses.  He was a Member of this House on one occasion and he was a member of various forums.  We also know him as someone who was always there in the darkest hours, someone who has great staying power and a huge commitment.  He is someone who has always worked through the political process and someone who believed in the primacy of politics, even when it was not easy to do so. Above all, Seamus Mallon is a consensus builder who is prepared to work step by step building up relationships with his opponents in social ways and other small ways so that when the big issues arise, a basis of trust has been built up.  When the history of these times is written the great hero of our times will be Seamus Mallon who has been, and continues to be, a patriot and a parliamentarian of the very highest quality.  On behalf of my party and myself I send our very best wishes for a successful operation, a very speedy recovery and we salute what he has done so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see why the Taoiseach is in some ways frustrated that things are not moving as quickly as he and everyone else would like.  The people of the North who have endured so much for so long would like to see stability and certainty where people can return to the normal everyday boring, mundane things of politics.  Sadly, we have not reached that stage yet.  Anyone looking back and trying to put where we are into perspective will see just how enormous has been the progress in the last year when we think of how difficult it was during most of the previous 30 years; <Col N="1272" /> when we think of the great starts that did not lead to success, when we see the various steps taken along the way, then what has happened in the past year is truly extraordinary.  Who would have thought one or two years ago that the Taoiseach being a frequent visitor to Stormont would become something we almost take for granted? Who would have thought that the sight of leaders of unionism coming south to talk to the political leaders in these Houses would become almost a normal everyday occurrence?  That simply would have been inconceivable in the past.  Who would have thought that David Trimble and Gerry Adams would meet in a businesslike manner even though they may not like each other?  Who would have thought this would have been possible a year ago?  Things will only become normal when Ian Paisley drinks his glass of bitter orange in the Members' bar here.  Even though we have had a debate on the Pioneers earlier today I am sure Members would still welcome him here.  When that day arrives, we will have reached full normality.</P>
    <P>I want to tell the Taoiseach not to be frustrated or depressed by what is happening because the rate of progress over the past year has been extraordinary and we are very close to the end.  At this stage what separates the parties is far less than what holds them together and the range of agreement is enormous.  The momentum to complete the work is unstoppable.</P>
    <P>Everyone knew when the Good Friday Agreement was signed that there would be setbacks and difficulties, but a framework was put in place and momentum was built up.  That framework is strong enough to sustain all the difficulties which have arisen.  The momentum established by President Clinton, our own Government, all the political leaders in the Republic and the British Prime Minister is still there and it is sufficiently strong to see this process to a successful conclusion. Perhaps this will not happen as quickly as we would all wish, but it will happen.</P>
    <P>Other things have changed.  Violence is no longer an option for anyone in the North.  In all the talk of decommissioning no one seriously believes that the Provisional IRA wants or can return to using the gun and the bullet.  The people have spoken.  Their own communities will reject them if they try to do that.  People now see that so much progress has been made by constitutional and political means and we are so close to a consensus that the very thought of any organisation now resorting to the old, despicable methods of violence is out of the question.  The message should go forth from both Houses that any attempts by the so-called Real IRA or Continuity IRA to get back to these practices will be met in a most draconian way by the forces of law and order and by the authorities on both sides of the Border.  That is what the people want and that is what they have voted for.  They will not settle for less.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the centre in the North holds.  It is vitally important that, whatever <Col N="1273" /> breakdown in relationships or straining in relationships there were between the Unionist Party and the SDLP, these difficulties are solved immediately.  If the parties in the centre hold then the Agreement can work.  Those parties in the extremes will come in but they will only do so if the stability is there.  It is vitally important that those relationships are restored and I hope they have been because these are the parties to whom most people look for stability and for the continuation of the process.</P>
    <P>We have seen a many great things over the past year.  We have seen the total normalisation of our relationships with Britain.  The British Prime Minister correctly pointed out when he was here that Northern Ireland distorted what should be the normal relationships between two friendly nations who have a great deal in common, a relationship of equality between the two countries.  In recent times we witnessed a willingness of parties on all sides, particularly the Fianna Fáil Party, to look at issues in a way in which they never looked at them before.  Senior members in the Fianna Fail Party have had an enormous change in attitude when they begin to openly talk about the Commonwealth and the possibility of Ireland rejoining it.  Many politicians in my party in the past, especially James Dillon, believed that the commonwealth was the best framework within which good relations could be brought about between the two parts of the island.  They were thinking of the English speaking commonwealth where many Irish people were in senior positions in Australia, Canada and so on, but it did not work out that way.  Perhaps Europe is now a more logical framework within which co-operation between North and South can be developed.  The fact that the Commonwealth is being considered in this way indicates an opening of minds, which is welcome.</P>
    <P>I want to look on the positive side and say that we have made enormous progress.  The great prize is within the grasp of all those striving for it.  I believe that this time next year we will be looking at a process that has been brought to a successful conclusion.  Hopefully the day when Ian Paisley takes a drink in the Members' Bar in Leinster House may not be very far off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach took time out from his busy schedule today to come to the Seanad.  It is opportune that we have a debate on the current situation in the North of Ireland in the run up to Christmas.  This year people in the North can look forward to a peaceful, happy and holy Christmas.  I sincerely hope that what has happened since the Good Friday Agreement will bring peace and stability to the North and, indeed, to the whole island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been setbacks since the Agreement was signed.  There have been delays in the implementation of various strands of the Agreement. Nevertheless, great strides have been made and there must be continuance of discussions between <Col N="1274" /> the various parties North and South.  Nothing that is good happens overnight.  All those involved in negotiating a reasonable, peaceful end to the Good Friday Agreement will face delays and problems.  It would be a mistake to think that one could change the attitudes, relationships and state of mind of people in a short few months.  In various countries throughout the world peace is a thing of the past.  People are experiencing great difficulties in places where attempts are being made to resolve conflicts, whether in Kosovo, Europe, the Middle East or Iraq.  People must trust each other.  Trust must be built up over time, it cannot be turned on like a tap.</P>
    <P>Political parties in the South must make it known that they support those involved in negotiations in the North.  I reiterate the feeling in the South for Séamus Mallon, not forgetting the work done by John Hume, David Trimble and others in the North.  We cannot forget the work carried out by civil servants and advisers, people who worked late into the night to discuss the nuances of the Agreement.  Those people have brought together the different strands of society in the North to a position where trust is now beginning to emerge.  In the next few months the building up of that trust will bring together all the strands on which the Good Friday Agreement was presented to the Irish people.  It is hoped the Agreement will bring peace and prosperity to the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must not forget the part played by President Clinton, his advisers and Senator Mitchell in bringing together all the strands.  The President did a great amount of work in relation to the North of Ireland.  He has, however, negated a lot of this good work by what he did last night in Iraq.  Unfortunately, he could not bring President Netanyahu with him on the Middle-East negotiations and we do not know what will happen in Iraq.</P>
    <P>I congratulate all those involved in the Good Friday Agreement negotiations.  I hope that in the lead up to Christmas the wishes of the majority of the Irish people will be satisfied in terms of the implementation of the various strands of the Agreement.  I thank the Taoiseach for allowing this debate to take place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to put on record what has happened during the course of this year.  I reiterate the tributes paid to the Taoiseach and to all those involved in the negotiations.  What we have on this island at present is an overwhelming imperative for peace.  That imperative was created by a democratic decision of the peoples of this island. This is something over which no one else has control. It is not in the gift of anyone to turn the clock backwards away from peace and towards violence.  We should remind ourselves that every day of peace has been wrested from 30 years of violence.  There has been eight months of peace apart from the tragic events of Omagh, and one <Col N="1275" /> or two others.  Unfortunately, we are now in one of those unpredictable, but not unexpected, blips that happen during the currency of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>We are now considering the narrow issue of decommissioning.  We are expanding it a little by relating it to demilitarisation and so on.  The way forward is to widen it more.  Within Northern Ireland there is the North-South element and the east-west element.  Perhaps we should develop the east-west approach a bit more.  This has been the least discussed approach up to now.  We do not know how it will relate to the new assemblies in Scotland and Wales.  It seems to me that this move forward would give sustenance and encouragement and cause confidence building in terms of our relationship with the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>On the possibility of Ireland rejoining the Commonwealth, I am sorry the Taoiseach has left because I would ask him to take that matter off the agenda.  It might have been a good idea when the leader of the party opposite raised it 50 or 60 years ago.  I want to put on the record that the Commonwealth is about as relevant to us now as the Organisation of African Unity, in other words, it has its own importance but it does not relate to this country.  It is a meaningless, impotent and sterile organisation as far as this country is concerned and should be taken off the agenda. It has nothing to do with the past, future or present.  It has relativity in all directions but it does not move us forward one inch.</P>
    <P>I believe that the question of parity of esteem is important.  I also believe we should keep stating the point that decommissioning is an aspiration but as long as the guns are silent and the bombs are not used &mdash; even while they remain a threat &mdash; people are in some sense safe from the day to day violence we knew and experienced over the last 30 years.</P>
    <P>Apart from both islands approach, we need to look at the sub-governmental approach to broader bodies.  I have recently been involved in a series of meeting with the Confederation of Irish Industries, IBEC and the trade union movement, ICTU in Belfast and Dublin, regarding ways in which we can move forward together.  This has created a great sense of confidence building and a sense of community about shared and joint objectives.  These things will put the other issues in a different context if we can all move forward together and in a sense of partnership.  People involved in industry, trade unions, churches, sporting organisations all have to do their bit.  The price of peace is very simply what people think is the price of peace, plus another little bit.  If every person is asked what they are prepared to do for democratic stable peace on this island and if they say &ldquo;This is how far I am prepared to go&rdquo;, then the answer is that you must go that quarter of an inch further.  If everybody does that we will have achieved what we set out to do.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we should begin by trying to get a broader movement of people between North <Col N="1276" /> and South, recognition of professional qualifications, recognition of people's contribution and joint entry into third level colleges.  The introduction of the euro could be another stumbling block we could have done without.  As long as the UK remains outside, it creates another aberration in that process.  We can welcome this year as being an extraordinary move forward with the Good Friday Agreement and let us hope next year is better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I spoke early last May to a large group of people in Chicago.  I was asked to speak for five minutes and explain to them the position in Northern Ireland.  It was a challenge and I did my best, but what impressed me was the number of letters I received at the time of the referendum from American people expressing how much they understood what Northern Ireland was about and what a huge step forward that that vote meant and why democracy will ensure that there will never be violence in Ireland again.  These letters were from people who did not understand the Irish scene.  We must not ever forget the enormous steps forward that have been taken.  What has taken place this year was the result of courage by a number of people who, over the last few years, were willing to take their courage into their hands and attempt to solve this problem by going against advice from so many people.</P>
      <P>At this meeting I asked a person what brought about their success, and after some thought he replied with a quote &ldquo;Whether you believe you can or whether you believe you can't, you are right.&rdquo; He was talking about success in business terms.  However, what he was saying could be applied to a football match; if you say I have no chance of winning, then I have not.  If we go into the match saying &ldquo;we can win&rdquo;, then we will.  I believe while courage was what was needed in the past, what we now need is confidence to go forward.</P>
      <P>I am not as confident as other members that there will be no return to violence, but if we have confidence and courage to believe that we can achieve this &mdash; particularly those who are actively involved in this on a day to day basis &mdash; then between that courage and that confidence we can move towards actually achieving it.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on his words today.  He talked about partnership, equality and mutual respect.  He has shown that during the past year.  I believe they are the foundations on what this Agreement and this step forward will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want like to pay tribute to the commitment and work the Taoiseach has shown over the last year.  He has to be commended on the difficult and hard work he has done.  It is typical of his style and it has paid dividends in this case.  As we approach the year's end we ask ourselves what has been achieved.  In my opinion, much has been achieved.  The Good Friday Agreement was a milestone in the history of the <Col N="1277" /> relationship between Britain and Ireland and the combination of determined and involved efforts by successful Governments, particularly those led by Fianna Fáil.  We must continually remind ourselves that the Agreement is not static.  It is not just a piece of paper that was signed and that everything from there on will run smoothly.  The Agreement is dynamic.  It is a process, not a product. It is an ongoing learning experience for everybody, in other words, it is essentially experiential. If this concept is not grasped then I believe much confusion arises.</P>
      <P>The Government's commitment and attachment to the Agreement continues to command the highest priority and work is intensive with the British Government and all other parties involved to ensure that all elements of the Agreement are implemented.  The implementation of the process is ongoing across all elements of the Agreement.  The Northern Ireland Act which underpins in British legislation the constitutional, institutional, equality and human rights aspects of the Agreement is now on the British Statute Book.  The criminal justice review and the international decommissioning commission continue to do their work while the Patten commission is progressing well and is consulting widely with both sides of the community in the North on the crucial issue of the future of policing and the reform of the RUC.  This, to me, is one of the most crucial elements of this entire Agreement.</P>
      <P>A central point of the whole Agreement is the implementation and operation of North/South bodies.  As yet there is no agreement but intensive negotiations continue behind the scenes to end the impasse.</P>
      <P>The whole issue of decommissioning and the formation of a shadow executive also remains unresolved and one inextricably linked to the North/South bodies.  Senator O'Toole mentioned three things with which I agree.  The first is the fact that although the guns are still there, they remain silent, and that is a step forward.  There are a number of armies in the North, not just the Irish Republican Army, and when decommissioning occurs it must occur right across the board.  I agreed with him when he stated there must be more emphasis on east/west rather than North/South links and the Taoiseach recently emphasised this in his speech in Liverpool. Senator O'Toole mentioned parity of esteem between the two equal nations.  I agree with his comments on the Commonwealth which has nothing to do with us whatsoever.  We are now in a dynamic Europe.</P>
      <P>Given the overwhelming endorsement of the Agreement on both sides of the Border, all parties owe it to the people of Ireland to ensure that the terms as voted on are seen to be implemented and a new Dáil well and truly realised.  I support all the work that has been done.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Senator Cassidy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Taoiseach and Senator Manning in wishing Seamus Mallon a <Col N="1278" /> successful operation.  He has done so much for the affairs in Northern Ireland over the last number of years.  He was a distinguished Member of this House.  I said on one occasion that he was probably the best speaker this House ever had.  I wish his wife and family well during their time of great concern.</P>
      <P>As one who lives on the Ulster Border I must say the Good Friday Agreement has given hope to people who live along the Ulster Border and in the province of Ulster.  It has been eight months of tremendous progress, with the silencing of the guns and confidence building in our communities, sporting organisations and everyone involved in commerce.  It is giving tourists a certain image of Ireland &mdash; that people can come here to a friendly destination, to a peace loving country.  The previous image held by Australians, Americans and others was that there was trouble in one part of Ireland while there was none in the other.  That image greatly damaged our tourism industry.  However, they are now beginning to see the fruits of peace and there are signs that the coming year will be tremendous.</P>
      <P>The day the entire island voted for the Agreement was historic.  We could feel in our bones that something special was happening.  Hopefully, Good Friday, the day on which the Agreement was concluded, will be a day we will cherish and never forget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate.  I also welcome the Taoiseach's visit to the Seanad to outline the current situation in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Good Friday Agreement was concluded at a difficult time for the Taoiseach.  His mother had just died but despite such personal difficulty he managed to conclude the Agreement with the parties involved.  He deserves to be complimented on his achievement at such a time.  The other parties involved should also be complimented, particularly John Hume and David Trimble who have since been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Both fully deserved the honour.  It is gratifying that the two strands of opinion in Northern Ireland were recognised in this joint award.  Both men are at the coalface of politics in Northern Ireland on behalf of their communities.  Despite the extremely different views of these communities on many matters, the majority of the people have a common aspiration to live together in peace and harmony.  That was clearly demonstrated in the referenda on the Agreement when the overwhelming majority of the people on this island voted for peace.  The parties involved in this process must continue to focus on that fundamental issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Agreement is of huge political significance. It is the result of years of discussion and negotiations in which many people were involved. The problem arose 75 years ago but its history dates to 500 years ago so attitudes are ingrained in the minds of the people.  The move to bring people together to focus on peace and harmony <Col N="1279" /> and to work for the benefit of the people of Northern Ireland is extremely important.  If there can be continued confidence, belief and trust that peace is achievable, it will be achievable. Undoubtedly, there will be difficulties on the way but if people think positively and are sufficiently focused, the result will be peace and harmony and people working together for the betterment of their respective communities.  I have confidence that this will happen.</P>
    <P>A number of difficulties have arisen already, particularly with regard to decommissioning. Senator Lydon is correct that decommissioning must take place and that it is not a one sided affair.  This issue is discussed as if only one group, a Nationalist group, has arms but there are arms on both sides.  There must be a fairer discussion of this issue.  I hope the parties involved will see the wisdom of making a token gesture of decommissioning. However, the fact that the guns are silent is a positive feature and we should focus on the positive, not the negative, features.</P>
    <P>Politics is about people and, as it was once defined, is the art of the possible.  This is a situation where the possible can be tested.  With will, full commitment, a heightened sense of direction and the assistance which has been provided from outside these islands, there could be a successful conclusion to this process.</P>
    <P>Like the Taoiseach, I would like to have seen greater progress in the implementation of the Agreement.  It is disappointing that the executive, the British-Irish Council and the Ministerial Council are not yet in place.  I hope that the politicians involved will recognise that politics is about people and that they must do what is best for the people so they can live together in peace and harmony.  They will enjoy greater economic advancement if peace continues.  It is fundamentally important that they keep that target in focus at all times.</P>
    <P>It is a trying time for politicians.  Indeed, I wish to send my good wishes to Seamus Mallon.  He has given a huge commitment to politics in Northern Ireland.  I thought he looked quite tired and stressed when he gave an interview at 1.30 a.m. during the negotiations when it was thought that everything had been signed and sealed.  However, overnight it all changed and, on a personal level, that type of stress takes a toll on politicians, who are only human.  I join my colleagues in wishing him well.</P>
    <P>The Good Friday Agreement is the anchor that will hold the situation in Northern Ireland together.  It is the formula under which progress can take place.  The various bodies to be formed under the Agreement will be the vehicles for peace and the enablement of the communities to live together in harmony.</P>
    <P>I hope everybody concerned, particularly those who at this time are creating unhelpful stirrings, will seriously reflect on their position and on what happened in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years.  They should look to the next 30 years and <Col N="1280" /> consider whether they want to be part of a negative situation in Northern Ireland or if they want to take courageous and constructive positions and look positively to the future with a specific view of their island and how they want their people to live.  If they do that and if they have faith and confidence in themselves, they will be successful in achieving their aim.  All politicians on the island have a responsibility to ensure that anything they say or do will be said and done with a view to helping the process.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Taoiseach on the superb work he did on the Good Friday Agreement.  His was a safe pair of hands in the negotiations on the Agreement.  While I might disagree with him about many other areas of policy, the enthusiasm, ideas, vigour and vision he displayed were a great credit to him.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the two Nobel laureates, John Hume and David Trimble, for their contribution, as well as the Deputy First Minister, Séamus Mallon, who was very articulate in the negotiations.  I acknowledge the release from prison of Danny McNamee, who exemplifies the impact of the Troubles.  He has spent over a dozen years in prison although clearly he was innocent.  It is good to see that situation reversed.</P>
      <P>We are currently two months behind the deadlines that were set in the Good Friday Agreement. There is no executive, North-South Ministerial Council, joint implementation bodies or British-Irish Intergovernmental Council, despite two months having elapsed since the deadline for their establishment.  It is dangerous to set deadlines because it is always difficult in situations such as this to meet them.</P>
      <P>Progress has been made by the two sovereign Governments.  The two Governments introduced legislation arising from the Good Friday Agreement. The British Government began the process of demilitarisation with the return of troops to barracks, the ending of the practice of the RUC carrying rifles &mdash; a good first step towards an unarmed police force &mdash; and the dismantling of the various fortresses in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is a moot point that those people who have been elected to the Assembly with the brief of implementing certain aspects of the Good Friday Agreement unfortunately have not done so.  They have not shown the same alacrity as the people of Northern Ireland who supported the Agreement in the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the remarks made about links to the Commonwealth, I agree entirely with those who say that we should not think of re-entering the Commonwealth under British leadership or in any other capacity.  We should be looking at the provisos of the Good Friday Agreement, dealing with east-west relations and building the new legal entities in conjunction with those entities which are to be established in Scotland, Wales, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, and with Northern Ireland and the Republic.  We would have a commonwealth of nations here with <Col N="1281" /> which we could interlink effectively under the umbrella of the European Union.  That is the way we should go, not in the direction of the colonial British Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>We should recognise that not everything is realisable within deadlines and should regard this process as a continuum.  We should be pro-active in the sense of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund which we approved here last week, through which we would invite American citizens to universities North and South where they could benefit from peace and reconciliation studies.  We should look at the European Convention on Human Rights and recognise professional qualifications from either side of the Border.  For these there are no deadlines, they are part of a continuum. All of us, North and South, can do our bit to ensure that what was written into the history books on Good Friday becomes a reality for all sides on this island.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak but I was lured in by the contribution of my distinguished friend, Senator Costello.

      <P>To my amazement, I met Éamon Ó Cuív in the corridor and he said that he agreed with every word.  I remarked that his grandfather would be revolving at 78 rpm in his grave if he heard that.  He replied that he would not, that his grandfather had regretted deeply that we left the Commonwealth because he felt that it cemented the break between the northern and southern sections.  I seriously think this is an idea worth exploring.  It certainly should not be dismissed. Senator Costello dismissed it in a reasonable way but there are others who dismiss it in ways which would antagonise a large number of people in Northern Ireland and even a few of us in the South.</P>
      <P>The reason I think it is a good idea is that in order to solve the problem in Northern Ireland, the circle must be squared.  It is a paradox.  You must simultaneously satisfy two completely conflicting desires which are not altogether rational but which are part of an emotional complex.  One tradition feels a thrill at &ldquo;The Soldiers' Song&rdquo;, the Tricolour and Uachtarán na hÉireann while the other experiences exactly the same psychological surge at the prospect of her gracious majesty Queen Elizabeth II and the British national anthem.  How do you resolve that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It always seemed that the one thing which can be done is to explore the possibility of some loose federation.  There would be a parliamentary institution in the North while we continue with this august institution and the two would be related in an all-island national framework with some degree of unification.  Thus the Nationalist half of <Col N="1282" /> the population of the North need not feel isolated and could legitimately experience some kind of belonging and deal with the shibboleths of Irish Nationalism and Republicanism.  Simultaneously, the Unionists, while they might be part of a unitary structure on the island as a whole, could retain legitimately their loyalty to the British crown and the traditions which go with that.</P>
    <P>The question of rejoining the Commonwealth should be not written out entirely, particularly since the Secretary General of the Commonwealth, who was here last week, urged it as an idea which is worthy.  The invitation is not coming from the British but from the other members of the Commonwealth.</P>
    <P>I heard Senator Costello say that there should be co-operation between all the parts of the island, the Isle of Man and so on.  We should not leave out the main constituent of Britain &mdash; England.  If we leave out the English we could be accused of reverse discrimination.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal from Gerry Adams, who has proved himself to have some statesmanlike qualities, Danny Morrison and others about &ldquo;their mandate&rdquo;.  They have a mandate.  Their mandate is 17 per cent and they should learn to accommodate themselves to that reality.  In a democracy a mandate of 17 per cent is exactly that; it entitles them to 17 per cent of the positions and influence.  The way they strut around they give the impression that their 17 per cent mandate, which is the largest they have ever achieved, puts them in the driving seat.  It is time they learned they are not in the driving seat and the only thing which backs up their claim to particular positions is the whiff of cordite which still surrounds them.  That is the reason people want decommissioning, realistic or not.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile commissioning an academic study of the language structures employed by the various parties involved, particularly Sinn Féin and Unionist representatives. Their grammatical mechanics and selection of vocabulary offer a key to the psychology which might help us in dealing with them.  There is a concentration of imperatives in the speech of people such as Gerry Adams when he says that &ldquo;the British Government must do this&rdquo;. Paisley is the same.  He says: &ldquo;O'Neill must go, Chichester-Clarke must go&rdquo;.  If you look at the heavy loading of certain moods and tenses, it would tell you a great deal about their psychology. This could then be shown to them. Those involved could say that they are not attacking them, but conducting an academic exercise to analyse language structures and this is how they come across.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 33, after &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(not being a person engaged in or employed by a person or body engaged in the provision of services to persons with disabilities)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Labour group proposes the amendment of section 20(2)(a) so that when the Minister appoints 20 persons and the chairperson to the authority, the chairperson should not be engaged in or employed by a person or body engaged in the provision of services to persons with disabilities. The reason for this is clear.  Somebody who is already a participant in or employed by a private or voluntary company &mdash; and I understand the Rehabilitation Foundation is the major provider of services in the area of disability in the voluntary and private sectors &mdash; would have a conflict of interest if appointed as an interim or future chairperson in that respect.  How can someone be employed in a private capacity and be chief executive officer of a body providing these services and not be in a difficult and compromising position as chairperson?  Do not forget the chairperson has the casting vote.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to take this amendment more seriously.  There will be plenty of opportunities when he goes to the Dáil to include an appropriate provision or he could accept our amendment.  We are seeking to ensure the membership and chairperson of the authority are above reproach and are seen to be impartial and, by nature of their composition and the person employed as chairperson, to be carrying out their duty without fear or favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For clarification, perhaps the Minister could indicate the term of office of the present chairperson. Does it continue when the current non-statutory body becomes a statutory body?  When will the next chairperson be appointed?  Will the next <Col N="1284" /> chairperson and other members of the body be appointed by the Minister?</P>

      <P>I second the amendment. Senator Costello has clearly explained the reason for this laudable proposal.  At a time when accountability and having matters above board are salient, it is important that nobody is in an invidious position and that a conflict of interest does not arise.  In this House we regularly have debates, which may lead to a conflict of interest. This is a precautionary amendment and its insertion is desirable.  It should not cause any difficulty to the Minister or his Department.  It would ensure difficulties or questions which may arise in relation to conflict of interest are prevented. I second this amendment and I recommend the Minister takes it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment appears to be based on the principle that National Disability Authority Board members engaged in service provision are somehow incapable of discharging in an unprejudiced way the statutory obligations imposed on them by section 8 of the Act.  In contrast, recipients of the service are characterised as incapable of any bias.  The truth is that both service providers and recipients are capable of distinguishing their roles as service providers and recipients from their roles as members of the National Disability Authority.  As a result I have no difficulty in principle in appointing a service provider or recipient as chairperson of the authority.</P>
      <P>The chairperson of the interim authority who I appointed last July comes from the service sector. With a chairperson and other members drawn from the service sector and the majority of members drawn from people with disabilities, their parents and carers, a sufficiently broadly based group has been appointed to meet the challenges which may lie ahead, in a balanced and reasonable manner.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello asked whether the chairperson will continue as chairperson following the expiry of the interim board.  Once the legislation is in place, the statutory board will take over and the chairperson will then have to be re-appointed or a new chairperson will be appointed.  The term of office is four years in accordance with the legislation before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" /> From Senator Taylor-Quinn's statement, there is an underlying implication in the amendment that a conflict of interest may arise when the chairperson is directly connected to a service providing body.  In that respect, I draw the Senator's attention to section 31 of the Bill which provides for disclosure of interests by, among others, members of the authority.  It is not just Members of the House who will have to declare their interests in the future, those on the authority, <i>inter alia,</i> will have to declare their interests.</P>
    <P>As a result, any member of the authority engaged in or employed by a person or body engaged in the provision of services to people with disabilities must disclose this interest when and where it is relevant to the business of the authority.  They must not influence, or seek to influence, a decision in this regard or take any part in its consideration.  I would expect any board appointed to an organisation to have the potential for conflict of interests to arise.  At the same time, the knowledge and experience of board members in areas allied to the work of the organisation makes their contribution to the deliberations of the board invaluable.  If this were not the case the board would be disconnected from the organisation concerned.  It is a standard practice to put safeguards such as those in section 31 into the rules governing the operation of a board.  For these reasons and those to which I have already referred, I am satisfied that the fears of the two Senators which gave rise to this proposed amendment are unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform of the day is the appointing authority.  He or she is required to have regard to certain criteria in making the appointment of the 20 ordinary members.  Section 20 provides for the appointment of the chairperson and the 20 ordinary members of the authority.  That section makes it quite clear that there are particular requirements that have to be followed in assessing who is or who is not suitable for appointment.  These requirements were borne in mind when the interim board was appointed.  The result is that the majority of the members of the board &mdash; 65 per cent &mdash; are people with disabilities or families and carers for people with disabilities. The criteria were adhered to without any statute being in place.</P>
    <P>The legislation states it is desirable that a majority of the authority be people with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, and that it is desirable that not fewer than eight members be women and not fewer than eight are men.  Incidentally, the interim board also fulfils this requirement.  There is to be one officer of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a representative of any other Minister directly concerned with or responsible for activities which are relevant.  There is also to be one staff member.  We have already had a long discussion on the fact that there will be one staff member; I would have two were it not for the fact <Col N="1286" /> that the number of staff is considerably reduced from the days of the National Rehabilitation Board.  There will only be 35 staff, and in those circumstances I thought one representative fair.</P>
    <P>It is also important to adhere to the requirement that those concerned have knowledge or experience either directly or indirectly of matters pertaining to disability or any other subject which, in the opinion of the Minister, would be of assistance to the authority in the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>The criteria set out for the formation of the board in section 20 were developed in light of the recommendations of the establishment group and with the help of the Seanad in the case of the gender criteria.  It would have been open to the establishment group to recommend more restrictive criteria in the case of the chairperson, for example, but such criteria would not be desirable. They would impact on the principle of balance, which the new authority must be seen to have in discharging its functions under section 8 with regard to service providers and recipients.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will accept from that outline that the situation is as it should be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he is simply not prepared to consider having any restriction on his sole right as Minister to make appointments.  He quoted section 31 on the disclosure of interests, but this indicates there are automatic areas of interest where there may be conflict.  If one is in a senior position in an existing service provider, there has to be a question mark about such a person being perceived by service providers and recipients as fair and impartial.  I am not saying that that has been the case, but it does raise the possibility of that perception.  The Minister owes it to the House to put a mechanism in place to ensure that a person in that position does not become chairperson.  Such a person could quite properly become a member of the authority, as they would have areas of expertise to represent, but a chairperson must be seen to be impartial at all times.  If the chairman is the chief executive officer of a major service provider &mdash; in rehabilitation care in this case &mdash; he or she would find it difficult to present that position to the board, public and the disabled people who are recipients of the provision.  The Minister is saying that there has been an inbuilt protection in the declaration of interests, but that relates to the financial aspect of members' interests.  It does not address our concern that the person appointed to this very sensitive position is clearly seen as a person who can conduct business in the fairest and most impartial way possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister has responded as he did on Committee Stage, but I would prefer him to withhold final judgment on this issue until he has had the benefit of a debate in the other House.  The clear view of Opposition Senators is that it would be preferable if the chairperson was appointed with this <i>caveat</i> to ensure impartiality at all times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is quite laudable as it provides that in appointing members to the authority the Minister will have regard for persons with disabilities, their representatives, families and carers.  This amendment proposes tightening up that provision so that at least some of the bodies with nominating rights can be identified. This is the norm in legislation.  This sector that has been a minority area in the consideration of society.  Many people with disabilities want to be taken seriously, to have an opportunity to live independently and to speak for themselves.</P>
      <P>I will give an example of how this was done in other legislation.  When the Dublin Institute of Technology and the Regional Technical Colleges were established in 1992, the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, agreed to a provision whereby the Dublin Institute of Technology board would be established with various nominating bodies, including the ICTU, the staff, the VEC, business interests and various educational establishments which certified qualifications. These bodies made nominations and within that there was a 40 per cent gender quota. It worked and the body is constituted in that manner at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main players were identified and given nominating rights.  Those nominations were then approved by the Minister.  At one point the gender balance was not correct so the Minister <Col N="1288" /> returned the nominations to be corrected.  That is the proper way to deal with the matter.  If this is the Minister's vision of how the governing body is to be established then it must be done so in a representative fashion.</P>
    <P>This amendment includes the main players, all of which are substantial umbrella organisations in the sector.  Some of these bodies should be given nominating rights and the Minister could then exercise the right to make the appointments.  It is not fair that a Minister should make the totality of the appointments, except where another Minister with a relevant responsibility might make an appointment.  In this case the Minister calls the shots.</P>
    <P>There is only one exercise in democracy in these provisions, where one member of the staff of the authority shall be elected by secret ballot. Why should the nominating bodies not be allowed to elect a representative person to the authority rather than giving the nominating power to the Minister?  That is not the way to go. Our proposals would produce a better balance and would generate the perception among the organisations who provide and receive services in this sector that the legislation will ensure they get a fair deal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the amendment. These amendments are straightforward and should pose no problem.  They are clear and specific proposals.  The Bill deals with a specialised sector and those working in the sector have specialised knowledge and appreciation of what is involved in the nature of the many disabilities that affect people.  It would be wise that people appointed to the board had expertise and experience in varying capacities in the sector.</P>
      <P>If one considers any specialist organisation it would be pointless appointing a person to the board if they have not got experience or knowledge. Such a person would be on such a steep learning curve that it would only be at the end of their term of office that they would begin to have an appreciation of what is involved.  However, if people with experience and knowledge are appointed they can make a greater contribution to a board.</P>
      <P>The amendment is a common sense proposal. It would involve nationally recognised organisations &mdash; the Disability Federation of Ireland, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped, the Mental Health Association of Ireland and a member from the Council for People with Disabilities &mdash; which would provide a good cross-section of people from a variety of bodies in the sector.  They could bring specific knowledge, experience and understanding of the sector to the authority.  Their contributions could not but be positive.  That these organisations could nominate a person from their sector would be worthwhile because such organisation would know who best to put forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1289" /> This common sense proposal would resolve difficulties that might arise for a future Minister who would simply have to seek nominees from the various organisations.  It would save the Minister the trouble of wondering who from within the various political parties might have some expertise or be suitable to be put on the board.  Our proposal would be far more open and democratic. Rather than looking for specific political affiliations a Minister could look for particular expertise.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the necessity and the wisdom of taking this course of action.  It should not cause complications.  It would make life easier for future Ministers and would satisfy the various organisations and those for whom we wish to provide the best possible service.  The bottom line is that the fundamental reason for this Bill is to do whatever is possible to empower disabled people to manage their lives and allow them to make decisions.  They must have a strong say in what happens in their lives.  The legislation must serve them and this amendment is a positive step in that direction.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will see the wisdom of this proposal and if he cannot accept it this evening, it may be taken on board in the other House.</P>

It comes after a paragraph which speaks of the desirability of having not fewer than eight women and not fewer than eight men on the board. Sadly, this is necessary.  I am not suggesting for a moment that being a woman is a disability but it is a disadvantage because everywhere there are procedures discriminatory against women.  On the wireless recently, Ms Bríd Rodgers said that of ten speakers at a recent conference on discrimination and equality, none was a woman.  That is the context into which this amendment, if accepted, would fit.</P>
      <P>The amendment indicates it would be desirable if the board included members of the Disability Federation of Ireland, the National Association for the Mentally Handicapped, Mental Health Association of Ireland and the National Council for People with Disabilities.  The amendment cannot be said to tie the Minister's hands because it merely talks of the desirability of including such representatives; it does not force him to do so, it simply recommends that he do, providing a context in which he can take an informed decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> The selection of the board has already been commented on.  It is in existence &mdash; I am not sure if the full board has been nominated but I imagine it has, in which case this provision would have to apply to the future.  It is a good idea that a statutory instrument should provide that it is desirable that these named organisations should be considered.  The current thinking on the provision of services for people with disabilities is to empower such people to take control of their own lives and to allow their choice to reach its full potential.  The slogan employed is &ldquo;Nothing about us without us&rdquo; and that seems perfectly fair.  The Minister and other Members will remember the visit of people from the Centre for Independent Living who courageously challenged a lot of presumptions about people with disabilities and wanted to be empowered to take control of their lives.  I am sure the Minister and his advisers are aware that internationally it is common for organisations for persons with disabilities to be run exclusively by people who are themselves disabled.  The amendment is not as radical as that but it suggests we make at least the modest advance that people from these named organisations should be considered in a positive context by the Minister.</P>
    <P>In choosing the board the Minister has picked some people with disabilities, and they come from an environment in which they deal all the time with people with disabilities.  This is to be welcomed but are these people and their representative groups being treated as adults if the Minister chooses their representatives?  It is a cardinal element of democracy that people be allowed to choose their own representatives.  This happens all over the world &mdash; the South African authorities wanted to pick the black leaders with whom they would negotiate; similarly, in Northern Ireland the British Administration wanted to pick the republican leaders with whom they would treat; and the Indonesian authorities wished to pick representatives for the East Timorese people.  Obviously this legislation does not go that far but &mdash; with the greatest respect, because I know the Minister is a humane man &mdash; there is an unwitting degree of patronisation in this, as if we know the best people to represent someone else.  They may know themselves and may have a different view.  In selecting a person to represent another group &mdash; telling one person to represent them in one field &mdash; there is always a temptation to pick the person who will give the least trouble.  That is only human &mdash; no one wants to invite trouble &mdash; but sometimes, particularly in organisations like this, it is good to have vocal people who might cause abrasiveness.</P>
    <P>The suggestion is that of the board of 20 people, who will have the ultimate say on many matters to do with disability, it should be recognised as desirable that four people, only one-fifth of the board's membership, be nominated from these umbrella organisations.  The Minister has not yet indicated whether he will accept the <Col N="1291" /> amendment but I hope he will because he generously accepted the substance of another amendment the other day, and he could do this without prejudicing the interests of himself, the Department and his successors, because the amendment only speaks of the desirability of these organisations being represented.  Sometimes Ministers answer that they cannot mention one organisation without mentioning another, and that soon we would have a list as long as one's arm but I do not believe that, as one will find if one talks to people with disabilities and their organisations. I do not mind if the Minister includes additional organisations to be considered.</P>
    <P>If we want to empower people with disabilities, this is a critical area where the Minister can show good intentions and good will.  I hope he will accept at least the substance of the amendment, as it would show good faith and a commitment to liberate people who have these disadvantages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe section 20(3) as drafted meets the need of the board of the National Disability Authority to be truly representative of people with disabilities, their families and carers while at the same time ensuring it includes a wide range of interests and represents a balance of key stake holders as recommended by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The commission also recommended that at least 60 per cent of members of the authority should be people with disabilities or their families.  The consultants to the commission made reference to this delicate balance, advising:</P>
      <P>If the board is dominated by Government Departments and statutory agencies it may lack courage in challenging current practice.  If, however, it is dominated by service users and carers it may lack the knowledge, leverage and legitimacy necessary to achieve real change.</P>
      <P>The establishment group's recommendation for the membership of the authority was made with due regard to the need to achieve this balance.  It recommended that account be taken of the following groups: people with disabilities; their representatives, families or carers; service providers, both statutory and voluntary; relevant Departments; the social partners and the staff of the National Disability Authority.  Section 20(3) provides for this recommendation.  It succeeds in achieving this balance while adhering as closely as possible to the recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In appointing the members of the interim authority I took account of, and found most useful, the many nominations I received from disability groups.  It is standard practice for interested parties to make nominations and for consideration to be given to all such nominations.  This will no doubt continue to be the case as the provision in section 20(3) stands.  It would not, however, be <Col N="1292" /> the case if I were to accept amendment No. 3.  As Senators are aware, a large number of organisations represent the disability sector but just four are mentioned in the proposed amendment. There are other organisations which, in the view of many, would have an equal interest in having nomination rights to the authority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances I believe it equitable to provide, as section 20(3) does, more general criteria for appointment to the authority.</P>
      <P>An interim authority has been appointed to the National Disability Authority.  These appointments have been made with full cognisance of the recommendations for its memberships, as reflected in the provision in section 20(3).  The representative nature of the interim authority is borne out when one looks at the credentials of the members appointed.  Senator Taylor-Quinn was anxious that the people on the authority should have expertise and that is something I ensured because I do not believe anyone has greater expertise on disability that those who have disabilities.  For that reason, I ensured that the majority of board members, 13, were people with disabilities, their families or carers.  Nobody could know more about disabilities than a person who has lived with disability.  Seven board members come from organisations representing disability, including the Irish Council for People with Disabilities, the national representative council, the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Mental Health Association and the Disability Federation of Ireland.  One must agree that this composition reflects a broad spectrum of disability groups and organisations without any of the rigidity which would arise from an amendment such as that proposed by the Senators.</P>
      <P>It is not, of course, my function as Minister to determine what groups shall be deemed to be representative of people with disabilities.  Many groups are in existence which intend to provide for or promote the interests and welfare of people with disabilities.  My Department has had direct contact with 100 disability groups.  In this context, I note that the forum for people with disabilities and the national representative council of people with disabilities have not been considered in the amendments.  The disability sector is emerging and evolving and the legislation to establish the new Authority must be able to keep pace with developments in the sector as they occur.  The amendments would be detrimental to the overall balance of the structural arrangements for the Authority and I am not disposed to accepting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very proud of the board which I put in place.  When the chairman of the Kerry county board saw the list he felt that perhaps I should be <Col N="1293" /> taken on as a selector for the Kerry football team during the coming season.</P>

      <P>I do not accept what the Minister said and he does not believe it fully when he reflects on it.  I cannot see why any Minister should jealously hoard the responsibility and privilege of making appointments of this nature. The Minister should go out of his way to devolve this responsibility in a democratic and representative fashion.  The legislation is more watered down than I thought.  The Minister said that 11 out of 21 members of the Authority would be representative of disabled organisations, disabled people and their carers.  The legislation allows him to appoint the remaining ten people without reference to criteria or guidelines relating to the disabled, recipients or providers.  The Minister can merrily look into his heart and write down the names of ten good, staunch representatives of whatever cumann or body he thinks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will not do that.  That was a throwaway remark.  However, it can be done by the Minister of the day under this legislation every four years.  Why can the Minister not build in the entitlement for certain representatives to be nominated as is commonplace in other legislation?  There would then be procedures and mechanisms in place which would not leave the appointments entirely to ministerial choice.</P>
      <P>How can any Minister see himself as the appropriate person to make appointments to a board comprising 21 people?  I do not understand why the Minister is not prepared to go out of his way to divest himself of that appointment mechanism. He can give his imprimatur to the appointments but should he be the nominating individual?  That would be improper, and remarks by previous speakers recognise that.  We should look for what is clearly perceived as an exercise in democracy and not ministerial dictat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 12, line 12, to delete &ldquo;one member&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;two members&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> We have been over this ground and I do not intend to delay unduly on this.  The Minister stated that because the staff number is only 35, there should not be two worker-directors on the board.  It should not be forgotten that the board is a substantial size with 20 members and a chairperson and it is a difficult role for one member of staff to play.  The norm is that at least two members of staff are on such a board.  The danger is, of course, that somebody could be appointed as a staff representative and cease to be a member at any time.  There is no mechanism for a substitute to be put in place or for somebody to be elected instead of that individual.  Currently, an individual who no longer works for the NRB still retains his position as a board member.</P>
    <P>There should be a mechanism for replacement if that member is supposed to be representative of the staff.  The fact that there is no scope for flexibility is disappointing.  The Minister should reconsider this matter.  The amendment would simply add one member to the board, satisfy the wishes of the staff and ensure that the Minister would not find himself in a situation where the staff would not be represented on the board, for example, if the representative were seconded to do further study or work somewhere else or resign to take up another job.  One could end up with no staff representatives on the board for a number of years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20(4) provides for the appointment to the authority of an elected member of staff.  The amendment seeks to increase the number of staff representatives that are required to be appointed to two.  The concept of worker participation on the boards of State bodies has evolved in recent decades and reflects the current partnership approach to social and economic issues.  A particular approach is evident in large corporate bodies, such as Aer Lingus, An Post, the ESB, Telecom Éireann, etc.  These bodies have substantial numbers of employees, often involving diverse groups which may have different concerns.  The boards of these organisations are generally management boards, with major responsibility for overseeing the functioning of a big commercial organisation.</P>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for the Worker Participation Act, has encouraged the development of staff representation in this context. That Department also recognises the differing needs of non-commercial State organisations in regard to staff representation.  For this reason, it advocates that a case by case approach be taken in making legislative provision for staff representation on the boards of new organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a number of recent cases, legislation has been enacted to establish new State bodies without <Col N="1295" /> reference to staff representation on the board.  This is the case with Enterprise Ireland, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the National Social Services Board.  Each of these organisations has one staff member on its board on an administrative basis.  Nonetheless, I am convinced it is appropriate to make provision for a staff representative in the legislation establishing the National Disability Authority.  As a small expert body, I envisage a close working relationship between the board and staff which will be facilitated by the inclusion of this representative.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined the reasons I do not propose to accept this amendment.  I have indicated that the issue of staff representation on the board of the National Disability Authority must be evaluated on the basis of the approach most appropriate for that particular body.</P>
    <P>There are many examples of State boards for which there is no provision for staff representation. These include An Bord Pleanála, Bord na Gaeilge, Bord Fáilte, CERT and The Blood Transfusion Service Board.  The board for the employment of the blind is another non-commercial State body which provides, like the NDA, for one staff representative to be included on the board.  The authority is to be established as an expert body.  The arrangement for one staff representative in the Bill is fully in line with existing practice and policy in this regard.</P>
    <P>I have said that the NDA will be a small organisation with an expected staff complement of 35 employees in total.  It would be disproportionate, in my view, to provide for more than one staff representative on a body of this size.</P>
    <P>This rationale was adopted by the Department of the Marine when it provided in the Harbours Act, 1996, that the level of staff representation on the harbour authorities would depend on the number of employees of each authority.  Where an authority has fewer than 30 employees, there is no provision for a staff representative on the board.  There is provision for one staff representative on medium sized harbour boards and for two staff representatives only in the case of the biggest harbour boards.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill with regard to worker participation is fully in line with best practice in State enterprises.  As a result, I am not disposed to accede to the Senator's proposal to increase the number of worker representatives on the authority.</P>
    <P>My objective is to try to ensure that this authority is as inclusive as possible.  I have absolutely no interest in having an authority which is not fully representative because it is too important an issue for that.  I have the greatest respect for the staff of the National Rehabilitation Board, which has done outstanding work over the years.  I have no doubt that the 35 staff who are now moving to the National Disability Authority will continue <Col N="1296" /> with that excellent work.  I would like to have more staff representatives but I must ensure the legislation is proportionate and that those who serve on the authority are representative.  In this context, I believe that, by providing in the legislation for the appointment of a staff representative, I have been more than fair and that my approach is correct.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>Like every other Member of the Oireachtas, I am concerned at the number of reports which have been recently made to the Garda concerning approaches being made to children by strangers while they were out playing or going to and from school.  It is a sad reflection on the society in which we live.  While we must not fall prey to hysteria, we must take these reports very seriously and we must put the safety of children first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that informal protocols exist between them and police forces in other jurisdictions with regard to the notification on arrival of convicted child abusers.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí are taking each of these reports seriously, and that each of the incidents is being thoroughly investigated.  While I am aware of speculation in the media concerning the reports, it is not the practice of the Minister for Justice, <Col N="1298" /> Equality and Law Reform to comment in detail on any specific investigation except in the most exceptional of circumstances.  All I propose to say in this case is I understand that the Garda investigations are at too early a stage for any concrete conclusions to be drawn as to the identity of the persons responsible.  I am sure the House would agree with me that nothing should be said or done at this early stage which may have the effect of prejudicing the outcome of an ongoing Garda inquiry and neither would any of us want to compromise Garda operational initiatives.  The gardaí must be given room to do their work.</P>
    <P>Consequent on the need to raise public awareness to this problem, the Garda Press Office issued, on 11 December, a press release in relation to personal safety for children and young people.  The press release reminded parents that with the long dark evenings and the approach of the school holidays, they should talk to their children about personal safety.  In particular, parents should know the whereabouts of their children at all times, and try to avoid putting their children in a position where they have to wait alone outside school for collection.  The gardaí also recommend that children should be reminded about their personal safety and be told specifically not to approach strangers in cars while travelling to or from school or while out playing; not to play alone or become isolated from other friends; to wear bright reflective clothing during the hours of darkness and, importantly, not to take sweets, lifts or talk to strangers without their parents consent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Department of Education and Science has developed a range of programmes dealing with aspects of social and personal safety which form part of the ordinary curriculum in primary and post-primary schools.  One such programme of which I am aware is the Stay Safe programme, which is taught in a number of primary schools.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that every community should be vigilant and keep an eye on its children's safety.  In terms of sharing community knowledge and in raising awareness, schemes such as Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert can play an important role in this regard in relation to the sightings of persons acting suspiciously.</P>
    <P>In the case of serious assaults of a sexual nature against children, the House will be aware that I published a discussion paper earlier this year on the law of sexual offences which includes a chapter on the sexual abuse of children.  I am currently considering submissions on this document and I assure the House that this is an issue which the Government treats most seriously.  My intention is to bring forward a set of comprehensive criminal law reform proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated my intention to establish a register of sexual offenders to complement the existing recording arrangements in place by the gardaí.  I have received a considerable number <Col N="1299" /> of submissions as to the nature of this register, for example, some would favour a register containing details of all sex offenders, others believe that the register should be confined to details of those convicted of paedophile type offences.  I am carefully considering all the options in this respect before coming to a decision on the final shape of the register.  The operation of the register raises very complex issues.  Given that we have a written Constitution we may not have the same flexibility that other jurisdictions had in introducing a register.</P>
    <P>We must realise, however, that this is a very difficult area for policing alone to address.  We know that crimes committed by paedophiles are considered by society to be, perhaps, the most heinous of ail.  Many consider this type of sex offender to be beyond redemption and research shows that recidivism rates for paedophiles are high.  Paedophilia is a condition which predisposes individuals to have sexual desire towards children.  There will, no doubt, be some paedophiles who have never committed a crime and who may be receiving some form of treatment for their condition but who have not come to the attention of the gardaí.  The State's response to the serious problem of sex offending must be workable, legally and constitutionally sustainable while at the same time offering the best possible protection to children.</P>
    <P>All convicted sex offenders who are in custody are encouraged and invited to apply to participate in the sex offender treatment programme in Arbour Hill Prison.  Those who apply are considered by the treatment team but not all are found to be suitable.  There are currently ten offenders undergoing this treatment and a further 26 are awaiting inclusion.  While offenders who have completed their sentence cannot be compelled to accept supervision from the Probation and Welfare Service on release, there are almost 100 sex offenders now under mandatory supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service on foot of court orders.  In the meantime I assure the House that any reports of attempted abductions are taken very seriously by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for attending the House.  He has a busy schedule.  I agree with him that to be constructive with regard to the problem of child abduction we need light and not heat in discussing the subject generally. It is difficult not to become emotive about this subject, but we do not necessarily do a service to the children of the country if we cannot debate it rationally.  That is what we should try to do in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Headlines in recent newspaper reports saying that gardaí now believe that the 39 abduction attempts over the past ten weeks are related are startling.  These have been mainly concentrated in the north County Kildare and west Dublin areas, <Col N="1300" /> with further reports from Portlaoise and Kilkenny.  There is a serious message here.</P>
    <P>I understand the gardaí have handed over their investigations to the detectives involved in Operation Trace, the detective unit involved in searching for women missing for some time in the southeast area, with inconclusive files still sitting on some desks.</P>
    <P>I listened to what the Minister said in the Dáil in response to questions raised by Deputy Fitzgerald. I am concerned that we are too slow in our response to what must have been anticipated. With the establishment of a register of sexual offenders in Britain it should have been seen &mdash; I suggest it was seen &mdash; that, given that we share the same language and similar backgrounds, many of the paedophiles on that register would travel here where they would continue their heinous crimes.  Given also that they could not move without their movements being tagged by the British police, they have travelled here in the belief that they will have greater freedom to continue preying on unsuspecting children.</P>
    <P>When Britain established its register of sexual offenders we should have moved immediately and not waited until the British criminals and paedophiles travelled here where they are now, according to certain reports, trying to wreak havoc in certain parts.</P>
    <P>I accept there are different parameters because of our written Constitution.  However, given the Freedom of Information Act and the need to service public demands, any convicted paedophile who has not practised or responded to what would be termed a deviation in sexual orientation &mdash; I believe anything involving children is a deviation &mdash; do not concern us in this debate.  We are concerned with active paedophiles who intend to abuse our children sexually and who have apparently attempted to abduct up to 39 children in ten weeks.</P>
    <P>I understand they are all from Britain, although they have not been identified.  There is a notorious criminal &mdash; whom I will not name because I do not wish to prejudice any court case that may arise in the future &mdash; who is allegedly living in the north County Kildare area and is signing on for unemployment assistance.  He has been named in the media recently.  The Garda Síochána have a bead on him but they cannot arrest him or question him until he commits a crime.  We will have to wait until a child is sexually abused by a paedophile before the Garda can pick him up.</P>
    <P>The Minister is doing too little too late.  We need a register of paedophiles, perhaps one of all sex offenders.  The Minister has yet to decide whether the register will cover all sex offenders or just paedophiles.  Why have we waited until the problem arrived here before we made a move? Was the signal from the British authorities not sufficient?  Was it not obvious that once they had established their register of sex offenders the problem would be transferred to this country and those criminals would jump ship and enter our <Col N="1301" /> jurisdiction where they can move with impunity and freedom until they commit an offence?  At the moment some of the worst criminals who have committed the most horrific offences across the Irish Sea are roaming our country.  How long will it take the Minister to establish the wherewithal to put this register in place?  Can he instruct the Garda to put the structure and network in place, even pending possible legislation? Can he also confirm whether legislation is required to set up the register?  The network and structures can be put in place now and I am sure he will get full co-operation from all sides of this House and Dáil Éireann in establishing and passing any legislation that he may need in this area. There would be no difficulty in recalling the Dáil in the first weeks of January if he would like to move on this issue as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have waited until the problem has become apparent and now it is all systems go.  Why did we not move on this issue once the British established the necessity for a register, when it was obvious what the results of their register would be and the threat it would pose to Irish children? It is a very simple equation to be able to indicate that those offenders would leave the British jurisdiction because time caught up with them and they were identified on the register, and come here to abuse our children.</P>
    <P>A special unit is being set up to investigate a suspected Irish paedophile ring.  Can the Minister say whether the Garda have confirmed that a paedophile ring exists or are these individuals sole traders in terms of their criminal activities and their predatory activities against our children? How many British paedophiles are known to the Garda to be here evading the British register? How many of the abduction attempts that occurred over the past ten weeks are associated with Irish paedophiles?  Can we also have details of the special unit being set up?  Will it be different to &ldquo;Operation Trace&rdquo; or will it take on the onerous task of monitoring the recent attempted abductions?</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeated what he said in the Dáil with regard to the stay safe codes our children are taught in school.  At the moment children and young teenagers should not be allowed out on their own.  This security measure places a huge burden on many parents but it should be carried until we know the extent of the problem and the Garda have the ability to apprehend suspected paedophiles who are preying on our children rather than having to wait until a crime has been committed.  We have to underline this message and say it is not safe for any child to be out on his own.  I would go further and say no one should walk alone in isolated areas.  This is a particularly difficult situation for women who may, in some cases, find it harder to defend themselves and might be prey to sexual deviants other than paedophiles.</P>
    <P>Established values and certainties that existed for generations have gone.  We are now examining <Col N="1302" /> those certainties to see if they were the cause of the sexual abuse that appears to be so prevalent today.  Much of the sexual abuse reported today is historic.  It is only when people reach adulthood and have received counselling that they have the courage and strength to come forward and point the finger at their abusers.  It is only when our courts have finally caught up with those abusers &mdash; and in most cases convicted them &mdash; that they have got their due.  Unfortunately it is a case of too little and often too late because so many lives are destroyed by sexual abuse.  Sexual abuse means a destroyed life.  All the counselling in the world cannot put all the pieces together.  Some people manage to cope but whether it is in childhood or in young adulthood that sexual abuse takes place a life is destroyed and a person's entitlement to happiness is stolen from them, particularly with regard to the joy of sexuality, mature sexuality and all that goes with consenting adults in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>I am not sure why abuse seems so prevalent at the moment.  Perhaps it is the historic number of cases that are before us.  What set of values or code of conduct has resulted?  Was there sexual repression here?  Why are so many scandals reported in the media today?  Is the rate of occurrence as bad today?  In five, ten or 15 years time when we look back at these so called more liberal or enlightened times will we have the same number of abuse cases going through our courts?  Is it an historic problem which we have finally lifted the lid on and had the courage to confront?</P>
    <P>It is too early to say whether the changed values of today are good or bad.  They are different values because the certainties are no longer in place but I am not sure what has replaced them.  What we thought were values by which people could live and where our women, children and young boys were safe over the years, turned out not to be safe in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>With regard to abuse in the Church, it pains me to say it appears that the celibate Catholic Church committed the greater number of abuses in the past.  Teachers were also abusers.  When we look at the abuse of power by people in authority with regard to children and young teenagers one wonders how we can teach values to young children. What is the correct message to give youngsters today?  Sometimes parents despair with the removal of the certainties of the past, more liberal times and electronic communication and communication from all over the world giving conflicting messages in terms of morality and codes of ethics.  What is the correct message?  Was the past correct with the historic abuse that is being revealed now?  Is greater freedom an honesty even if we have a different set of values today? Is that healthier?  I do not have the answer I am simply posing these questions.  This is a time of uncertainty and it is difficult for many parents and young people here to make the decisions and choices necessary by which to live their lives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1303" /> The Minister does not have an easy job, particularly in handling this issue.  I am concerned about his tardiness in moving on the sex offenders register even though he has now assured us it will be put in place.  He will have the full co-operation of this House in passing any legislation needed to get this register up and running.  I would appreciate if he could respond in detail.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming here today.  I would appreciate if he would respond in detail on the special unit that has been put in place, the terms of reference of this special unit and whether we need to give any final messages, bearing in mind that we need light, not heat, on this subject, over the next weeks and months until we come to terms with the British paedophiles who have fled that jurisdiction to prey on our children. It is bad enough to have our own problems without being seen as a safe haven for paedophiles from other jurisdictions.  We need answers from the Minister in this regard.  Many people want assurances that everything possible is being done to deal with this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  I called for this debate.  I did not do so lightly; I gave the matter some consideration before I raised it in this House.  I do not recall a situation whereby in a matter of weeks there were 39 reported cases of attempted child abduction. Today I spoke to two garda superintendents, one in my own town of Mullingar where there was an attempted abduction of a young girl a week or ten days ago.  Two men in a car were involved in the incident which took place in Grange, near the gaelscoil.  As the crow flies, I could throw a stone to the location from where I live.</P>
      <P>Today I contacted the superintendent of the Garda Síochána in Cavan town.  I regret that the figure contained in a report pertaining to the number of attempted abductions has now risen by another one.  There was an attempted abduction of two young sisters, aged seven and nine, by a man in Cavan town, in close proximity to Saint Clare's national school.  This occurred at approximately 3 p.m. yesterday.  Thank God, a little seven year old came to the defence of her sister and walloped the attacker with her school bag. The attacker lost his nerve and fled because of the loud cries of the child.  This attack occurred in the middle of the day in an urban area.  This is a very serious problem.  This is the stuff of which nightmares are made, especially as it pertains to parents and concerned members of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very concerned that a number of known paedophiles from Britain are living in this country. I refer to the individual mentioned by Senator Doyle.  It is suspected that this individual has committed at least one murder.  I do not want to be alarmist, but it worries me when I read reports of 39 or 40 cases of attempted child abduction in two months.  I am speaking primarily as a parent of a fourteen and a half year old <Col N="1304" /> daughter.  I shudder to think what would happen if that child, or anyone else's child, failed to return from school from an errand or from playing with friends.  I do not think we can over-state the situation with which we are confronted.  I am aware of abductions which are referred to as &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; incidents between two estranged partners. In these cases perhaps the husband attempts to take forcibly the children of a particular union, or <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    <P>Recent reports of attempted child abductions in various parts of the country have given rise to fears about the existence of a paedophile ring. There is as yet no concrete evidence of such a ring.  However, the gardaí have been sufficiently alarmed to issue a warning to parents regarding the number of incidents that have taken place in the past couple of months.  Up until recently, child abduction was not a great problem in this country. It is a particular problem in the United States and elsewhere.  Nonetheless it is a matter of concern, with 99 cases involving 164 children, representing an increase of approximately 14 per cent on 1996, being abducted last year.  That figure has now increased.  We are fortunate in having relatively few missing children compared to the United States, where more than 360,000 children are reported missing every year.  Most abductions are a result of &ldquo;tug of love&rdquo; incidents, involving holiday romances in Mediterranean and African countries where it can be extremely difficult to get local police and the relevant authorities to treat cases seriously.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Government has introduced the Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill demonstrates its commitment to protect children in such situations, particularly in abduction incidents when they are taken to another country. The Bill currently before the Dáil provides for children to be returned to their country of residence, where matters of custody and access can be settled by local courts.  This will better protect children under easily identifiable rules of private international law.</P>
    <P>Everyone will be aware of the Dutroux case in Belgium.  This brought into focus the horrors of the abduction of children for sexual gratification and exploitation.  The Protection of Children (Hague Convention) Bill will give a degree of extra protection to children, but the primary responsibility in this regard lies with parents.  The Garda, in issuing its statement of warning to parents, emphasised how vital it is for them to be vigilant and to ensure their children are educated not to associate with strangers, nor travel to or from school, or on errands, by themselves.  This country was known as the island of saints and scholars in bygone days.  It is terrible that we now could make the opposite comment.  I agree with Senator Doyle that men, women and children are no longer safe on the streets, roads and lanes. Society must be protected.  The Minister, who is very pro-active, must take the necessary steps to ensure that society is protected, especially children <Col N="1305" /> and women.  My views on attacks on old people are already on record, so I will not repeat them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been assured by the Garda that the force is taking the reports of attempted child abduction very seriously.  However, there is no evidence to suggest that a paedophile ring is in operation.  The current situation underlines the importance of such programmes run by the Department of Education and Science, such as &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo;, which is taught in primary schools.  It is imperative that local communities watch their children and that neighbourhood schemes such as the Neighbourhood Watch and Community Alert scheme are utilised to alert the gardaí where persons are acting suspiciously.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in all the cases reported recently, not one car registration has been taken.  I know it is very difficult for a child to have the presence of mind to do this when they are approached by a potential attacker and when the person loses their nerve and jumps into their car and goes, but the child nevertheless should be instructed both at home and in school to endeavour, in so far as possible, to take the registration, the make and colour of the car.  The Minister has published a discussion paper on sexual offences which, among other things, addresses the issue of sexual offences against children.  He is currently considering a wide range of submissions from which a comprehensive set of criminal law proposals will be formulated.  I earnestly look forward to that.</P>
    <P>This current situation is again focused on the need for a register of sex offenders.  The Minister has stated categorically that it is official policy to introduce a register but only after due consideration and in a way which is the most workable and effective, and &ldquo;effective&rdquo; is the operative word here.  The Minister in response to a Private Members' Bill introduced in the other House some time ago indicated that this was being examined as a matter of priority.  A wide range of proposals are being made on this issue from interested parties, which has highlighted this highly complex and difficult area.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister will bring forward very soon the register which will serve the purpose for which it is being created &mdash; the protection of our children from the vile desire of paedophiles, whether they come from across the water or are home grown.  There can be no hiding place for those people.  I pledge with the Minister to take any steps necessary to ensure the protection of children.  I am delighted that the Fine Gael Party will support the Minister in a very positive way and I look forward to his proposals and response to my comments.</P>
    <P>In conclusion may I say as a parent I am deeply disturbed about this situation.  I know the gardaí are stretched to the limit and are trying to do their best, but there could be a Garda presence around secondary schools when children are <Col N="1306" /> returning home, especially at this time of year to ensure a safe journey home.</P>
    <P>I want to thank the Minister for coming into the House and the Leader for providing time for this debate.  It is one of the most important issues that has been raised for some time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very sad day for our society that we have to discuss a topic such as child abduction and the attempted child abductions in the last couple of weeks.  Such a debate is extremely important so that scaremongering does not take place.  We should at least make the public more aware of the facts.  One never really thinks about an issue like this until it affects your own area.  In my area yesterday local radio was taken over by the news of an attempted child abduction in County Cavan.  In that case public awareness both of the parents and children is most important.  I must compliment teachers who have introduced the Stay Safe programme in the primary schools as part of the curriculum.  There is no doubt that the teaching of such a programme was beneficial to the two little girls involved in the attempted abduction because, despite their ordeal, they were both able to give a very indepth description of the person.  They may not be very specific details but when you consider their ordeal, they must be highly commended for their bravery.  Teachers now have the added strain of ensuring the safety of the children under their care until the parents collect them after school.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator Doyle regarding sex offenders from the United Kingdom.  In my view sex offenders are similar to drug pushers in the sense that if they are not welcomed in one area, they move to another area.  Of course the natural move for a number of these sex offenders from the United Kingdom was to travel to Ireland.  I give my full support to the Minister in drawing up a register of sex offenders because it is the only effective way to control these individuals in the long term. Over the coming weeks it is important that we continue our public awareness campaign, perhaps by using the media, to enlighten parents and children of these dangers until we get a programme in place.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Glynn for his contribution and I am glad to be able to share my views on this issue because anyone who is vulnerable, be it the elderly or children, has a profound effect on each of us.  I do not envy the Minister his job but I hope our sentiments and the sentiments expressed in the other House will prove that action is needed as soon as possible.  I hope that in the coming months we will be able to draw up a register of sex offenders.  There are no words to describe these individuals.  You could not call them people.  Whatever it takes to apprehend or identify them, we must do everything in our power to protect our children and the future generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> I know from experience that we have come a long way.  At least we are now talking about issues like this.  As a midwife &mdash; Senator Henry will know the hospital to which I am referring &mdash; on night duty I was instructed to guard the room where a child abduction was supposedly going to take place and prevent anybody entering.  I do not know what I, a student midwife, could have done to prevent that happening but unfortunately, that was the amount of knowledge which any of us had.  Thankfully in a number of hospitals video cameras are now installed.  However, the case I mentioned happened only about five or six years ago.  As I said, we have progressed in the sense that we now acknowledge there is a problem. Thankfully no abduction took place but who is to say it will not happen at some stage in the future, be it in maternity hospitals or outside schools.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I wish the Minister luck in his endeavours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with Senator Leonard when she was given such instructions because, while it was only a few years ago, our thoughts were far more parochial.  Fewer strangers came into hospitals and there was less risk of abduction of small children.  When one sees the cases that occur in Britain, it is miraculous that there has only been one case in an Irish maternity hospital in the past few years.</P>
      <P>It is terrible that we must pay such attention to the abduction of small children.  However, it is important to remember that if a register of sex offenders is compiled it will not consist of strangers' names but of those of our neighbours.  Unfortunately, children are nearly always attacked by people they know.  The biggest problem in this country is incest.  I do not look forward to such a register containing the names of incest offenders because they are the parents of the victims.  It is an extremely sensitive issue so we must be careful. Will we just include the names of molesters who are strangers to the children?  Will we include the neighbours and the parents?  This is not an easy solution to a dreadful problem.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister paid so much attention to this in the discussion document.  There is a full chapter on the sexual abuse of children.  Dreadful cases come before the courts each day.  The lack of remorse in many of them is most depressing. It is important to remember that of the 100 sexual abusers in the Curragh, none is receiving treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot make them have treatment; they must be willing to become involved in programmes.  I understand that the response of those who become involved is quite good.  It takes some time for many of them to see the error of their ways.  I remember one man saying <Col N="1308" />&ldquo;but she enjoyed it&rdquo;.  The court did not take the same view when the case came before it.  It is a serious problem and I am delighted the Minister is giving it such careful attention.</P>
      <P>Several speakers have mentioned teachers.  It is most important that the stay safe programme is implemented in schools.  Teachers usually have a good idea when something is going wrong for a child and if they see odd reactions to parts of the programme it can be most important.</P>
      <P>As I have said on previous occasions, when we established the sexual assault unit in the Rotunda Hospital we thought we would be attending to victims of adult rape.  However, within the first six weeks the unit was flooded with children under 14 years of age who were brought in by teachers.  There was nowhere else to bring them. Temple Street Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin now have extremely busy units for children who are victims of sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>We must also be careful to deal with the possibility of false accusations.  A friend of mine, Fr. Shay Cullen, has been accused in the Philippines of raping a seven year old child whom he had taken into his care.  I have known Shay for a long time and it was interesting to hear the equanimity with which he spoke on the radio recently.  He said he was sure the case would be dropped because he had had to deal with this type of occurrence previously.</P>
      <P>We must be careful to prevent hysteria being generated whereby people who are in positions of responsibility for children are falsely accused. That would be very sad.  I am sure Members of the House will join me in hoping Fr. Cullen's situation in the Philippines will be resolved as soon as possible.  He has done unbelievable work in that country over the past 20 years.  Whatever level of child prostitution exists in this country it cannot compare with the levels that exist in the Philippines, Thailand, Kenya, Brazil and many other countries.  Unfortunately, the list is long.  I am sure the other Members share my concern about Fr. Cullen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is having a long session in the Upper House this afternoon.  I compliment my colleague, Senator Glynn, for taking the initiative in seeking this debate.</P>
      <P>I must agree with the Minister's opening comments about the possibility of a hysterical reaction to reports such as that issued by the Garda Síochána.  It is an unprecedented departure by the Garda to issue such a statement.  I cannot remember any other occasion on which the organisation spoke out so forcefully and in such detail about an issue that is so sensitive for parents, society and for the Minister who has responsibility in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Presumably, the statement is evidence of a real concern on the part of the Garda that this issue is now firmly on the agenda of its operational activities.  I accept that due to the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána the Minister <Col N="1309" /> cannot offer details about the statement or the reason for it.  We must take it at face value.</P>
    <P>This problem is an indication of the breakdown of many of society's social mores.  There is probably not a town or village in the country where some parents &mdash; I use the term advisedly &mdash; have not acted in a most irresponsible manner towards their children.  On some occasions they probably have no idea where their children are.  They might leave notes for children when they come home from school telling them to buy their evening meal in the local chip shop because the father is in the pub and the mother is gone off to play bingo.  I have no wish to exaggerate that phenomenon but it must be a factor in this problem.</P>
    <P>The glue that held society together for so many generations and the sense of family, which was so important in ensuring that members of families always knew the whereabouts of other family members, have broken down, especially in the urban environment in which many of us are now rearing families.  That must also be a consideration. How does one address it?  The Minister referred to one option, the initiatives being undertaken by his colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, in education and awareness.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn quoted statistics for the number of missing children in the United States &mdash; the total is about 300,000.  Visitors to diners, restaurants or filling stations in the US will be familiar with the sight of photographs at these places of missing children.  Beneath the photograph is the plea &ldquo;have you seen this child?&rdquo; People are also invited to make a donation to a national association which is attempting to find missing children, many of whom are abducted.  Although the scale of the problem in America is huge, the numbers quoted by the Garda Síochána for Ireland are proportionately high.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that about nine months ago I accompanied a group of people who came to a meeting with him to propose the establishment of a missing persons bureau.  The Minister has his own views on this matter.  He quoted the statistics that were then available and pointed out that the vast majority of missing persons return within a year.  Is he inclined to revisit that matter or is he satisfied with the current position? It is not directly related to the subject of this debate but it is a consequence of it.  Is he satisfied that the structures in place to trace missing children and persons are adequate?</P>
    <P>There are root causes of this problem.  They include the increase in the number of parentless children and the role of the television, Nintendo 64 or Sony Playstation in replacing family and community involvement and the interaction between parents and their children.  This means that children now receive much of their information from the television.  Not all of it is the sort of thing to which we, as children, would ever have been allowed access.  There is a need to look at regulation of this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1310" /> The Minister will be aware that I have an obsession about amending the Video Recordings Act, 1994, specifically as it relates to video games which depict, in some instances, graphic violence. Children as young as six are being exposed to Japanese games such as &ldquo;Mortal Combat&rdquo; where simulated blood is seen gushing from severed limbs.  That is not acceptable in any civilised society, yet the industry has been allowed to regulate itself.</P>
    <P>It is now time, in light of the experience of recent years and the increase in child abductions, to examine the link with the images on our television and cinema screens.  Censorship is for the common good but it is strange that a Brendan Grace comedy video must be submitted to the film censor for classification while a video game such as &ldquo;Mortal Combat&rdquo; can be sold with a sticker on it, which falls off in many cases, classifying it as for over 18s and yet being used by six and eight year olds.  In case the House thinks I am exaggerating, the six and eight year olds in question are my own sons.  When I went back to the shop and questioned them, they told me there was a sticker on the video.  When I then pointed out that there was no sticker on it, they said that it must have fallen off.  That is why I have a bee in my bonnet about this.</P>
    <P>The House appreciates that the volume of legislation which has emanated from St. Stephen's Green since the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, entered office is such that it is difficult to place in the order of priorities one amendment to an existing Act.  I know that and I am not criticising, I am trying to raise awareness of this issue so that something might be done about it.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to know what measures are being taken to deal with violence and paedophilia on the Internet.  Is the Garda involved with its colleagues in other parts of the world in the way in which the Minister has outlined it is regarding paedophilia generally?  Internet pornography must be addressed.  How to address it is exercising the minds of police forces all over the world and there seems to have been some success through pooling information.  As can be seen on a regular basis in the newspapers, arrests are made of those peddling pornography on the Internet.  The most recent case was in Sweden where a father was using his six year old daughter for graphic scenes which he then peddled on the Internet.  The depths of depravity to which these people will lower themselves is beyond comprehension. It gives an indication of the evil and malevolence behind the mentality of people who use children for pornography.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider running a series of television commercials aimed specifically at children to alert them to many of the points which he has outlined and which the Garda has publicised? A picture is worth a thousand words so it might be a worthwhile exercise to mount such a campaign on television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who have contributed to what I regard as a very important debate.  This is an area to which I have been giving attention for some time.  In Opposition I put forward two Bills dealing with this area, one of which, dealing with the reportage of incest proceedings, was taken by the then Minister for Justice in this House to form the substance of the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Bill, 1996.  It was of considerable assistance at that time regarding attendance by health board officials and media reportage of the details of evidence in such cases.</P>
      <P>The other Bill which I put forward, and which was accepted by the Government, was the Criminal Law (Sexual Jurisdiction) Bill, 1996.  That legislation provides for the trial in this State of an individual who commits an offence of paedophilia in another jurisdiction, much the same as the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act does for certain offences committed in the North or South, whereby offences can be tried in the different jurisdictions although the offence was not committed there.</P>
      <P>I recently passed the Child Pornography Act which is regarded internationally as a model Act. It is excellent legislation which deals with the whole question of child pornography, its possession, dissemination and trafficking.  It is an important contribution to our criminal law.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney requested that we examine the Internet.  There is an expert group currently doing precisely that.  I am of the view that action is required.</P>
      <P>With regard to the problem which has been discussed here this evening, I agree that we do not want to create hysteria.  Nonetheless, it is important that parents are vigilant.  I understand that there have been over 40 reports to the Garda Síochána of attempted child abductions in recent times.  That, of course, gives rise to concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective in my publishing the discussion paper on sexual offences was to generate discussion which is desirable in changing our criminal legislation fundamentally in the area of sexual offences.  I have been heartened by the submissions which we have received and many of those contributions are quite enlightening. Indeed, some of the contributions made by Members of both Houses have been very enlightening and extremely helpful.  As Senator Henry eloquently pointed out, formulating a register of sexual offenders or paedophiles is not a simple matter.  It is very difficult.  We have a written Constitution and there also other difficulties. The millions of questions that arise in connection with the formulation of a register must be answered and cogent reasons must be given for those answers before we proceed.  We must first address the fundamental question of whether the register should be one of sexual offenders or one of only paedophiles.  Having <Col N="1312" /> addressed that question, we must decide who should be on the register, how long a person's name should remain on it, who should have access to it and who should hold it.  These are all important questions that impinge seriously on the matter.</P>
    <P>In reply to Senator Avril Doyle's question, we must know the kind of register we will have before stating definitively whether legislation is required.  An educated guess might be that legislation would be required.  As I have stated, I am concerned about the problem.</P>
    <P>Of course one would be concerned about the possibility of foreign paedophiles arriving on our shores when we have a common travel area with another country.  In that respect, and in respect of a register generally, I am sending officials from my Department to Great Britain to discuss the issue of the register and to learn from any problems which have arisen there.  I know they have had difficulties.  In addition, I want to discuss with officials in Great Britain the matter of tracking paedophiles from one jurisdiction to the other.  I stated earlier that there is an arrangement whereby information is given to Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>The matter of treatment is important.  There are ten places available in Arbour Hill prison.  It is true that there are currently no treatment places in the Curragh, but I am examining the possibility of providing places there.  Any sex offender will receive treatment in an Irish prison, Arbour Hill, before his release, provided he volunteers for the treatment and &mdash; this is very important &mdash; he is a suitable candidate for treatment. Experts in this area have expressed the view on more than one occasion that compulsory treatment is not effective.  I intend to examine the matter of providing additional treatment places in the future, probably in the Curragh.</P>
    <P>When discussing this issue, it is important to state that the breach of any fiduciary relationship is serious, whether it be a breach of trust by a parent towards a child in an incest case or by a member of the clergy or a teacher towards a child.  However, it is equally important to state that the percentage of clergy who have been convicted of or involved in child abuse is very low. This is not stressed as often as it should be.  The majority of priests and brothers have made an enormous contribution to Irish life.  It is important to make that point as it is often not recognised.  Rather than being child abusers, the clergy have often enhanced the lives of countless thousands of young Irish boys and girls.  That is not to say there have not been clergy members involved in paedophilia.  However, the majority of them have given enormous service to the Irish people.  It is important the same is said of teachers, because it is the truth.  It might not be a sensational truth, but it is still the truth.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is thoroughly investigating each report it receives and will continue to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  A Chathaoirligh, I thank you for allowing me to raise a matter that is particularly important in these weeks, public transport, how it affects the public and how the public need is not being catered for.</P>
      <P>It has become clear in recent months that the Government does not have a policy regarding public transport and the needs of the public. Week in and week out members of the public have to wait hours to get home.  It is almost easier to win the lottery than to get a taxi.  There is no recognition of the public's needs from Iarnród Éireann.  The promised increase in DART services in the weekends coming up to Christmas has not occurred.  The last DART services at weekends are relatively early, which is a disgrace when one considers what the public needs.</P>
      <P>Serious consideration has not been given to what consumers require or deserve.  The Minister and the management of Iarnród Éireann stand condemned for their lack of action.  They have made no effort to provide the extra money for a late service during the Christmas and new year period.  One wonders if the Minister and management of Iarnród Éireann think the service is run for their benefit and not for the consumer.  There seems to be no overall public policy on responding to what the consumer wants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are fed up.  Promises were made that the DART would run on the half hour up to 1 a.m., but this has not happened, and people are being left stranded.  This scandalous situation cannot be allowed to continue.  It must be addressed. I ask the Minister of State to examine the taxi situation and particularly the DART service.  I have raised this matter before.  The first DART on Sunday does not run until 9.40 a.m. I ask the <Col N="1314" /> Minister of State to address these matters positively, and if he cannot I ask him to take my concerns known to his senior colleague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to bring Members up to date on developments since this issue was last debated in this House on 2 April 1998.  Extra capital investment is not required to extend the operating hours of DART services.  There are capacity constraints on DART system where necessary capital funding is being provided by the Exchequer and by the EU.  I will come back to the question of capital funding later.  As the Minister pointed out previously, the State makes substantial resources available to Córas lompair Éireann each year.  In 1998 this amounted to £107 million.  Iarnród Éireann has received about 90 per cent of this amount to fund its operations, including the DART service.  This figure does not include Iarnród Éireann's receipts from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs during that period in respect of the operation of the free travel scheme.</P>
      <P>The allocation of the State subvention to the individual companies within the CIE group is entirely a matter for the board of CIE.  It is then a matter for the individual company, such as Iarnród Éireann, to decide on the distribution of this allocation in support of particular areas of its operations.  The House will appreciate that these are internal matters for the CIE group and I have no function in relation to them.</P>
      <P>However, it must be acknowledged that CIE is seeking to introduce extended late night public transport services, particularly during the Christmas period.  The Nitelink bus service has extended its hours of operation to 3.30 a.m. over the Christmas period.  Northbound routes are now serving Parnell Square as well as the city centre and St. Stephen's Green is being served by southbound routes.  This is a welcome improvement for 1998, and I will be looking with interest to see how well this revised service performs during these busy weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been intensive efforts by the Iarnród Éireann management to extend the times of operation of the DART service.  Despite these and ongoing contact with the trade unions, drivers have not agreed to the operation of additional late night services.  I understand efforts are continuing and that meetings were held as late as last night.  While agreement has not been reached I commend the effort that was put in.  I know Iarnród Éireann management moved quickly to resolve concerns about issues such as security. They proposed strengthening the private security firm presence on trains and had secured Garda support as well.  Progress can be made.  This was shown during the year when, for example, extended services were provided for special once <Col N="1315" /> off events like the Tall Ships Race, and the Minister supports them.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave made the point in a previous debate that a concerted effort is made only at Christmas time.  While this is not entirely correct, this is a good time at which to take the initiative. There is an increased demand for public transport services at this time and it is the ideal time to test the attractiveness of additional services.</P>
    <P>Credit must be given to Iarnród Éireann for responding where possible to increasing demand. They have done so this month by increasing the frequency of trains on the two weekends before Christmas.  Throughout the year they have responded to customer demand by increasing the capacity of their services on Saturdays and Sundays with longer trains now operating on most services on both days.</P>
    <P>At other times the Minister accepts that capacity is a difficulty and that investment is needed.  This has been acknowledged and funding is being provided by the Government to supplement CIE's own spending which was outlined during the previous debate.</P>
    <P>As a result, Iarnród Éireann has ten DART carriages on order and these are due to be supplied in 1999.  They are being funded in part by the EU and in part from Iarnród Éireann's own resources.  The Exchequer together with the EU is providing extra funding for the acquisition of a further 16 carriages for delivery in the year 2000.</P>
    <P>These 26 new carriages will be used to enhance existing services and to operate six car train sets. They will also cater for the extended DART network to Malahide and Greystones, which is expected to open in 1999.  They will increase the DART fleet from 80 to 106 carriages &mdash; a 30 per cent increase in capacity.  Furthermore, a new station at Barrow Street is at the planning stage and is expected to be opened by the year 2000. This project is being funded by the EU and from Iarnróid Éireann's own resources.</P>
    <P>These projects demonstrate this Government's commitment to improving capital expenditure on public transport infrastructure in Dublin.  Iarnród Éireann is very much alive to the need to develop and improve the quality of the service it offers to its customers.  However, it cannot develop its late night services without the agreement of its trade unions and workforce.  These are kept under regular review so as to identify measures which can be taken, within available resources, to improve services for its customers, and the company will continue to do so, particularly as the extended DART network comes into operation and as the new rolling stock becomes available in the coming years.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State is very good to deal with this matter, but the Medical Council <Col N="1316" /> is not a public enterprise, it is a private body.  I would be very grateful if he would bring this to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Medical Council has, over the last 15 years, approached various Ministers for Health regarding changes which it was felt were needed in the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, which governs the practice of medicine in Ireland. The council is composed of medical practitioners and lay members.  About nine months ago the council asked the Minister to increase the number of lay members on the council by ministerial order.  This was not agreed.  The council has not received any communication in writing regarding this matter, though it did receive a telephone call about eight months later which informed it that the change could not be made in time for the next election, which is in spring.</P>
      <P>The council is very disappointed by this. Although the profession is self-regulating, it is important that there are enough lay members to give the public confidence.  The decision made was regrettable because it is essential that the public has confidence in medical practitioners and the suggestions the council made that if felt could help should have been listened to.  No one regrets this more than members of the medical profession.  The profession is seriously hampered in separating ill doctors from incompetent doctors because, under the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, there is but one method of dealing with both.  A single set of procedures is used by the fitness to practice committee of the council.  This is an adversarial inquiry which may be suitable for misconduct cases but is quite unsuitable for health related issues.</P>
      <P>Doctors affected by health problems should not be accused of misconduct and should not be dealt with in a fashion that implies they may be guilty of misconduct.  The present system leads to doctors concealing their problems until either the doctor or one of his or her patients comes to a terrible end.  It is not just drink or drugs that are involved in these cases.  It can often be a mental or physical illness.</P>
      <P>The council has proposed that a non-adversarial system be set up in parallel to the fitness to practice committee which would deal with health related issues.  The health committee proposed according to the recent discussion paper on health procedures for 1998 published by the council will be established with the following remit:</P>
      <P>1.  To deal with complaints which have a health component, where no allegations of patient harm are included.  [This may be in cases where there is a mental or physical illness although there might be an involvement of substance abuse.]</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> 2.  To carry out an appropriate investigation into suggestions of ill-health by gathering information, obtaining expert reports and meeting with the doctor concerned and others if necessary.</P>
    <P>This could be in quite an informal setting initially. For example, I heard of a case involving a person who was a severe diabetic and he was struggling manfully to deal with hypoglycaemic attacks but was not in a position to keep going.  The council should have been in a position to ask him to discuss the matter and advise him to take six months off to sort out the problem.  At present it would have to have a full scale inquiry.</P>
    <P>The proposal continues:</P>
    <P>3.  To make recommendations to the doctor on the management of his professional responsibilities, compliance with medical advice and monitoring of progress.</P>
    <P>4.  To operate in a non-adversarial fashion, inviting the co-operation of a doctor with relevant inquiries and recommendations.  [Once again the emphasis would be on the doctor's health or ill health and helping him or her regain good health.]</P>
    <P>5.  To monitor compliance with its recommendations.</P>
    <P>6.  To report to the fitness to practice committee on doctors who do not comply with its recommendations or who are initially dealt with in relation to a health complaint but who later raise concerns in relation to misconduct.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated that the committee would have some teeth.</P>
    <P>The proposal indicates that the health committee's interventions would be carried out as follows:</P>
    <P>All inquiries and recommendations should be carried out with the co-operation of the doctor and without the need for legal procedures. If a doctor fails to co-operate, produces false information or does not comply with recommendations, then a complaint can be made to the fitness to practice committee.</P>
    <P>A screening committee, made up of the president of the council and a small number of council members will review complaints or referrals which have not been clearly directed to either health or disciplinary procedures.</P>
    <P>If a complaint includes both health and disciplinary elements, the doctor involved should have the option to bring the health matters to the attention of the health committee.</P>
    <P>The council's document continues:</P>
    <P>The separation of health and disciplinary functions will have a number of effects:</P>
    <P>1.  Health matters will be dealt with more quickly and cost-effectively.</P>
    <P>2.  More doctors may be encouraged to <Col N="1318" /> bring health problems to the council's attention.</P>
    <P>3.  Doctors with health problems will receive fair and appropriate advice about their professional responsibilities in a context which respects their needs as patients.</P>
    <P>Urgent action is needed.  Inquiries into cases are being set up by health boards and by other professional bodies rather than referring the cases to the Medical Council.  This is not desirable. Cases will not be treated in a uniform way and the possibility of inquiries in which the public have little confidence will result.  I ask for the council's concerns to be taken seriously before another medical tragedy is a headline in the newspapers.</P>

      <P>I compliment Senator Henry for raising this important matter.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and I will relay to him the points made by the Senator.</P>
      <P>The Minister has only recently received a copy of the Medical Council's discussion paper on health procedures which outlines the council's proposals for separating inquiries into the conduct of doctors who have health problems from the more general inquiries into allegations of misconduct or unfitness.  He has not really had an opportunity to study them in detail or to consult the council or other interested parties but will do so in the new year.</P>
      <P>However, he agrees with the council's general approach that the procedures for dealing with sick doctors should be separated from those used to deal with allegations of misconduct or incompetence. The latter procedures, of necessity, are long and complex.  They are also adversarial in nature which renders them unsuitable to deal with doctors who, although ill, may not have caused harm to their patients or been the subject of any complaint.</P>
      <P>As medical practitioners, doctors should have the best insight into their own clinical condition. Occasionally the nature of their illness may result in a loss of such insight and a family member, friend or patient may have to bring the matter to wider attention.  Procedures for dealing with sick doctors should have the confidence of the profession and so encourage doctors who may be experiencing health problems to come forward and seek help at an early stage.  It goes without saying that doctors have an ethical obligation to ensure that their own state of health does not endanger or compromise the health of their patients.</P>
      <P>The proposals made by the council are constructive and should be the subject of debate among doctors.  The Minister hopes the procedures proposed or something similar can be put in place pending an amendment to the Medical</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1319" /> Practitioners Act, 1978.  He hopes to be able to bring forward the heads of a Bill to amend the 1978 Act early next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister would also like to take this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to Dr. Aidan Meade and his colleagues on the <i>ad hoc</i> sick doctors committee who have handled these sensitive issues on a voluntary basis for many years.</P>
