      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  Item 1, motion re the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997, to be taken without debate; item 2, Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998 [<i>Seanad Bill amended by Dáil</i>] Report and Final Stages; item 3, Investor Compensation Bill, 1998, [<i>Seanad Bill amended by Dáil</i>] Report and Final Stages; item 4, Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1997, Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes; item 5, motion discharging order for Committee Stage of the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill, 1997, to be taken without debate and the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill, 1997, Committee and Remaining Stages; item 6, Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1998, all Stages, with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed ten minutes and those of all other Senators not to exceed eight minutes and item 7, motion re amendment of the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal, to be taken at the conclusion of item 6.  Contributions of spokespersons are not to exceed 15 minutes and those of all other Senators are not to exceed ten minutes.  Senators may share time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.  Again a huge amount of legislation has been ordered for the last week of the session. This happens every year and should be avoided. In addition, it is not appreciated that the amendments for the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill were published this morning and we are to discuss it immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;sick&rdquo; and &ldquo;sinful&rdquo; were used this morning by a Presbyterian minister to describe the burning of Catholic churches in Northern Ireland last night.  Even by the depraved standards of Northern Ireland in the last 30 years, <Col N="626" /> when places of worship are desecrated a line has been crossed, and this strikes deep into the core of civilised society.  Every Member will want to condemn this and to send our sympathy to those whose churches have been destroyed so wantonly. I hope that what is clearly intended as a provocation will not be responded to and that restraint will be exercised, though that will be difficult.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note, all Members will want to send best wishes to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister elected by the Northern Ireland Assembly yesterday.  They have a huge task ahead of them but they showed a spirit of determination and unity yesterday and all Members will wish them success.  Most Senators know Mr. Seamus Mallon, who was once a Senator.  He is a great friend of virtually every Member of the Oireachtas and is deservedly admired for his stamina, courage, stubbornness, common sense and integrity over the last 25 years.  We all wish him and David Trimble every success in the days ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments on the burning of churches.  It behoves all Members to say that a liberal pluralist society must be one in which all views and opinions are tolerated.  That must be true of large and small groups, and it is an extraordinary indictment of our society that people will burn each other's places of worship, whatever they are.  We have had recent debates on refugees and ethnicity and this is equally important.  It must hit at the heart of a community when its place of worship is attacked in this way.</P>
      <P>I compliment <i>The Examiner</i> on its handling of an issue in today's edition in comparison with the other broadsheets' handling of the same issue yesterday.  <i>The Irish Times</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i> disgracefully published a list of pensions yesterday and added pensions of widows and orphans of Members of the Oireachtas, including those of two former Cathaoirligh.  This is utterly unfair.  It is an invasion of privacy and confidentiality and reopens old wounds and sorrows.  It is nobody's business what people are entitled to under a duly recognised system.  It is fair that people in the public eye, retired or otherwise, have their pensions published, but it is unfair and wrong to publish the incomes of children, widows and widowers.  I compliment <i>The Cork Examiner</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks initially made by Senator Manning and supported by Senator O'Toole concerning the burning of the Catholic churches last night. Regardless of denomination it is an abominable act of sectarianism and bigotry to burn a place of worship.  Such acts play into the hands of men of violence who wish to disrupt as far as possible the democratic process which thankfully was embarked upon in Northern Ireland with the election of the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister yesterday.  I wish the Assembly well.  It is a supreme irony that this weekend there will be a march to another church which will be the prologue for a confrontation between the two communities in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Our party is not happy with the Order of Business as outlined.  We have had item 1 on the Order Paper for a number of months.  We were informed by the Acting Leader that the motion would be debated at the appropriate time.  We are now told the matter will be taken without debate. Will the Leader consider providing time to debate the motion?</P>
      <P>The Investor Compensation Bill, which did not appear on the original Order Paper provided to us, has been placed on the Order of Business.  It is regrettable that so much legislation has to be crammed into the business of the House towards the end of session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential that the House is unanimous in its condemnation of the burning of the nine Catholic churches last night in Northern Ireland.  As Senator Manning stated, it is accepted practice throughout the world that churches are places of sanctuary and refuge and are excluded from conflict.  This principle has operated for centuries. It is extraordinary that a very small group of evil people can decide this universal principle does not apply to this Christian island.  It is important to note that despite the evil intention some good has come from the appalling events. One sympathises with the clergy, congregations and the wider community, but this morning there was a very manifest demonstration of Christian solidarity in the face of the atrocities, something which is welcome and encouraging.  One of the parish priests interviewed on radio this morning asked the very good question about how one could enter the mind of those who perpetrated these acts.  It is very difficult to conceive the intention of the perpetrators and why they carry out such acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate David Trimble on his appointment as First Minister and Seamus Mallon on his appointment as Deputy First Minister in the Assembly.  Both will bring to their office the qualities required and will help unify the people of Northern Ireland.  I am sure the Cathaoirleach supports me in sending congratulations to Lord Alderdice on his appointment.  I am sure when the time comes he will be elected to the Chair of the Assembly.  Those of us who met him on a regular basis in Dublin Castle at the Forum for <Col N="628" /> Peace and Reconciliation, and others, recognise the qualities he brings to the office and I am sure he will have a very positive effect on the Assembly.  I ask all these people to use their good offices to do everything possible to defuse the situation in Portadown and Drumcree in the context of the Orange parade to Drumcree church.</P>
    <P>The hope of Members is that both Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon, at a date of their choosing, will address the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the House debated the Murphy report.  I did not realise it could have an impact in the context of discussions in the House on many issues through the years being ignored. I had two phone calls as a result of yesterday's debate from people who must be closely associated with the Houses of the Oireachtas as the debate was not broadly publicised.  The debate gave one of the people courage to confront what had happened many years ago.  I suggest to the Leader that we should address people's concerns as a result of the Murphy report and what has happened in sporting bodies and in society.  Doing so on a regular basis would reduce talk about reforming the House.  I was very upset by both phone calls.  I ask the Leader to facilitate more frequent debate on matters of concern to people. Doing so will ensure a continuing and enhanced role for the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with others in condemning the outrages against Roman Catholic places of worship in Northern Ireland last night.  I am particularly glad nobody was seriously injured or killed as a result.  I am more appalled by the loss of human life as, however dreadful the outrages were, churches can be rebuilt.  Human life cannot be restored and the taking of life is worse than the ghastly and offensive acts of last night.  I listened with disdain to the rank hypocrisy of Ian Paisley's condemnation of what happened.  That man, more than any other, has fuelled the fires of sectarianism and until he eats his words of antagonism towards the papacy and the Roman Catholic Church, nobody will take his condemnation seriously.  He gave people a motivation for carrying out such acts.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the Church of Ireland and think it is time it told the Orange Order that until it disinfects itself of the sectarian elements of its procedure, ritual and handbooks and its nasty sectarian anti-papal language it is not entitled to use church property.  It is time the Church of Ireland had the guts to stand up and say this, even if it loses some members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with colleagues in sending best wishes to the Assembly.  It is very heartening that it has started work in such a positive manner.  Many in the South have said for some time that we require more than politicians to demonstrate responsibility. However, it is very difficult for people to display responsibility if they have no authority. They now have authority and giving it to them <Col N="629" /> has brought out the latent qualities of responsibility.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for taking the matter I raised on the Adjournment yesterday.  I thank my colleague, Senator Brendan Ryan, for successfully drawing attention to the debate during one of his sporadic appearances in Leinster House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I deprecate the fact that reference was made to Mr. Netanyahu.  Frequently when I raise the issue I am asked about Israel.  There is a nasty underlying tone of anti-Semitism about this.</P>
      <P>Perhaps if not tomorrow than early in the next session we can have a debate on Tibet, an issue which is on the Order Paper.  Presumably, the House knows there has been a series of bombs in Lhasa, which is a worrying development, and a number of Tibetan monks have been murdered by the Chinese occupying authorities in Tibet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader contact Aer Lingus immediately to ask it to include in its in-flight magazine helpline telephone numbers of the various organisations in America for people in trouble?  I raise this matter as a result of a tragic incident in New York last weekend when a young Irishman found himself in difficulty with nobody to help.  There are many excellent organisations in America which provide help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members in condemning the appalling actions of those involved in fire-bombing churches in the North.  I wish to raise a matter I mentioned two days ago when I joined with Senator Kiely in calling for a debate on rail track investment proposals.  I am concerned about this matter having read what was said on behalf of the Minister for Public Enterprise in the other House last night about the Killarney-Tralee line. Despite all the safety reports and the concerns about the poor state of the line, it is obvious the Government is operating a two tier system with Kerry on the hind tit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Members who have expressed sympathy for communities which have suffered as a result of the burning of houses of worship in the North last night.  It is sad that people are so sick in the mind that they would engage in the destruction of houses of worship. On Tuesday evening during statements on Northern Ireland I said the RUC would have an opportunity to demonstrate even-handedness and I <Col N="630" /> hope it does so on this occasion.  I congratulate the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland who were appointed yesterday. I also expect them to demonstrate even-handedness. Because he is the First Minister, David Trimble must represent all the people and he will have ample opportunity over the next few days to demonstrate that he is fit to be First Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I condemn the organised arson which caused the destruction and desecration of churches in Northern Ireland last night.  In view of the fact that most people there describe themselves as Christian, one presumes these were denominational attacks and not attacks on people of another religion.  I suggest that if they learned more of the liturgy of the different denominations, they might find they have a little more in common and would desist from these appalling attacks.  As a member of the Church of Ireland, I share Senator Norris's horror at seeing Drumcree act as a battleground again for the most blatant of sectarian services which could be held in Northern Ireland.  I hope something will be done by the Church of Ireland so that the Orange Order will desist from using those premises for such a purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the good wishes to the new Assembly in Northern Ireland.  I also wish the First Minister and Deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland every success in the difficult task they face leading up to Drumcree.  I appeal to all sides to see sense, to resolve the difficulty peacefully and not to bring more violence to the province.</P>
      <P>The burning of churches in Northern Ireland is a sad occurence.  As someone who has read lessons in the Church of Ireland and the Catholic Church over the years and who listens to the Protestant and Catholic services on radio almost every Sunday, I do not believe the people who carried out this sacrilege are members of any church; they are sick people.  Using the words of the gospel, I say &ldquo;Father forgive them for they know not what they do&rdquo;.  They have committed a terrible sin.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader organise a debate in the next session on the road safety report which we recently received?  It makes interesting reading. As I said previously, since most accidents happen at night there should be more road patrols at night.  It is time the Minister introduced 70 mile per hour speed limit on national primary routes and a 50 miles per hour one on secondary routes. Driving at 60 miles per hour on narrow secondary roads where many of these accidents occur is lunacy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, come to the House?  I understand the Bill resurfaced in the Dáil this week and I am sure those involved in the education process would like this legislation to be implemented before the new school term.  Will the Leader indicate when this Bill is likely to come to the Seanad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments made on all sides in welcoming the new Assembly which heralded a new dawn on the island.  It reminded me of Churchill's comment after the First World War that while everything changes, nothing changes.  It is right the House condemns unreservedly what happened in Northern Ireland last night; Senator Farrell referred to this as sacrilege. The ongoing situation at Harryville seems to have passed from the public consciousness.</P>
      <P>In the spirit of this new era, will the Leader ask the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, if he intends to initiate discussions with the Football Association of Ireland and the Irish Football Association on the possibility of Ireland fielding a representational soccer team at international level?  This question surfaced on and off in recent decades but was not considered because of the considerable political difficulties and the historical baggage associated with both associations.  It was the southern rather than the northern association which broke away.</P>
      <P>In the light of this new era which has dawned and with a representational Assembly in the North, the Leader might request the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come to the House in the next session to make a statement on the matter or to provide some insight.  After all, he has been the catalyst in many other areas of sport and is involved in trying to provide more facilities.  The various sporting bodies look to the Minister for funding and initiatives.  The time is right for a debate on whether we should have an all-Ireland football team representing us internationally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with colleagues in wishing the Assembly the best of luck and, in particular, Mr. Trimble and Mr. Mallon.  Mr. Mallon played in the Oireachtas captain's prize golf outing at Luttrellstown on Monday in a most relaxed mood.  In fact, he played with one of our colleagues, Senator Caffrey.  He brought in a good score and was fourth in the competition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ask the Minister to let me know when the report referred to by Senator Burke will be published.  I congratulate him on his sporting achievements earlier this week.  He was lying low for a while but we all knew he would take the handbrake off sooner or later.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the views expressed by Senators Manning, O'Toole, Dardis, Costello, Norris, Coghlan, Callanan, Henry, Farrell, Mooney and Burke in condemning the dreadful events in the North of Ireland last night.  These people have stooped to a new low.  I agree with all the sentiments that have been expressed here.  I hope the strength and resolve of the people of Northern Ireland will once again show that goodwill can overshine the evil of last night.  I congratulate Senator Norris on his courage in calling on Ian Paisley to see the light of day once and for all and to lead his people in a positive direction, which he has not been doing over the last number of months, if not years.</P>
      <P>I too congratulate David Trimble and Séamus Mallon.  David Trimble has shown great courage. He needs all the assistance and help he can get.  I agree with the proposal by Senator Dardis to invite both men to address the House at a future date.  When I first became a Member of this House I had great pleasure in taking my seat with two great people, the late Paudge Brennan and Séamus Mallon, who was the finest contributor to this House in the 16 years I have been a Senator.  He has displayed great courage and he, his wife and family have made enormous sacrifices following the stance they have taken over the last 30 years in the North of Ireland at a cost to their health, careers and financial position.  I am delighted he has been justly rewarded.  He comes from a great tradition and has enormous ability.  He was first heard of on the playing fields of Ireland representing his native county, where he was a star above all sportsmen in his earlier years.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello inquired about item 1.  This was agreed by the Whips in the Dáil.  I also understand it has been agreed by the Whips in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Lanigan expressed great concern regarding the telephone calls he received last night following the debate in the House yesterday on the Murphy interim report.  I am pleased some good has arisen from a debate in this House.  I <Col N="633" /> have organised as many debates as possible to facilitate Members' requests.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be my policy to continue this for the next three to three and a half years. Senator Norris asked for a debate on Tibet, which can be organised in the early part of the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Dan Kiely called on Aer Lingus to have its helplines placed in <i>Cara</i> magazine.  I will pass on that request.  Senators Coghlan and Dan Kiely expressed concern about the Killarney-Tralee rail line.  I passed on their requests yesterday to the Minister.  It will be looked at the earliest opportunity, subject to the availability of finance.</P>
      <P>Senator Farrell requested a debate on road safety.  It is timely to hold such a debate.  I congratulate the midlands Radio 3 who, in conjunction with Laois, Offaly and Westmeath County Councils, has taken on itself to highlight, free of charge, every hour on the hour the appalling tragedies on our roads.  Of the last 17 fatal accidents in the past three weeks, 11 occurred in the midland counties.  I hope the national television and radio stations will also show the spirit of Radio 3 and these local authorities and do something about this issue in the national interest.  The number of accidents and deaths on the roads over the last number of weeks is horrific.  Many of them occur in the late hours of the evening or the early hours of the morning.  This will have to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh asked when the Education Bill will be before the House.  Report Stage is to be taken by the Dáil tomorrow.  I understand it will not conclude then.  It will possibly be the first Bill before this House in the next session.</P>
      <P>Senator Mooney congratulated the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation on his various initiatives.  I will pass on the Senator's proposals and requests.  Perhaps we could hold a debate in the next session.</P>
      <P>As this is the second last day of this session and looking back on our 12 months work, the House may be interested to note that 52 Bills were published since the Government took office while six were restored to the Order Paper.  Forty of these Bills have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas and most of the remainder will be processed this week.  The remaining Bills will be taken in the first two weeks of the next session. This is a terrific programme of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of amendments were made to the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Bill, 1998, in the Dáil which have resulted in improvements to the Bill which I will now outline.</P>
      <P>One of the main objectives of the Bill is the improvement in the existing arrangements for consultation between local authorities, travellers and the public, aspects which I recall were of considerable interest to Senators.  It is not surprising that a number of amendments relate to this process.</P>
      <P>The first such amendment, namely, amendment No. 3, inserted a new paragraph (e) in section 8 to specifically require that local community bodies or groups will be notified prior to the preparation of a draft accommodation programme. The inclusion of such a requirement at this early stage is significant in that it ensures local community groups will have opportunities to be involved from the earliest possible point in the process &mdash; for example, once notified, a local group could make an initial submission to the housing authority on its general policy in this area.</P>
      <P>The consequence of being notified under section 8 is that groups are automatically supplied with the following: a draft of the programme when put on public display; a copy of any amended draft programme which is submitted to the members of the authority for adoption; and, a copy of the programme as finally adopted.  It must be remembered these are the minimum requirements and there should be further opportunities for further input or exchange of information on the process, depending on local circumstances. In putting forward this amendment, I took into account the views expressed by many Senators about the need for wider public consultation on proposals for traveller accommodation. While the Senators' comments were made in the context of including representatives on the local consultative committee, I proposed this amendment as a more appropriate means of ensuring public involvement from the earliest practicable stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next main group of amendments relate to the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Committee and the local accommodation consultative committees.  Amendment No. 9 inserted an additional subsection in section 9 to require the national committee to submit an annual report to the Minister and to have the report laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. In this way there will be regular opportunities for both Houses to raise any issue or problems relative to the provision of accommodation for travellers. Amendment No. 10 to subsection (5) of section 20 will ensure that a person appointed to fill a casual vacancy on the national committee will be selected in the same manner as the previous <Col N="636" /> appointment.  Amendment No. 11 inserted an additional subsection (6) in section 21 to provide that proceedings of a local consultative committee were not invalidated by any vacancies among the membership.  There is also an additional subsection (3) in section 22 as a result of amendment No. 12 which makes it clear it is the members of the authority who make the appointments to the local committee.  While this level of detail could have been provided for through the Minister's power to issue directions to the appointing authority, I accepted the amendments in the interests of clarity and transparency.</P>
    <P>As a result of amendment No. 13, an important new provision has been introduced at section 25. This is an enabling provision to ensure local authorities have adequate statutory backing to provide loans for caravan replacement or repair or the acquisition of land or the provision of sites for caravans.  Existing policies in this area have been under review by the National Traveller Accommodation Consultative Group, the group set up in advance of legislation, with a view to extending the range of options available to travellers to acquire their own accommodation.  A preliminary examination of recommendations of the group was recently completed in my Department during which the inadequacies of the existing legislation to support loans schemes were identified. The new section 25 will allow any loans scheme which may be brought forward to be put on a proper statutory footing, including the attachment of criteria and conditions which are practical and enforceable.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 inserted a new provision, the purpose of which is to include a reference to section 20A in section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, to ensure the offences provisions of section 34 apply to contraventions of any regulations made under section 20A.  The amendment arises out of District Court proceedings taken by a local authority against a number of landlords in which it was successfully argued that their failure to pay the annual registration fee required under article 8 of the Housing (Registration of Rented Houses) Regulations, 1996, was not an offence.  Section 20A of the 1992 Act provides for the making of regulations requiring the payment of an annual or other fee in relation to the functions of authorities in respect of rented accommodation.  The registrations regulations, 1996 were made under section 20A of the 1992 Act.  The effect of this amendment will be to remove any doubt that failure to pay the annual registration fee is an offence.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 is intended to ensure that the prohibition on erection of temporary dwelling within one mile of existing accommodation at paragraph (1)(c) of the revised section 10 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1992, applies, in the case of accommodation provided by voluntary housing bodies, to the full range of accommodation which may be provided by such <Col N="637" /> bodies for travellers and not just sites for caravans as in the previous wording.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 provides for the insertion of a new subsection (4) in section 7 to give specific power to the Minister to specify the date by which local accommodation programmes must be adopted.  While the provisions of subsection (1) imply the Minister has this power, I was advised specific provision should be made for this.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments were of a drafting nature, relating mostly to improvements in punctuation and realignment of text.  The purpose of amendment Nos. 2, 4, 5, 6 and 8 to sections 8, 9, 12, 13, and 18 respectively was to improve the punctuation.  In addition to punctuation, amendment No. 7 inserted in section 14 the indefinite article before &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; in the second line of the section.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 to paragraph (b) of the revised section 10(1) of the 1992 Act was for the purposes of realigning the text to ensure that powers of local authorities in relation to follow up action apply to any of the circumstances described at articles (i), (ii) or (iii) and not just article (iii) as in the earlier draft.</P>
    <P>Finally, the two further amendments to this section, Nos. 14 and 16, were intended to clarify that the distance of five miles from a site for caravans under the revised paragraph 10(1)(a), or the distance of one mile from any caravan site or other traveller accommodation under the revised paragraph 10(1)(c), location is a radius of the distance in question from the location referred to.</P>
    <P>I am sure Members will agree the amendments made have resulted in tangible improvements to this important legislation for the benefit of all the practitioners involved, the public and, in particular, the travellers who stand to benefit most from its provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this legislation and place on record our appreciation of his efforts in regard to this issue.  In this legislation he has attempted to move the issue of traveller accommodation forward, particularly at local level.  The issue has been a particularly intractable one through the years, not only in the Dublin area but throughout the entire country.  In the summer months one can witness the manifestation of the difficulties which face local communities when the traveller population goes on the move, as I believe it is entitled to do.  Problems arise for local communities, especially when travellers seek accommodation in places which were never designed for that purpose, on the sides of public roads and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's flexibility in taking on board very worthwhile and valuable amendments, particularly amendment No. 3, which will ensure public involvement in the process at the earliest stages.  I also thank the departmental officials for the work they have done on this issue. It is my fervent hope the legislation will be successful on the ground when it is implemented. <Col N="638" /></P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister for the time and effort expended on this legislation and for listening to the views of Senators and Deputies.  I had reservations about the lack of consultation at local level so I welcome amendment No. 3, which requires the consultation of local bodies prior to the preparation of a draft accommodation programme.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 14 and 16, which deal with the one mile radius around caravans and the five mile distance between caravans and housing, will be difficult to implement in the Dublin area.  Sites will not be available because of their proximity to built up areas.  I cannot see how the legislation will work in those areas.  We are doing our best to accommodate both sides but there will be difficulties on the ground.  In my area there are no sites and it would be impossible to prepare a programme when the area is so built up.  Where will the travellers go?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill was initiated in the Seanad and passed Committee Stage in the Seanad.  The Minister had an open mind and accepted a number of amendments in both Houses.</P>
      <P>There must be the greatest consultation possible with the public when settling the traveller community.  Only when that consultation occurs can travellers be successfully housed.  I am surprised one of the amendments clarifies the situation which arose in the District Court where it was argued that the annual registration fee for housing was illegal.  That was an extraordinary anomaly and I am glad it has been clarified by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It is crucially important that we recognise the work done by the Minister in dealing with this legislation.  It is progressive and meets many needs.  It will create problems, as all legislation does, but it is a realistic approach to an important social and public need.  The Minister and the Department are to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>Ensuring there is a proper flow of information, as outlined in the amendments, is important.  The greatest problem which we have encountered over time is a lack of discussion.  The inclusion of representatives of the travelling community in consultations is hugely important to the self esteem of that community.  It now has a say in the determination of its own needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that travellers are being seen as part of the wider community.  That is the only way to resolve any remaining difficulties.  We spoke earlier about the importance of pluralism and respect for the views of others.  This legislation reflects a growing tolerance and openness in society.  It accepts the travelling community's culture as part of our culture.  This involvement will let travellers see that they are not a distinct culture but part of the Irish culture.  I know the travelling community do not accept that argument but I believe it is as much part of our culture as the Irish speaking community.  This Bill <Col N="639" /> achieves what should be aimed for in all legislation dealing with various groups of people.  It specifies the quality of interaction between the group and the authorities.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 15 refers to the building of temporary dwellings which are likely to obstruct or interfere with the use of public or private amenities or facilities.  In south Dublin a house for travellers was erected around an ESB pole. The pole came through the floor, the first ceiling and went out through the roof of the house.  As the Minister will know from experience, at the end of the day nobody was responsible.  This building certainly obstructed public and private amenities in that it interfered with the electricity service.  The pole was less than ten feet from parts of the house.  Every building regulation in the book was broken and when the ESB found out about it, the electricity was cut off within two hours.  Does it represent a lack in the legislation that the authority could find itself in breach of the regulations?  Who was responsible?  Did the local authority have the power to demand the ESB move the pole or did the ESB have the authority to insist the pole remained there?  In the implementation of amendment No. 15, if we find houses built around ESB poles and there is a cost involved, who pays that cost?  The taxpayer, the local authority or the ESB?  I do not object to the amendment but it is unclear who is responsible.</P>
    <P>When the local authority set about building houses for the travelling community, houses which were badly needed, it came up against a block.  In amendment No. 1 there is a stipulation that plans must be implemented within a certain period of time.  Amendment No. 15 states that dwellings should not obstruct or interfere with public or private amenities.  Now a local authority attempting to discharge its responsibilities and build the type of housing required by the travelling community finds itself blocked by another public utility.  This is ridiculous.  I am not asking the Minister of State to comment on a particular case as I do not expect him to know the details. However, will he clarify whether local authorities have the power to insist that public utilities move?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and the amendments to this Bill which has been discussed at length in the House.  The emphasis on public involvement is a welcome inclusion in the Bill as it enables the public to accept developments in their areas.  Section 31 includes provision for a five mile radius and there is now an onus on local authorities to provide temporary serviced sites to enable the travelling community to move off the side of the road.  Most of them would gladly do so if the services were provided and the onus is now on local authorities to do so. I also welcome the fact that the Minister of State has included a one mile radius which gives powers to local authorities and enables residents to accept sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="640" /> I welcome this legislation and compliment the Minister of State on its introduction.  I hope that local authorities will take on board their responsibilities to ensure that travelling and semi-settled travelling people are looked after on halting sites. I hope that this is only the first stage and that these people are moved to proper housing in a short period of time and integrated into society. This is the direction in which events are moving. Travellers, particularly younger travellers, want to move in that direction.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister of State and his officials. I hope that it is passed and that action is quickly taken as a result.</P>

Rinne mé gach dícheall aird a thabhairt ar na moltaí sin agus an Bille á phlé agam sa Teach seo agus sa Dáil ina dhiaidh sin.  Leis an fhírinne a rá is dócha gurb é sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ar ais anseo le leasuithe ar an mBille.</P>
      <P>Tá súil agam go mbainfidh an pobal agus an lucht siúil tairbhe as na moltaí atá sa Bhille agus go n-oibreoidh na húdaráis áitiúla go dícheallach chun an polasaí atá á leagadh amach a chur i gcríoch.  Glacaim leis go dtógfaidh sin tamall ach mar sin féin má chuirtear chuig na pleananna atá leagtha amach le haghaidh tréimhse cúig bliana ní bheidh aon easpa airgid ann ó thaobh an Rialtais de.  Tá se tábhachtach go mbeadh gach éinne sna contaethe éagsúla agus sna húdaráis áitiúla, an pobal i gcoitinne, na daoine atá tofa, na hoifigigh, an lucht siúil agus iad siúd atá ag cabhrú leo, ag obair as lámha a chéile chun na haidhmeanna sa Bhille a bhaint amach.  Tá sé scannalach agus náireach go bhfuil níos mó ná míle clann fágtha fós ina gcónaí ar thaobh an bhóthair.</P>
      <P>Níl éinne sa Teach seo sásta leis sin agus tá dualgas sóisialta orainn cabhrú leo ó thaobh polasaí oifigiúil de.  Tháinig na moltaí atá taobh thiar den Bhille chun tosaigh nuair a bhí an Rialtas deireannach i réim agus glacaim buíochas leis an iar-Aire as ucht an réamh-obair a déanadh ag an am agus a réitigh an bealach don Roinn an Bille a chur le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá an Bille os ár gcomhair anois tar éis díospóireachtaí sa dá Theach agus tá feabhas ar an mBille dá bharr sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Senators for their welcome for the Bill and their contributions and co-operation in ensuring a relatively smooth passage for the legislation. I appreciate the all-party support which the Bill received since initiated in this House on 27 March 1998.  Senators will accept that I listened carefully to the points made and was happy to accept some of the amendments proposed. Further amendments were subsequently made, the seeds of many of which were sown in this House.  The debates on the Bill were stimulating and worthwhile and we have emerged with a Bill which is a significant step forward in the Government's <Col N="641" /> commitment to providing a more inclusive society.</P>
    <P>The success of the Bill can only be judged on the extent to which it is implemented locally.  I assure Senators that I will do all in my power to ensure that housing authorities have the necessary advice, guidance and support to meet the Bill's objectives at the earliest possible date.  The measures to be put in place at local level will involve a commitment from all concerned &mdash; housing and other public authorities, travellers and the public.  There is no reason for any of the players to opt out as the Bill recognises and provides a role for each and I hope they will live up to the expectations during the next five years.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the one and five mile radii and the lack of sites.  The one mile provision authorises the removal of unauthorised dwellings which are parked within one mile of facilities provided under the five year programme.  It does not specify that people have to be brought to any particular site, and even if no site is available they cannot park within a one mile radius.  Some Senators may have misinterpreted this provision.</P>
    <P>Senator Joe Doyle referred to the rent case which required amending legislation following a court case.  The local authority concerned was the Ennis Urban District Council and the Government is happy to have the support of the House in amending the legislation to close the loophole which was cleverly availed of in the courts on that occasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senator O'Toole's comments on the Government's intent and the wish of the House to introduce progressive, modern legislation to provide proper facilities for the travelling community. It is always dangerous to deal with specific cases, particularly when I do not know the case to which the Senator is referring.  I do not think it is appropriate that I should comment on a case when I do not know the details.  However, the Bill deals with the unauthorised parking and location of dwellings on public lands.  If the case mentioned by the Senator refers to a dwelling constructed on private land, then it could be a case of trespass or more appropriate to planning laws.  I cannot comment further without the details.</P>
    <P>We are almost at the end of the debate on this Bill.  It was initiated some time ago and goes back to the decision of former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, to set up the task force.  Deputy McManus acted as chairman of the task force before being appointed Minister of State.  As Minister of State she played an important role and took the recommendations of the task force into account.  I inherited a process which was under way and I am happy to have been involved in bringing it to its conclusion with the support of both sides of the House.  It is significant that the Bill was initiated by one Government and completed by another, so the policy has the full support of all parties.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators.  I accept the tributes paid to my officials and thank them myself for the extensive <Col N="642" /> work they put in.  I also thank the National Travellers' Consultative Committee, which now plays a major role, for submitting recommendations upon which the guidelines are largely based.  It has worked diligently on this issue.  It has cross-sectional representation, including travellers, and its input is valuable as it ensures that the formulation of policies, regulations or legislation by the Department are based on the full knowledge of the views and wishes of the travelling community and that these are taken into account.  It often happens that people who are not travellers and who are not part of the culture believe they have the solution.  Measures imposed in the past have not been successful.  I hope a new era of co-operation and transparency has come about, in which greater progress can be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain briefly the amendments made to the Bill following its passage through the House.  There are 23 amendments in all and, if Senators want me to explain any of them in greater detail, I will be happy to do so. No disrespect was meant by not tabling the amendments in the House on Committee Stage. One amendment was accepted here on Committee Stage and we agreed to consider another, which gave rise to a further three amendments to the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will take amendments Nos. 1 to 3 to section 18 together.  This section originally provided that the Minister for Finance would be responsible for the appointment of the members of the Investor Compensation Company and of the board of the company, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The three amendments were tabled on the basis that the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have responsibility for the appointment of the members of the board, who will represent the interests of consumers, because the Minister has specific responsibilities in the area of consumer affairs.  I was happy to accept the amendments on those grounds.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 deal with the situation where a compensation scheme or fund has difficulty paying compensation &mdash; for example, in the event of a major default.  It is necessary to make provision for such a situation because the Office of the Attorney General has advised that it would not be possible under Irish law to require a compensation scheme to pay out unlimited compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 25(8) of the Bill as initiated provided that a compensation scheme operated by a professional body on behalf of accountants could set an annual limit on payments to investors, subject to the approval of the Central Bank.  However, the section did not specify what would happen when a compensation scheme reached that limit. On the other hand, section 35 of the Bill as initiated applied to both compensation schemes for accountants and to the Investor Compensation Company.  Section 35(1) provides that compensation must be paid within three months of the establishment of an investor's claim. Section 35(2) then goes on to say that the Central Bank might, at the request of the Investor Compensation Company or of a compensation scheme for accountants, provide for an extension of the time for paying compensation of up to a further three months, which is a total of six months.  This is in accordance with the provisions of the investor compensation directive and was intended to deal with a situation where a compensation scheme comes under extreme funding pressure. However, it must not be forgotten that the directive applies only to a minority of investment firms.</P>
    <P>As the Bill was drafted, the Investor Compensation Company or an accountants' compensation scheme would be breaking the law if it was unable to pay out within six months.  Where payments under the compensation directive are concerned, we have no option but to provide for this. However, in all other cases our legal advice is that there are limits on the obligations which can legally be imposed on investment firms in terms of funding compensation if they are not covered by the directive.  To cover this situation I have amended the Bill so that there is a single provision dealing with inability to pay compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 25(8) has been deleted.  The replacement section 35(2) provides that payment of compensation may be deferred for an unspecified period, but with important safeguards for investors. It will be possible to defer payment of compensation only in exceptional circumstances.  The Central Bank will have to approve any delay and it will be able to impose conditions and requirements relating to the delay.  Investors will continue <Col N="644" /> to have a right to payment within three months in all but the most exceptional circumstances. We are dealing here with a situation where the roof falls in on the investment community. We have to cover every eventuality, however unlikely.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to ensure that product producers cannot evade their responsibilities under the Bill by including restrictive clauses in a contract given to an investment firm.</P>
    <P>Regarding amendment No. 7, section 42 originally provided for an exemption from liability for damages for the Central Bank, its officers and employees and for the compensation company and its officers and employees.  Section 20 provides that the bank can establish a subsidiary to provide administrative services to the Investor Compensation Company.  This amendment extends the exemption from liability which will be available to the company and to the bank to include a subsidiary set up by the bank.  This is essentially a technical amendment.  If the bank is to have this protection in providing administrative services to the company, as agreed by both Houses, and if it sets up a subsidiary to do the job, the subsidiary should logically have the same protection.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 21 and 22 are best considered as a group.  An amendment to section 43(7) was tabled on Committee Stage in this House and it was agreed to examine it.  I tabled this amendment and amendments Nos. 21 and 22, which amend similar provisions in the Investment Intermediaries and Stock Exchange Acts, as a result of that examination.  They are drafting amendments clarifying an offence provision relating to the provision of documents or information. I thank the Senators who tabled the original amendment for drawing the matter to my attention.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 9 to 16 can also be grouped. They amend sections 44 to 47 of the Bill which deal with solicitors who do investment and insurance business.  These eight amendments deal with difficulties which emerged following the passage of the Bill through this House.  The background to these sections is as follows.  The Bill plugs a potential compensation gap where solicitors are doing investment business.  Currently, if a solicitor is doing incidental investment or insurance business, the Law Society compensation fund provides compensation.  If the solicitor is doing non-incidental investment or insurance business, he should be a member of a compensation scheme under the Bill.  However, if he does not own up, he would be covered by neither the Law Society compensation fund nor by a compensation scheme under the Bill.  The Bill deals with this potential gap by assigning responsibility in such cases to the Law Society compensation fund.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 inserts a new section, section 48, in the Bill.  It ensures that the Central Bank will be able to pass information to the <Col N="645" /> Investor Compensation Company or to a subsidiary set up by the bank in accordance with section 20 to provide administrative services to the compensation company.  Otherwise the arrangement could not work.  The EU Investment Services Directive allows the disclosure of information by competent authorities &mdash; in this case, the Central Bank &mdash; to bodies which administer investment compensation schemes.  Hence the strict confidentiality regime of the Central Bank can be amended.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 23 is a technical amendment to the Long Title of the Bill arising from amendment No. 17.</P>
    <P>Section 51 provided that a liquidator or receiver of an investment business firm or of a Stock Exchange member firm would not be an investment business firm for the purposes of the Investment Intermediaries Act.  Amendment No. 18 extends that provision to liquidators and receivers generally because it would not be appropriate to require a liquidator or receiver to obtain authorisation from the Central Bank where their activities as a liquidator or receiver include, for example, selling shares owned by a company which was being liquidated or was in receivership.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is a drafting amendment to section 59.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that product producers are not prevented from doing business with a certified person, in other words, an accountant who provides only investment services which are incidental to the provision of accountancy services.</P>
    <P>Finally, we come to amendment No. 20.  Section 60 as introduced amended section 31 of the Investment Intermediaries Act to impose a requirement on a product producer to publish a newspaper notice where a written appointment with an investment product intermediary had been discontinued.  This section was recommended by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy which examined the collapse of the Taylor group of investment companies. The purpose of the section is to try to ensure that the public is aware that an intermediary may no longer do business on behalf of a product producer. The section has been amended to allow the written notice to be published by the intermediary, because of concerns that publication by the product producer might damage the intermediary. Where the intermediary does not publish a notice within 14 days, the product producer will be obliged to do so.  This achieves the end of informing the public but in a modified way which reduces the possibility that there might be a misunderstanding as to why the intermediary is no longer dealing with the product producer because in the majority of cases the written appointment will be discontinued for commercial reasons.</P>
    <P>The remaining amendments on the list have been dealt with already.</P>

      <P>I am not sure we are dealing with the return of the Bill to the House as we <Col N="646" /> should.  It only came to our notice yesterday that we would have to bring the Bill back to the House and it was only this morning that I got the list of amendments.  I did not bring the Bill originally through this House and I feel this is an unsatisfactory way to do business.  I am not even sure which of the 22 amendments were thoroughly debated previously either in the Dáil or by the Select Committee.  Of course, no Members of the Seanad were party to the debate at the Select Committee.  I feel I am under a considerable handicap in doing justice to this very important legislation.  The need to have the Bill passed before the end of the session is not a justification for not parsing and analysing it.  Some of the amendments may be new and may not have been discussed by my parliamentary party or by my party spokesman.  I do not know.  This is a dangerous way to proceed.</P>
      <P>The Opposition may be criticised when the Bill is in operation for having failed to ensure that the Bill was adequately examined.</P>

      <P>May I, to be helpful, make two points?  The Committee Stage of the Bill was long and extensive.  I accept that Senators were not party to it but it lasted more than seven hours which was quite exceptional.  I have brought no new amendments today which were not discussed by the Senator's colleagues either in the Select Committee or on Report and Final Stages. Indeed, some amendments came from the Opposition. There is nothing new which has not been discussed in great detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for that helpful interjection.  We have not even had time to read the Official Report of the debate in the Dáil.  This is not a satisfactory way to do business. I was thrust the list of amendments as I walked to the House this morning.  We must examine how we do our business in the interests of ensuring the relevance of this House and the important job with which we are charged.</P>
      <P>I have no difficulty accepting the amendments before us.  I thank the Minister for accepting amendments from my colleague, Deputy Noonan, in the other House.  This is an example of a Minister listening to reasoned cases made by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>On reading the Official Report of the debate in the Dáil on 30 June, I see that when my colleague, Deputy Noonan, proposed amendments to section 18 the Minister initially gave a stock reply which had been prepared for him.  I will not embarrass him or his officials by going through it in detail but the reply given was not even relevant to the amendment tabled by Deputy Noonan.  He had moved his position, having listened to a previous reasoned response from the Minister and had tabled a new amendment which took account of the Minster's advice.  The Minister's reply referred to the detail in the original amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, having listened to the point made by Deputy Noonan, the Minister accepted his <Col N="647" /> amendment and I thank him for that.  That is how the Houses of the Oireachtas should function. That is the point of examining legislation line by line and illustrates why, simply because a Government has a majority, we should not rubber stamp legislation or push it through without regard to opinion on all sides.  It is a reflection on the Minster's intellectual integrity that he responded so positively to Opposition amendments.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about outstanding difficulties in relation to the industry working party on the Investor Compensation Bill.  The working party has proposed changes to section 60 and I would like the Minister to address their concerns, to say how far he has been able to meet them and why the specific points they make have not been met. It has been difficult, in the hour available to me, to catch up on the proceedings of the last two days.  I understand from media reports that the Minister rejected proposed changes to the Bill from the investment industry working party who wanted section 60, which deals with the treatment of intermediaries, dropped.  The Minister rejected this amendment and said that the Bill had to strike a balance between the interests of the investment industry and consumers.  No one could disagree with that.  However, under the terms of the original section, investment institutions which are required to give a letter of appointment to intermediaries with whom they do business must publish notice of discontinuation of appointments in a national newspaper.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State appeared before the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service he agreed that there was a need to change the section and he put down an amendment to that effect.  However, he refused to delete the section. Under the Government amendment the intermediary rather than the investing institution must publish in a national newspaper the withdrawal of the letter of appointment within 14 days.  If this does not happen, responsibility reverts to the product provider to publish the information.</P>
    <P>Anne Fitzgerald, the chairperson of the working party, is still not satisfied and believes that investors will not be fully protected under the amendment.  She said that consumers' problems are exacerbated by the fact that a fraudulent intermediary has 14 days to publish a notice before the product producer is forced to act. &ldquo;This is 14 days in which to defraud,&rdquo; she said. The working party suggested that if the section is retained, it should force companies to inform the Central Bank within three days of discontinuance. It also suggested that the bank be forced to accept responsibility for accurate updating of its register of intermediaries.</P>
    <P>In response, the Minister of State said that if somebody wanted to defraud an investor, they could do so within 24 hours as easily as within 14 days.  My colleague, Deputy Noonan, asked why the Central Bank should not be responsible for placing the notice.  The Minister of State said he <Col N="648" /> did not think it would be a good idea.  At that stage he also put on record details about the likely size of the fund to be established to compensate defrauded investors.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about this area, although that might relate to the fact that I am not thoroughly fluent on the line by line provisions of the Bill. However, to ensure I am doing the job with which I am charged, I ask the Minister of State to develop his reasons for not accepting the deletion of section 60 as suggested by the working group and to respond to media reports of the group's ongoing concern subsequent to the Select Committee's deliberations on the section.</P>
    <P>The £15,500 limit was discussed in detail in the Dáil and I am aware that it is linked to the EU directive.  There is a similar limit on cross border transfers of moneys within the EU.  This and other directives have been discussed in detail in both Houses.  Nevertheless, the £15,500 maximum compensation limit is a small amount <i>vis-à-vis</i> the type of investment that occurs in many cases.  On the one hand one can say that the investor is aware that it is a maximum limit and is, therefore, aware of the risks he or she is taking if they expose themselves beyond that amount.  On the other hand, however, in the overall context of investment and attracting money, it is an extremely small amount.</P>
    <P>Is there provision for indexing this limit or is it unalterable until it is amended on foot of another regulation or EU directive to change it?  How does the £15,500 or 20,000 ECUs maximum compensation limit keep pace with inflation?  Why is it pitched at such a modest level?  The answers to these questions should be on record to ensure complete understanding of the logistics of the compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bill well.  It provides for the payment of compensation to clients of investment business firms, Stock Exchange member firms, credit institutions and insurance intermediaries &mdash; so called investment firms &mdash; when an investment firm is unable to return money or investment instruments belonging to clients.  It also transposes the EU investor compensation directive into Irish law.  The Central Bank will be the supervisory authority for investor compensation and the competent authority in the State for the purposes of the investor compensation directive.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a limited company to administer investor compensation arrangements, some details of which we are dealing with this morning.  I thank the Minister of State and his staff for the time they have invested in promoting this important legislation. It is part of the body of legislation required to instil security in the general financial services and investment sector.  Only last night the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and Public Affairs recommended the establishment of an independent financial services authority in its response to the investigations of the National Irish Bank and Ansbacher scandals.  Could the Minister of State comment on the role such a financial services <Col N="649" /> authority might have with regard to regulating and supervising these sectors and on how that function might or might not dovetail with the business before the House today?</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for his attention and for accepting amendments from all sides of the House.</P>

      <P>Like Senator Doyle, I am concerned at the short notice Members were given for dealing with this Bill.  Given that it is important legislation, it is understandable that the Government is anxious to have it passed before the end of the session.  However, we take our responsibilities as legislators seriously and we would appreciate time to peruse the amendments. I am aware that the Minister of State and his officials put a great deal of work into this legislation. Therefore, since a proper examination of the provisions would require a considerable amount of time and research, I am prepared to take the work of the Minister of State and his officials on trust in that regard.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, Senator Dardis spoke about the need for legislation such as this.  He was referring to the Food Safety Authority, but it is indicative of our times that complex regulatory and protective structures must be put in place for consumers and customers, particularly in the financial services sector where there are major issues of public concern not only in relation to the Ansbacher accounts and the tribunals of inquiry but also with regard to how banks conduct their business. Senator Doyle referred to the recommendation of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for the establishment of an independent financial services authority.  That appears to be a sensible suggestion which would probably receive all-party support.</P>
      <P>The Bill before the House is designed to provide a level of protection for investors.  However, one will be unable to judge its effectiveness in according such protection until after its implementation. I wish to put on record my appreciation of the work done by the Minister of State and his officials on this legislation.  I hope it will be effective and that the Oireachtas will not be required to revisit this issue as more concerns arise about the operation of financial services.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. As a former Member of the Seanad, I have great respect for its work.  I do not order the business of the Seanad but I and my officials did everything we could to accommodate all views on this legislation.  A number of good points were put forward and my acceptance of relevant amendments has improved the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle raised a number of important points.  I presume she is not suggesting that we remove the important provision in section 60 which is the central consumer interest provision. Viewed in that context, one can understand the view of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="650" /> It is my role to strike a balance between the industry and the consumer.  When I introduced this Bill here I emphasised this was a consumer oriented Bill.  My concern and that of the Oireachtas Select Committee involved, as expressed over some of the debacles that happened, was that we must put in place legislation oriented in a way that would offer as much protection as possible to consumers.</P>
    <P>With regard to section 60, the industry was initially concerned that the intermediary would have difficulties if product producers published a notice that an intermediary was no longer taking business from them.  When an intermediary ceases to do business with a product producer it does not signal there is something wrong.  An intermediary can take this step for all sorts of commercial reasons and it is their choice to do so. If a product producer published a notice in the newspaper it could convey the wrong impression, that it had to do with some fraudulent activity on behalf of the intermediary, which may not have been the case at all.  We agreed that there was merit in this point and changed the situation to allow an intermediary to publish a notice.  We also left it up to them to decide what to put in their notice with regard to the reason for their termination of an arrangement.  That would have overcome the industry's difficulty.  Unfortunately, when we moved to do this other issues were raised.</P>
    <P>In reality, it is my business, as it is all Members, to ensure that the consumer gets information, which is what section 60 is all about.  This section tries to ensure the consumer understands the reasons a product producer is no longer dealing with an intermediary; but this should not be done in a manner that would automatically convey there was some fraudulent activity, because that is not always the case.  There are many reasons for an intermediary to terminate business.  I am sure the Senator was not suggesting we should not look after the consumer but ensure that the consumer gets the information.</P>
    <P>First, we decided to make changes to allow for an intermediary to publish the notice.  Second, I inserted a timeframe of 14 days.  When this issue was debated on Report and Final Stages, in response to Deputy Noonan, I stated that there was not much point in my inserting a timeframe of three or four days in the Bill knowing that this deadline could not be met.  Obviously an intermediary would seek legal advice and then it could take up to seven days to publish the notice in the newspaper.  A timeframe of fourteen days seemed reasonable and when I explained it in those terms all Members agreed that it was reasonable.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that there is a reasonable timeframe that allows time to publish the notice in the newspapers.  I did not want to put in a timeframe that obviously would be impossible to meet and would negate the whole prospect for all sorts of extraneous reasons as to why the information was not there in the first place.  I wanted to be reasonably precise but fair and give a workable, practicable <Col N="651" /> approach rather than some aspirational approach.</P>
    <P>Members will agree that this is how we should legislate.  There are many things we would like to include in legislation that would only be suitable in a perfect world and that we know in practice cannot be done for various reasons.  I was not going to start the Investor Compensation Company and this very important fund by putting it in place and then doing things that could negate its ability to function in the widest sense.  That is why I inserted a 14 day timeframe.</P>
    <P>Section 60 is a very important provision from the consumer's perspective &mdash; the industry might have all sorts of views on it.  We have struck a very good balance between the rights of the industry and the consumer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have every confidence in the intellectual capacity of the person the Senator mentioned and they are a very valuable contributor to this area, but there is a particular perspective being put forward that I have to make a judgment on.  My judgment is that I must balance the consumer interest with the industry.</P>
      <P>The latest question is: why would we not do the same for the Central Bank?  It is going to publish reservations about a client and it is the regulator. It would be a bad reflection on an intermediary if the Central Bank published a notice in the newspaper with regard to that person because it might not convey precisely why the intermediary was leaving or give a different impression altogether. That person may be only moving or discontinuing business with one product producer and yet have many different agency arrangements with other product producers.  It is not right for the Central Bank, as a regulator, to publish such notices.</P>
      <P>I have got to be fair in the interest of the consumer and the intermediary because we must not presume that in the termination of many of these arrangements there is a fraudulent activity.  We have to realise that this is a commercial world and there are many reasons an intermediary would terminate business arrangements with a product producer.  I am sure it happens regularly.  Exclusive arrangements come along, new products come on the market, intermediaries move because they were no longer interested in their clients, etc. Therefore, I had to allow some latitude on this issue.  If there is fraudulent activity or suspicion of same, the notice must be published.  It is then up to the investor to question the reason behind it.  Our business is to ensure the information is published in the proper fashion and we have achieved this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator A. Doyle raised the issue of compensation but this has already been discussed at length.  I do not accept that it is a paltry sum. First, we must remember there was no compensation <Col N="652" /> in the past and now £15,500 or 90 per cent of the total loss is available to compensate a person who has been defrauded by an intermediary. It would have been nice to be able to allow for a very large sum which could cover all claims, but then <i>caveat emptor</i> is forgotten about along with people's ability to discern between intermediaries and products.</P>
    <P>Second, if I insisted on a very high compensation figure it would have been more difficult to launch the fund.  The costs involved might have been so substantial as to make it impossible to get it off the ground and there might have been an attempt to make the consumer pay for some of the costs.  This is like an insurance policy in some respects and the costs could be so prohibitive as to make it not worthwhile.  I am open to the prospect, depending on how the fund is working, of increasing the compensation figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>This point already came up, that the Minister could possibly arbitrarily increase the fund.  But this is primary legislation, a point accepted by the Senator's colleague, and I am not keen on Ministers having arbitration functions in that regard.  This should be resolved by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It does not mean we have to bring in a new Investor Compensation Bill just to deal with this situation.  There is an ongoing range of financial legislation being passed through both Houses, which will continue because the market is evolving so fast.  Therefore, there will be ample opportunity to amend this provision on an ongoing basis if the House sees fit.  There is no question of having to wait for years to do this.</P>
      <P>I think we have struck a very good balance.  I appreciate all the contributions made by Senators and that the Bill was introduced here.</P>
      <P>I must refer to the single regulatory authority. The recommendation of the Oireachtas committee regarding a single regulatory authority is interesting.  Senator Doyle mentioned this matter on Second Stage.  However, it does not relate directly to the Bill.  The Senator is correct; this type of legislation begs a specific question and merits discussion.  However, it would not be appropriate to do so in the context of this Bill. A working party established by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, is due to report soon and it will probably deal with this issue.</P>

      <P>The impetus towards EMU is gathering pace.  As the House will be aware, over the weekend of 1-3 May the Heads of State of Governments of the EU member states confirmed that 11 member states qualify to join EMU and adopt the euro from 1 January 1999.  Ireland is one of the 11; the others are Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Portugal, Finland, Austria and Spain.</P>
      <P>Over the same weekend, as was widely expected, ECOFIN Ministers announced that the current ERM bilateral central rates will be used in determining the irrevocable conversion rates on 1 January 1999.  This announcement provides a clear message to the markets and will assist financial market stability in the run up to EMU.  The decision to use ERM central rates is consistent with economic fundamentals and the sustainable convergence of the member states concerned.  I am satisfied that, after the revaluation of the IR£'s ERM central rate on 14 March last, the economy is well placed to participate in EMU from the outset.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Ireland faces into EMU from a position of economic strength, very strong growth, rapid employment creation, moderate inflation, a budget comfortably in surplus and a rapidly declining debt ratio.  The launch of the euro presents us with a historic opportunity to build on the economic and social progress we have achieved over recent years by promoting accelerated economic convergence and integration of the economy with our EU partners.  Furthermore, economic recovery is becoming well established in Europe strengthening the opportunities which EMU presents.</P>
      <P>Confirmation of the member states qualifying for EMU and the pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates to apply from 1 January 1999 was followed by the establishment of the European Central Bank.  Obviously, the ECB will have a crucial role to play in ensuring the ongoing success and stability of the euro.  With these historic events so recent, it is appropriate that we should now discuss the Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998.  This is the third Bill containing provisions relating to EMU and the euro to come before the House this year.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank Act, 1998, provided for the compatibility of Central Bank legislation with Articles 107 and 108 of the Maastricht Treaty, while the Finance Act, 1998, addressed taxation issues relating to the introduction of the euro. This Bill, as promised in the national changeover plan, is designed to provide for the other changes in monetary law and other changes necessary for the introduction of the euro.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> While the Bill is generally technical in nature, it nevertheless marks the historic nature of the decision to enter EMU by declaring that, by virtue of the relevant EU regulation, from 1 January 1999 the euro is the currency of the State.  We consulted widely in the preparation of the Bill, and I want to put on record my appreciation to all the organisations involved in that consultation, including those represented on the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, for their valuable contributions.</P>
    <P>Any consideration of the provisions of the Bill must take as its starting point the legal framework which has been set down at EU level for the use of the euro.  Accordingly, I will outline this legal framework.  I will then describe the provisions of the Bill before dealing with a subject in which I know Senators take a keen interest, the practical preparations which are in train for the changeover to the euro.</P>
    <P>Two EU regulations together comprise the EU legal framework.  The first is Council Regulation 1103/97 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro which was adopted by the Council on 17 June 1997.  This regulation provides for continuity of contracts and other legal instruments and for the technical rules, including rounding rules, for conversions between participating currencies and the euro.  It also provides that, from 1 January 1999, the euro will replace the ECU at a rate of one to one.</P>
    <P>The second regulation is Council Regulation 974/98 on the introduction of the euro which was formally adopted on 3 May 1998.  This regulation provides that, from 1 January 1999, the euro will be the currency of the participating member states and sets out the rules governing the three year transitional period which begins on 1 January 1999 and ends on 31 December 2001.</P>
    <P>During the transitional period, national currencies will continue to exist as subdivisions of the euro and since euro notes and coins will not be available until 1 January 2002, all cash transactions will remain in national currency.  Until then, the principle of &ldquo;no compulsion/no prohibition&rdquo; will apply, whereby economic agents will be free to use the euro but will not be compelled to do so.</P>
    <P>During the transitional period, unless parties agree otherwise, contracts and other legal instruments denominated in national currency will continue to be performed in national currency, while those denominated in euro will be performed in euro.  However, the regulation contains an important provision about payments made by crediting an account.  It provides that where a payment can be made by crediting an account, a debtor may pay either in euro or in the national currency of the member state where the creditor has his or her account.</P>
    <P>The payment must be credited by the financial institution to the account in the denomination of the account, that is, whether it is in the national currency or the euro.  Therefore, a payment in euro credited to an IR£ account in Ireland will <Col N="655" /> automatically be converted into IR£s and a payment in IR£s credited to a euro account in Ireland will be converted into euro.</P>
    <P>In addition, the regulation provides that member states may take measures for the redenomination of debt into euro and for redenomination of the unit of account of organised markets, for example, stock markets, and of payment systems. Section 23 of the Bill contains measures relating to the redenomination of debt.</P>
    <P>Council Regulation 974/98 also deals with the final changeover to the euro, which will take place from 1 January 2002.  From that date euro notes and coins will be put into circulation and will be legal tender across all the participating member states and references in contracts and legal instruments to participating currencies will be read as references to the euro at the relevant conversion rate.  Thus, on 1 January 2002 the legal changeover will be complete and all IR£ denominated bank accounts, laws and contracts will be read as if they were in euro according to the conversion rate.</P>
    <P>However, the regulation provides that national currency notes and coins may remain legal tender for at most six months more, that is, up to 30 June 2002.  This period may be shortened by national law.</P>

      <P>This was debated at length on Committee Stage in the other House.  There is provision in the Bill to allow it to be shortened but it cannot be said at this stage whether that will happen.</P>
      <P>The EU legal framework comprises the core monetary law of the euro area and the two regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in Ireland.  However, some national legislation is still necessary, both for the sake of clarity in national law and to avail of options in the legal framework, and that is essentially the purpose of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should mention at this point that the heads of the Bill which were circulated for consultation to interested parties last March contained a more extensive reflection of the terms of the EU legal framework than is now in the Bill.  However, the European Monetary Institute, in its opinion on the heads, expressed a legal concern about such an approach as EU regulations have direct effect in national law.  Accordingly, the Bill now adopts a narrower approach, essentially declaring that by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State is the euro and the Irish pound is a subdivision of it.  The EMI accepted the need to refer in national legislation to the lawful currency of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMI's opinion also raised some other points which have been reflected in the Bill, notably as regards two imperfections in Central Bank legislation which were raised in its legal convergence report in March, and the desirability <Col N="656" /> of a reference to the fact that DIBOR &mdash; the Dublin Interbank Offered Rate &mdash; will be replaced from 1 January 1999 by EURIBOR &mdash; the Euro Interbank Offered Rate.  The EMI also offered some valuable drafting suggestions which have been taken on board.</P>
    <P>Now that I have described the EU legal framework, it is time to turn to the details of the Bill itself.  I will start with an overview of its main provisions.</P>
    <P>As I have already said, the Bill declares that, by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State will be the euro and the Irish pound will be a subdivision of it.  Second, the Bill removes incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the EU legal framework for the use of the euro; it also recognises the role of the European Central Bank as regards the issue of notes and as regards the volume of coins to be issued.  Third, the Bill stares that as of 1 January 1999, DIBOR will be replaced by EURIBOR.  Fourth, the Bill makes provision in relation to the redenomination into euro of outstanding Government debt.</P>
    <P>In addition, at the request of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have included three provisions relating to the redenomination of company share capital into euro.  These provisions will facilitate companies which wish to redenominate their capital structure into euro before 1 January 2002.  Finally, the Bill provides for the design, issue and sale of commemorative legal tender coinage.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Sections 1 to 4 contain standard provisions as regards short title and commencement, interpretation, expenses and the laying of regulations and orders before the Oireachtas.  Section 5 is a definitions section.</P>
    <P>Section 6 declares that, by virtue of Council Regulation 974/98, from 1 January 1999 the currency of the State will be the euro and the Irish pound will be a subdivision of it.  In so doing, it amends section 24 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, which defines the Irish pound as the monetary unit of the State.  The section also amends the statement in the Decimal Currency Act, 1969, that the Irish pound and penny are the only legal denominations of the currency of the State, because obviously that will no longer be true with the advent of the euro.</P>
    <P>Section 7 declares that contracts may be denominated in euro during the transitional period by virtue of Regulation 974/98, despite the fact that euro notes and coins will not be in circulation. This provision overrides section 25 of the Central Bank, 1989: briefly, that section requires contracts to be either in legal tender or in a currency other than the currency of the State.  As the euro will be neither during the transitional period, it is necessary to override the 1989 Act provision.</P>
    <P>Sections 8 to 14 deal with legal tender and legal tender amounts, and with the provision and issue of euro coins and their costs and proceeds. <Col N="657" /> Section 9 gives the Minister for Finance power to set a date for the withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins before 30 June 2002.  It is too early to set a date for withdrawal of legal tender status, so the section gives the Minister power to withdraw that status by order.  An order under this section must be laid in draft before each House of the Oireachtas and will require a resolution of each House to approve it before it is made.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that no one other than the Central Bank and persons designated by ministerial order will be obliged to accept more than 50 euro coins in any single transaction.  Article 11 of Regulation 974/98 sets this general limit of 50 coins.  Section 10 also provides for the repeal, from the date of withdrawal of legal tender status from Irish pound notes and coins, of the present rules about legal tender of coins.</P>
    <P>Section 11 empowers the Minister for Finance to provide and issue euro coins and to set out by order their technical specifications, subject to the requirements of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Treaty provides that the specifications of euro coins must comply with the technical specifications which the EU Council of Ministers lays down.  It also provides that the issuance of such coins will be subject to the approval by the European Central Bank of the volume of issue, as will issuance of commemorative coins provided under Part III of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for protection against counterfeiting for coins &mdash; including commemorative coins &mdash; issued under this legislation, and for euro coins issued by other member states. Sections 13 and 14 deal with the costs of providing, and the proceeds of issuing, euro coins.</P>
    <P>Chapter IV of Part II of the Bill, sections 15 to 19, deals with the calling in and redemption of notes and coins.  The expression &ldquo;to call in&rdquo; means to demonetise or put out of currency. Redemption involves the replacement of notes and coins by giving value for them by the issue of other coins or of currency notes, or by crediting their face value against an account at the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Sections 15 and 16, respectively, provide for the calling in and redemption of coins issued under this Bill, and euro coins issued by other participating member states which will be legal tender in Ireland.  In addition, section 15 limits the Minister's calling-in power by requiring the consent of the European Central Bank to any order under that section relating to matters within its competence.</P>
    <P>Section 17 extends the existing prohibition on melting down of coins to include coins issued under this Bill and euro coins issued by other participating member states which will be legal tender in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides that the Central Bank may continue to redeem Irish pound notes, even after they have ceased to be legal tender.  Section 19 provides that the Central Bank must have the <Col N="658" /> authority of the European Central Bank to call in notes.</P>
    <P>Sections 20 to 30 are a miscellaneous collection of sections.  The main provisions in them relate to the substitution of EURIBOR for DIBOR, redenomination of debt and redenomination of company share capital.</P>
    <P>Section 20 amends section 57 of the Copyright Act, 1963, to reflect the copyright of the European Central Bank in relation to euro notes, and the copyright of the Minister for Finance in relation to the national face of euro coins issued under Section 11.  As Senators will be aware, euro coins will have a national face: in our case the national face will show the 12 stars of the EU flag, the year, the harp and the word &ldquo;Éire&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 21 allows the issuing authority for statutory forms which contain references to sums in Irish pounds, or which are designed to accommodate references to such sums, to change the forms, or allow them to be changed, to show also the corresponding amounts in euro or to accommodate references to sums in euro.</P>
    <P>Section 22 states that from 1 January 1999, the Dublin Interbank Offered Rate &mdash; DIBOR &mdash; will be replaced by the Euro Interbank Offered Rate &mdash; EURIBOR.  A statement to this effect has already been made in the national changeover plan.</P>
    <P>Section 23 governs the arrangements for the redenomination of tradeable debt instruments during the transitional period.  The transitional period runs from 1 January 1999 to 31 December 2001.  Section 23 also contains certain provisions for facilitating the redenomination of the non-tradeable debt of State bodies.</P>
    <P>All the member states that will participate in EMU, including Ireland, have indicated they intend to redenominate their &ldquo;own currency&rdquo; tradeable debt instruments in the first week of 1999. For Ireland, it is particularly important to redenominate our domestic currency debt into the euro as soon as it becomes feasible.  We will be a small issuer in a large euro bond market, so we will need to ensure the liquidity and attractiveness of our bonds from the very outset to secure our place in that market.</P>
    <P>Obviously, the markets should be crystal clear as to how bonds and Exchequer notes issued by me, or by the National Treasury Management Agency on my behalf, will be redenominated.  It would be inappropriate to use primary legislation to this end, so I intend later this year to issue an order under section 23(1) which will set out the method of redenomination.</P>
    <P>In that order I will be specifying what is called a bottom up method of redenomination.  This is designed to redenominate the debt with the least possible inconvenience to bond holders, the NTMA and the Central Bank.  The bottom up method simply involves changing the denomination of each individual holding of a bond using the conversion rate, and issuing or withdrawing small amounts of that bond to ensure that the sum of the individual holdings of the bond will <Col N="659" /> equal the euro value of the total Irish pound amount of the bond.</P>
    <P>I understand the NTMA has no current intention to redenominate Irish Government debt issued under the law of another participating member state and denominated in currencies to be replaced by the euro.  If circumstances arise in which it might be necessary or desirable to redenominate this debt, subsection (2) provides that the method used should comply with the law of the member state which governs the debt in question. The NTMA will, of course, be keeping the question of redenominating this category of debt under active review.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in subsection (2) that, where other issuers of tradeable debt choose to use the method envisaged for redenominating Government debt which I will set out in the order I will be making later in the year, they will have the authority of law to do so unilaterally: use of any other method will be subject to the applicable contract.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 23(3) has been included to facilitate the redenomination of the non-tradeable debt of State bodies.  Essentially, my aim in that subsection is to remove a potential administrative obstacle to such redenomination.</P>
    <P>Sections 24, 25 and 26 have been included at the request of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  They are designed to set out how redenomination of company share capital will be effected when, on 1 January 2002, references to national currencies in legal instruments are to be read as references to the euro at the conversion rate.  They also provide a mechanism whereby companies wishing to redenominate their share capital into euro during the transitional period will be able to do so.</P>
    <P>To redenominate or redenominalise its share capital during the transitional period, a company will have to have the necessary resolution passed by its shareholders.  The redenomination must occur at the level of the total share capital authorised or issued, or at the level of the total class of share.  The individual nominal share par value will then be determined by dividing the redenominated amount by the number of shares involved, and the nominal share par value will be expressed in an unrounded amount.</P>
    <P>Many companies are likely to want to express their nominal share value in even euro amounts, and section 26 will facilitate such companies.  It deals with situations where the renominalisation involves an increase in capital, as well as situations where it involves a decrease.  If an increase is involved, use may be made of distributable reserves or the introduction of additional capital, while if there is a decrease, an amount equal to the decrease &mdash; which cannot amount to more than 10 per cent of the reduced capital &mdash; will have to be paid into a fund to be known as a capital conversion reserve fund.  In essence, where the renominalisation involves a decrease in nominal value, the actual total amount of the <Col N="660" /> company's capital will remain unchanged, but will be expressed in different ways.</P>
    <P>Renominalisation in this way will be available during the transitional period and for an 18 month period after the end of the transitional period.  After that, companies wishing to adjust their capital will have to operate under the existing company law provisions.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 relate to two legal imperfections which were identified by the European Monetary Institute in its assessment of Ireland's legal convergence in March 1998.  I undertook to address these imperfections at an early date and these two sections do so.  Section 27 amends section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989, to confirm that the Minister for Finance's ability to suspend certain transactions in the national interest under that section will be without prejudice to the performance by the Central Bank of any function, duty or power required under the Treaty or the Statute of the European System of Central Banks &mdash; the ESCB.</P>
    <P>The second imperfection identified by the EMI is dealt with by section 28, which amends sections 10 and 13 of the Central Bank Act, 1997, to confirm that the requirement that the Minister for Finance's consent be obtained before the Central Bank refuses to approve the rules of a payment system or subsequently revokes such approval will not extend to the ESCB related activities of the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>Section 29 empowers the Minister for Finance to make regulations for enabling Part II of the Bill to have full effect.  Sections 30 to 34 provide for the design, issue and sale of commemorative legal tender coinage and for the cost of their provision and the proceeds of their issue, and applies the Copyright Act, 1963, to them.  Commemorative coins have been only a rare feature of Irish coinage over the years but essentially the Bill codifies the practice which has been followed up to now in relation to the issuance of such coins when it has occurred.</P>
    <P>Regarding practical preparations for the changeover to the euro, Senators will be aware that in January I published the second edition of the national changeover plan.  This sets out the arrangements that will be made by the public sector, the banks and building societies and the Irish Stock Exchange for the changeover to the euro. It also contains an appendix which describes the changeover work being done by various public and private sector bodies and lists contact points for further information.  I aim to publish a third edition of the plan in the run-up to the start of EMU.</P>
    <P>On 5 May 1998, I established the Euro Changeover Board of Ireland, which has two tasks: to oversee the implementation of the changeover to the euro and to provide public and consumer information about it.  In early June I launched an information campaign by the board aimed at the general public.  This included an information leaflet which is being distributed to all households <Col N="661" /> and an advertising campaign on television and radio and in the print media.</P>
    <P>Regarding information for business, Senators will be aware of the excellent information pack which has been prepared by the Forfás Business Awareness Campaign.  Over 35,000 copies of this pack have been circulated.  In addition, over 80,000 copies of a short brochure summarising the key issues for small and medium enterprises have been distributed by Forfás, while over 140,000 copies of a summary leaflet about EMU and the euro have been distributed in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  Forfás has also organised two radio advertising campaigns offering businesses the opportunity to phone a dedicated euro-line for information.</P>
    <P>The campaign has conducted two surveys on awareness and preparedness levels in the enterprise sector &mdash; a benchmark survey in June 1997 and a follow-up survey earlier this year.  The surveys were conducted among 600 businesses and reflect the broad structure of Irish industry. Overall, small and medium enterprises &mdash; that is, businesses with less than £1 million in turnover &mdash; are less well prepared for EMU than larger firms.  However, the more recent survey results indicated a greater level of awareness among small and medium enterprises.  The message for all companies remains the same: if you have not already begun to prepare, then you should start immediately.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that as well as the Forfás campaign, many other organisations such as the banks, the accountancy profession and also the representative organisations of business are also providing information and advice on the changeover to the euro.</P>
    <P>EMU and the changeover to the euro will require much preparation across the economy. This Bill, while generally technical in nature, represents an important third step, after the Central Bank Act, 1998, and the Finance Act, 1998, in our domestic legislative preparations for the introduction of the euro.  Indeed, it marks a historic change in our monetary law by declaring that from 1 January 1999 the euro is the currency of the State, as well as providing for redenomination of debt into euro and facilitating the redenomination and renominalisation of company share capital.</P>
    <P>There is a matter related to section 27 to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.  Section 27 (b) substitutes a new subsection for subsection (7) of section 134 of the Central Bank Act, 1989. Where such substitutions are made in legislation, it is usual to insert the subsection number in the text of the new subsection.  In other words, on page 16, line 3, it would be usual to insert, after the double quotation, the number (7).  This is the usual practice followed, and it is only due to a clerical omission that it has not been followed in the present text.  Accordingly I wish to ask the Cathaoirleach to direct the Clerk of the Seanad to make a versional change, under Standing Order 103, to page 16, line 3, by inserting, after <Col N="662" /> the double quotation marks, the number 7 in brackets.  I stress that this is not a substantive change.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the Bill.  During the debate on the Central Bank Bill Members spoke about EMU so I will be relying on my contribution on that occasion, lest anyone think I am plagiarising someone else.</P>
      <P>An ESRI study published in July 1996 and a NESC report entitled &ldquo;EU Integration and Enlargement&rdquo; both concluded that, on balance, membership of the EMU would be advantageous for Ireland even if the United Kingdom did not join, and that our strategic interest lay in full economic and monetary union.  The ESRI conclusions stand up two years later and, according to one of its editors, Mr. Terry Baker, the risks of EMU are now considerably lower than they were in 1996.  There are several reasons for this &mdash; the strengthening of our public finances, an increase in participants, a massive appreciation in sterling and a major policy change by the UK Government in favour of eventual membership of EMU.  Last October the UK Chancellor, Mr. Gordon Brown, said:</P>
      <P>If, in the end, a single currency is successful and the economic case is clear and unambiguous, then the Government believes Britain should be part of it.</P>
      <P>The British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair said this week:</P>
      <P>Our policy has not changed since October. What has changed is the fact that EMU is now happening and all of us, not least the City of London, must prepare for its arrival.</P>
      <P>He went on to say:</P>
      <P>If we join, it will be on the basis of national economic interest, according to a series of economic tests set out by the Chancellor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He concluded by saying the people will have the final say in a referendum.  I refer specifically to the statements by Chancellor Brown and the Prime Minister Tony Blair because one of the great down sides regularly quoted for some years in relation to joining the single currency has been the risk of sterling shock and Britain's failure to join EMU.  These issues are mentioned in the context of our dependence on the UK market and our historic links with sterling.  One does not have to travel too far beyond these shores to find that most economic commentators effectively consider we are linked with sterling, albeit not officially, in the context of our economy, trading patterns and markets.  As such one of the biggest concerns, which is quite legitimate, is that while on balance it is right for us to join, sterling will <Col N="663" /> be outside EMU.  We must measure and understand as carefully and as well as possible the implications of this and how things will pan out in future.</P>
    <P>I referred to the fact that the British Chancellor set out a series of tests which Britain would use to measure when it was ready to enter EMU.  On discussing the Central Bank Bill I alluded to these tests, which I found extremely helpful in concentrating my mind on the issues and the negatives and positives.  There is much I could say for and against EMU if asked to do so.  Like many politicians on many issues, we can field arguments on both sides.</P>
    <P>The primary reason for Britain not entering, and conversely one of the reasons we have &mdash; although I am not sure about this &mdash; is the lack of economic convergence.  I do not wish to be facetious in suggesting that we must carefully examine this issue as the argument is equally applicable here.  Many eminent economists, including Chris Johns of Allied Irish Capital Management Limited, support this approach.  The British Treasury measures the difference between the actual and potential output of the economy to compare economic cycles <i>vis-à-vis</i> general economic convergence in Europe.  Terry Baker of the ESRI commented on this to the effect that the divergence in economic cycles between Ireland and Germany or France is clear from both growth and interest rates, whatever measurement is used.  According to the latest EU figures, our economy will grow by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent this year while Germany's will grow by approximately 2.5 per cent and France's by between 2 per cent and 2.3 per cent. The economic cycles are completely out of synch. Our short term interest rates are approximately 6 per cent, compared to 3 per cent in Germany. Economic and monetary union will mean monetary policies, therefore, which suit Germany and France but which may not be appropriate to us. This is one of the nubs of the matter.</P>
    <P>I was interested to read a comment attributed to Mr. Wim Duisenberg, the new president of the European Central Bank, in relation to this issue. In no uncertain terms he made it quite clear that monetary policy in general will be dictated by the larger economies in Europe, namely, France and Germany.  He said &ldquo;because the economic weighting of France and Germany in the Euro zone was high, it would be appropriate for interest rates to converge at a low point&rdquo;.  Either we can expect German interest rates to increase slightly between now and the end of the year, something which seems unlikely according to economists &mdash; I take their word for it as I do not have the experience to assess the matter for myself &mdash; or rates here to be reduced by 2 per cent.  A reduction of 2 per cent in interest rates must impact on our growth and economy and the issue of over eating and inflation must be debated.  On the other hand, we can look to the <Col N="664" /> US where the economy has had low inflation and high growth.</P>
    <P>This area, which provided the bible of many economists, appears to need urgent rewriting in terms of interpretation.  It is very hard for a lay person in economic matters such as myself to know whom to listen to.  There was a time when a drop of 2 per cent in interest rates and the spin off growth almost automatically equated with inflation and overheating.  We are now being told this need not be so.  I would like the Minister to give assurances in relation to the potential impact of a 2 per cent drop in interest rates by Christmas, something the Taoiseach confirmed would happen. On what basis can we reassure those concerned about the economy that this will not automatically result in overheating and inflation? What are the Government instruments which will ensure we take the path of the US in recent times, making it is possible to have a growth rate, low interest and a non-inflationary economy?  This area, which needs to be repeatedly examined, together with the possibility of sterling shock, have been rightly brought to our attention by serious commentators.</P>
    <P>Some prominent commentators have stated that EMU will mean monetary policies which suit Germany and France but which will not necessarily be appropriate to us.  It will mean we will have to operate with interest rates which may be too low for the particular point in the economic cycle at which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>The second test applied by the British Treasury in considering the issue of economic and monetary union was whether it was flexible enough to deal with unforeseen economic shocks once it had ceded its ability to control monetary policy to the European Central Bank.  This issue was addressed by the ESRI in its 1996 analysis, which has been consistently used by the previous and current Governments to justify entry to EMU.  It is an excellent report and I support its conclusions. However, we must not ignore the down sides.  As I have previously stated, even those of us who are enthusiastic supporters of EMU must as politicians use a little devil's advocacy to prepare the public for the fact that there will be down sides which cannot be ignored, even if on balance we fully approve of what is being done.  The ESRI report concluded that once control of monetary policy was ceded, and following any serious economic shock, it would take three years for prices to adjust and approximately four years for wages to adjust.  According to the report, the result of an economic shock would mean Irish firms would become less competitive while some may not be able to survive through the adjustment period. Have we really considered what this will mean? Have the implications been spelt out to the relevant sectors?  I have not seen a debate at the level which it should take place.</P>
    <P>The level of flexibility in the economy was highlighted as a problem by the National, Economic and Social Council in its analysis.  The bodies whose reports are used to justify our moves <Col N="665" /> contain much information yet to be debated.  I ask that we try to have a more balanced debate.  It behoves those of us who support EMU to push this agenda.</P>
    <P>Peter Neary and Rodney Thom of University College, Dublin, argue that the lack of flexibility makes it unwise for Ireland to participate in EMU if Britain remains outside because of the risk of sterling related shocks.  This point has been made for some time and I would like the Minister to comment on it in his reply on Second Stage.  It is one of the main points on which those who do not support this particular move can claim some high ground.</P>
    <P>An interesting aspect of the whole sterling question is the strengthening of sterling in recent times.  From the initial reports published in 1996, to which I already referred, and the position in which we find ourselves today, the Irish pound has gone from parity to 81p today.  Sterling will find itself the strongest currency in Europe outside the euro.  Many institutions and international investors will use investment in sterling as a hedge against the euro.  Sterling finding itself initially outside the euro will be beneficial for the British economy as people use it as a hedge while they monitor the stability of the euro and its progress towards a reserve currency.</P>
    <P>Sterling could be used to spread risk and could keep strengthening outside the EMU.  Again, I would love to hear the Minister comment on how that will impact on our position, given our markets in the UK and yet being a member of EMU. Sterling will find itself the strongest non-euro currency in Europe.  Many south east Asian people, whose fingers have recently been burned by the various shocks on the Asian financial markets, use and will continue to use sterling as a safe haven for investment.</P>

      <P>I accept that, but there comes a point when we should realise that we have to do justice to an important debate.

      <P>I made reference to the different Treasury tests and basically the reasons Britain is staying outside. I will not have time to go through the other points I wanted to make on that and maybe the Minister in responding to Second Stage could dwell on the whole aspect of sterling being outside, the impact on ourselves of that and on our markets and how it might impact on sterling, because that is extremely interesting in itself.</P>

      <P>I will make a few points in no particular order of importance.  I ask the Minister to comment on the impact of the crisis in Asian financial circles on the euro and how it is being handled by ECOFIN generally.  What are the contingencies there?  We had a yen crisis during the week and I was told that will only be second to the problems in Korea.  The Japanese banks are <Col N="667" /> among the largest in the world and are huge lenders not only to its own domestic economies but they have substantial exposure in the US and, indeed, Europe.  I would like to know the implications of that for us.</P>
      <P>Business preparedness is an area I would like developed.  It is a most important issue.  Are we satisfied business, particularly small and medium sized enterprises, are awake and up and running in terms of the impact the euro will have on their business, from their suppliers right down to their distribution chain?  I am not sure the debate is loud enough.  I know some excellent work is being done in certain circles on this, including that being done by Forfás and various other groups in the public and private sectors.  However, I have a feeling it is not impacting on those who will need to know.</P>
      <P>Will there be further revaluation?  In the past few days we read that some economists recommend that we should have revalued more in March than we did and that it is not too late now. Again, I cannot develop that point.  Is there any question of a further revaluation of the Irish pound at this stage?  It is a most important question. Even to float the suggestion has impacts for financial markets and I would like to know the Minister's thinking on it.</P>

      <P>It was with some concern that I read in this morning's papers comments attributed to the Governor of the Bank of Ireland, Mr. Howard Kilroy, at its AGM.  I mention in passing that we are talking about the loss to banks in relation to the introduction of the euro &mdash; £25 million in profits every year after the year 2002 to the Bank of Ireland.  Rather ominously, Mr. Kilroy goes on to say it is hurtful, not life threatening, and that they have plans to replace it.  Given the particular climate through which we have lived in relation to charges, interest rates and overcharging and promises to introduce an independent financial services authority &mdash; may that come on stream quickly &mdash; I ask the Minister what plans might the banks have to replace their losses in this area.</P>

      <P>What road are the banks moving down in relation to replacing their losses because of the introduction of the euro and on <Col N="668" /> the whole exchange rate story in relation to them?  I ask the Minister to comment on the changeover period.  Six months would be a recipe for chaos.  What plans has the Minister in place and how will he assess whether we can move to a three month or a one month period?  What are the tests in terms of the length of time of that period?</P>
      <P>I thank the Acting Chairman and have stretched his patience further than I should have, but I appreciate it.  On the second last day of term and on extremely important legislation, when there are but one or two offering on either side of the House and when in theory we could sit until 8 p.m. tonight, it does not do justice to limit people if they want to continue on this issue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Economic and Monetary Union Bill, 1998.  As has been said, it is to a great extent a technical Bill and is necessary to put in place the measures which will allow us to change over to the euro on 1 January 1999, but it will not become effective until three years later.</P>
      <P>It would be appropriate to say that decisions taken by Government over the past ten years are responsible for the position in which we find ourselves today.  Some of the economic decisions taken possibly as far back as 1987 by the then Government and subsequent ones have meant this country is in a position to join with other member states in a single currency.  It has shown a progressive approach by successive Governments over the past ten years.  It also demonstrates the success of industrial relations over the past ten years.  The national interest was put first and we have now converged with the other states of Europe in joining a single currency.</P>
      <P>This technical legislation is a a necessary follow on from the Central Bank Act, 1998, which implemented measures required by the Maastricht Treaty.  In addition, the Finance Act, 1998, harmonised the taxation position.  This is a historic day for the country because we are enacting in legislation our decision to join the single currency.</P>
      <P>The euro will be the strong currency we hope for.  It will trade favourably with the US dollar. Europe is now a large block and our future is tied to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public will not be unduly annoyed about the developments leading to the single currency. Ireland is one of the few countries to experience a currency changeover when decimalisation was introduced in 1971.  Most people took that in their stride, although some took the liberty to hike prices.  Those who remember argue it amounted to a great con job because there was abuse and a levelling of prices.  I ask the Minister and his <Col N="669" /> Department to be conscious of that on this occasion.  There should be a watchdog to ensure similar opportunities do not arise.  Does the Minister see any difficulties in the period when Britain will stay out of the single currency, especially with regard to our commercial, financial and monetary interaction with Northern Ireland?</P>
    <P>Much has been written and said about the European Central Bank.  It is said that the larger countries will decide on interest rates while factors affecting the smaller countries, such as Ireland, will not take precedence.  Some economists take the view this could be dangerous in a European context.  For example, there is free movement of labour in the US.  By contrast, in practical terms this is not the case in Europe to any great extent for various reasons, including language barriers.  If problems arise in Ireland there are few opportunities for labour to move, other than to the UK.  This is not an issue in the US, where people can and do move, Given this, the overall US economy has not been affected by the varying performances of individual states.</P>
    <P>What will be the position of the Central Bank and what will happen to its reserves?  What will happen to Irish currency replaced by the euro? For example, how would the discovery of a box of £20 notes in 2010 be treated?  Would they still be legal tender and, if so, what rate of exchange would apply?  Practical problems such as this are likely to arise, especially given the tendency to hoard money in this country.</P>
    <P>The public is by and large conditioned to the euro.  It is a historic time and it shows us as a mature nation on the move that has taken its rightful place with its partners in Europe.  The introduction of this legislation shows where we have come to.</P>
    <P>Our decision to join the then EEC in 1973 has brought major benefits and helped the nation to progress in leaps and bounds.  The single currency is a further step in the integration of Europe.  The Irish people have embraced Europe and have been good Europeans.</P>
    <P>I do not like the view that we are recipients from the EU and that we are always extending a bowl to be filled.  I do not accept that.  For example, the amount taken from our coastline and our seas and put into EU coffers represents a massive amount of money.  On balance, it might just equal our receipts from Structural, Cohesion, Social and agricultural funds.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and commend it to the House.  We look forward to its passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this subject for the second time in this House.  The more I listen to those in favour of the euro the more strongly I am against it.  That is no insult to those who spoke here.  Senator Doyle made a speech which was, she said, balanced.  She then proceeded to put a very strong case against <Col N="670" /> the euro and answered it with a very weak case in favour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not say it was deliberate, but it was interesting.  She said the great argument against us entering the euro, that Britain would not go in, was now countered by statements from the British Prime Minister and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer from which she quoted. However, these left it open for Britain to take a decision which would be in the best interests of the British people; the issue will be decided by referendum there.  I suspect a referendum should also have been held on the specific issue of the single currency here.  We should have entered into a much greater debate on the issue than has been the case.</P>
      <P>There is something very odd about the incredible consensus in favour of the euro in Ireland.  It is absolutely unique, even in a situation where we have political agreement on virtually everything, that on the major economic issue facing the country this century, not only are all the political parties in agreement but so too are the social partners. It is incredible that those who, to a large extent, have sold out on the people they represent, such as IBEC and the trade unions, are also agreed on the issue.  There does not seem to be any dissenting voice on this issue to which there are two very definite sides.  The only two opposing voices I have heard in the Oireachtas are my own and that of the Sinn Féin Member in the Dáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I am examining the logic of my thoughts.  It is very odd that there seems to be an extraordinary consensus on this issue inside the loop of official Irish society although there are some dissenting voices among economists and academics outside it.  It may sound arrogant to say it but I believe the reason for that is simple, namely, most people do not understand what is involved.  I carried out a written survey among some business people on this issue some time ago. When I asked them if they were in favour of EMU, virtually all of them replied they were.  The standard form also posed a number of other questions, one of which asked whether the respondents had considered the implications of EMU on their businesses, to which they all answered no. They did not understand the issue but were told it was an inevitably good thing.  That is worrying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a kind of propaganda machine in operation on this issue, led by Europe, the Civil Service and politicians, which seeks to convince <Col N="671" /> people monetary union is something we must accept.  Part of that is psychological because of the extraordinary benefits we have reaped from Europe.  There is a feeling in Ireland that everything which relates to Europe is good.  Senator Finneran said Ireland does not have a begging bowl mentality.  We may not have, but we have been given money on a plate by Europe for many years and seem to think we must be good Europeans in return.</P>
    <P>The other reason for the consensus on EMU is a political one.  There is still a massive inferiority complex in operation in this country, motivated by our desire to prove we can survive without Britain and our economy is not dependent on the British one.  We want to prove we can enter the single currency even when the British do not.  The Irish economy is dependent on the British one whether we like it or not.  If the British economy was cut off, we would face extremely serious problems and, whatever happens, we will face such problems in Europe because of our relationship with the British economy.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran boldly stated he believed the euro would be a strong currency.  Perhaps he should get a job as a foreign exchange dealer.  I do not know whether the euro will be a strong currency and neither does anyone else.  Whatever happens, Ireland will face difficulties.  The Minister will be aware that, because of recent pressures, the weakness of the punt against sterling will put inflationary pressures on the economy which may, or may not, be possible to withstand and may make it very difficult for the Minister to resist wage claims.  Alternatively, the Minister may be faced with serious problems from exporters who are currently experiencing a bonanza. When we join EMU, we will have no control over our relationship with sterling and I believe we are cutting off that link mainly for political reasons.</P>
    <P>People regularly quote the ESRI and NESC reports.  It is very easy to quote economists because they all say different things all the time and one need only choose the view with which one politically agrees.  The ESRI report came down only marginally in favour of EMU.  We must bear in mind the report is commissioned and paid for by the Government, a fact which calls its independence into question.  I do not believe it deserves as much credence as those who take an independent approach to the issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister's behaviour on the foreign exchange markets has been absolutely superb. The Opposition's attempt to make him say something foolish about foreign exchanges in the period prior to revaluation was utterly irresponsible and the Minister quite rightly resisted the temptation to do so.  He attended the ECOFIN meeting in March and surprised everyone by revaluing the punt.  The idea he should somehow have signalled his intentions to the foreign exchange markets in advance of that is possibly the most ridiculous one I have ever heard from any political <Col N="672" /> party in this country.  I hope the Minister continues to behave in that manner until 1 January. After that date, unfortunately, his attitude to foreign exchange will not matter very much because we are giving up the great leverage which many economists say forms the basis of the economic boom we are currently experiencing.</P>
    <P>It is impossible to know why the country is experiencing its current boom.  There are four or five possible reasons, one of which is that it resulted from the devaluation of 1993.  That devaluation may have been forced upon us but there is nothing particularly wrong with that as it is merely market forces at work.  However, we are giving away that particular option.  Not only are we giving it away, we are giving it to someone else.  Senator Finneran acknowledged that interest rates and foreign exchanges would be decided elsewhere after 1 January 1999.  Surely, Senator Doyle was correct when she said interest rates will converge and will be set by Germany and France.  Those countries will not give two hoots about the Irish economy and have as much as acknowledged that.  I visited Frankfurt last week and asked a German banker what would happen in regard to Ireland and interest rates.  He acknowledged we would not be in a position to do anything as a smaller country and that interest rates would not be fixed with Ireland in mind but in the interests of Germany and France.  The consequences of this are very serious.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear Senator Doyle's comments on rethinking the economic theory in regard to low interest rates and inflation. However, the traditional wisdom is that if interest rates come down, dictated by France and Europe, the economic boom we are experiencing will turn into a furnace and we do not know what the consequences of that will be.  It is certain, however, that there will be inflation.  If a house can be sold for £6 million when interest rates are 3 per cent higher than in Germany, what will house prices be when the rate is much lower?  It makes sense that they will rise in the short term and that will lead to serious social problems.</P>
    <P>Economists say different things about what will happen.  Some say there will be an inflation-led slump.  If inflation does rise as a result of low interest rates, the Minister will be politically unable to resist demands for higher wages.  I do not advocate the social partnership in which the Minister believes but I know that if there is a rise in inflation, Governments have to give in to pressure groups and as a result competitiveness suffers.  That will mean the end of Irish economic success, a possible slump and a situation where we will have to go back to the French and the Germans and say, &ldquo;Look what you have done to us.  These are the consequences of shadowing your interest rates and of joining the euro.&rdquo;.  They will reply &ldquo;Hard luck.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It would have been easier if we had said we were not going into the euro yet, we do not know if this will work &mdash; just like the Brits.  We are a sterling satellite, although we will not accept it, <Col N="673" /> and we should wait, watch the euro and track sterling.  Although we positioned ourselves for a fall in sterling at the meeting on 14 March, exactly the opposite has happened.  Sterling has, as happens in foreign exchanges, risen although virtually every expert said it would fall in value.  It has continued to rise for reasons which could not be anticipated, but one of the lessons of foreign exchange markets is that the unexpected cannot be anticipated.  The Bank of England decided it had no option but to continue to raise interest rates against expectations, which had a downside for British industry, to curb inflation.  As a result sterling has risen and the IR£ is not in the position in which it expected to be against sterling. That makes life difficult for us.</P>
    <P>I fear for the euro.  Contrary to what Senator Finneran said, there are dangers that it could be weak rather than strong.  I have no strong views on it, but we should recognise that a currency born of a political fudge &mdash; countries which do not qualify have been let into the euro, Italy and Belgium are glaring examples &mdash; carries the risk that it may sink to the level of the weakest economy. I do not like a State which has been guided so well economically, by this Minister in particular, sacrificing economic independence and prosperity to join a country like Italy which has been governed recklessly.  I oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House.  I read the speech he made to us on 16 October last year and it was interesting to recall what he predicted would happen.  Many of the policies have come to fruition and brought us to where we are today.</P>
      <P>As we look toward EMU and its implications for Ireland, we should look at the strengths, opportunities, weaknesses and threats.  The benefit of involvement in EMU is the initial elimination of foreign exchange risks.  This is important for those trading in Europe, the UK and throughout the world.  Any reduction in risk will be beneficial to those in business.  If the economy is to continue growing, exports will create the wealth and develop the economy.  There will be a reduction in cross-border trading costs and that will benefit our competitiveness.  A further threat is greater competition and we must be able to match our competitors in Europe and any reduction in trading costs will help us achieve this.</P>
      <P>There will be improved price transparency. Now we can arrange holidays by ringing travel agents in Belfast, London or Paris.  Goods are bought and sold on the Internet.  We will see a greater need for transparency in pricing.  At some stage a magazine published in Britain will not cost a pound extra to buy here.  The amount of money we pay additional to publication prices in the UK is scandalous.  There will be better access to EU markets.  It will be easier for those in the EU and abroad buying Irish goods and services if they pay for them in the one currency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> Senator Ross seems to be under the impression that lower interest rates will mean we will all be buying £6 million houses.  I do not know if that is true but I am looking forward to lower interest rates.</P>
    <P>Competition will be greater and that is a threat. Irish companies and Irish based foreign multi-nationals thrive on competition.  One of the great aspects of our culture is that if there is a challenge we will face it.  Competition will focus our minds, making us concentrate on our export market and work on our competitive advantage.</P>
    <P>The difficulty of the UK not joining will cause problems, but that is for it to deal with.  London is the centre of a large financial services industry and business there will realise it has to come on board.  That is a UK decision and it is not for us to dictate its policy.</P>
    <P>The UK is a major market for Irish exports but we must change our mindset and stop looking to it as a big brother.  There is a much bigger market. People exporting to the UK should be asking where else they can compete.  Traditionally we did not look to France as there was a language barrier.  There are now better modes of communication. If they join forces and use the various offices and agencies established to assist them, small companies can enter joint marketing initiatives on the Continent and move away from their reliance on the UK market.</P>
    <P>Sterling is strong at present and this gives Irish exporters a competitive advantage.  Companies in the clothing, textiles, confectionery, food and furniture sectors are exporting to the UK.  These companies must prepare contingency plans as they will face problems if sterling falls and our prices in euros increase.  It is too easy to sit back in a booming economy and not realise that times will not always be this good.  Anyone planning for the future must keep this scenario in mind, particularly those focusing on the UK market.</P>
    <P>We have often discussed the actions which must be taken, yet people are still not prepared. Companies do not realise that they must change their invoicing systems as they will be invoicing in euros &mdash; during the changeover, they will be invoicing in both punts and euros.  This means that software, pricing machinery, cash registers and all systems which are part of the trading process must be changed.</P>
    <P>We do not need to worry about the new currency. The euro will become one of the most widely accepted currencies which will result in it being a strong currency.  It will help Ireland decrease its dependency on the UK market, which is important for us as a country.  Companies need to be aware of the fact that they will have to change the ways in which they do business and deal with customers and suppliers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has established a very good awareness campaign and his officials and Forfás are doing an excellent job in sending out information. The Committee on Enterprise and Small Business recently acknowledged that the campaign had been effective; however, it is not effective <Col N="675" /> enough.  Small businesses do not realise what is happening and what effect the euro will have on their operations.  There is a need for greater awareness and for people to realise that business is changing.  The year 2000 is approaching.  In addition, we are going to have a new currency, changing the way in which we do business.</P>
    <P>Large firms have committees and managers with special responsibility for handling the changeover. However, people in small, owner-managed companies think that the euro is something happening in the future.  The future is getting closer and we must find something which acts as a catalyst to convince small businesses that they must begin to change their software and cash registers and to start invoicing in euros.  This is not happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that 51 per cent of small and medium sized enterprises perceived that the overall impact of EMU will have a significant impact on their businesses.  That figures compares with 33 per cent in 1997.  This indicates an improved awareness, but it also highlights the fact that 49 per cent of these enterprises do not perceive that the overall impact of EMU will have a significant effect.  That is very frightening.  The figure is improving but we must improve it further.  Only 25 per cent of small businesses have prepared functional work plans for the changeover. That is an improvement on 13 per cent last year, but it means that 75 per cent of companies have not prepared such plans.</P>
    <P>I had a visually impaired visitor with me today and I told him I was speaking on the euro in the House.  He asked me if I could speak to someone about the quality of the paper in the notes.  The new £5 note was supposed to have some sort of identification dot but it does not work.  It is important that we examine the quality of the paper in the notes and ensure that the currency is suitable for the visually impaired.  Other European currencies have different ways of signalling the denomination of notes and this issue needs to be addressed.  I would ask the Minister and his officials to take this matter on board.</P>
    <P>Ireland is going from strength to strength.  The EMU is a challenge and an opportunity.  There are difficulties ahead but if we work together and focus our minds we can address these issues and problems.  EMU will be an assistance as Ireland continues to grow.  I hope that the Celtic tiger is not going to go away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as it is an important stepping stone towards EMU.  Unlike Senator Ross, I am an enthusiast of the single currency and I was happy to read that the euro will be the currency of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with Senator Ross in congratulating the Minister on the manner in which he handled this issue, particularly events on 14 March.  I do not always agree with Senator Ross and I fundamentally disagree with his views on the euro.  He disagrees with the concept, but the only alternative <Col N="676" /> he has suggested is that we establish a link with sterling.  However, sterling has a poor record and has failed to maintain its standards over some generations.</P>
    <P>The euro and EMU are positive steps for Ireland which offer great potential.  However, that potential is not going to be automatically released.  How we do in Euroland will be up to ourselves.  We will have to work hard.  I stress this point because we have recently heard much about the good news concerning the euro.  However, we have to realise that we are giving away control. This makes it all the more important that any area of control we have should remain available. We have reduced the number of economic levers so it will be vital to use those that are left to the fullest possible advantage.  This should be the focus of public debate.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the debate today. Senator Doyle stated that she would be the only Fine Gael speaker.  If this is such an important issue then Fine Gael should have more than one speaker.  There should be a public debate on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the unrealistic public expectations of what will happen when we enter EMU.  All of the talk has been about the advantages, particularly the lower interest rates.  As a result, many people are beginning to think of EMU as a free lunch.  The cold reality is that we will have to pay for lower interest rates.  We should pay serious attention to the words of the President of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg.  I compliment him on the clarity of what he said in Frankfurt this week.  Unlike some central bankers, President Duisenberg does not speak obliquely or obscurely.  He tells it as it is, and this is a good sign for the future.  He made it abundantly clear that interest rates in Euroland would be set according to the needs of the big countries.  He specifically said that interest rates will converge towards the very low rates that the German economy, in particular, needs right now. He also made it clear that there would be no genuflecting towards the needs of countries like Ireland in setting interest rates.  It is very important that this has been clearly stated.  He stressed that countries such as Ireland would have to rely on methods other than interest rates to control their economies.  To make sure none of us was in any doubt about what he was saying, he said that this means fiscal controls.  What we can no longer do with interest rates, we must do through adjusting levels of taxation.  This is the tough message which must be put across to Irish people about EMU.  It is not a free lunch with advantages only.  It is a balance of advantages and disadvantages.  Put bluntly, lower interest rates will have to be paid for by higher taxes.</P>
    <P>I understand why many people would prefer to sweep this unpleasant information under the carpet.  Reducing taxes is popular whereas increasing them is not.  If a fear of the public reaction prevents the use of that fiscal mechanism until later, the price Irish people will have to pay <Col N="677" /> will be much higher than was thought.  That is why it should be made clear to people that joining EMU will have a price and that part of that is the end of the lowering of taxes which has been attempted over the past ten years.  Irish people must be prepared in advance for this reality.  If they are not, the political courage to take the necessary steps will be found wanting.  We will have to make the most of the levers of control left to us.  We have a great deal of control over where we source our goods.  My company and its suppliers have been able to source products other than in the sterling area.  Many of these products will enable us to fight inflation in a different manner.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with two aspects of the change, especially the changeover.  The two aspects are related while also distinct.  First is the length and timing of the changeover period in 2002 when euro notes and coins will become available.  As an aside, I congratulate the Minister on his use of the word &ldquo;20-02&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;2,002&rdquo;.  It was always 1014 for the Battle of Clontarf and not 1,014.  People should use the Minister's turn of phrase.</P>
    <P>Regarding the changeover in 2002, the timing is important.  It is envisaged that euro notes and coins will become legal tender on 1 January 2002. That is a nice date but it is not practical.  The beginning of the year is a dreadful time for retailers for various reasons.  It is just after Christmas and after sales so it is not the right time to introduce such a radical change.  It was for that reason 15 February and not 1 January was chosen for decimalisation in 1971.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three possible dates: 1 October 2001, 1 January 2002 and a later date in 2002.  The second date is unsuitable from an Irish perspective for the reasons outlined by the Senator.  In Ireland we turn the Christmas holiday into a long holiday.  The rest of Europe has not caught up with our concept of long holidays so it does not regard 1 January as importantly as we do.  However, until the rest of Europe adopts our mode of thinking of taking two weeks' holidays around Christmas, we will have to operate by 1 January 2002, which was more acceptable from the point of view of other countries.  The problems of retailers regarding sales and a great deal of money being in circulation were taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's explanation. The length of the period for changeover is more crucial.  I have a huge difficulty, as does the retail trade in Europe, with the advice that the changeover should be spread over a six month period.  I am glad the Minister said we do not have to use the full six months.  I argue strongly that it should be a one day changeover.  That was done in 1971.  We learned that maintaining the ability to give change in two currencies for weeks is hugely difficult.  It is also likely the vast majority of the public will not use the new currency <Col N="678" /> until they have to.  The &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach should be taken.  The freedom to do it is in the legislation.  A certain date should be named &mdash; I would prefer if it were in February &mdash; as the date on which change will only be given in euros and that should be the same as the day the euro is introduced.  If it must be 1 January, then so be it.  I can imagine a bus driver who, under current thinking, will be required to carry two currencies for weeks in case one person requests change in euros and another requests it in Irish money.  That is an impossible situation and we should do what was done in 1971, which was a one day changeover.</P>
      <P>Regarding dual pricing, I draw attention to a signed agreement on Tuesday in Brussels between the retail trade &mdash; EuroCommerce &mdash; and the European Commission which was initiated by the Commission.  Its aim is to establish a climate of confidence during the changeover to euro.  They agreed not to introduce legislation for dual pricing but to find a way in which it would be done voluntarily.  Six principles are involved.  First is to apply EU rules for rounding up or down.  Second is abstention from charging higher prices.  Third is providing practical information. Fourth is displaying both prices in certain conditions.  These have been laid down having been voluntarily agreed between the trade and the Commission.  Fifth is that staff would be capable of explaining the situation.  Sixth is signage informing customers whether retailers accept euros prior to the changeover date.  The use of this sign or label will not be enforced but anyone who uses it and does not adhere to it will be liable for legal action.  I mention this agreement because achievements can sometimes be made more readily through co-operation and agreement rather than legislation which insists on something being done and which uses the threat of legal action if it is not.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to give serious attention to two areas.  First is the changeover date.  It is preferable that there be a quick changeover period and ideally a single day changeover.  Second is that he should accept and recognise that the dual pricing agreement made by EuroCommerce in Brussels is the correct approach rather than attempting to enforce dual pricing through legislation, something some have suggested should be done.  It will be a difficult period for customers and more so for traders.  It is estimated the cost of changeover will be 2 per cent for retailers.  In many cases that will comprise 50 per cent if not all their net profit.  Therefore, if a cost increase to customers is to be avoided, we must listen to the trade and ensure dual pricing, the changeover date and all other steps happen with co-operation rather than resistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the legislation. There has been a long gestation period since it was first decided in the Maastricht Treaty that we would embark on EMU.  Looking at newspaper reports and the photographs of the launch, I hope <Col N="679" /> it is not a metaphor for things to come when the two top dogs, France and Germany, will be the leaders and the smaller nations will provide a little colour in the form of Riverdance.  Mr. Duisenberg has made it clear that the top dogs of the operation are Germany and France.  It will be interesting to hear how loud their bark is and how well they keep control of their patch.</P>
      <P>This legislation deals with the nuts and bolts of monetary union, the coinage and currency.  The establishment of the single currency will have enormous repercussions on economics and politics.  We are for the first time moving away from the subsidiarity system.  We are about to surrender control over our own currency and pool it in a common European bank with no flexibility.  We will have no say in how our currency is used or how financial crises will be dealt with.  This is a daring step.  We are placing our trust in the European Central Bank as one of the most important elements which will determine our financial and economic future.  I hope we are making the right decision. So far as I know, no precautionary measures have been taken to deal with the collapse of the project. It is possible that it will collapse.</P>
      <P>We are fortunately enjoying economic success. Our unemployment rate is less than 10 per cent. Spain, on the other hand, has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.  That country could find it impossible to cope with the restrictions which will be imposed unilaterally by the European Central Bank.  Question marks hang over the establishment of EMU and only a fool would pretend they do not.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Quinn's view about the need to introduce the single currency on a particular date. We naturally leave such matters to the last possible moment.  Decimalisation should have taught us all a lesson and many of us have not come to terms with decimalisation and metrication. However, I am concerned that we should not leave things to the last moment.  A long transition period will give opportunities for abuse and profiteering. During the interim period we will be operating with two currencies.  We will be dealing with extra exchanges of currency and the financial institutions may be able to take advantage of this.  We are assured that this will be kept to a minimum but I do not for one moment believe that will be the case.  The sooner the transition is made the better and the setting of a particular date for the final changeover is a good idea.</P>
      <P>This step could be catastrophic or very benign. We are making a leap of faith.  We expect the new currency to be strong and capable of rivalling the US dollar &mdash; I do not even mention the yen &mdash; on world money markets.  This will be a stabilising influence on European markets.  We all remember the financial crisis of 1993 when interest rates rose rapidly because we are a small open economy subject to predatory speculators.  It will be extremely difficult for that to happen in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Membership of the single currency will place constraints on us to be prudent in our housekeeping. We will be obliged to keep our borrowing and the organisation of our budget within certain constraints.  These constraints are healthy. National governments are infamous for avoiding logic and concentrating on the short term reality, sometimes in purely electoral terms.  They have been guilty of short term borrowing leading to long term pain.</P>
    <P>The expected decline in interest rates will be valuable in the long term.  In the short term, because of our strong economy and the easy availablity of money, capital will be poured into the economy and could lead to inflation.  This is a real fear.  A 3 per cent reduction in interest rates is being talked about.  The Central Bank plans to delay the reduction of Irish interest rates in the hope that German rates will increase.</P>
    <P>The end of exchange rate charges will be welcomed. We know the old story of the traveller who goes from one European country to another and when he has changed £100 at every border is left with only £50.</P>
    <P>The Irish Central Bank have looked after the nation's financial interests on the European scene but they have been found wanting in supervising and regulating financial institutions at home.  Now that their international role is diminished they might spend more time ensuring that our domestic banking system operates to the highest standard. That might be a beneficial side effect of the new monetary system.</P>
    <P>We are entering a new fiscal mechanism of cohesion.  The danger is that we are now involved in a crude fiscal mechanism of cohesion to which we have no alternative.  We are lagging behind the Community in other areas but we are out on a limb in the fiscal area.</P>
    <P>The countries with the strongest currencies will be the most anxious to maintain that mechanism because they see it as a means of asserting their strength and, in many ways, their sovereignty. However, it should not become a power trip for France and Germany, who will benefit because they have strong currencies which interact to a greater degree with their strong economies. Smaller countries such as Ireland, Spain, Portugal and perhaps Italy, have vulnerable economies which have only recently become, or are in the process of becoming, stable and are anxiously trying to maintain decent levels of employment, low debt and budgetary balance.</P>
    <P>There is a danger from the stronger economies. I was worried to hear the new president of the European Central Bank say that France and Germany will dictate interest rates.  As Senator Quinn said, they are in effect telling us it is our responsibility to deal with the fallout and are suggesting that we deal with it through our taxation and budgetary system.  Basically, this is the way the big boys will play the game.  They will play it on their pitch, in their fashion and, even though we are also on the pitch, they intend to keep the ball in their possession.  That does not augur well for <Col N="681" /> a collective approach to the euro.  Last May there was an unseemly row between France and Germany over the presidency, a row which has not yet been resolved.  A few days ago Mr. Duisenberg said his term would run for the full eight years, contrary to the French assertion that he would serve only half his term to make room for a French president.  Clearly, the big boys are still trying to hog the scene.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that Ireland did not secure a place on the managerial team for the European Central Bank.  The fact that Ireland does not have a representative at senior decision making level is unfortunate.  The Taoiseach said nobody was interested in the job which is ludicrous.  It does not matter whether they were interested in the job, somebody should have been put forward for it.  I am sure somebody patriotic could have been found to put themselves forward for a well remunerated position in order to protect Irish interests.</P>
    <P>Some months ago, the Minister intervened to set a satisfactory valuation for the Irish pound <i>vis-à-vis</i> the deutsche mark.  What is the current situation in that regard?  Is there time for a readjustment of the Irish currency before the final plunge is taken?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest and little surprise to the words of wisdom from Senator Ross.  It bothers me to hear these people protecting the national interest with their hearts and souls.  I did not agree with a single sentence he said.  However, it is the great value of the Independent Senators that we give breadth to a debate, even among ourselves.  That is extremely important.</P>
      <P>It is always entertaining to hear this expression of europhobia and euroscepticism.  I am not sure which is which but in the case of Senator Ross much of it is europhobia rather than euroscepticism. He is often worried about the impact of strangers.</P>
      <P>There is a view of France and Germany as monolithic structures, as if every politician in Paris and in the Bundestag has the same view and as if Germans will only look after German interests.  In my experience, every society has monetarists, free marketeers, leftists, socialists, conservatives, eurosceptics and people who are phobic about anybody who is different.  There is the same mix of such people in Europe and when people sit around a table they will be guided by their philosophies, what they are trying to achieve and what they believe is the best way of dealing with the economy.  That is what will inform their decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister must knock on its head this poor view of ourselves which indicates a lack of self-esteem, an inferiority complex which suggests that Irish people will be unable to keep their heads above water in the great <i>milieu</i> of Europe. We heard that view many times in the 1970s when we discussed joining the EEC.  We were told we would lose our culture, but what happened?  Irish <Col N="682" /> culture is stronger than ever.  We have found expression and space for it and there is a new acceptance among Irish people of the importance of being Irish.  Being European, far from taking away from our sense of Irishness, has reinforced it.  The same will happen in this case.</P>
    <P>Irish representatives have never felt less than able to articulate a point of view, to defend themselves, to put forward viewpoints or to progress discussions in Europe.  Irish people have always been comfortable in Europe and that is not a phenomenon of this year, last year or since we joined the Community.  It dates back to when Ireland sent saints and scholars to Europe to educate its people.  Now we will educate them again in the sense that we will give them a share in our experience.</P>
    <P>I do not have reservations about this Bill.  I am aware that there are risks, but there are risks in every decision on the economy.  If something goes wrong in three years time, certain people will blame our participation in the euro.  There will always be people who will justify something retrospectively.  It would be difficult to find many people who would like Ireland to leave the European Union now even though in the 1970s up to 40 per cent of the population did not want us to join the EEC.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that we remind people about the history of our currency.  It is untrue that it takes a generation to adjust to a change in currency.  Every generation this century has adjusted to a change in currency.  We had the pre-Independence currency, the Saorstát currency, the link between the Irish and British currencies, the change to decimalisation, the break with sterling and now we will change again.  What is new about this change?  We have changed many times and, while there is a new dimension to this change, it is not a change that people cannot handle.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Quinn's views on the supposed need for a six month transition period.  People get on airplanes every afternoon at Dublin Airport and travel to various destinations on the Costa del Sol.  Within 20 minutes they know the price of a pint or litre and a meal.  They have no difficulty making that transition and they do not need people walking behind them with calculators to do it.  People will adjust extremely quickly.</P>
    <P>I believe 1 January is the worst possible date for the change.  I have made that point to the Minister on many occasions.  I also pointed out in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service that six months is an unnecessarily long transition period.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the importance of the words &ldquo;not later than 1 January 2002&rdquo;.  What does it mean? Does it mean that euro notes and coins will be introduced before that date?  Can he also explain the &ldquo;not longer than six months&rdquo; requirement? These decisions were taken in Madrid in 1995. These dates and time spans were established at that time.  It should not be necessary to take six months.  I know we are committed to the 1 January <Col N="683" /> 2002 deadline but are we constrained to this date?  Are all the member states doing the same? I have the impression that Germany wanted to move things in a more telescopic timeframe.</P>
    <P>I raised the issue of dual pricing with the Minister on a number of occasions.  What is dual pricing? Unfortunately, this country has not completely changed over to decimilisation and we still experience difficulties.  People still confuse gallons with litres, pounds with kilogrammes, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The pint remains sacrosanct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but we may write on it what portion of a litre it is.  We should still call it something else.  There are different words for pint in Irish and English but it does not matter as long as we all know what we are doing.</P>
      <P>I look forward to next year because commission on currencies convergence will vanish.  I get a sense of satisfaction when travelling to Brussels or Paris and I try to make my journey without using currency just to prove it can be done.  When a person wants to leave the airport in Paris you can pay for a taxi by credit card, just as you can pay for a hotel room, etc.  However, you will still be charged commission at the end of the month.</P>
      <P>There is an incorrect view abroad about the reduction in interest rates.  People think there will be the same interest rates in every bank and institution in Europe.  It should be explained that we are talking about the underlying interest rates or those between banks and that administrative charges and competition between institutions will remain.  People believe that as and from 1 January 1999 every institution will reduce its interest rates.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his reticence about joining the euro too early and at what rate we should join.  He has given us stability which was not there before and it is very much appreciated. We have seven months left and everyone has discounted the fact that we will be joining at a lower rate or at the German interest rate.  With the deutschemark moving into the sterling and dollar economies the parliament in Bonn must consider raising their interest rates slightly between now and the end of the year in order to ensure people who have euro unstable accounts do not take their money out of these economies and bank it somewhere else.  This fact should be made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not have time to deal with convergence.  I want to ask the Minister about another issue but he keeps ignoring me time and time again.  I would remind him that he is my constituent and I represent him in good places.  The Minister will receive a bundle of money from the Central Bank reserves.  What will we do with it?  I have named Department of Finance officials in the past and they will tell him what to do but he should ignore them.  The Minister should work at home, doing a bit of teleworking, and not enter the Department of Finance building at all.  He should meet the people, see what they need and then decide <Col N="684" /> how to spend the money.  He should keep his officials busy for a few weeks trying to figure out how to spend the money.  Schools need teachers and social services require funding.  More and more is demanded from the State and people are demanding more services.  We are getting wealthier. It is very important that people at all levels feel the benefit of a stronger economy and a wealthier country.  I ask the Minister not to lose his sense of values and the common touch.  He should not let the bureaucrats get to him.  He should not let them stem his creativity in spending the money.  Our national debt is reducing all the time.  The more economic investment we make, the more it will reduce.  The net GNP ratio is so close to the convergence point that it does not make any difference and we are well within the limit.</P>
    <P>The Minister has two sums of money to be given out this year.  First, there is the unexpected increased revenue from taxation.  I reread the Minister's budget speech so I know he did not expect it.  He must do something with it now. Second, the Central Bank reserves produced an amount of money of which a very small amount will have to be given to Europe.  What will he do with the remaining reserves?  He should give hope to the people running primary schools, etc.  He should think how he can make a mark on the future and let us share in the benefits of a growing economy.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation and look forward with enthusiasm to the introduction of the euro. I will mail my first euro to Senator Ross.  I will ask him to spend it in a high class establishment and to enjoy himself.  This act will allow him to have the very best food and entertainment at my expense.</P>

      <P>I will try to deal with most of the points raised by Senators. Senator O'Toole wants me to become very popular overnight but this popularity would last a very short period.  I was not born at the time but when the late Deputy Oliver Flanagan first contested an election in the late 30s he launched that election on the platform of monetary reform.  His motto was: &ldquo;We should print all the money we like and give it to the people&rdquo;.  Fifty or more years later Senator O'Toole wants me to do something similar with the Central Bank reserves.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refer to that point later. A number of Senators raised queries about interest rate convergence and what EUCB President Duisenberg said earlier in the week.  To be blunt, the 11 member states will give up two instruments of our financial armoury, namely, our control over interest rates and our right to move our exchange rates.  Not alone is Ireland giving up these financial tools but so are the remaining ten states which makes up the Euro 11.  On Monday, when the Taoiseach and I were in Frankfurt, <Col N="685" /> President Duisenberg said that the setting of interest rates will be a matter for the EUCB.  He has stated this on numerous occasions.  We have been used to an independent Central Bank. Other countries do not have &mdash; or have not until now &mdash; the totality of independence which the Irish Central Bank enjoyed.  The Minister for Finance of the day sets exchange rate policy.  The Central Bank implements it as well as setting interest rates.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance of the day, not alone myself but my predecessors, has no influence on that area and that laid down under the Acts.</P>
      <P>In other countries that position has not always been so clear but it is in Germany.  The German model of the Bundesbank has been copied in the EUCB legislation which guarantees the independence of the EUCB from political interference. Members may remember the debate about setting up Euro 11 or the Euro 10 council as it was termed.</P>
      <P>There was a divergence of opinion in Europe about the French and the German way of doing things.  The legislation relating to the Central Bank followed the German model and guarantees its independence.  As President Duisenberg said, the European Central Bank will have the control of inflation and price stability as its main concern.  In that context it will consider the totality of the European economies.  Ireland is a small player in that regard and, therefore, the interest rate will be set to benefit Europe as a whole.</P>
      <P>This will mean, as we have known for some time, that countries such as Ireland will have to rely on its own way of doing things.  This boils down in the main to fiscal policy and structural changes in the economy.  It will not only involve budgetary policy, because its impact, as we know from experience, is limited.  I have always held the view that the structure of a small open economy such as Ireland is important rather than big bang approaches in fiscal policy.  The comments of President Duisenberg should not be surprising in that regard.</P>
      <P>Senator Doyle and others raised the issue of inflation.  As I stated previously on many occasions, what has happened in the economy in recent years, irrespective of the comments of economists now, is a little inexplicable.  Does anybody remember any economist predicting six or seven years ago that there would be growth rates of up to 8 per cent on average?  The answer is no because no economist made such a prediction.</P>
      <P>This proves my point that if one wants to make money on foreign exchange or interest rates, one should listen to the views of economists at the start of the year and then bet in the other direction. Having studied this area for the last 28 years, I can inform the House that if one did so, one would make a fortune.  I am sure that in five years all the economists will be able to say why the economy grew at this rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons, and I have outlined some of them in this and the other House. However, nobody in the Department of Finance, <Col N="686" /> the Central Bank, the ESRI or the other institutions can explain how, if one is looking at traditional economic textbooks, the economy has grown at an average of more than 6 per cent for the last five or six years and there has been practically no inflation.  If one had answered a question on the junior certificate paper seven years ago by stating that the economy could grow by an average of 6 to 7 per cent for a number of years and there would be no inflation, one would definitely have failed the examination.</P>

      <P>One would have received zero marks because, according to the traditional economic textbooks, it could not happen.  As somebody who has made innumerable speeches during my 21 years in the Dáil about the dismal state of the economy and how things would get worse &mdash; I made a career of this for many years &mdash; I must confess that I and others cannot explain the phenomenon.</P>
      <P>Nobody can predict with certainty what will happen in this area because nobody can explain how it has been possible to have low inflation of 1 and 2 per cent and colossal growth rates over a number of years.  According to basic economic textbooks, it was not supposed to happen.  People could be cautious about predicting what will happen if interest rates move in a certain direction.</P>
      <P>My policy, which luckily I announced before I took up office, is that the best thing Ministers for Finance or Opposition spokespersons on Finance can do with regard to currency issues is keep their mouths shut and allow the markets to do their business.  This policy has worked relatively successfully and, therefore, I will not speculate on what will happen with regard to interest rates in the coming months.  However, I predict that the interest rate set by the European Central Bank will be somewhere between the current German and Irish interest rates.</P>

      <P>The Governor of the Central Bank said his intention is to keep Irish interest rates as high as possible for as long as possible. Between now and 1 January, there will be a new converged European central rate.  People can work out for themselves the more likely outcome in terms of the two opposite ends of the spectrum. In common with currency matters, one cannot predict interest rates with certainty.  Senator Ross is correct that one cannot anticipate the foreign exchange markets.  Governments all over the world have wasted huge amounts of money by trying to influence how foreign exchange markets operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> I am concerned about inflation getting out of control in the economy.  As stated in the revaluation communiqué on 14 March, a point which was repeated in press statements and information from the Commission on the first weekend in May, Ireland will have as its budgetary policy the continuation of low inflation.  Undoubtedly, low inflation, in addition to a wide range of other aspects such as education and demographics, has allowed us to become competitive and to reach this point.</P>
    <P>The total reversal of the daft economic policies pursued in the 1970s and 1980s and the more sensible policies followed since 1987 also played a significant role.  Although it is not popular to refer to him, the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, was one of the architects of that decision.  The total reversal of economic policy introduced by the Haughey Government in 1987 definitely led to the current condition of the economy. I have great cause to remember the 1970s and 1980s because I preached that economic philosophy. It was followed and led to the current success of the economy.  In a nutshell, it involved common sense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tallaght strategy helped also.  The former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, could not have done it without Deputy Alan Dukes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will recall that when Deputy Dukes was still leader of the Fine Gael Party, I complimented him and said I hoped he would not have to pay a heavy price.  I did not wait until he was no longer leader of his party to say it.  Undoubtedly, it was another factor in the economy's success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I made a political prediction that Deputy Dukes would be repaid for his actions.  However, I was wrong and the opposite happened.</P>
      <P>Senators raised the issue of the United Kingdom staying outside the euro.  This was the background to the case made by Senator Ross, who has argued consistently for a long time that it is inappropriate for Ireland to join in such circumstances. Senator Ross takes the view that monetary union in Europe is a bad idea in any event.  However, since that argument has been lost and there will be monetary union, Senator Ross and others say Ireland should not join because the United Kingdom is staying outside.</P>
      <P>This is a legitimate point, but it has been rejected by this Administration and previous Governments.  On the balance of advantages that it is considered Ireland can enjoy, it has been decided that it is in our best interests to be in the first wave of participating countries.  There is no point arguing the toss with Senator Ross about this matter; Senator Doyle quite rightly referred to some of these doubts as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="688" /> A number of Senators are business people &mdash; and some of them are present in the Chamber.  I will wager that whenever they had a good business idea for a new project or enterprise, despite all the analysis and expertise it finally came down to making a decision, yea or nay, in the end.  I could not guarantee with 102 per cent certitude that any business decision I made was definitely going to work.  I do not mind Senators raising doubts about the single currency because it is the same situation &mdash; despite all the analysis and the great work which has been done across Europe to get us to this point, no one can say with 102 per cent certitude that it will be a tremendous success from day one and that everyone will benefit.  However, the Irish Administration concluded a long time ago that it was in our best interest to join up from day one, which is what we are going to do.</P>
    <P>Various questions were raised about the changeover date.  I interjected to explain to Senator Quinn why that date was picked.  I recognise the difficulties it poses.  However, we have given ourselves power in this Bill to set a date, if necessary, between 1 January 2002 and 30 June 2002 from which all Irish pound notes and coins will be called in.  There will be a hoovering up operation from that date and a big logistical operation has been put in place.  The dates 1 January and 30 June 2002 were inserted in the Bill because those are the dates in the European legislation.  Some countries will need more time than others.  Given that it is three and a half years away, it is too early to say what date we will set, if any &mdash; the date might end up being 30 June 2002.  At least we are giving ourselves the option; we can see how matters develop.  However, I take on board the points raised by Senators Quinn and O'Toole in regard to setting a particular date.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole raised the issue of the Central Bank reserves, which he has mentioned before; I thought I had dealt with it but I must have overlooked it.  In the interests of clarity we must differentiate between two forms of reserve.  There are reserves which the Irish people own and which we trade on foreign exchanges, which are put aside.  The other reserves are the accumulated profits of the Central Bank &mdash; the Central Bank makes profits every year from its business.  Those accumulated reserves will be in the region of £1.3 billion at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has reserves to back up the currency, such as small amounts of gold, dollars, etc.  In the setting up of the European Central Bank, we will have to pay an amount for share capital, based on criteria such as our GNP and population.  We will have to subscribe in the order of £35 million.  That will appear in the books of the Irish Central Bank as an investment in the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>We will also have to contribute to the ECB reserves, which will be calculated on a percentage basis.  We will have to contribute a small amount, possibly in the order of about £350 million of our reserves.  There will be no physical movement of <Col N="689" /> the reserves but they will be designated in the Central Bank's books as the reserves backing up the euro.</P>
    <P>The accumulated profits, in which Senator O'Toole is interested, are the profits the Central Bank has built up over the years by buying and selling currency, dealing with the financial institutions and so on.  As I said, they will be in the order of £1.3 billion at the end of the year. Senator O'Toole wants me to be very bold with that money, which would make me very popular overnight.  I have made no decision in that regard yet.</P>

      <P>Senator O'Toole wants me to work at home for a few months and not listen to the Department of Finance.  However, he should remember I preached strict financial discipline when it was not the thing to do before he became a Member of the House.  I can say at this stage that I will not be flush with this money &mdash; as he appears to want me to be &mdash; without saying what we are going to do with it.</P>
      <P>Senator Quinn made points about the changeover period, interest rates and dual pricing.  I welcome what the EuroCommerce group said recently and we will be studying it further.  The Director of Consumer Affairs has also welcomed the points which were made.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole that Irish people should not have an inferiority complex; we do not.  Europe has done a great deal for Ireland since we joined in the early 1970s.  I remember the debate quite well because it was the first political campaign in which I was involved at a very low level.  I have seen all the changes which have happened since.  We welcome all the money provided for roads, sewerage schemes, water schemes, etc. However, Europe's greatest contribution to Ireland has been to make us more outward looking and grown up as a nation.  Politicians sometimes make the mistake of saying we must have a begging bowl approach to Europe because they think that is what their constituents want them to do.  However, we now know what we long suspected &mdash; we are the best in Europe or anywhere else.  Membership of the EU has helped us in that regard, and that cannot be measured in pounds and pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Doyle and others raised the question of revaluation and devaluation.  I adopted the principle of not speculating in this regard in the past and I am not going to do so now, except to state the very obvious.  When the <i>communiqué</i> was issued that weekend it was said that was the last time it was going to be done.  People make the mistake of thinking the Minister for Finance of Ireland or anywhere else can wake up one morning and decide to revalue against the deutschemark. <Col N="690" /> Ministers cannot do that.  Revaluation is done by consensus because when one currency moves it affects all other currencies in the grid.  I cannot wake up in the morning, decide we have a great rate against the deutschemark, ring my friend, Theo Weigel, and tell him I am going to revalue in the afternoon.  That is not how it is done.</P>

      <P>Since 14 March and that weekend in May the markets have taken on board the situation.  Technically and legally, there will be a seamless transition from the ECU to the euro between 31 December and 1 January.  The ECU is a notional currency made up of a basket of currencies including those of the 11 participating member states, sterling and some other currencies. It was announced on the first weekend in May that the central rates would be used as the mechanism. People can read what they like into that. It is not on the agenda.  Some people are speculating in the market for the sake of trying to create some activity in the foreign exchange markets where there has been no activity for some time.</P>
      <P>Senator Cox made a point regarding the visually impaired.  The visually impaired organisations have accepted that the European Central Bank has taken this matter on board.  That will not be a problem.</P>
      <P>Senators raised many interesting points.  One could spend hours discussing them and I may be doing some an injustice by not dealing with their points.  Senator Finneran raised the issue of possible problems with Northern Ireland.  There will be no more problems than there are at present, except that there will be a currency circulating in the Six Counties which will be different from ours, but that should not present a problem in the medium or long term.</P>

      <P>I see the sense of amendment No. 17, particularly the provision for a photograph of an evacuee child sent to the central tracing agency of the international committee of the Red Cross.  Under what conditions will identity cards for journalists be issued?  Does reference to a professional capacity infer journalists sent by Government or by newspapers?  Subsection (3) states &ldquo;The Minister may, from time to time, specify in regulations a fee to be paid by a person for the issue of an identity card under this section&rdquo;.  What type of fee is envisaged by the Minister and to whom will it be payable?</P>

      <P>There has been a civil war in Angola for many years.  Under the Lusaka Protocols demilitarisation has taken place.  UNITA rebels were issued with identification cards. However, the MPLA Government forces have taken away the cards and those issued with them have been killed.  Does the Minister see identification cards as a safeguard for children or others in a former war situation?  This is a very pertinent question, particularly in Angola and perhaps in other areas where there have been confrontations.</P>

      <P>The section refers to journalists acting in their commercial capacity and sent to areas on behalf of their newspaper.  Journalists should be afforded protection.  Many of them provide a valuable service in difficult areas and send out information which can often have a beneficial effect, particularly for the least protected people in a war.</P>
      <P>The fee will be paid to the Exchequer and is simply to cover administrative costs.  It is not a matter of making profit and the fee will not be prohibitive.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Lanigan's point, the identity cards and their strengthening through the Protocols and domestic law are important.  The more countries sign up to the different conventions and the Protocols the more one hopes the protection they offer will be respected.  We are trying to make the identity cards as clear and as internationally understandable as possible in order to avoid confusion.  We also wish to enshrine in law the specific distinctiveness of the different types of cards.  One cannot guarantee who will respect the law.  However, we expect it will be respected by all forces in armed conflicts, be they international or serious domestic conflicts as are currently taking place in the former Yugoslavia.  The intention is to put in place the means of ensuring as much protection as possible is afforded.</P>

      <P>This amendment provides for a purely grammatical correction.  Regarding amendment No. 21, the problem of mercenaries first came to prominence in connection with the Katangese secession.  Since then there has scarcely been any conflict involving military operations in which the presence of mercenaries has not played a part in one way or another.  Article 47 of Protocol I contains the definition of &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo; but does not give a mercenary the right to claim prisoner of war status.  The amendment enables the State to take steps to detain mercenaries who may enter the State on their way to an armed conflict.  Hopefully, this will enable the State to make a contribution which will lead to a reduction in the violence and number of deaths in armed hostilities.  The inverted commas are, accordingly, being deleted to permit the additional subsection.</P>

      <P>Under these Protocols or Article 47 mercenaries do not have the status allowing them to claim the same rights as normal prisoners of war.  They are viewed as people who engage in armed conflict.  If somebody is found in the State on their way to an armed conflict a judgment can be made and the person can be arrested and detained, hopefully preventing them from <Col N="699" /> entering hostilities if the State does not desire them to do so.</P>

      <P>In a sense I agree with what the Minister said.  What constitutes a mercenary?  Are the people on a US plane refuelling at Shannon Airport and on their way to a conflict considered to be mercenaries if we do not have an interest in the conflict?</P>
      <P>There are mercenaries all over the world.  What is the current definition of a &ldquo;mercenary&rdquo;?  If I worked for the United Nations and was not invited to a particular country to deal with a conflict, I would be considered a mercenary by that country.  I do not want the standard definition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important question.  A mercenary is any person who is specifically recruited locally or abroad in order to fight in an armed conflict; does in fact take a direct part in the hostilities; is motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain and is promised by or on behalf of a party to the conflict material compensation substantially in excess of that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in the armed forces of that party; is neither a national of a party to the conflict nor a resident of territory controlled by a party to the conflict; is not a member of the armed forces of a party to the conflict and has not been sent by a state which is not a party to the conflict on official duty as a member of its armed forces.  The definition of a mercenary is well covered.</P>

      <P>I return to Angola where Cubans, Russians, South Africans, British and others took part in the civil war there.  My question is when do mercenaries become legitimate?  No conflict could take place without mercenaries because there is no Government which does not bring in forces and advisers.  No conflict can stand alone. We supply mercenaries as do the Americans, the Russians and the British, who are brilliant at so doing.  I would like to reinforce what is stated in the Bill by suggesting that the international community defines what is a mercenary and deals with them.  Until now there has been no definition of a mercenary.  No conflict can take place unless people from outside the area of conflict participate. That is the major problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand what Senator Lanigan said.  We are dealing with our legislation here. The definitions I read out in the context of how this State behaves are what concern us.  Senator Lanigan is talking about a much wider issue, which I would not want to diminish.  It is not, however, an issue with which I or the Government can deal in the context of this Bill.  This legislation deals with how this State behaves as regards that particular issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" /> Looking at the number of definitions which cover what is defined as a mercenary, the Government or the State has certain criteria on which to make various judgment calls on how it would judge whether a person on their way to a conflict is, in the purest sense, a mercenary and the State would take a certain view on how it should act as regards that person.  There are a number of definitions and the State has room to manoeuvre.  It is important we have the ability to arrest somebody who, according to our judgment, will not contribute anything to an armed conflict but will cause even more serious injury for no other reason than personal gain.  There are within the definitions judgments which the State may make.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach báire mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leatsa, a Chathaoirligh, leis an Seanadóir Donie Cassidy agus libhse ar fad go raibh sibh sásta am a sparáil chun an Bhille a rith tríd an Teach.</P>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and his colleagues for affording us the opportunity to bring the Bill before the House.  Notwithstanding the pressures of time and competing legislation, it was necessary to try to complete this legislation before the recess.  I appreciate that making time available to allow us complete our work this afternoon could not have been easy.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the importance of Defence and appreciate the job our Defence Forces do, both at home and overseas.  The can do approach and professionalism of members of the Defence Forces have long been recognised by successive Governments.</P>
      <P>Defence is, of course, a considerable public undertaking and in 1998 will involve expenditure of £570 million and the employment of 13,200 people, including military and civilian personnel, throughout the country.  My Department manages a property portfolio of approximately 21,000 acres, which includes 34 permanent military installations and holds equipment and other assets to the value of over £250 million.  It accounts for approximately 4 per cent of Government spending.  Accordingly, the Government is committed to ensuring that all these resources are used wisely to enable the Defence Forces deliver high quality services and at the same time give value for money to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective is a properly structured, well equipped Defence Forces, capable of meeting their roles in the most efficient and effective way.  In addition, the Defence Forces of the future must have the capacity and the flexibility to adapt to a changing environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next Monday one of the most important events in the Defence Forces calendar takes place in the Curragh Camp.  It is the commissioning ceremony for 34 cadets who come from different backgrounds, with different skills, ready to give their all for their country.  The ceremony epitomises what the Defence Forces stands for &mdash; a proud organisation with a distinguished history.  These young, ambitious leaders are ready to lead the Defence Forces well into the next millennium. They are ready to face the changes which are necessary to ensure that the organisation is ready <Col N="702" /> and able to face the many challenges that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>In that regard, one of the key developments currently taking place is the reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  This is not something that is happening in Ireland alone.  With the changing international environment, many countries are having a hard look at their defence forces and the requirements for the future.  No organisation, civil or military, can afford to sit still.  One must move with the times to progress in any form.</P>
    <P>The reform process for the Defence Forces is the most far-reaching and wide-ranging which the organisation has seen since its foundation.  It is a most complex process and one which cuts across all areas of military life.  It has been acknowledged by all concerned that reform of the Defence Forces is both necessary and overdue. All major aspects of Defence Forces reform are contained in the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, which covers the years 1996 to 1998 and which followed from the 1994 Price Waterhouse review of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The plan has been widely circulated throughout the Defence Forces and all participants are working in the full knowledge of the ultimate objective, which is to have the Defence Forces structured and organised in such a way as to enable them carry out their roles as laid down by the Government in September, 1993.  It will be an organisation with enhanced operational capacity and one of which all its personnel can be proud.</P>
    <P>Some of the major reforms being carried out as a result of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan involve the reorganisation of the Defence Forces from a four command structure to a three brigade structure and an enhanced organisational and operational capability through larger unit sizes.  There will be nine larger infantry battalions instead of the current 11 and there will be less top-heavy structures in place.  There will also be a reduced manpower level to 11,500 and lower age profiles and new career structures for officers and enlisted personnel.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation contained in the implementation plan provides for the revision of the range of statutory duties of the Chief of Staff, specifically to give a new emphasis and focus to his responsibility for the effectiveness, efficiency, military organisation and economy of the Defence Forces; and the allocation of the duties of the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General to two new appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff, one with responsibility for operational matters and the second for support matters. Having one person at the helm of the Defence Forces makes for a more streamlined management system.  The Bill will give legislative effect to these recommendations.</P>
    <P>The unique structure of primary and secondary legislation governing the Defence Forces also forms part of the background to the Bill.  Based on the Defence Act, 1954, and supplemented by an extensive set of Defence Force regulations, the purpose of this legal structure is to facilitate the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="703" /> Minister's control and regulate the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps in every detail.  However, in many ways, the 1954 Act reflects the priorities and concerns of another age with a major emphasis on procedural detail.</P>
    <P>In the Defence Forces in recent years, a major effort has been devoted to blowing away the administrative cobwebs.  Instead of formal regulation, many matters are now dealt with by simple administrative instruction issued by the military authorities, enabling a more creative and flexible approach to management.  However, in the area of organisation, this effort has been stymied by the inflexibility of the 1954 Act with regard to organisation.  At present, as Minister, I am obliged to specify by regulation each and every appointment in each and every unit of the Defence Forces.  Every time personnel are moved around I should, in theory, make yet another amendment to the regulation, a thick volume known as CS 4.</P>
    <P>The Bill will introduce two major innovations in military management.  First, it will put in place a modern management structure along the lines outlined above as suggested by the EAG.  Second, it will empower that management structure with the flexibility to manage effectively the manpower resources of the Defence Forces by removing the requirement for a major body of regulations.</P>
    <P>Since the launch of the Strategic Management Initiative, there has been a greater focus throughout the public service on clarifying lines of authority and accountability and on specifying clearly the objectives to be met.  The vesting of authority in senior public service managers must be balanced against the need to ensure that the position of the elected Government is not in any way eroded.  The organisational changes proposed in the Bill are grounded in this balanced approach. Where before there where three quasi independent offices, now there will be a single integrated military headquarters with a single officer clearly in charge.  The Bill also reflects the provisions of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan adopted by the previous Government.  Military command of the Defence Forces will remain with the Minister.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Bill is technical in nature.  In the course of its preparation, many different issues concerning both the new management structure and the new approach to regulating the military organisation were raised.  Senior military personnel have been intimately involved in this process and many of their suggestions have been incorporated into the Bill.  In addressing all of these issues, the expert advice of the parliamentary draftsman's office has determined our approach.  I appreciate its considerable assistance in clarifying many difficult legal issues.</P>
    <P>Sections 12 and 13 of the Defence Act, 1954, are the principal sections being amended.  Section 12 provides for three principal military office holders and prescribes the terms and conditions attaching <Col N="704" /> to these three appointments.  Section 13 establishes in the Department of Defence three principal military branches, the heads of which are the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General. Under the terms of the Act, the Minister for Defence has assigned to each of them specified duties relating to the business of the Department of Defence.  Each is directly responsible for and reports to the Minister on the performance of those duties.  In addition, a co-ordinating role in relation to the business of the principal military branches of the Department has been delegated to the Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the implementation plan, the Bill before the House provides that the existing three military branches of the Department of Defence will be replaced by a single military element to be known as Defence Forces Headquarters. The Chief of Staff will be the head of Defence Forces Headquarters and will be supported by the two Deputy Chiefs of Staff, one dealing with operational matters and the other with support matters.  The Chief of Staff, who will as heretofore be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government, will be given the full range of duties heretofore assigned to the Chief of Staff, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General.  He will have responsibility for the overall management of the Defence Forces.  The Deputy Chiefs of Staff, who will be appointed by the Government and to whom duties will be delegated by the Chief of Staff with the approval of the Minister, will report to the Chief of Staff and not directly to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The amendment Bill provides for the recommended designations and for the reorganisation of the duties of the existing three principal military office holders, for smooth transitional arrangements and for adaptations.  The remaining sections of the Bill involve relatively minor changes and mainly provide for the replacement of the existing appointments of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General with the appointments of Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) or Deputy Chief of Staff (Support), as the case may be.</P>
    <P>Since the adoption of the three year implementation plan in 1996, an excellent start has been made in rectifying the many deficiencies identified in the consultants' report.  Through a voluntary early retirement scheme costing nearly £50 million, we have achieved a strength of 11,500. The final phase of the scheme, which will involve about 225 personnel, will be launched next week. There has been substantial progress reducing the number of medically unfit personnel.  We have introduced a policy of continuous recruitment and a new manpower policy for enlisted personnel. We have 300 first timers serving with UNIFIL at present.  In the case of officer promotions, progress has been made to a more merit based system.</P>
    <P>Although these achievements represent major milestones along the path of reform, we must be mindful of the need to underpin our recent successes <Col N="705" /> through longer term reform in the management structures.  The present top level structure of the Defence Forces was designed to meet the needs of a bygone era.  It was deliberately designed to ensure that no single military officer could exercise excessive authority and undermine the position of the Minister.  Accordingly, each of the three autonomous branches was headed by an independent office holder reporting personally to the Minister with the Chief of Staff confined to exercising an unspecified co-ordinating role. However, while the command and management structures of the Defence Forces must be consistent with maintaining civil control of the military, in the modern age we must also have regard to good management practices.</P>
    <P>In the course of its 1995 report, Price Waterhouse emphasised the importance of developing and strengthening a professional management ethos in the Defence Forces with a greater focus on the efficient and effective use of resources.  In this context, the consultants highlighted the unusually cumbersome arrangements at headquarters where three nominally independent office holders report separately to the Minister. When this matter came before the then Government, a more conventional and centralised approach was endorsed with a single officer, the Chief of Staff, empowered to act as a chief executive. This approach has been adopted in the present Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is so technical in nature it is impossible to oppose most of it.  The only issue with which I disagree is the transfer of responsibility for the appointment of the Chief of Staff from the President to the Government.  I am aware amendments were tabled on this issue in the Dáil to which the Minister did not accede.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a housekeeping exercise in terms of military reorganisation and one could say a lot of time, energy and effort has been expended on it. Given that the organisation as a whole demands farreaching reform and reorganisation, I do not know why the Minister did not wait until the publication of the White Paper and include these housekeeping and reorganisational exercises in one, overall reforming piece of legislation which would bring the Army, its management and structures out of the Victorian age and into the 20th century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister stated, it was the era of anarchy in the 1920s and 1930s which gave birth to the unique type of Army structures we have in Ireland.  I am sure no threat could be posed to the security of the State by the Army and no single member of it could have complete and absolute authority.  However, in more settled times, the existing arrangements are now totally unnecessary and it is important we bring the Army into the modern age.  In that regard, I commend the Minister for his efforts.  More farreaching reforms <Col N="706" /> are required, however, and I would like to know when the Minister intends to introduce them.</P>
    <P>In Seán O'Casey's play <i>Juno and the Paycock,</i> Joxer Daly asks the famous question &ldquo;what is the stars?&rdquo;.  I reflect the opinion of many when I ask &ldquo;what is the Army?&rdquo; In view of current controversies, the public perspective on the Army has diminished.  That is a pity.  We are faced with the prospect of approximately £1 billion disappearing out of the national Exchequer to meet compensation claims.  During the previous debate, Ireland's entry to EMU and its implications for Ireland were discussed.  The Minister for Finance was asked what he would do with the money which would become available as a result of Ireland's entry, particularly the vast Central Bank resources and the tax windfall coming into the Government coffers as a result of our improving economy.  If £1 billion is subtracted for Army compensation claims, a sizeable hole will be put in those resources.</P>
    <P>Nowadays people expect a return on their money and that is sometimes the sole criterion by which worth is measured.  As we become more sophisticated, we demand more from our public services and more will be demanded from the Army.  The Army's role should be expanded and new legislation may be necessary to provide for that.  The role of military police could be expanded.  For those of us who travel 500 and 600 miles rarely a day passes when we do not meet lunatic drivers on the road.  One would sometimes wish to have the authority to arrest them.  I know there would be logistics involved in the creation of an expanded role for the Army but I am sure the necessary legislation could be drafted.</P>
    <P>The issue of Army deafness claims is topical at the moment.  The Green Book could possibly become a green eyed monster with court claims reaching mammoth proportions.  The controversy has overshadowed the Minister's work since assuming office and has become a major public issue.  The manner in which the media are treating this issue leaves a great deal to be desired.  I am aware there are genuine cases but the courts seem to be experiencing considerable difficulty dealing with this issue.  The efforts to provide the courts with some kind of guidelines may have backfired. The Judiciary does like to be guided in its approach to decision making and it certainly does not appreciate Oireachtas involvement in its role.</P>
    <P>The wrong decision was made on compensation. The Minister is appealing many of the decisions to the Supreme Court, something which should have been done initially.  Before any case was appealed, £45 million had been paid in compensation. This set a trend which continues still.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to reorganisational changes at the top level of the Army structure.  The Bill does not set out to do anything radical.  The changes are necessary but I do not understand the urgency with which they are being dealt.  We have been waiting for legislation in other areas and we have been <Col N="707" /> unable to get it as quickly as this Army legislation. The legislation for the Commission for the West was promised six months ago but it has not yet been delivered.  There is widespread public concern about that.  It is amazing that there can be legislation dealing with issues I would not regard as urgent when there is legislation badly needed for the development of disadvantaged areas in the west and the midlands.  The bulk of legislation for the Western Development Commission has been delayed.  I see no sense of urgency about that legislation.  The Minister must have reasons for the urgency surrounding the legislation; maybe he would tell us those reasons.</P>
    <P>This is a housekeeping exercise which is technical in nature and will not make any dramatic changes.  I will say no more about it except to ask the Minister to bring in the White Paper on his proposals for the total reorganisation of the Defence Forces.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to speak on this important legislation. I pay tribute to Minister Smith for his work in the Defence portfolio.  We are aware that most of his time is taken up in dealing with the major issue of Army hearing loss compensation claims.  The problem was not of his making, it was a poisoned chalice passed on by the previous administration who dealt with it as one would deal with a hot potato.  He has tackled the issue in an up front manner.  He has made every effort to resolve this complex problem.  He wants to have the issue put to one side and remove it from the courts, significantly reducing legal fees and lessening the burden on the taxpayer.  The action he has taken to date has saved a significant amount of money and I am sure the Minister will refer to that in his response.  I hope the level of awards in the courts stabilises at a reasonable level which will facilitate the Minister in his desire to establish a compensation board to deal with all claimants in a fair and equitable manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is working hard to implement the Defence commitments contained in An Action Plan for the Millennium.  Work on the White Paper on Defence is well under way.  Delegation of day to day administration from the Department to the military has progressed.  The continuous recruitment of young personnel is paying dividends.  It is important to have a constant supply of young, eager and talented recruits coming into the Defence Forces and making their mark. The programme of equal opportunity is bearing <Col N="708" /> fruit.  Columb Barracks in Mullingar is positive evidence of this.  This is due to the Minister's proactive manner of dealing with the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The process of providing suitable equipment and accommodation for the Defence Forces is ongoing.  You only need to walk around McKee and Cathal Brugha Barracks, the naval base at Haulbowline and Baldonnel to see how much has been spent on improving facilities.  The current tender competition for armoured personnel carriers is the biggest defence contract in the history of the State.  The Army personnel carriers will be essential for Irish troops carrying out their roles at home and on peacekeeping duty overseas, where their magnificent performance brings the reputation of Ireland to new heights.  These are positive developments which will enhance the overall operation of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us follows the Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan for 1996-8.  The enactment of the legislation is necessary for the implementation plan to work.  The Bill will revamp the top level military organisation and structure and it makes perfect sense.  The situation in the Defence Forces since the enactment of the Defence Act, 1954, is past its sell-by date. Things have changed and I am glad this legislation is before us.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that this house we are discussing requires a different type of roof because the one which is there is leaking.  The Minister has taken measures to correct that.  The top level organisation needs to be modernised.  Section 12 of the Defence Act, 1954, is one of the main sections which needed to be amended because of the reorganisation.  The principal amendments to the section involve the substitution of the two new posts of Deputy Chief of Staff for the posts of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General, and prescribe that the appointment to these posts be made by Government.  This contrasts with the present position where appointments to the offices of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General are made by the President.</P>
    <P>The fundamental difference between the new arrangements and the current situation is that under the new arrangements, the holders of the appointments of Deputy Chief of Staff will report to the Chief of Staff, whereas at present the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General report independently of each other and of the Chief of Staff to the Minister.  Under the new structure the Deputy Chiefs of Staff will be subordinate to the Chief of Staff.  They will be his deputies and for this reason it would be most inappropriate to prescribe in legislation that they should be appointed by the President.  Appointments by the President are normally reserved for positions which are independent of the Government such as members of the Judiciary, the Ombudsman and the Governor of the Central Bank.  It is worth noting that Secretaries General of Government Departments and the Garda <Col N="709" /> Commissioner are appointed by the Government and not by the President.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, wholly appropriate that appointments to Deputy Chief of Staff should be made by the Government.  It could reasonably be argued that the Chief of Staff should also be appointed by the Government.  However, given the relationship between the Defence Forces and the President, as set down in the Constitution, it is felt that on balance there is some merit in his appointment being made by the President.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the existing section 12 of the Defence Act, the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General are appointed to the principal military offices of Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General. This Bill provides that the Deputy Chiefs of Staff are appointed by Government and are not separately established posts.  This is because under the new arrangements all of their duties, functions and responsibilities will derive from the office of the Chief of Staff and they will not have an independent function of their own.  In this regard it should be noted that in the strict legal sense each and every member of the Defence Forces, from Lieutenant General down to a new recruit, is an office holder.  The thrust of this section is to place the Chief of Staff at a different level than his deputies in the new structures and to make it clear that he is the sole officer reporting to the Minister on the military business of the Department of Defence.  That is a logical move which is in the best interests of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces it is necessary to rewrite a number of Defence Force regulations, including those which prescribe the numerical establishment of the forces. In that context it is considered that future Defence Force regulations should prescribe the maximum overall limit of 11,500, together with the permitted maximum number in each rank and the number of technical officer and technician appointments within that overall strength.  This would give much needed flexibility to the military authorities, enabling them to determine from time to time within the prescribed overall limit the strength of the various staffs, units and other elements of the forces and the title and designation of each military appointment.  It will also facilitate the transfer or posting of personnel from time to time to areas of greatest need, having regard to such factors as changing circumstances, the operational requirements of the forces and the exigencies of the service.  This is another important strategic step forward.</P>
    <P>This is necessary legislation which will allow for the better managment of the Defence Forces.  The defence and security of the State are vital to national economic and social wellbeing.  Defence services are among the most critical provided by Government.  The importance of having a top class, streamlined Defence Force with the capability to effectively and efficiently handle its designated roles cannot be understated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> In bringing forward this legislation the Minister is complying with the undertaken given in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  Reference was made to the White Paper, which is at an advanced stage of preparation.  The Minister has grappled with one of the most serious situation ever to confront a Minister since the foundation of the State and he is to be congratulated.  He is a man of great political courage and since taking office his status has risen to new heights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a technical Bill which we will be supporting.  The important issue is what members of the Defence Forces do and how efficiently and effectively the Army is run rather than titles and chains of command.  It behoves us as legislators to ensure that the Minister leads the way in restoring morale to the Defence Forces. There has been a problem with morale for a number of years and we must pay tribute to all members of the Defence Forces &mdash; the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, which play a vital fishery protection role.</P>
      <P>We need to refocus attention to see where we are going in the next century.  This behoves the Minister to lead by example and he has done so. Problems exist such as that concerning compensation. Over many years the Army has been the poor sister in defence matters but we should not forget the great work it has done.  There have been problems concerning the Garda and the Army but it is important to give due recognition to these two important institutions of State.  We must also ensure that whatever resources are required are made available.  The Minister will have the support of this side of the House in any extra commitments and recognition he can give to the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Army has played a very significant role at home as a back up to the Garda.  It is particularly noted for the peacekeeping roles it has carried out over many years.  I welcome the belated recognition of those who served in areas such as the Congo and Namibia and the Minister's recent awards.  For too long too much lip service has been paid to these men.  If we are to continue to play an influential peacekeeping role the necessary resources must be provided to ensure that the best training is provided and that equipment is updated &mdash; the Army must not be seen as a Dad's Army.  I am sure the Minister intends to ensure that the Army is well resourced and that the Government supports the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Army School of Equitation has played an important role over 70 years.  Army personnel and Irish horses have graced many arenas throughout the world and have competed at Olympic games and other such events.  This role must be maintained and resources must be provided to ensure that there is an adequate supply of young horses so that we continue to recognise the prominent role played by the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We support this Bill.  I hope the Minister will take on board the matters I have mentioned, <Col N="711" /> particularly the Air Corps and Naval Service and their efficient fishery protection role, which will be increasingly important.  Additional resources must be provided to those areas of the Defence Forces which are in need.  If there has been a loss of morale in recent months and years, it behoves the Minister, with the support of both Houses, to ensure that morale is rebuilt so that we can continue to be proud of the Army and that it will continue to serve the country well into the next century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation and accept the need for it.  However, I believe, and am sure the Minister accepts, that it is part of a raft of legislation which will be introduced over the next few years as part of the reorganisation of the Defence Forces which is a result of the Price Waterhouse efficiency audit group report.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is preparing a White Paper and I look forward to its early publication. I will comment on it later.</P>
      <P>The Army comprises three brigades, nine infantry battalions and 11,500 personnel and will become slimmed down and fitter.  In that context, I hope it will be allowed to operate efficiently and effectively and that it will be given the resources it requires to do the job properly.  Those resources should be channelled through the Chief of Staff and he should be given control of the operational side of the budget.  There was a great deal of debate in the Dáil on outputs and it was suggested that the Chief of Staff should be responsible for them.  I share that view but since the Minister answered in detail many questions asked about that in the Dáil, I do not intend to deal with it in any substantive way.</P>
      <P>When the Public Service Management (No. 2) Act was debated in the Houses in 1997, I sought to amend it because it was part of the legislation that the Department of Defence was defined as being the Department and principal military branches &mdash; the Chief of Staff, the Quartermaster-General and the Adjutant-General.  However, the latter two were not included in the Schedule and this was the case for a number of people in other Departments, such as the Attorney General. I sought to have the principal military branches excluded because to do otherwise would be to give the Secretary General of the Department undue influence over them and I thought that undesirable.  That attempt to amend the legislation was unsuccessful.  The Minister dealing with the legislation was the late Deputy Coveney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, an important principle is at stake and it is one about which we must be careful and that is the degree to which the State and the Defence Forces interface.  Given our history and the need to ensure there is a separation between Government and the Army, we must be careful how we proceed on these matters.  That is not to say that this legislation does not intrude on an area that it <Col N="712" /> should not because it does, but it does it properly. However, it is something about which we must always be aware when dealing with defence matters. It is only a short step from wanting to regulate the Army to wanting to control it.  That is something undesirable in a parliamentary democracy such as this.  Obviously this also works in reverse.  The degree to which the Army intrudes in civil matters is something about which we must also be careful.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Adjutant-General and the Quartermaster-General &mdash; or the Deputy Chief of Staff (Operations) and the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) who will replace them &mdash; are no longer office holders.  I sympathise with the view expressed in the Dáil that these should be presidential appointments because of the principles I outlined.  However, having read the Committee Stage debate in the Dáil, the Minister has answered that point conclusively.  In other areas, such as the courts, the President appoints the chief officers while other appointments are dealt with differently.  Perhaps that is appropriate.  However, it comes back to departmental control, the fact that the Secretary General can exercise a substantial degree of control and the nature of the relationship between the Army and the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister might deal with section 39(b) in his reply as it was not dealt with as comprehensively in the Dáil as other matters.  It concerns the five year term for office holders.  While I welcome it, I query its renewal.  The Minister mentioned the commissioning ceremony in the Curragh next Monday to which I look forward.  Young people entering the Army should have a reasonable expectation that they can progress to the most senior ranks and that career opportunities are available to them.  There should also be a prospect of the age profile within the service falling. By international standards, we have an elderly army.  Personnel are old by international standards and that is something of which we must be aware.  The Minister is correct to say that the 1954 Act was inflexible.  It is ridiculous that he should have to specify by regulation each and every appointment within the Army.  That is not sensible in a modern society.</P>
    <P>Regarding the White Paper, difficult issues will have to be confronted, not the least of which will be barrack closures.  In that context, I appeal for the representative bodies, RACO and PDFORRA, to be fully consulted, as I am sure they will be, in the preparation of the White Paper and for their views to be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Another matter is savings in the Forces.  We have already debated the deafness problem and I welcome the legislation presented on that matter. However, it would wrong if the savings achieved within the Defence Forces were used to pay the bill accruing to the State as a result of liability which the courts might establish.  The savings from reorganisation should stay within the Army. In the Curragh, it has been decided that people <Col N="713" /> who live in Orchard Park, a part of the greater Curragh complex, will be able to buy their houses.  That is something they have sought for many years.  Plausible reasons were given in the past why it could not happen but now it can.  It would not be proper or appropriate for the moneys which arise to the State in that context to be used to meet the deafness bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it should go towards the swimming pool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that.  The Minister has prompted me in that direction.  I learned to swim in the Curragh swimming pool many years ago.  The principle is that, if the Army is to be a proper one, it is right that it should have facilities available to it, and that is purely from a social rather than an operational point of view.  That is why the pool in the Curragh is important and why it should be kept open.  There is also the issue of the Army bands which are an important part of military tradition.  I hope they can be retained. Recently there was a commemoration of 1798 in the Curragh at which the band of the Curragh Command played.  Such bands enhance these occasions and they are an important part of military tradition.  Senator Cosgrave mentioned the Equitation School; that too is important.</P>
      <P>One final important point concerns the Partnership for Peace.  Ireland and the Irish Army should be part of the Partnership for Peace.  The Amsterdam Treaty does not oblige us to enter into any military commitment unless it is by the will of the Irish people.  However, we must take part in actions overseas.  It is already the case that Irish soldiers serve under NATO in Bosnia and that they have been involved in peace enforcement. Legislation was introduced to allow our soldiers to serve in a similar capacity in Somalia.</P>
      <P>We must participate in international peacekeeping and peace enforcement and become involved in the Petersberg Tasks on a humanitarian basis.  It is entirely appropriate for the Army to be involved in these matters, given its proud and honourable tradition in helping to resolve conflicts overseas.  It has gained tremendous credibility from the international community in areas of conflict for its efficiency and impartiality.  The Oireachtas will be able to decide on these matters and no one will be forced to do anything he should not do.  Once we have decided that we need an Army it is proper and correct that it should be deployed overseas.  I am very much in favour of our being a member of the Partnership for Peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a small but important piece of legislation.  I welcome it because it performs the important function of updating the structures of the Defence Forces to make them more efficient and effective, particularly at top level.  Senator Caffrey called the Bill a housekeeping exercise.  That is so, but the house in <Col N="714" /> question &mdash; the Defence Forces &mdash; is in need of major renovation.  I accept that the White Paper which is pending will be that renovation plan and will establish structures to allow the Defence Forces to meet the challenges of the modern era.  The Partnership for Peace to which Senator Dardis referred is one of the functions of the Defence Forces.  It is important that we ensure that the Defence Forces are equipped to deal with our international responsibilities and I support any move to ensure that they are equipped to fulfil their function on our behalf on the international front.</P>
      <P>I assume the White Paper will lead to further legislation and for that reason I do not intend to be too critical of this legislation.  A number of urgent and important issues are not addressed in this legislation.  First, the Bill makes no reference to the structures of the Air Corps or the Naval Service.  We know from recent newspaper reports that some changes are proposed for both those branches of the Defence Forces.  I hope the Minister will respond to this point.</P>
      <P>Second, the Bill makes no reference to procedures for courts martial.  This is a grave omission. As the Minister is aware, in the United Kingdom court martial procedures have been challenged through the European Court of Human Rights on the grounds of partiality and the role of the judge advocate.  The UK Government, in response, has had to promise new legislation to make the procedures more independent. I wonder if similar changes are required here, if our procedures have been examined in the context of the Defence Act, 1954, and if amending legislation will be required to address this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will be brief because this issue was discussed in the Dáil only this week.  I disagree with very little the Minister has said and having read the Official Report of the Dáil debate I see that very few aspects of the matter have been missed. However, no debate on defence matters could ignore the Army deafness issue which hangs like a black cloud over the Defence Forces.  Public perception of the Army and confidence in it are extremely important.  The Minister has struggled with this issue since coming to office when he was handed a poisoned chalice.  I commend him on his efforts and publicly wish him the best.  We all know that the Army has been done untold damage by the massive Army deafness claim.  The public are convinced that among the huge number of claims there must be some which are bogus.  This reflects badly on soldiers who are genuinely afflicted and on their families.  The Minister is hidebound by the inconsistent approach of the courts to the claims.  There is an urgent need to take the matter out of the court system and resolve it in an independent tribuna, but this appears to be impossible.  Until the matter is dealt with the image of the Army will continue to suffer damage.  Any review of the structures of the Army must involve an internal discussion of this matter, the causes of the crisis <Col N="715" /> and its effects on the Defence Forces.  That discussion cannot happen while the issue is current but I hope it can be done in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I look forward to the publication of the White Paper and the legislation which will follow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister landed in the hot seat when he took over in the Department of Defence.  The Army deafness claims represent a huge problem and I wish him luck dealing with it.  I hope the courts will start making awards that will stabilise the situation.  Hopefully, a compensation board can be established which will remove the big wigs and legal personnel from the equation and ensure that compensation is paid to the people who deserve it without having their legal representatives taking the cream.  I hope the Minister will be successful in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>Over the years the Defence Forces have done a fantastic job for this country in extremely serious situations, especially during the war years and the Troubles.  They play a vital role in the stability and defence of this nation.  In latter years they have fulfilled various roles as part of peacekeeping missions abroad.  They are highly regarded and respected throughout the world for that work.</P>
      <P>I was in the United States when President Kennedy was assassinated and a unit of our Defence Forces was brought from Ireland to be part of the guard of honour at the President's funeral.  I was extremely proud of the Irish Army on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are going through radical change at present which will require extensive resources.  It would be detrimental to that process if resources earmarked for streamlining and so forth had to be paid in claims.  Everybody hopes to see the Defence Forces improved.  The Minister is endeavouring in this legislation to upgrade and introduce regularity into the forces or, as he said, shake the cobwebs from the cupboards.  This will give young people an ideal opportunity to serve their country and to go from the rank of private to the top of the Defence Forces.  That is a challenge which will be attractive to young people.  This Bill is the start of many good developments in this area and I wish the Minister well.</P>
      <P>The legislation is necessary and it is high time it was introduced.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct but I interpreted the Senator's remark in the right way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate.  This legislation was linked to the White Paper in a number of contributions.  It is more important to link it with the ongoing reorganisation <Col N="716" /> of the Defence Forces.  The Price Waterhouse review and the subsequent implementation plan envisage a ten year span during which the different stages of the reform process can be completed. Ten years are required for a number of reasons.  One is the fact that the review was long overdue.  A number of the problems which had developed in the intervening period were so great that no single instrument or Bill could solve them at the same time.</P>
    <P>I was anxious that this Government be the first Government to commit itself to constant recruitment, not only because young, talented, motivated and educated people would join the Defence Forces continuously but also because we cannot afford to repeat the process of humps and hollows of non-recruitment followed by extensive recruitment followed by non-recruitment.  There are promotional and other problems when great numbers of people of the same age join the forces at the same time and are seeking promotion.  I am anxious to get rid of those problems.</P>
    <P>However, it is not possible to change what I inherited overnight.  This Bill should not be linked in that sense to the White Paper.  It should be linked to the process of change which has reduced the numbers through voluntary early retirement from over 13,000 to 11,500.  That and constant recruitment &mdash; in fairness to the last Administration, there were two tranches of recruitment &mdash; will reduce the age profile.  Significant investment in refurbishment is required in Cathal Brugha, McKee, Finner and Collins Barracks and in various other centres throughout the country to ensure the working environment is continually improved.  On many occasions I have said that I am ashamed of many of our installations. No previous Government did anything about them and it is unlikely that a future Government will have the resources to do everything to each of them.  Therefore, we must set priorities.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis referred to the savings that are made being allocated in part to deal with the claims for hearing loss compensation.  We have no resources which, through their sale, would match the requirements of the total compensation bill; but if we can make a contribution, however small, it will remove some of the pressure.  However, of the resources which will come to hand as a result of relocations and disposals of important pieces of property which can assist with the housing crisis and commercial and other development, only part of them will be devoted to that purpose. The bulk will be devoted to necessary re-equipment, refurbishment and redevelopment.</P>
    <P>I now turn to morale and the effect on the Defence Forces of the current debate.  It is important to remember that the majority of people who have and are serving in the forces have made no claim and that the majority of the claimants have genuine claims.  The argument relates to those who climbed on the bandwagon and the court awards for minor injury.  They are <Col N="717" /> the two problems which should be separated from the generality of what the Defence Forces do.</P>
    <P>The work of the Defence Forces includes participation in peacekeeping missions in 30 countries over the past 40 years.  This country has been proud of their activities in each of those countries. Grave risks were taken in the name of peace.  Highly trained and motivated people went on these missions and 75 people lost their lives. This week I honoured those who were killed in action under the banner of the United Nations with An Réalt Míleata, a medal to commemorate their great contribution and enormous sacrifice.</P>
    <P>At home, the Defence Forces deal with fisheries surveillance, drugs interdiction, support for the Garda Síochána, defusion of bombs, cash escorts and their usual daily work.  Senator Dardis referred to the more spectacular work such as bands going to schools around the country and the style, presentation and grace of parades.  That is an important part of the soul of a country and it should be protected and developed.  It is critically important in this and other debates to emphasise these positive developments.</P>
    <P>There are few industries where employees are permanent, have secure pensions and no threat to their employment.  These are the strengths of the Defence Forces and they should be emphasised. I do not feel that my work is dishonoured by the actions of another Senator or Deputy in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There have been instances where I would not have wished to be in the position that a minority of my colleagues have been in.  I cannot comprehend why I should take responsibility for that.  I do not see why I or the generality of politicians should be blamed for that, notwithstanding the fact that the public might do it.  My own approach to this and to that of the Defence Forces is to stand up, be counted and not be afraid to feel proud about it because it is part of the way we should proceed.</P>
    <P>Senators Glynn and Caffrey spoke from two different angles on the Army deafness claims.  I assure Senator Caffrey that the legislation passed here on the Green Book and civil liability requiring the courts to have due notice of particulars contained in that independent study is standing up well despite a few glitches.  I forecast that it will be better in the future.  If we trawl the compensation arena over the past year to 18 months, the average quantum award by court or out of court settlement was £35,000, it is now £15,000.  If you use your multiplier on 12,000 cases, you are talking about a saving of £250 million in little over a year.  Therefore, it would be very hard to say this system is failing.  This has been a difficult time and we have further to go.  We must reduce awards for minor disabilities, but we need everyone's co-operation to make it happen.  We should continue to make whatever savings are possible in this area.  We must also protect the Defence Forces and its image from fraudulent claims or from very high awards for minor disabilities. Despite a few problems that have emerged over <Col N="718" /> the past weeks, the bulk of the current settlements are based within the context of the Green Book.  The court staff and the legal profession think it is a formidable document.  I intend to ensure it stands the test of time; but, more importantly, that it produces a quick solution on a fair and equitable basis which protects the image of the Defence Forces, does not give major awards for minor disability and saves the taxpayer millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the issues of output, autonomy and control.  It is very important to remember that the democratic Government is in control. This is the civil authority and the Army is answerable to it.  Through all that empowerment, local autonomy, better management of resources has to be the order of the day.  About 60 per cent of the non-paid area is totally within the control of the military.  There are some signs of alarm in terms of various costings that we inherited.  I am not blaming anyone.  These costings have grown over time but the matter needs to be looked at seriously.  It is not as a result of civil control but probably because there was no control.  It is important to get the right balance and have cohesion between the military and civil authority so that we are all kept on our toes to make whatever savings possible and devote them to development, redevelopment and re-equipment.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis inquired about officeholders.  It is important we remember that the Quartermaster General, the Adjutant General and the new Deputy Chief of Staff are and will continue to be officeholders.  The five year contract is renewing the old Act and is part of being able to have continuity. In 1969, when the Troubles greatly intensified, there was a great need for the Army to be at the ready for contingency plans.  If the Chief of Staff was due to retire at a time like that most people would think whoever was in charge at that time should be able to guide the Army through that emergency.  That is one part of freedom.  But if you look back over the term of office of successive Chiefs of Staff you will notice they had a much shorter period.</P>
    <P>I thought Senator Dardis at the end of his contribuiton was referring to the five year contract in the force generally.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Meara referred to the fact that there was no mention of the Naval Service and the Air Corps in this Bill.  Price Waterhouse reviewed the Air Corps and presented a report last year.  The then Government decided it was not comprehensive enough, that they should go back and have a more detailed analysis of the problems, strengths <Col N="719" /> and weaknesses of these individual forces.  Price Waterhouse presented a final report in late February. It was presented to the Taoiseach's office who has responsibility for the EAG.  The report will be placed before the Government before 8 July and will be published before the end of the month.</P>
    <P>Even though there was a review of these two forces we still implemented a few measures.  One such measure was the purchase of an additional ship which is being built by Appledore and will be commissioned in 1999.  We continued to move forward because fishery protection, drug importation, all those management matters are very important.  We also addressed the problem of pilots leaving the Air Corps because of attractive offers from civil aviation by introducing a service commitment scheme which enabled us to retain 12 out of a potential 24 pilots.</P>
    <P>We are not just waiting for the White Paper, new legislation, reports, etc., day-to-day management still goes on.  I accept the White Paper will be an important component in the medium to long-term as to where we go and how much we delve into different areas.  It is also important to realise that there was no mention of a White Paper until this Government came into office.  We gave a commitment to produce a White Paper.  It was intended to produce it within one year but now it will probably be within two years because we need greater consultation.  We obviously have to have discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  There are other areas where security matters have to be resolved.  I give a commitment that the consultation will be full and meaningful and submissions will be sought from representative associations and other very shortly.  There will be an opportunity for a full consultation with all the representative authorities.</P>
    <P>Our courts martial system is based on the principle of civil courts.  Their decisions can be appealed to the civil courts.  Every soldier is entitled to the same rights as anyone else under the Constitution, that is, they are free to go to whatever court his or her legal advisers suggest.</P>
    <P>The Army bands represent another difficult matter to resolve.  The reorganisation process has decided on the numbers.  The advice from top band musicians is that the figure suggested is not sufficient for four bands.  The military advice is that that is the number, because reorganisation does mean some pain.  Further discussions have to take place to try to come up with the best solution. I am interested in maintaining the history and quality of music produced by the Army bands.  The band has visited my constituency twice, including last Sunday when it gave a beautiful recital in Killenaule.  Arguments are ongoing about whether smaller or greater numbers are required.  The position is being examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> A sum between £100,000 and £150,000 was provided to the Army Equitation School this year to enable it buy better horses.  We must ensure that this can be done on an ongoing basis because it is not now possible to buy top quality horses at former prices.  We must consider how we can continue to build up this resource given its impact on the Defence Forces, the support it receives from the public, its tourism potential and the international acclaim it has received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to push my luck with the Minister but my point relates to functions and duties of the Chief of Staff as defined in section 4.  It states that he shall be directly responsible to the Minister for the performance of such duties as may from time to time be assigned to him or her under subsection (2).  This is as it should be. I agree with the Minister that the Army must be subject to the control of the democratic State.  Its purpose is to support the civil power.  However, my point relates to the degree to which it would be possible to politically interfere with the Army. This would be entirely improper, although I do not suggest the Minister would do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Chief of Staff made a comment in respect of the Partnership for Peace.  It was appropriate for the military adviser to the Government to speak out, but there appeared to be an inference on a radio programme yesterday evening that this was improper, that the Chief of Staff should not have a view on such matters and that if he did have a view, he should keep it to himself and not express it publicly.  I am totally opposed to the idea that he should keep his mouth shut.  It is proper for the Chief of Staff to <Col N="721" /> have a view on matters which are relevant to the way the Army can operate and the degree to which it should be involved in overseas peacekeeping and peace enforcement duties.  I welcome the statement reported in the press yesterday.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is aware, there were a number of heated meetings around the country before the last general election where the representative associations made their views explicitly known. This is proper and healthy for democracy. However, I heard a statement at one meeting which appalled me.  An individual stated that they would march on Leinster House and throw their medals through the railings.  The suggestion that anybody in the Army, which supports the State, would march on the Parliament is dangerous.  I hope we never see members of the Defence Forces marching on the Parliament of this State.</P>

Such views should never be expressed or such action taken, but it is important to realise that his views represent 0.0001 per cent of the total of 11,500 people in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.</P>
      <P>I will not comment on the statement made by the Chief of Staff.</P>
      <P>The partnership for peace is a matter which the Government will consider in discussions with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Ultimately, the people would be consulted about it.

      <P>That Seanad Éireann resolves that the terms of reference contained in the resolution passed by Dáil Éireann on the 7th of October, 1997 and by Seanad Éireann on the 8th of October, 1997 under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 and 1979 be amended as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  By the deletion from paragraph A.5 of the words &ldquo;committed on or after the 20th June, 1985.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> 2.  By the addition of the following paragraphs after paragraph D:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;E.  The Tribunal shall, in addition to the matters referred to in paragraphs A(1) to A(5) hereof, inquire urgently into and report to the Clerk of the Dáil and make such findings and recommendations as it sees fit, in relation to the following definite matters of urgent public importance:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  Whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly, to Mr. Raphael Burke which may, in the opinion of the Sole Member of the Tribunal, amount to corruption or involve attempts to influence or compromise the disinterested performance of public duties or were made or provided in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving such payments was improperly connected with any public office or position held by Mr. Raphael Burke, whether as Minister, Minister of State or elected representative;</P>
    <P>2.  Whether, in return for or in connection with such payments or benefits, Mr. Raphael Burke did any act or made any decision while holding any such public office or position which was intended to confer any benefit on any person or entity making a payment or provided a benefit referred to in paragraph 1 above, on any other person or entity, or procured or directed any other person to do such an act or make such a decision.</P>
    <P>And that the Tribunal be requested to conduct its Inquiries in the following manner to the extent that it may do so consistent with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, 1921 to 1998:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) To carry out such preliminary investigations in private as it thinks fit (using all the powers conferred on it under the Acts), in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists in relation to any of the matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 above to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry in relation to such matters;</P>
    <P>(ii) To inquire fully into all matters referred to in paragraphs E1 and E2 in relation to which such evidence may be found to exist;</P>
    <P>(iii) In relation to any matters where the Tribunal finds that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, to report that fact to the Clerk of the Dáil and to report in such a manner as the Tribunal <Col N="723" /> thinks appropriate on the steps taken by the Tribunal to determine what evidence, if any, existed and the Clerk of the Dáil shall thereupon communicate the Tribunal's report in full to the Dáil;</P>
    <P>(iv) To report on an interim basis to the Clerk of the Dáil on the following matters:&mdash;</P>

    <P>any other matters which the Tribunal believes should be drawn to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil at that stage (including any matter relating to the terms of reference);</P>
    <P>and to furnish such further interim reports as the Tribunal may consider necessary.</P>
    <P>F. And that the Sole Member of the Tribunal should be informed that it is the desire of the House that:&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion amends the terms of reference of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters which was established pursuant to a motion passed by both Houses last October.  A resolution in like manner was passed by Dáil Éireann yesterday with the support of all parties in that House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two main objectives to the amending terms.  First, the motion provides for the amendment to the original terms of reference of the tribunal sought by Mr. Justice Flood, the sole member of the planning tribunal, in his interim report <Col N="724" /> of 26 February 1998.  Second, the remit of the tribunal is being extended to enable it to inquire into all substantial payments made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly for whatever purpose or with whatever motive, to Mr. Raphael Burke, the former Minister, Minister of State, Deputy and county councillor.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1998, Mr. Justice Flood has consented to the second amendment proposed, following consultation with the Attorney General on behalf of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government under the terms of the Act.  This comprehensive amendment of the planning tribunal's terms of reference shows the commitment of the Government, and that of both parties in Government, to ensure the highest standards of behaviour are upheld in public office.  The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are agreed that the best way forward in regard to the controversy surrounding Mr. Burke is to ensure a full judicial inquiry is held to fully investigate all relevant matters.</P>
    <P>The original terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal provided for the fullest possible investigation of the propriety, from the viewpoint of the planning system, of the payment which Mr. Burke himself acknowledged as having received from Mr. Gogarty, and indeed any other payment to him that might have been connected in any way with the operation of the planning system.  When it became known that Mr. Burke had received at least one other large contribution, notwithstanding his statement in the Dáil last September, the Government determined that this and any other substantial contributions or benefits received by Mr. Burke should also be investigated to establish if there was anything untoward relating to the purpose or motives of the donor in making such a payment, or of Mr. Burke in soliciting, receiving or rewarding it.</P>
    <P>Having considered the various options available to the Government, it became clear fairly quickly that the best course was to extend the remit of the planning tribunal as it was already examining at least one payment made to Mr. Burke.  Mr. Justice Flood was agreeable to taking on this wider investigation and he was satisfied that it would not create undue problems for the work of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to formally place on the record of the Seanad the Government's thanks to Mr. Justice Flood for agreeing to widen the remit of the tribunal in the manner proposed, particularly given the already heavy work load of the tribunal and the demanding task with which it has been charged.</P>
    <P>It is very important that neither I, in introducing the motion, nor any Member in speaking on it, should be seen in any way as pre-empting the work of the tribunal in relation to the matters in question.  Therefore, while I do not intend to comment directly on the allegations which have <Col N="725" /> led to today's resolution, it has to be said there is general agreement among all parties that Mr. Burke's activities should be judicially investigated. One of the founding principles of my party, the Progressive Democrats, was to ensure that the integrity of the political system was upheld and to restore public confidence in the workings of our democracy.  These values hold equally true today.</P>
    <P>It is in all our interests that this tribunal should inquire thoroughly into the allegations which have been made concerning payments made to Mr. Burke.  Of course, it is also important that Mr. Burke's rights to justice and a fair hearing are protected.  The tribunal procedure will ensure that fair procedures are applied and the principles of natural justice upheld while ensuring the public interest is served in arriving at the truth of these matters.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice McCracken stated quite clearly in his report on his inquiries into the Dunnes payments that it is unacceptable for any Member of the Oireachtas to receive large personal gifts, and went on to refer to the potential for bribery and corruption.  Speaking in the context of large sums of money, he also said that if politicians are to give effective service to all their constituents or to all citizens, they must not be under a financial obligation to some constituents or some citizens only.  I can assure the House that both parties in the Government subscribe to these views.</P>
    <P>It is entirely inappropriate for any politician to solicit or accept on a personal basis substantial payments or benefits.  Acceptance of such payments is open to the interpretation, however ill founded this maybe in any particular case, that the donor expected or the recipient provided some benefit.  This is especially true in the case of an office holder.  This applies to local elected representatives, whose decisions on development plans can add considerably to the value of land, just as much as it does to Ministers or Deputies.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, it is in the interests of all parties to ensure the tribunal clears up the circumstances of these payments.  I am confident that Mr. Justice Flood and his team will leave no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of these matters.  The tribunal will have the full support of the Government, and of both parties in Government, in this task.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the House that, as a result of consensus and co-operation among all parties, we have imposed legislative constraints which should go a long way in guarding against any repetition of the type of activities in question.</P>
    <P>Under the Electoral Act, 1997, political parties and Members of each House of the Oireachtas and the European Parliament are, since 15 May 1997, required to furnish a donation statement each year indicating whether a donation exceeding the relevant threshold was received during the preceding year and giving particulars of any such donation.  Following an election, candidates not elected at the election must furnish a <Col N="726" /> similar statement in relation to donations received by them at the election.  The disclosure threshold for a political party is £4,000 and for individual members and candidates it is £500.</P>
    <P>The Ethics in Public Office Act is another recent legislative measure which is doing much to promote openness and accountability in public life.  It is important to say that all these advances were supported by all parties in the Oireachtas. The new procedures on political donations introduce transparency into the system of funding of political parties and candidates for election.  We must be vigilant in ensuring these procedures operate effectively, both in our own interests in defending our integrity as elected representatives and in the wider public interest of safeguarding the integrity of the democratic system.</P>
    <P>Another very significant step in ensuring high standards in public life and underpinning public confidence is the Government's commitment, already announced by the Taoiseach, to establishing a permanent commission on standards in public office.  This would have a wide ranging mandate to investigate allegations of misconduct in public office and by all elected representatives. Proposals in that regard are being considered by the Government.</P>
    <P>I expect a commission on standards in public office will be welcomed in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  While the tribunals currently under way and those which have completed their work are doing and have done commendable work, it is generally agreed that setting up <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals is not the most effective way of dealing with allegations, which nowadays are made with increasing regularity and which can have a corrosive effect if not dealt with promptly and decisively. Apart from anything else, it places great demands on the Judiciary at a time when the court system has more than enough ordinary business to cope with.  The House will have an opportunity to debate this wider issue when the Government brings forward its proposals in due course.</P>
    <P>The extended terms of reference before the House are extremely comprehensive in relation to any payments or benefits given to Mr. Burke and show, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the Government is determined to have all the allegations in this respect fully investigated and the truth laid bare for all to see.  In the first place, the tribunal will have to establish whether any substantial payments were made or benefits provided, directly or indirectly, to Mr. Burke during his political career.  If there were such payments, then it will have to decide on the motives of the benefactors &mdash; whether they were corrupt or intended to influence matters improperly.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it must decide if the payments were made in circumstances which may give rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making or receiving the payments was inappropriately connected with any public office held by Mr. Burke, not only as a Minister or Minister of <Col N="727" /> State, but also as a Deputy or county councillor. Then, in addition to the foregoing, the tribunal must decide whether, in return for any payments, Mr. Burke did anything directly or indirectly while holding any public office which was intended to benefit the donor or indeed anybody else who may be connected in any way.</P>
    <P>These terms of reference are quite exhaustive and will enable the tribunal investigate all relevant aspects of the payments that have been mentioned or, indeed, any other payments.  At the same time, the Government is concerned that the tribunal should have terms of reference which are well focused and which ensure that the tribunal's time is not wasted investigating irrelevant matters.  The tribunal, therefore, will have to form a judgment on whether any particular payment or benefit warrants investigation.  I am confident this discretion will enable the tribunal to carry out its work in an efficient and effective manner.</P>
    <P>These are the core provisions of the addition to the terms of reference of the planning tribunal. Provision is also made for the way the tribunal is to carry out its work.  These provisions are similar to those which apply to the tribunal's existing mandate.  The tribunal will carry out its preliminary investigations in private in order to determine whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry.  Should the tribunal find that there is insufficient evidence to warrant proceeding to a full public inquiry, it must report this to the Clerk of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement that the tribunal provides an interim report to the Clerk of the Dáil on the new matters referred to it, indicating in relation to them the number of parties represented, progress to date, the likely duration of the proceedings and any other matters it believes should be brought to the attention of the Clerk of the Dáil.  The latter may include views on the terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In this respect I can assure the House that if the tribunal in the course of its deliberations becomes aware of any deficiencies or unintended constraints in the terms of reference, the Government will do whatever is necessary to ensure the inquiry fully achieves its objectives.  The Clerk of the Dáil is obliged on receipt of any report from the tribunal to have it laid immediately before both Houses.</P>
    <P>The other amendment in today's motion grants in full Mr Justice Flood's request to enable him to consider matters included in the original terms of reference which had arisen prior to 20 June 1985.  This date is the date of the local elections held before the making of the payment to Mr. Burke by Mr. Gogarty.  It was inserted in the original terms of reference and accepted by all sides of the House as a reasonable time frame within which the tribunal should operate.  It was certainly not intended to limit the effective discharge of the tribunal's work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> In his interim report of 26 February, 1998, Judge Flood stated that he was advised that evidence in relation to matters which occurred prior to 20 June 1985 is admissible if and in so far as it is relevant to matters which occurred subsequent to 20 June 1985.  However, he stated that the fact that such a date is specified may give rise to a legal challenge which would inevitably delay the proceedings of the tribunal in relation to such matters.  Notwithstanding the advice and to avoid any such legal challenge, the tribunal sought the deletion of the words &ldquo;. committed on or after the 20th June 1985 .&rdquo;.  The Government is happy to accede to this request.</P>
    <P>The planning system is one of the principal means of ensuring that development takes place in an environmentally sustainable manner and is essential to our economic and social development as a society.  The Government has therefore taken, and will in the future take, further steps to ensure that the integrity of the planning system is upheld.  At the moment great demands are placed on the planning system to support our economic development in processing planning permission applications and in adopting development plans and zoning land for specific uses.  We must be sure that all these decisions are taken on the basis of proper planning and development considerations. Planning decisions can affect the value of land and benefit land owners enormously.  On the other hand, ill considered zoning can lead to increased costs to the taxpayer for infrastructural services and to poor quality living environments where people are cut off from everyday services.</P>
    <P>The Government is concerned to increase the effectiveness of the planning system and to ensure that planning decisions are made in good time, and in this context there is a resolution before both Houses of the Oireachtas to enable the Minister to increase the number of board members of An Bord Pleanála by three so that the board can deal more effectively with the continuing strong upward trend in the volume of planning appeals.  Last week I was in the Seanad for the passing of the Urban Renewal Bill, 1998, to provide for the renewal of run down urban areas by means of integrated area plans.</P>
    <P>However, all of this work will be fatally undermined if the public does not have confidence that the planning system operates in a fair and open manner for the overall public good.  I believe that the great majority of elected representatives and officials operate the planning system honestly and diligently and deserve to have confidence in the system vindicated.  It is to be hoped that the thorough inquiry being carried out by Mr. Justice Flood will achieve this result.</P>
    <P>While the amendment requested by the tribunal could have been made after the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1998, was enacted in May, prudence dictated that it should not be proceeded with until the means of investigating the matter of other payments to Mr. Burke which had by then come into the public domain was decided on.  In the event, it was <Col N="729" /> clearly better to avoid making two separate resolutions amending the terms of reference.  I commend the resolution and the amended terms of reference to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister of State introduced the resolution appointing the Flood Tribunal in this House last October, he stated that our planning system was too important to tolerate any hint of corruption or impropriety.  Every elected representative would fully concur with that view, and it is underpinned by this resolution. The terms of the Flood Tribunal were to inquire into certain planning matters and to restore public confidence in the planning system.  The planning system is of such paramount importance to the country that we cannot tolerate even the slightest hint of corruption or impropriety.  This applies to officials who make planning decisions and to local authority members who adopt development plans.  The original terms of the Flood Tribunal provided for an investigation into payments which Mr. Burke himself acknowledged having received from Mr. Gogarty in the context of our planning system.  It is unfortunate that Mr. Burke did not avail of the opportunity of making a personal statement to the Dáil to give a full list of the contributions which he had received.  If he had done so, it might not have been necessary to extend the terms of reference.</P>
      <P>It now appears that Mr. Burke received at least one other large contribution and it is only right that the Flood Tribunal should be enabled to investigate and establish if there was any impropriety on the part of the person giving the contribution or on Mr. Burke's part in receiving it. Extending the terms of reference might not have been necessary had the Government heeded the request of the Opposition for more open ended terms of reference in the first instance.  The Government argued then that it could not change the terms of reference of a sitting tribunal, but I am pleased that the Attorney General, having consulted with Mr. Justice Flood, has agreed to examine this matter.</P>
      <P>The tribunal can only work effectively if it receives the full co-operation of every individual and group, especially those which have relevant information which would be helpful to the tribunal. There has been much speculation about which members of Fianna Fáil knew about the £30,000 payment to Mr. Burke and I hope that they will give all the information available to them to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>The political system has been seriously damaged in the last 12 months, especially by revelations made to the McCracken Tribunal and the comments which Mr. Justice McCracken made about politicians receiving large contributions, which the Minister of State referred to.  The tribunals set up recently and this tribunal are very important in our endeavours to restore public confidence in the political system, but we have a long way to go before we can fully restore public confidence in politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> It appears that only a few politicians may have misbehaved, but that has rocked the political system. The Flood Tribunal, assisted by this motion, must speedily restore public confidence in our planning system.</P>

      <P>We have debated this before and I endorse the Government's efforts to bring transparency and truth to politics.  This amendment seeks to broaden the terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal and I concur with Senator Doyle: it is a pity that there are a couple of bad apples in the political system.  There is no point in saying that one party is totally clean; the problem is that a very small number of politicians &mdash; no more than 2 per cent of the whole &mdash; have created a political storm that has undermined public confidence in us all.  That is regrettable, because there are decent and honourable men and women in the Oireachtas and in county councils all over the country.</P>
      <P>I must have made hundreds of representations on planning matters in my 13 years on Cork County Council and sometimes a person might thank me by buying me a pint in a pub.  It is wrong to have such large contributions, as these give rise to allegations and innuendoes.  The answer is to allow Mr. Justice Flood and his tribunal to investigate these matters fully.  Both Coalition partners' policies in this matter are clear.  They want to get to the bottom of the matter and ensure Members of the Oireachtas and those in public life do their work honestly and openly.</P>
      <P>I fought four general elections and see nothing wrong with somebody giving me £300 or £400 towards my campaign.  Once it is declared there is nothing immoral or illegal about it.  Campaigns can be costly.  However, giving huge sums of money up to £50,000, perhaps by building companies, with the intention of receiving political favour is wrong and must be stamped out.  There is a long road ahead for politicians if we are to restore public confidence.  From time to time we are guilty of throwing allegations and spreading rumours and innuendo.  The Government has taken a particular stance on the matter.  We must all examine what is being said, restore public confidence and convey to the people that politics is about many things but it is not about corruption. Those foolish enough to go down that road will be punished and irreparable damage will be done to their careers, etc.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to the House and the Whips for co-operating fully in processing legislation.  Much legislation has been put through the House in the last few days; this would be nearly impossible without the co-operation of the Whips.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial issue is raised at the end of the Minister's speech when he said the process could be fatally undermined if the public does not have confidence in the planning system. Anyone who thinks this concerns an investigation <Col N="731" /> into the planning system is wrong: this is about politicians, political life and the standards that pertain in it.  The establishment of the commissions and the extension of the terms of reference, which I support, is about much more than this.  People are not talking about the planning system but about political life.  They are not talking about where houses were built or rezoning but whether politicians do their work honestly.  It is important that we focus on this issue and that we are not afraid to grasp the nettle.</P>
      <P>There are good and decent people in every party and group in both Houses.  It is shameful the way people whom I know to be hard working and diligent are tarred with the brush of corruption. I hold most of those I have met during my 11 years as a Member in high regard, even though I may have substantial, serious and continuing difficulty and differences with them in terms of their beliefs and policies.  However, that is a different matter.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the Taoiseach's reference to the establishment of a commission on standards in public office.  I ask the Minister to take some of what I have to say on board, consider it and discuss it with his party colleagues.  I also ask other parties to discuss the matter.  The more the Taoiseach refers to a commission the more worried I become as to what will be the end product.  I strongly believe in self-regulation and that politicians should look after their own profession, ensuring it is properly run, organised and policed.  A commission on standards in political office, concerned with the work of public representatives, should be chiefly made up of politicians. The work of the committee should reflect what is done in other professions.  Responsibility should not be handed to a group of outsiders.  If the Taoiseach decides to allow outsiders set standards for politicians he will effectively be raising a white flag and saying we cannot do our own business.  It would disable us and take from us ownership of standards of ethics and conduct in our profession and the responsibility of getting our own house in order.  These are hugely important issues.</P>
      <P>Statements by Minister's on extending authority to various groups, devolution of power and subsidiarity all concern people's ownership of the standards by which they work.  If ownership is taken away people are no longer part of the decision making process.  The same must apply to politicians.  We cannot have lower standards for ourselves.  We should insist on the same breaks we want other groups and professions to have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should establish a council or commission which is not too large and the majority of whose membership is politicians.  There should be some outsider input, as is the case in other professions such as teaching councils, in order to let in air and light.  The British Medical Council has included people outside its profession as has the Law Society of Ireland.  The Law Library is in the process <Col N="732" /> of doing the same.  In regulating a profession everybody recognises the importance of having a majority of the profession on the group determining standards, but there should also be external members.</P>
    <P>In our case the group should in the main consist of politicians and set standards, rules and regulations.  It should determine how to deal with such issues as consultancies, donations, criminal actions, bankruptcy, corruption and many other issues which arise.  We should determine standards for ourselves in the manner we expect other professions to operate.  We do not expect people from outside a particular profession to regulate that profession.  The majority of members of the commission, whatever it is called, should be Members of the Oireachtas while the minority should include carefully chosen outsiders from different groups.</P>
    <P>There should be two groups within the commission or council, one to decide due process when allegations are made against a Member or former member of either House.  The due process should constitute, in legal terms, a domestic remedy. Giving due regard to the principles of natural justice, due process and the fundamental rules of evidence and cross examination, the group should carry out the investigation and inquiry, form a conclusion and make a judgment.  This process should be done carefully and properly. The other group should be charged with examining the judgment and decide on the imposition of penalties.  The types of penalties should be previously established by the commission and, in industrial relations terms, include reprimands, warnings, final warnings, fines, impositions, etc. Another penalty might be the striking off of a Member, something which can happen at present in the context of bankruptcy, for example.  The legislation would have to be changed to govern the establishment and work of the commission.  If people were not happy with the outcome they could appeal to the High Court.</P>
    <P>It is completely wrong to continue to publicly reinforce the impression that the only way to clean up political life, find the problems or expose corruption is by getting outsiders to do it.  Almost every other profession has proved that this is not the best way to do so.  Nobody knows better than the members of a profession or working group where to look, where things are likely to be lost, hidden or covered up and the potential scams.</P>
    <P>I completely support the Taoiseach's good intentions.  The Minister of State stated:</P>
    <P>Another very significant step in ensuring high standards in public life and underpinning public confidence is the Government's commitment, already announced by the Taoiseach, to establishing a permanent commission on standards in public office.  This would have a wide ranging mandate to investigate allegations of misconduct in public office and by all elected representatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I recognise the difference between public office and elected representatives, but that is a matter for another day.  I am not sure if the Minister of State is the most senior person in both Houses or if any Members have longer service, but he has been through here and has seen it all.  I speak as an Independent, who tend to be seen as cleaner than clean which is nonsense.  Nobody is any different to anybody else in these Houses and I never try to milk that particular impression.  I ask the Minister of State to allow us to determine and set our own standards, police and implement those standards and take action where there have been transgressions.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that I speak as an Independent and of perhaps saying things which party politicians may not be able to say because people would say they were trying to cover up something. I have seen how the system works and we will rue the day if we hand this over to people other than the Members of the Houses.  It would be wrong, regressive and different to what is done by other professions.  I ask the Minister of State to bring that point to the attention of the Taoiseach, who perhaps might come to the House for a couple of hours to ask us our views on this matter and not only come here with a proposal.</P>
    <P>On the planning issue, part of the problem has been created by the fact we as public representatives have not been prominent enough not only in defending but in promoting and explaining the need for rezoning.  The country cannot develop as it is doing without a necessary building programme, including factories, houses, etc.  I make no judgments on the outcome of this inquiry, but I have lived in north Dublin since 1969.  Joan and I built our own house there in the early 1970s and I have been through the planning process.  I do not know how much better or worse it is there than in other counties because I do not have experience of them.  However, I had difficulty getting planning permission because I was building in a greenfield area.</P>
    <P>I regret the fact that people in the area whom I taught when I was a teacher have not been able remain living in the area &mdash; although they work only ten or 12 miles away &mdash; unless they were related to farmers who had land on which they could build.  The lack of planning and development in the area is destroying many small communities in areas like north county Dublin.  Proper planned development is needed in those areas.  Recently I read that Dublin has the widest spread of population of any city in Europe comparable in size.  That is an issue at which the planning people must look.  The reason is that planning permission has been denied except in cases where people put forward a strong case.  As a result, there has been a huge amount of ribbon development which is not the best type of development, particularly in areas close to a city.</P>
    <P>It is hugely important that public representatives use every opportunity to say that we need planning and rezoning.  I have said regularly that <Col N="734" /> whenever somebody tries to set up a small factory or whatever, those who object are the people who have been in the area for about a year and a half and who pulled every string and applied much pressure to get into the area.  As soon as they do, they take the selfish view that nobody else should live there.  This is part of our culture in that if somebody sticks a spade in the ground we all line up behind to object even before they turn the sod. That type of Luddite, regressive and backward looking attitude has been reinforced by the fact that we are less than forthcoming in putting forward the proposal that we need this type of development.</P>
    <P>I know many of the county councillors in my area of north County Dublin, the area under focus, and they are decent people who get much unfair criticism.  They do the job as well as they can.  I am not aware of any evidence of corruption, although I have heard the story like everyone else.  I hold in good regard the county councillors who have represented me for the past 30 years, from all parties and no party.  It is important that we say that.  I am not and will never be a county councillor.  Their job is thankless and those of us who do not depend on them for their votes should recognise what they do.</P>
    <P>I support the proposals before us today and the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach.  The Minister of State has considerable experience in public office and I ask him not to be shy in putting forward his views on how we regulate ourselves in political life.  It could be said that his party mentioned these issues over many years but it is not the only party with these concerns.  It is a matter on which we need to take a strong stand and about which we need to be straightforward.  We should clean up whatever needs to be cleaned up and ensure standards are maintained in the future.</P>

      <P>It is a measure of the Minister of State's liberalism that he is prepared to spend so much time with us.  We are beginning to suffer from legislation fatigue but that is not to diminish in any way the importance of this motion, which I support.  An important sentence in the Minister of State's address which bears repeating was that we should not pre-empt the workings of the tribunal on the matters before us.  It would be improper of us to use our privilege to pre-empt proceedings as we would be threading on dangerous ground.  That caution from the Minister of State is one we must take on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of those who operate the planning system, whether county councillors or officials in the planning departments in the various authorities, do so openly and honesty.  There <Col N="735" /> is nothing improper about people making representations for or against a planning application provided it is done in an open and honest way. In my constituency, a public representative made representations on behalf of those in favour of and those against a proposal.  That showed a marked degree of balance on the part of the public representative, whom I am reluctant to name.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>He is an accountant, so perhaps that tells us something.  The planning system should be open and transparent as is required. We must congratulate and thank Judge Flood for seeking to have his terms of reference expanded. I wish him well with the investigations which are ongoing and with those which will be pursued. The ultimate objective is to establish the truth. However, this is the difficulty.  Unfortunately, it appears the only way it can be done is through the institution of tribunals of this kind.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the commission on standards in public office.  I understand the proposals regarding this matter will be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, of which the Senator and I are members.  All these aspects will be considered there.</P>
      <P>While we impose regulations and rules here, the disciplinary aspect has been deficient.  I recall cases where matters giving rise to improprieties of a minor nature &mdash; for example, something having been said &mdash; come before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, which then makes a ruling. However, it appears to be very difficult to exercise a sanction.  Other than in the narrow cases defined by legislation, such as bankruptcy and the holding of a criminal conviction, as being reasons for disqualification, there does not appear to be proper disciplinary procedures.  The illogicality of this is reinforced by the fact that while it is possible to suspend Members for disorder in the House and have them excluded from one or several days' sittings in certain circumstances, if a misdemeanour is not picked up or is unrelated to something that took place in the House there does not appear to be such a disciplinary procedure.  This should be looked at when the matter comes before the committee and both Houses.</P>
      <P>There are examples where self regulation works well &mdash; for example, in the case of the Medical Council or the Bar Council.  It is possible for areas of public life to regulate themselves well and to do so openly and transparently.  It is the position of the Progressive Democrats to restore public confidence in democratic politics &mdash; I am sure that is the wish of other parties also &mdash; to ensure our democracy is strong, that people can have confidence in their public representatives and that the system can operate well, efficiently and openly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> It is also important that we proclaim the value of democratic politics.  It has deficiencies, which are underlined by these tribunals.  However, it is the best system we could have.  It is infinitely more preferable to any of the alternatives.  It is important that, as practising politicians, we say our work as part of a representative democracy is important and, by and large, well done.</P>
    <P>On the matter of rezoning I must declare an interest because I have had land rezoned by Kildare County Council.  However, there are large sums of money at stake and there is the potential for improprieties to occur in the context of the amounts involved.  Those who appear to be most opposed to the rezoning of land or to planning applications for housing estates are frequently those who also protest that house prices are too high.  There appears to be a basic inconsistency between those two positions.</P>
    <P>There is also the matter of &ldquo;not in my back yard&rdquo;.  Many people have come to live in north County Kildare in recent years.  They settle in very nice housing estates and their children go to local schools.  Yet, when somebody wants to join them in a neighbouring housing estate not yet built, they appear to regard it as something that should not happen.  They have reaped the benefits of being able to move into an area, but they want to deny it to others.  It does not seem to be a consistent position.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the Electoral Act, 1997, and the Ethics in Public Office Act. There is an increasing raft of legislation which regulates donations and public life.  The commission on standards in public office will be another element in that process and it is to be welcomed.  However, these matters will be for scrutiny on another day.  It would be improper for us to comment directly on any of the specific aspects which are dealt with by the motion and by the terms of reference of the tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it is legislative fatigue and the fact that we are on item 7 of our business today that has led to such a low attendance for this important debate.  Perhaps it is also fatigue for the subject because it must be at least the third time since the House convened last autumn that this issue has come before it in some related fashion, whether it has been legislation to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts, motions or whatever.  I suspect it will not be the last time, because even this morning the newspapers refer to new questions that have arisen with regard to payments made to former Deputy, Mr. Ray Burke, which are at the centre of this tribunal of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the motion is uncontested, it is unusual there is no facility for putting down an amendment. That was not the case in the past.  As it happens, the motion is very comprehensive and notable in that, for the first time, it mentions the former Deputy, Mr. Ray Burke, and the need to investigate any suspicion of corruption surrounding <Col N="737" /> payments made to him.  However, given its comprehensive scope, it is being supported.  If this kind of response had been available last autumn when the issue first arose we probably would not have debated it on three or more occasions.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and other Senators have referred to planning.  However, the tribunal is not really concerned with planning.  All these issues are about politics, corruption in politics, the cloud that hangs over political life, ethics in public office, standards in public life and that wide range of issues which have arisen with regard to these and other payments.</P>
    <P>A cloud has hung over the issue of planning, especially in Dublin where it has been a matter of rumour and speculation for a long number of years.  There was the beef tribunal and the Dunnes payments tribunal, which has not yet completed its work.  There are currently two tribunals of inquiry and other investigations.  While most Members of this and the other House find it very uncomfortable and while we all recognise it is not a good time to be in politics, we must recognise this is a process we must go through.  In many ways this is a very painful period in our democracy.  However, when we emerge at the other side I hope we will have learned very important lessons.</P>
    <P>The central lesson we must learn is the separation of public and private interests.  The Ethics in Public Office Act has that as its central tenet. The Act requires the registration of donations and interests so that members of the public are clear about the candidates for whom they vote. This is a basic element of European democracies which we, in Ireland, have only recently discovered. While I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to introduce more advanced legislation in this area, I hope he will receive the support of his colleagues and I hope there will be total recognition across all political parties and representatives of the need for legislative underpinning of the separation of public and private interests.</P>
    <P>I have reason to remember the discussion surrounding the Ethics in Public Office Act as I was working for the then Minister, former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, when the legislation was introduced. Accusations were made that the legislation went too far, interfered in people's private business and was unnecessary.  We now know it was entirely necessary and the current Taoiseach is planning to advance it.  I find it interesting that the quarters which so opposed the legislation at the time are now in favour of it.</P>
    <P>I distinctly recall the former Deputy for Laoighis-Offaly, Ger Connolly's, vociferous and strident opposition to the Bill which the democratic process rightly allowed him to express.  He saw the Bill as a totally unnecessary interference in people's private lives.  That showed a failure to realise that we have a public responsibility as public representatives and that it is important to state that responsibility, particularly in relation to <Col N="738" /> the maintenance of standards in public life.  It seems to me that until such time as that fact is taken on board and totally understood, we will not succeed in shifting the cloud currently hanging over political life.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the former Deputy Connolly has been replaced in Laoighis-Offaly by Deputy Fleming, former accountant and financial adviser to the Fianna Fáil Party.  I examined Deputy Fleming's contribution on this issue in the Dáil yesterday in detail and it raised more questions than it answered.  I wonder whether the trench the Deputy has started to dig, presumably to protect himself and blame the former Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey &mdash; the whipping boy for all Fianna Fáil's past sins &mdash; will ultimately lead to the current Taoiseach.  The sequence of events outlined by the Deputy is quite bizarre.  Deputy Fleming claims he first became aware of the payment to former Deputy Burke at a fundraising lunch in 1989.  When he received a cheque from Mr. Burke for only £10,000, he brought it to the attention of the party leader.  The following is an excerpt from Deputy Fleming's Dáil contribution:</P>
    <P>I was aware since the previous evening that Fitzwilton was to make a large contribution to the Fianna Fáil Party through Mr. Ray Burke. When he arrived we asked him for the cheque and he gave the envelope to Paul Kavanagh or myself.  On opening it we saw it contained a bank draft for £10,000 . I was not satisfied that £10,000 was the full amount of the contribution. Both of us asked Mr. Ray Burke where was the balance.  He told us that £10,000 was the amount that was being given to party headquarters and the rest would be used for his constituency purposes.</P>
    <P>Immediately after that Mr. Paul Kavanagh and I spoke to the then party leader, Mr. Charles Haughey, who was at the luncheon. We pointed out to him that we believed the party's national fundraising committee had been left short in respect of this donation.  Mr. Charles Haughey indicated that we should leave the matter with him.</P>
    <P>The fact the Deputy spoke to the then party leader shows this was obviously a matter of some consternation within the party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming went on to point out he was elected a Member of Dáil Éireann in June 1997. Prior to that, he was a candidate for election, one who had declared his interest in becoming a TD long before the election was called.  Deputy Fleming also outlined the sequence of events of last year.  The Deputy returned to Ireland from holiday before Mr. Burke made his statement to the Dáil on 10 September 1997.  Members will recall the country was awash with rumours about payments by Mr. Gogarty to Mr. Burke at the time which resulted in former Deputy Burke making his Dáil statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fleming stated he telephoned Mr. Burke directly around this time.  Mr. Burke was <Col N="739" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs at the time, a man whom we know to have been extraordinarily busy and absorbed with matters in Northern Ireland and foreign affairs generally.  However, Deputy Fleming managed to speak to him directly although he pointed out he did not discuss the matter with the Taoiseach.  Deputy Fleming also made the following extraordinary statement:</P>
    <P>In Fianna Fáil there is a longstanding practice and an unwritten rule that party officials and fundraisers do not discuss the details of individual donations with the party leader or other senior party members.</P>
    <P>That did not prevent Deputy Fleming discussing the matter with Mr. Haughey in 1989.  Only a few days after making a statement to the Dáil, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs resigned.  That was a major political scandal and I find it unbelievable that someone in Deputy Fleming's position did not speak to the Taoiseach about such an urgent issue.</P>
    <P>This motion, comprehensive and welcome as it is, would not have been necessary if the Government had not been dragged kicking and screaming into a realisation that in its response to this and other issues, it must be comprehensive, open and up-front.  I wish the Taoiseach well in regard to his proposals on the ethics commission.  If only we were at a position where the public had sufficient confidence in us to allow a situation where we could regulate our own affairs, we would not have to bring in what Senator O'Toole referred to as outsiders.  Any public offices commission would have to be chaired by a High Court judge in my opinion although I realise there are constitutional issues involved in regard to the separation of powers and so on.</P>
    <P>I want to use the swimming issue for the purposes of analogy.  Members of the public will not believe any report by the swimming fraternity itself into allegations of abuse.  We still do not have confidence in the IASA although we do have confidence in the Murphy report as it was an independent one.  All such investigations must be independent.  The current Ethics in Public Office Act is a fine piece of legislation and I hope the Taoiseach does not feel hounded by a public perception of corruption into producing something which may not be suitable or appropriate.  I am aware that major constitutional issues surround this matter.</P>
    <P>If we are to restore confidence in public office, we must set standards for the operation of public life and those standards must be firmly based on a recognition, first and foremost by Oireachtas Members, of the need for a separation between public and private interests.  We have gone beyond the stage where people can say everyone knows what they are like.  The cloud which hangs over us now affects everyone and questions everyone's integrity.  It is hard to take that on board because we know there are very few rotten <Col N="740" /> apples and the vast majority of us do our best to serve the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion to broaden the terms of reference of the tribunal.  I will not be slinging mud because at the end of the day public representatives are all tarred with the same brush.  Politicians have a poor reputation among the general public.  We make progress and then another scandal breaks and embarrasses us all. There are bad apples in every political party in the State &mdash; I could identify plenty here.</P>
      <P>I have fought many elections and I never received a penny from anyone.  The one contribution to me was made by my cumann after I had fought five elections in 18 months.  After the fifth election I did not even have the price of a tank of petrol for my car and my organisation gave me a few pounds.</P>
      <P>I have been a public representative for 20 years.  No one has put his name to as many section 4s as I have in County Kerry.  I was signing section 4s to divide an acre lot when a father was trying to give his son or daughter a half acre to build a house and they were ten feet short for the purposes of the County Planning Act.  It would take six years to change the county development programme. County development plans are more flexible now &mdash; an acre lot which is a few feet short for frontage will be overlooked and section 4s are unnecessary.</P>
      <P>Tribunals are the greatest disasters this State has ever seen.  They are an enormous drain on the taxpayer.  The money could have been put to better use building new roads, houses, sewerage schemes and rezoning land.  The people wearing the wigs love tribunals, they make millionaires of many of them.  I compliment the Taoiseach for putting together a commission to draw up a code of ethics for public life.  Every candidate will have to account for their election expenses whether or not they are elected.</P>
      <P>Perhaps there has not been enough land rezoned causing the price of housing to rise.  I was glad to hear Senator O'Toole saying that people are holding onto land.  This is an ideal opportunity for Dublin Corporation to rezone land and install the proper infrastructure thus reducing the price of houses.  That should be done throughout the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions to the debate on this motion.  As one of the longest serving Members of the House it gives me no joy to be here to discuss a matter of this nature.  It is sad that events have occurred which have led to the necessity to establish this kind of tribunal.  It is not for us to make any judgments about the matters which are being investigated. That is the purpose of the tribunal and the work is best left to the member of the Judiciary who <Col N="741" /> has been appointed by the Government to undertake that work.</P>
      <P>I wish to record my appreciation of the co-operation given by the Opposition parties in agreeing to the text of the amendments deemed necessary to the original terms of reference.  The text presents to the House the fruit of much co-operation between the Attorney General and his staff, and Judge Flood and his legal team.</P>
      <P>In working on the text for the extended remit of the tribunal, the Attorney General was given a clear indication that these payments which have been the subject of so much speculation and comment over recent weeks should be investigated in the fullest possible manner.  Not alone do the extended terms of reference cover matters which are already in the public domain but they also enable the tribunal to investigate any other payments or benefits received by Mr. Burke which may be brought to its attention.  It is difficult to see how we could have a more comprehensive inquiry under the provisions of the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts.  The Opposition parties have acknowledged this and, just like the original terms of reference of the Flood Tribunal, the amended terms of reference before the House enjoy cross-party support.  This strengthens the moral authority of the tribunal.</P>
      <P>Senator Avril Doyle said that this amendment could have been avoided had the Government agreed to widen the terms of reference in October.  The Government's concern at all times has been to ensure an effective tribunal.  One has to look at the terms of the 1921 Act under which these tribunals are established.  That Act allows for the establishment of a tribunal to inquire into definite matters of urgent public importance. Very wide terms of reference would risk being <i>ultra vires</i> of the 1921 Act and could be overturned subsequently by a court challenge.  The situation has changed now that information about another substantial payment to Mr. Burke has come into the public domain.  In the light of that it is entirely appropriate that the terms of reference be amended.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the proposal to establish a public offices commission.  I want to make it clear that intention is under consideration at Government level and no final decision on it has been made.  The proposed public offices commission would set the standards for politicians.  I agree it is a matter for politicians to set their own standards and lay down the ethics to which they expect Members to adhere.  It must be ensured that where those are transgressed there are adequate and proper procedures in place to follow up allegations of impropriety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that a permanent commission would have the status of the High Court and the powers of a tribunal of inquiry.  It will be empowered to investigate allegations against public office holders, elected representatives and officials.  The Government will be bringing these <Col N="742" /> proposals forward shortly and both Houses will be given an opportunity to debate them.  Senator O'Toole can then argue his case that these matters should only be subject to scrutiny by Members of the Houses themselves.  The Senator looked at me and said that because I was one of the longest serving Members I must have experience of how the House operates and that I should support that view.  My experience leads me to a different conclusion and I would not support that view.  I am well aware of what happens in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and other committees.  In many cases, sides are taken by Members based on political affiliations.  Having gone before some of those committees in a personal capacity as a Member of the House, no Member could be certain that matters would be adjudicated purely on the facts.  There is far too strong a political alignment in these committees.</P>
    <P>On the occasion I went before a committee, I felt that I was in a star chamber.  A Member of this House made an extreme statement about me for which he subsequently apologised to me. However, that was not much use after the statement had been made in committee.  Senator O'Toole appealed to my experience as to whom I think is best qualified to make an impartial decision.  One cannot go to a better source than the Judiciary in which the public has full confidence.</P>
    <P>The establishment of such a commission is not a reflection on the excellent work carried out on our behalf by tribunals.  However, it is clear that <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals are not the most efficient way of carrying out such investigations.  Given the workload of the Judiciary and the number of demands for tribunals, it would seem reasonable to have a permanent commission to which allegations could be referred and which would have the machinery and officials in place to ensure that matters were properly examined.</P>
    <P>There would also be significant delays if we continue with the present situation whereby tribunals have to be established.  It takes time to staff tribunals and get them up and running, so a permanent commission would seem reasonable in order the deal with the epidemic which has struck public life.  This has to be rooted out and the only way to do so is the determined and resolute manner in which the Government is tackling the matter.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators &mdash; except Senator O'Meara &mdash; who resisted the temptation to go into detail on matters which are the subject of the inquiry. Those involved are entitled to have their actions assessed by the tribunal.  It will fully investigate these matters and will give those involved the opportunity to put their side of the case in accordance with the principles of natural justice supported by most people.  The proper time for Members to comment is after the tribunal has reported its findings when the facts are available and when we can consider what follow up action is required.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="743" /> In particular I thank Mr. Justice Flood, who is acting in a true spirit of public service in undertaking these responsibilities.  He is acting as the sole member of the tribunal, which places great responsibilities on his shoulders.  On behalf of the Government and the House I thank him for his co-operation in agreeing to chair the tribunal.  He has done so in the public interest and is now taking on the extended remit which this House is giving him.  I wish him every success so that the true facts are established and we can get away <Col N="744" /> from false allegations and innuendo.  Where positive facts are established appropriate action will be taken.</P>
