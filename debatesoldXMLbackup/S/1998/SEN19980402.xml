      <P>I have notice from Senator Norris, that on the motion for the adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to make decisions speedily in order to facilitate the restoration of the former Garda station, Barlow House, Drogheda, County Louth, as an art centre.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Cosgrave of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide additional capital funding to Iarnród Éireann to extend the operating times of the DART service.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2.  Item 1 will be Order for Second Stage and Second Stage with 15 minute contributions from all speakers.  Item 2 will be taken at 2 p.m. also with 15 minute contributions from all speakers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I wish to raise two matters.  First, the reports of a car bomb found at Dún Laoghaire this morning are disquieting.  I congratulate the Garda on averting what might well have been a major and dastardly tragedy in Britain.  It brings home clearly that there are powerful enemies of the peace process at large and the strongest possible condemnation of what they are attempting to do should emanate from the House in addition to a commendation for the Garda in averting a potential tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, we should express our solidarity with those involved in the peace process at this crucial <Col N="1438" /> stage.  It is disturbing that new problems have arisen at this late stage, but, hopefully, that is part of what normally happens during negotiations. There will be a few other scares between now and the finalisation of the peace process.  Nonetheless, it is important that the solidarity of all sides in the House is seen to be behind the negotiators as they try to reach a final agreement over the next week or two.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader inform the House on next week's business?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo strongly what Senator Manning said.  We were pleased the Garda acted so quickly and efficiently and the congratulations of the House should be sent.  The Garda has an exemplary record in stopping such activity over the past few weeks and it is to be commended.  It is a great pity there are traitors in this country. They are enemies not just of the peace process but of the people.  Is there a method of charging them with treason because that is what they are about?</P>
      <P>However, I strongly support the efforts made by the Taoiseach.  He is an excellent negotiator and I wish him well.  I note with pleasurable amusement that one of his assistants is Mrs. Elizabeth Carson and hope this is an omen that will make her recommended to the Northern parties in the talks.</P>
      <P>The Leader has indicated that he will look favourably at a detailed debate on the Luas project, which is covered under item 19 on the Order Paper.  Perhaps the debate will be scheduled for the beginning of the next session.  I raise this issue because of a report in <i>Business and Finance</i> which indicates that the Public Transport in Dublin report for 1999 was suppressed because it recommended the exploration of an underground.  The same consultants were involved in the Dublin Transport Initiative and yet there was no consideration of the report.  This caused a delay which may lose funding from the EU for a transport project.  This is a major scandal and I hope this matter will be investigated.  I wish the Minister every success in implementing the report and conclusions of the Atkins report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, compliment the Garda on their success yesterday in dealing with the car bomb found in Dún Laoghaire.  I also congratulate them on their success over the past few months as we come closer to a peace deal where splinter terrorist groups are determined to prevent it.  The Garda have been doing a tremendous job on this side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the summit between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister, held in London yesterday, did not produce a successful outcome on the crucial North-South institutions. I encourage every effort that will be made, particularly for the next week.  Mr. Mitchell has stated that is the deadline for an agreement.  I also encourage the spirit of compromise and generosity <Col N="1439" /> on all sides because there cannot be a solution unless there is a degree of compromise.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I raised the issue of a freefone being advertised by the NIB.  I thought it might have been an April fool's day joke about the activities of the NIB.  Thankfully, the advertisement is in today's newspapers.  Will the Leader facilitate a debate on the entire banking system?  The system seems to be worsening on a daily basis.  The authorised investigating officer has uncovered £50 million stashed away in offshore accounts in the insurance area and that far more insurance companies have been involved in this scam than hitherto expected.  Eighty per cent of those cases are breaches of the Insurance Act 1989.  We need to have a wideranging debate on the entire banking system, their ethics and how it operates.  We should also look at the supervisory role performed by the Central Bank and other bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I was relieved to hear the Garda had discovered a car bomb at Dún Laoghaire port.  I commend the Garda and the security forces on their diligent work.  It is apparent that there are evil and malicious people determined to wreck the peace process and put the North back on the road to chaos and destruction.  These people must be condemned.  Everyone involved in the peace talks are trying hard to keep it on track.  Senator Norris correctly pointed out that their actions are traitorous.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning's comments on the peace talks.  There will be a few hiccups along the way but that is to be expected.  We now need steady nerves so that we are not deflected by the people who wish to wreck the peace process.  I also commend Mr. Mitchell on his role in trying the move the peace process forward.</P>
      <P>On a lighter note, I mentioned several weeks ago that the Ireland and England rugby match in Twickenham on Saturday next would not be broadcast live by RTÉ.  It would only be broadcast after it was shown on Sky because the English Rugby Union have sold the rights to the match to that station.  The Irish Rugby Union have also benefited financially from this set up but the general public have not.  Yesterday in the Dáil, the Taoiseach addressed this issue and intends to ensure that in the future the Irish public will be able to view major national sporting events on a non-payment basis on our own domestic channels.  I welcome this proposal.  I had asked for a debate on broadcasting in that context. Perhaps it might still be appropriate to have such a debate.</P>
      <P>Will the Cathaoirleach contact the RTÉ authorities to find out if it is part of a national strategy to cure insomnia that <i>Oireachtas Report</i> is broadcast at 3 a.m.?  Even the most ardent political junkies will not stay up until 3 a.m. to watch the programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if Senator Norris was on it, I doubt even those people would stay up until 3 a.m. I commend RTÉ if it is part of a global strategy to cure the nation's insomnia, but I wonder at the relevance of broadcasting the programme at 3 a.m.</P>

      <P>As is customary, I have allowed considerable latitude to the leaders of the various political groups.  Regrettably, I cannot give the same latitude to the remaining Senators who wish to speak on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Garda.  As a result, public confidence in them is growing daily.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to negotiate with the Garda representative organisations in relation to pay increases.  It is very easy to praise their work but paying them should not be a problem.  I ask the Leader to convey to the Minister my concerns about the delay in awarding the Garda their justifiable pay deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the European Monetary Union in view of a recent ESRI report.  It stated the likely effects of joining the European Monetary Union, the possible jobs that may be affected, particularly those in the banking sector, and the concerns expressed by industrialists, importers and exporters.  There is a great deal of confusion among the general public as to whether joining it is the best option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the commendations for the Garda in dealing with the car bomb.  I also call for a satisfactory pay deal for them.</P>
      <P>I raised the matter of amending regulations for temporary licences for small public service vehicles.  Yesterday, this matter was raised in the Dáil.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to attend this House so he can inform us when he intends to bring forward amending legislation for small public service vehicles.  The current regulations are inflicting great hardship on the small operator.  I ask the Leader to do this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader have the mental hospital inspectors' report for 1996 published? Can we also have a debate on it and the other published reports after Easter?  There is a considerable amount of concern in many quarters regarding the situation in the Central Mental Hospital, where there is a tremendous shortage of space.  There is also concern about the other mental hospitals where there appears to be a lack of co-ordination with the community psychiatric services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello.  Yesterday, the Minister for Finance was in the Dáil. He should inform this House what the current situation <Col N="1441" /> is regarding the banking system and Dr. O'Connell of the Central Bank.  The impression abroad is that not only NIB has a problem, but all the banks; I know the Consumer Protection Society was in some branches yesterday.  Are the TSB, ICC and ACC in the same boat?  It would be serious if this House were not informed of the true position.  We are not getting the same commitment from the Ministers as did the other House.  This is a serious matter.  I ask that this House be informed urgently &mdash; today if possible but if not, then Tuesday or Wednesday of next week.  Why would the Minister not come before the House last Tuesday?  Dr. O'Connell of the Central Bank gave the impression that there is no problem with the other banks but we all know that is not true.  Senator Costello made a good point, and I support him.  This is not a nice issue for the public.  We can talk about money which is being salted away in offshore accounts and the account holders not paying tax but these are customers who can barely afford to pay their taxes and who are taxed doubly by the banks.  I would appreciate it if something could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in paying tribute to the Taoiseach for his work for peace.  I sincerely hope he and Prime Minister Blair are successful because if they are not, it will be a win for the hard men and I hate to think what will happen if the peace process is a failure.  I appeal to the media to play a more positive role than they have to date.</P>
      <P>I too call for a full debate on the banking system. It appears no other bank is doing anything wrong.  I do not think the NIB is as big and bad as is supposed but, unfortunately, it is the bank which was caught.  We should examine all the agencies and look at the profits made by banks, insurance companies and building societies.  It is immoral.  An entire day should be given to a debate on banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>When will we have the necessary order under the Sale of Goods Act regarding the sale of insurance products and the provision for disclosure and other costs to the customer?  The Minister has already intimated in a speech outside this House that he is leaning in this direction; this is in line with our motion.</P>
      <P>I would welcome a debate on the banking system but, in my opinion, the Governor of the Central Bank answered truthfully and comprehensively yesterday.  As he pointed out, he must operate within the law.  His role is primarily prudential. Many of the matters being raised here should be dealt with by the Director of Consumer Affairs.  In line with the Fine Gael motion in the other House, it is my opinion that we need to give more legal powers to the Central Bank.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Members in calling for a comprehensive debate on the banking system.  The last time there was such a debate was in 1992.  At that time we received an information pack from the Irish Banks Standing Committee <Col N="1442" /> and, as a result, I found out that AIB was overcharging me by 3 per cent.  The bank claimed this was a mistake by a branch official.  If we had not debated that issue in 1992 I would not have found that out because nobody would have told me about it.  The NIB is not alone in overcharging and trying to blame someone down the line instead of blaming the system.</P>
      <P>I also ask for an early debate on overseas development co-operation and aid.  A huge amount of money is being collected for overseas development and there has been no debate on the efficacy of where that money goes or the role of the NGOs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Government and co-operation between them.  A group from Trócaire attended at the Subcommittee on Development Co-operation which has collected £164 million over the past 25 years and it hopes to collect £4 million from its Lenten campaign which is money well spent throughout the world.  Irish people work extremely hard on our behalf in the most difficult and dangerous places to make sure the people of the Third World get sustenance and are not just left behind our economically successful society.  I congratulate Trócaire on the fantastic work it has done over the last 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who has called constantly for a debate on banking, I support Senator Cregan's call for the Minister for Finance to make a statement to assure the House and the people that what happened in National Irish Bank is not happening in State banks.  The Governor of the Central Bank, Dr. Maurice O'Connell, stated he had no evidence to suggest that the practices in the National Irish Bank were being carried out in any other banks.  We are responsible to the nation for the State banks and the Minister for Finance is duty bound to come into the House to allay any fears the public have in regard to State banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept fully there is a need for a debate on the banking system, nevertheless, we should be careful not to do or say anything that would undermine public confidence in it because, if that were to happen, it would have a disastrous effect on the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senators Norris, Costello, Dardis, Ridge and Manning in congratulating the Garda on its great work this morning in discovering the evil deeds being planned by people to wreck the peace process and offer our support to the Taoiseach and his negotiating team.  I also wish to be associated with the good wishes to the chairman of the talks, Senator George Mitchell.</P>
      <P>Senators Burke, Norris, Cregan, Coghlan, Costello, Farrell and Dardis called for an urgent debate on the banking system and for the Minister for Finance to make a statement.  I discussed this with him yesterday and he will be only too pleased to come in during the first week after the Easter recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1443" /> I also discussed at length with him the points raised by Senators concerning the year 2000 bug. He intends to spend time here on a specific day to hear the views of all Senators.  He is also coming in for a full day's debate on the implications of European Monetary Union on Tuesday, as requested by Senators Manning and Coogan. Since the three items cannot be taken together as they are all important, the Minister is coming to the Seanad on three different days.  On Wednesday we will debate the Local Government and Planning Bill, 1997, Second Stage.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis called for an urgent debate on broadcasting.  I assured the House last week that I will make time available for this at the earliest opportunity.  I agree that showing Oireachtas Report at 3 a.m. is ridiculous.  Whoever is responsible in RTÉ will have to be told that if they do not broadcast it at a reasonable time, we will have to regulate the matter ourselves.  We only ever asked for fair play.  This is not fair play and I intend to take the matter up with the broadcasting committee.  I will ask its chairman to convene a meeting urgently to discuss a number of problems in relation to RTÉ's respect for the Houses of the Oireachtas and the broadcasting of proceedings.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis congratulated the Taoiseach on his stance on the issue of major sporting events, which he said should be available to everybody, irrespective of whether they are well off.  I agree with him and I wish to be associated with the Deputy Leader's remarks.  It is the view of all Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas that this should be the case and the Taoiseach has the support of all sides on this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn asked me to contact the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and relay his concerns about small public service vehicles.  I will do that for the Senator.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry raised the 1996 inspector's report on mental institutions.  I am endeavouring to deal with this matter.  I spoke to the Minister for Health and Children and he has agreed to come to the House as soon as the report is published.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan congratulated Trócaire on 25 years of hard work.  I wish to be associated with those well deserved congratulations.  The Senator asked for a debate on overseas development aid. I will make time available for a discussion on this subject after the Easter recess.</P>

Another discussion would be timely in terms of updating Members on changes made to the plans and what progress has been made in the meantime.</P>

    <P>Bill entitled an Act to consolidate the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993, to give the force of law to the Convention signed at Brussels on the 29th day of November, 1996 on the Accession of the Republic of Austria, the Republic of Finland and the Kingdom of Sweden to the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters and to the Protocol on its interpretation by the Court of Justice of the European Communities with the adjustments made to them by the Convention on the Accession of the Kingdom of Denmark, of Ireland and of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, by the Convention on the Accession of the Hellenic Republic and by the Convention on the Accession of the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic and to provide for related matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Bill, 1998, has two main objectives. First, it will enable Ireland to ratify the Accession Convention of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the 1968 Convention on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and to the associated Protocol on the interpretation of that Convention by the European Court of Justice.  Second, it will consolidate the provisions of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993. In the course of that consolidation, the opportunity is being taken to make minor procedural adjustments to the legislation.  Otherwise, the legislative machinery which has been in force since 1988 is being retained. <Col N="1445" /> While the extent of the Schedules to the Bill might suggest otherwise, the concept underlying the 1968 Judgments Convention is very simple.  It is the provision of speedy and informal procedures for enabling judgments in one member state to be recognised and enforced in each of the other member states.  The Lugano Convention, which is also the subject of this consolidating legislation, parallels the 1968 Convention and fulfils the same purpose in relation to the enforcement of judgments between EU member states and three states which are members of the European Free Trade Association &mdash; Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.  The fundamental principle underlying both conventions is the creation of a common body of rules which govern the jurisdiction of the courts in a broad range of civil and commercial matters both in EU member states and members of the European Free Trade Association.  This common body of rules is accompanied by a system whereby the relevant judgments in such civil and commercial matters are, by and large, subject to almost automatic enforcement.</P>
      <P>The 1968 Convention was drawn up pursuant to an obligation under Article 220 of the EEC Treaty for member states to enter into negotiations with each other to simplify the formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals.  Its effect was limited to civil and commercial matters and it entered into force between the six original member states on 1 February, 1973.  Subsequently, a separate Protocol on interpretation of the Convention by the European Court of Justice was drawn up and this entered into force in 1975.  Accession to the convention and its Protocol is a requirement of membership and, in consequence, a series of accession conventions has resulted in minor modifications of those original instruments as new member states have joined the Union.  In 1978, there was the Accession Convention for Ireland, Denmark and the UK.  In 1982, there was such a convention for Greece.  In 1989, there was one for Spain and Portugal and most recently there was the 1996 Accession Convention for Austria, Finland and Sweden.  The intention is that this convention will be ratified by the State as soon as is practicable, following the passage of this legislation.</P>
      <P>The text of the 1968 Convention as amended by the 1978, 1982, 1989 and 1996 Accession Conventions is now in the form of a consolidated text which was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 26 January, 1998. Although the 1968 Convention has been in force in the State for ten years, it is a somewhat technical measure which may be more familiar to the legal practitioner than anyone else.  Therefore, it is worth setting out some of the main features of the convention, as amended by the subsequent Accession Conventions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its main object is to simplify legal formalities in the civil and commercial areas.  The scope of the convention is set out in Article 1.  That Article <Col N="1446" /> provides that it is to apply to civil and commercial matters, but not to judgments concerning the status or legal capacity of natural persons, matrimonial property, wills, succession, bankruptcy, arbitration, social security, revenue, customs or administrative matters.  The convention does not cover criminal matters.  Also, certain matters relating to status &mdash; for example divorce &mdash; are excluded from the scope of this convention. However, in this context I wish to mention that at EU level, negotiations on a draft Convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters are close to finalisation.  When finalised, this measure will, in broad terms, extend the principles of the 1968 Convention to encompass the recognition of divorces, judicial separations and annulments on an EU-wide basis.</P>
    <P>The jurisdictional rules of the convention are set out in Title II, in particular Articles 2 to 18 therein.  As to the grounds on which jurisdiction may be assumed under the Convention, the main ground, set out in Article 2, is that a person domiciled in a contracting state is sued in the courts of that state.  In this connection, I point out that the meaning of &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; under the conventions is roughly equivalent to ordinary residence.  The term does not have the more particularised meaning which generally applies under Irish law. Within the Bill, provisions relating to domicile are contained in section 15 and in the Ninth Schedule.</P>
    <P>There are a limited number of grounds on which recognition and enforcement of a judgment can be refused.  The main grounds for refusal to recognise a judgment are where it would be contrary to public policy to do so or where the defendant was not made aware of the proceedings against him or her.</P>
    <P>Special provision is made for individual litigants in areas such as insurance and consumer contracts and also in matters relating to maintenance. In these areas the plaintiff is the acknowledged weaker party and so he or she may commence proceedings in the country where he or she is domiciled.  That is an exception to the general principle that proceedings must be instituted in the country where the defendant is domiciled. Other exceptions of this kind occur in matters relating to a contract &mdash; where a person may be sued in the courts for the place of performance of the obligation in question &mdash; and in tort cases, where a person may be sued in the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate fact of modern living that ever-increasing travel and mobility can bring more and more pressures on family life and can, where marriages have broken down, see individual family members living in different countries. In this regard the enforcement of foreign maintenance judgments will strike most people as being of particular importance.</P>
    <P>The passing into law of the Judgments Acts, which we are now consolidating, meant that Irish maintenance orders could be recognised and <Col N="1447" /> enforced in all EU and EFTA countries which were parties to the 1968 and Lugano Conventions. However, while the simplified enforcement mechanisms were available to the maintenance creditor, he or she had to travel to or engage a lawyer in the country concerned in order to secure enforcement of the maintenance judgment.  Under the Maintenance Act, 1994, a central authority now functions which is concerned with the recovery of maintenance and acts on behalf of maintenance creditors who wish to have a maintenance order enforced where the maintenance debtor is living in another country.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the 1994 Act mean that it is no longer necessary for Irish maintenance creditors to initiate enforcement proceedings themselves in the relevant member states.  Instead, they simply apply to the central authority for assistance in having their maintenance order recognised and enforced.  The central authority deals with incoming and outgoing applications, assists with documentation, locating the whereabouts of debtors and aims to ensure that moneys due are duly paid over.</P>
    <P>There is a small procedural change introduced in the Bill that is relevant to the area of maintenance. This change in procedure relates to applications for the enforcement of authentic instruments and settlements.  Instruments are a feature of the law in some Scandinavian and continental jurisdictions and usually provide for the enforcement of financial obligations without the need to have recourse to the courts.  Settlements are a feature of Dutch and German law.  They are approved by a court and are enforceable without further formality.  At present applications for the enforcement of such instruments and settlements must go to the High Court.  However, to simplify matters, I am providing in the Bill for the applications for enforcement of such instruments and settlements to be directed to the Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Another matter of note in relation to maintenance is that the 1996 Accession Convention inserts a new article &mdash; Article 5(e) &mdash; into the Protocol to the 1968 Convention, providing that arrangements relating to maintenance obligations concluded with administrative authorities or authenticated by them shall be regarded as authentic instruments under the 1968 Convention. Under the Bill, these maintenance arrangements may also be enforced via the office of the Master of the High Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill re-enacts the existing provisions of the Judgments Acts, 1988 to 1993, as adjusted to incorporate the Accession Convention for Austria, Finland and Sweden.  For convenience of reference, there are set out in Schedules to the Bill the new consolidated text of the 1968 Convention and the 1971 Protocol in both the English and Irish languages.  Also set out are the key provisions of the four Accession Conventions and the text of the Lugano Convention and its Protocol.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> Section 1 is a standard provision in legislation of this nature and it provides that the Bill will be brought into operation on a date or dates to be fixed by order and that different parts may be brought in at different times.  In respect of the 1996 Accession Convention, which involves Austria, Finland and Sweden, it will be necessary for one of those three countries to have deposited its instrument of ratification before that Convention can enter into force.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill is concerned with the 1968 Convention and the subsequent Accession Conventions. Under section 5 these conventions are to have the force of law in the State.  Thus, the courts are considered to know of their provisions without the requirement to have them proven in evidence.  There is also an identical provision in respect of the Lugano Convention in section 18 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Protocol gave jurisdiction to the Court of Justice of the European Communities to interpret the 1968 Convention and to give rulings thereon.  Section 6 provides that, arising from that jurisdiction, judicial notice shall be taken of the rulings and opinions of the European Court of Justice on the conventions.  The section also provides that judicial notice shall be taken of the Explanatory Reports on the Accession Conventions. The report in respect of the recent accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden is not yet available, but I would hope that it will be possible to bring forward a suitable amendment to the Bill should the report become available in the near future.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides that applications for the enforcement of judgments are to be made to the Master of the High Court.  To facilitate speedy enforcement procedures, the Bill extends the definition of judgments, where appropriate, to include authentic instruments and settlements and arrangements relating to maintenance obligations, which are common in continental jurisdictions, so that these measures too can be enforced via the office of the Master of the High Court rather than via the High Court itself which is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deems convention judgments in respect of which an enforcement order has been made to be of the same force and effect as a judgment of the High Court.  However, the overwhelming majority of maintenance orders will fall to be enforced by the District Court under section 9.  This allows the maintenance creditor to avail of the administrative machinery for the enforcement of maintenance orders which is well established at District Court level.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for the payment of interest on judgments and for the payment of costs. Section 11 provides, where the need arises, for fixing the currency and rate of exchange which should apply in the case of enforceable maintenance orders.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 the High Court is empowered to grant any provisional, including protective, measures which are normally available to it even <Col N="1449" /> if the substantive matter of the case falls to be heard by the courts of another state which is a contracting party to the 1968 Convention.  The measure most likely to be applied for would be an injunction to restrain a defendant transferring assets out of this jurisdiction so as to defeat any future judgment that might be given against him or her.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill makes the relevant provisions of this legislation applicable to the Lugano Convention, which governs enforcement of judgments between EU and EFTA member states.  As I mentioned, the Lugano Convention mirrors the provisions of the Judgments Convention. It is possible for a state which is not yet a member of the EU or EFTA to accede to the Lugano Convention provided it is sponsored by a State which is such a member.  Such accession requires the unanimous agreement of all the contracting parties.  It is likely that Poland will be acceding to the Lugano Convention on the basis of these arrangements in the near future.  Furthermore, as additional countries apply for membership of the EU, I would expect that accessions of this nature will become more commonplace.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill makes certain amendments to the Maintenance Act, 1994, which are necessitated by this Bill and repeals the Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993.</P>
    <P>Although this is a technical Bill, its effects have day to day significance for many people.  As a consolidating measure it will be of benefit in simplifying this somewhat complex area of the law, both for the practitioner and anyone else who has reason to use this legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a multi-billion pounds trading and commercial relationship with our EU partners and the EFTA countries.  This country must be part of an international legal system which ensures that court judgments in civil and commercial law matters &mdash; including contracts, exchange of funds, delivery of goods, etc. &mdash; made in one member state are recognised and enforceable in a uniform way in another member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome of 1957 required the contracting states to simplify the laws governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments by courts and tribunals in the civil and commercial law areas.  The Community was slow to simplify the recognition and enforcement of judgments; it was not until the Brussels Convention of 1968 &mdash; ten years after the original Community of six member states was formed &mdash; that the first legal framework was put into place.  However, even after the Brussels Convention the harmonisation of the law in this area has remained slow, both in its making and in its usage by the people whom it could affect.  This is the case despite the huge growth in trade between member states which gave rise to much litigation on contract default, <Col N="1450" /> employment disputes and other commercial matters.</P>
    <P>There were some spectacular commercial scams in this period.  The Cathaoirleach will know that in 1981, in my own county of Roscommon, a businessman collapsed his meat business and left for Spain with about £2.5 million owed to small farmers for livestock they delivered to his premises for slaughter.  This individual was disgracefully allowed to slip out of Ireland and live in luxury on his ill-gotten gains.  Spain was not at that time a member of what was then called the EEC and there was no reciprocal arrangement which would have made a civil or criminal judgment against the businessman in an Irish court recognised or enforceable against him there.  Spain has built itself a reputation as a haven for people escaping maintenance orders, fraud charges or business collapses in other countries.</P>
    <P>There were other spectacular scams during the 1980s involving investments by ordinary people. The chief culprits were able to escape to Spain or elsewhere but any civil or criminal judgments against them were not enforceable abroad.  In that light the principle of this legislation is welcome because it is important that we keep developing in that direction.  Spain and Portugal became part of the mutual legal arrangements with the San Sebastian Convention of 1989 and we legislated for their inclusion in those mutual arrangements in 1993 but, alas, that was too late for the victims of the fraudsters for whom Spain in particular had provided a safe haven.</P>
    <P>I have not had time to read the 23 sections and nine Schedules in the Bill as published.  Perhaps in her reply the Minister could elaborate on the measures which strengthen employees' contractual rights.  I am interested in this because it was mentioned in the 1993 legislation.  For example, a young Irish person may enter a work contract in Germany but find that it is varied or changed against his or her interest, causing serious loss or damage.  Are there improved and enforceable legal procedures in this Bill by which such a person can easily seek compensation or redress and, if such redress is sought in an Irish court, can it be enforced in the country where the dispute arose? Presumably the Bill broadens the scope of the convention which we discussed in 1993.  Can the Minister tell us what is new in the Bill?  What does the convention provide as regards the enforcement in Ireland of a libel award in Austria, or <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
    <P>I was delighted to hear the Minister's remarks about maintenance awards.  In 1993 I was in the other House during the discussions on the legislation providing for enforcement in Spain and Portugal.  The enforcement of maintenance awards covered a large part of that discussion, and rightly so, because many husbands who had deserted their wives had fled to Spain and were known as the &ldquo;Marbella Set&rdquo;.  The 1993 Act contained improvements and the former Minister, Mr. Taylor, introduced a judgments Act in 1994 but I still receive complaints about the difficulty <Col N="1451" /> of enforcing or varying maintenance orders &mdash; for instance, the circumstance of the ex-spouse living abroad has improved and the spouse living in Ireland may seek to have the other's improvement in income reflected in the maintenance payments. Does this Bill improve matters further?</P>
    <P>There are now 21 countries contracting to the convention.  What kind of cases in civil or commercial law cannot be taken for judgment and on what grounds can the recognition or enforcement of judgments be refused?  The Minister made a general statement on that point but perhaps she could give specific examples of cases which cannot be taken or where recognition of a judgment can be refused.</P>
    <P>How many Irish judgments have been enforced abroad since 1993?  Conversely, how many foreign judgments of the kind provided for in this legislation have been enforced here in that period? It would be interesting to know the take up rate.  Many people complained in the past of the great travelling distances involved in pursuing judgments in Spain or Scandinavia and the different legal systems to be tackled.  Some were overwhelmed and did not exercise their legal rights. The conventions of 1988 and 1993 have been ratified by the Houses and we now seek to ratify the 1998 convention, so there must have been an increase in the flow of judgments in both directions. Perhaps the Minister could supply the figures.</P>
    <P>These measures only apply to our EU partners and the EFTA countries, with whom we have 80 per cent of our trade, tourism and general exchange of business.  We should strive to have similar arrangements with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.  We do a lot of trade with these states, they are democratic countries with fully developed legal systems and mutual arrangements with them, such as those provided for in this Bill, are possible and feasible. It would be easy to mesh with them.</P>
    <P>While probably no more than 10 per cent of our trade is outside the EU and EFTA it is substantial. We trade and exchange with several countries where the rule of law and the quality of democracy is hardly as good as it is here.  For example, our ill fated meat trade with Iraq necessitated an insurance scheme funded by the taxpayer to protect the interest of exporters &mdash; perhaps only one exporter was involved &mdash; against the default of payments by Iraq.  It would be virtually impossible to have mutual legal agreements with countries such as Iraq which are not democracies and do not have developed legal systems.</P>
    <P>The establishment of legal frameworks and measures of this kind, by which judgments made in one country are enforceable in another, are very important especially with regard to trade. There has been a massive expansion in world trade in recent years.  The GATT has been broadened and negotiations for another round are due to commence.  In the history of world trade, barriers <Col N="1452" /> have broken down and trade has expanded. There is, therefore, a necessity to construct a legal framework to protect trade from default, breach of contract, etc., which is mutually enforceable across borders.  It is important that this country take a lead in this area.  It is also important that we have a simple, coherent legal formulation, with the maximum co-operation between the judicial and court systems of all countries with which we trade to ensure that these measures work smoothly.</P>
    <P>It is two years since Austria, Sweden and Finland joined the EU.  I am mystified why it has taken this length to bring the ratification of the convention before these Houses.  I am sure there are good reasons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  My party has no difficulty with it.  I urge the Minister to work along these lines for greater co-operation and to put in place a better and ever improving legal system and framework by which we can resolve problems surrounding maintenance orders and other areas. While the law may look good on the Statute Book difficulties arise in court.  We should learn from difficulties and problems that have arisen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I am pleased that this is the eighth Bill from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be initiated in this House since last September. It is an indication of the high esteem in which the House is rightly held.  Other Ministers and Departments should consider this kind of approach.  It would give greater significance to Seanad Éireann and would be welcomed by all Members.</P>
      <P>In essence, there is nothing new in this Bill.  It has two main functions.  First, it will enable the State to ratify the convention on the accession of Austria, Finland and Sweden.  Senator Connor wondered why it has taken so long to do this.  To date, only one EU country has ratified; we will probably be the second.  The second main function is to consolidate the provisions of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993.  This is one of the reasons the Bill contains 23 sections and several Scheudles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill deals with contractual matters, matters of tort, maintenance orders and other civil matters outside the criminal law jurisdiction.  Under the judgments conventions, jurisdiction rules are prescribed which determine which court in each member state is competent to rule on an action. The basic rule is that a defendant is to be sued in their country of domicile which, in this context, equates broadly with ordinary residence. However, in certain cases a person can take proceedings in his or her own country against a person domiciled in another contracting state instead of having to sue that person in the country in which they reside.  This is to be welcomed because the previous provisions created huge difficulties for all practitioners.  It will apply in areas such as maintenance where people may commence proceedings <Col N="1453" /> in their own country against maintenance givers who live outside the country.  Consumer proceedings also benefit.</P>
    <P>I have encountered examples of this kind in my area.  For example, Mr. X, a deep sea diver who works on rigs in Saudi Arabia or off the coast of Scotland or Italy, moves to Europe after he and his wife separate.  Previously, his spouse would have had severe difficulty in locating him.  Furthermore, if the court granted a maintenance order of £100 per week for her and her three children it would have been virtually impossible to have it enforced.  While the 1994 Act introduced a new system in this regard, the enforcement of simple things, such as maintenance orders against a husband who decided to lose himself abroad, was virtually impossible.  It was necessary, for example, to apply to the courts for permission to serve documents outside the jurisdiction, which made it frustrating and probably financially disadvantageous. Most applicants for these orders were probably left high and dry and unable to afford to employ the services of lawyers in other countries, never mind in this country.</P>
    <P>If somebody came to my office ten years ago for advice on commercial and civil matters of this kind I would have cautioned against proceeding unless the client had money to latch on to the defendant in another jurisdiction.  In view of this, the consolidation of the law in this area is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The convention also provides for speedy and informal procedures to enable the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial, but not criminal, matters as between Ireland and other EU member states and states which are members of EFTA.  All EU member states are parties to the original convention, accession to which is a condition of EU membership.</P>
    <P>When enacted, the Bill will enable the State to ratify the convention dealing with the accession of Austria, Sweden and Finland, the 1996 accession convention to the 1968 convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and to the associated Protocol on the interpretation of that convention by the European Court of Justice.  The 1996 accession convention is not yet in force because it must be ratified by Austria, Finland or Sweden before it can come into effect.  To date, it has been ratified by only one country, the Netherlands. Following the passing of this Bill it will be our intention to be one of the first group of countries in the EU to ratify it.</P>
    <P>The Bill also consolidates and makes minor amendments to the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993. Consolidation was desirable because, at present, relevant provisions are to be found in several pieces of legislation &mdash; the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993, and the Maintenance Act, 1994.  In this regard, I am encouraged by Senator Connor's remarks that his party largely supports this consolidating <Col N="1454" /> legislation which also recognises the accession of three new countries.</P>
    <P>Apart from the adjustments to the legislation as a result of the 1996 Accession Convention, the only change is a procedural one which relates to certain specialised applications for the enforcement of authentic instruments and court settlements. These are relatively new to Irish law although, as the Minister stated, they are quite common in countries such as the Netherlands. The Bill provides that such applications will be made to the Master of the High Court rather than to the High Court itself, which is the case at present.  This is a very practical and sensible provision because the High Court lists are extremely clogged up, even for <i>ex parte</i> applications, but the Master of the High Court could give a decision on an application within a month or six weeks.</P>
    <P>The development of legislation which provides for similar procedures in civil matters throughout the EU and EFTA states should be encouraged. Most of the 50 lives lost in the Betelgeuse disaster off Whiddy Island in 1979 were French.  The vessel's owners were of different nationalities and it took a tribunal and several years of litigation and wrangling before settlements could be enforced. Fortunately, for those who were injured or suffered, the tanker was owned by a commercially viable and reputable company and the awards were eventually enforced.  However, there have been severe difficulties in civil and commercial matters concerning tort, contract, maintenance orders etc.</P>
    <P>I compliment the central authority, which was set up under the Maintenance Act, 1994, on its work.  If one obtains a maintenance summons against a person living in another country the central authority will assist in processing the application. This is a very important and simplified way of doing business.  Not only will the central authority assist in the enforcement of an order made by an Irish court, it will also, conversely, assist in the enforcement here of an order made in a foreign court.  This central authority is doing excellent work on behalf of people who have maintenance orders made in their favour but cannot afford the time, frustration and cost of litigation. It has filled a huge vacuum which existed for decades.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely technical but, as the Minister said, is basically consolidating existing provisions. I commend the Bill to the House.  Its implementation will assist in the smooth operation throughout the EU of contractual and commercial matters, such as maintenance orders and the law of tort.  For example, if an accident occurs in another EU state, where does one issue proceedings and who does one sue at present?  If the person complained against resides elsewhere does he have to be pursued through the EU?  Once this measure is ratified we will have a simplified and practical workable law throughout the EU.  I thank the Minister for initiating the Bill in this House and for recognising the important legislative role of the Seanad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party also supports the Bill, which ratifies the Accession Convention of Austria, Finland and Sweden to the 1968 Convention, and also consolidates the provisions of the Jurisdiction of Courts and Enforcement of Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993.  My erstwhile colleague, the former Minister for Equality and Law Reform, initiated this legislation and I am glad the Government has taken up his suggestions in this regard.  It follows on from the 1988 Act which allowed for the enforcement of judgments throughout the European Union, as it then stood, and the 1993 Act which was also introduced by Mr. Mervyn Taylor and which extended this to Spain, Portugal and the EFTA states.  This Bill goes an extra step by adding Austria, Finland and Sweden to the existing law on the enforcement of judgments.  Therefore, the legislation now covers all EU member states and the remaining EFTA states.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on coming up with the idea to consolidate the law in this Bill, which repeals the Acts of 1988 and 1993.  It is an excellent idea to simplify the legislation and make it more accessible.  That is the direction which our legislation should take in future.</P>
      <P>I note the text of the conventions are given in Irish and English in the First and Second Schedules to the Bill but in only one of the official languages &mdash; English &mdash; from the Third Schedule onwards.  I ask the Minister to examine that anomaly for Committee and Report Stages.</P>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the thrust of this legislation, which enables us to recognise and implement judgments enforced in other countries and to have reciprocal arrangements here.  Will the Minister give some indication of the extent of the use of this legislation? Do we have any mechanism for compiling reports?  Is there provision for an annual report on the progress of the legislation?  Is there any mechanism in the Department to show how extensively it is used in terms of maintenance, commercial law and judgments relating to tort, damages and contracts?  Although criminal matters are not included, it would be interesting to see if judgments in civil cases in other countries are recognised and enforced.  It would be fascinating to read an annual report on the operation of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a central authority under the Maintenance Act, 1994.  That is the way forward on all judgments we are seeking to enforce under this legislation.  We are talking about a wide range of countries and different operations of law.  It is difficult for our citizens, who are consumers of the provisions of this legislation, to find the means or the time to exercise their rights.  They have recourse to the legal profession, but a central body to deal with all matters is a reassuring and accessible mechanism.  This is one area where we could begin the process of compiling an annual report.  If a central authority processes maintenance orders, then surely its files should be accessible.  It would also be good if a <Col N="1456" /> central processing or enforcement authority was set up to deal with commercial matters and our citizens could avail of it.  I ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>Our society is now more pluralist and mobile. In fact, the definition of domicile means little more than residence.  The people of this nation were always great to travel.  They move between countries more regularly now but they always come home again.  That is also true of citizens of other jurisdictions and those in matrimonial or commercial relationships in this country.  As time goes on, civil relationships and the number of contracts entered into will increase.  The use of these instruments will continue to expand.</P>
    <P>Criminal matters are omitted from this Bill, although such judgments are equally important. The provisions of this legislation should be extended, particularly if criminal assets and property are seized in this country or in other jurisdictions to which many of our drug barons have fled and judgments are enforced in this country. Interpol and the Garda Síochána are operating in conjunction with their colleagues in other jurisdictions. It would be useful if the Criminal Assets Bureau had access to a central authority, as proposed in the maintenance order, where they could view all the judgments entered about people, such as drug barons, who travel abroad regularly, particularly when fleeing the law, and have civil obligations and criminal records in other jurisdictions. Perhaps the Minister might consider maintenance, commercial and criminal matters, which are important in terms of inter-jurisdictional activity.</P>
    <P>Section 13 states that an order may be made against transferring assets out of the jurisdiction where that might be seen as defeating a future judgment.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify how the legislation will operate in terms of different countries.  If one country believes that an asset might be transferred out of our jurisdiction, how will the legislation operate in terms of giving evidence and ensuring that the court can act?  Can that matter be dealt with through the central authority?  Although it is a maintenance matter, it might also be a commercial matter if the assets from a person's company or from a liquidation sale have a bearing on the operation of the company or its subsidiary in another jurisdiction?</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation, which extends our role in the European Union and consolidates our relationship with the other member states and EFTA countries.  As Senator Connor said, there seems to be an omission of a range of other countries with which we could enter into such legislative arrangements, particularly the western group of democratic countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia and the next wave of accession countries from central Europe such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.  We do not have to wait for their accession to the European Union to make progress on such matters.  Accession conventions would not be required in the case of the United <Col N="1457" /> States, for example, but there would be separate arrangements parallel to what we are entering into with all the countries in the European Union. The same terms and provisions would apply for recognition and enforcement of matters in our joint jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I welcome the legislation.  I am delighted it has come forward without too much delay and I hope the other European countries to which it applies will ratify it as speedily as we have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the welcome extended to this legislation and particularly for comments made by Senators who are anxious to see the development of this type of legislation.</P>
      <P>The Bill is primarily a consolidating measure which repeals and re-enacts the Judgments Acts, 1988 and 1993, as well as amending certain sections of the Maintenance Acts, 1994, which has been absorbed into the consolidated text.  It will also enable the State to ratify the 1996 Accession Convention dealing with the accession of the three new member states to the Judgments Convention.</P>
      <P>It is important that there is a greater awareness of the origins of the Brussels Convention.  The impetus behind the convention, as drawn up originally in 1968, was to give meaningful effect to Article 220 of the Treaty of Rome.  That Article called on member states to secure &ldquo;the simplification of formalities governing the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts or tribunals&rdquo;. While the actual convention is a technical measure which may be more familiar to the legal profession than to the general public, it is worth reminding ourselves that the fundamental aim is to simplify legal formalities in the civil and commercial areas so that, by and large, the relevant judgments are subject to almost automatic enforcement.  So, while the Bill is a technical measure, the Brussels and Lugano Conventions have the capacity to impact in a practical way on people's daily lives where the legal action they are taking has a transnational dimension.</P>
      <P>Many examles were quoted in the debate.  For example, if an person resident in Ireland is injured while using a product manufactured in another contracting state and wishes to bring a negligence suit to obtain damages, the conventions enable him to bring an action before the Irish courts should he wish.  Similarly, if business and commercial relationships are to function with maximum efficiency those engaged in contractual relationships across national boundaries must be assured that the full range of enforcement remedies are available to them, notwithstanding that the parties may be based in different EU or EFTA member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the current climate, when European affairs are subject to so much debate, I am glad to be able to say that we are among the first of our EU partners to be taking steps to ratify the Accession <Col N="1458" /> Convention of Austria, Finland and Sweden.  The only other state which has ratified this convention so far is the Netherlands.  The convention will not, however, come into force until one of these acceding states has ratified it.  It is likely that this will happen later in the year.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor quoted the example of an Irish person who had been working abroad.  An Irish person working under an employment contract in another EU state who is unfairly dismissed has a number of options when it comes to bringing a suit against an empoyer.  Under Article 2 of the convention the person could sue in the courts of the place where the employer is domiciled.  In addition, under Article 5.1 he could sue in the place where he habitually carries out his work.  If he does habitually carry out his work in any other country the employer may also be sued in the courts for the place where the business which engaged the employee was, or is now, situated.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan referred to the country in which a court case can be heard.  If an Irish person is knocked down by a car driven, for example, by a French person, it would not be necessary for the Irish person to sue in the French courts, although this would be an option.  Instead, relying on Article 5.3, he could bring a case before the Irish courts since Ireland would be the place where the harmful event occurred.</P>
    <P>The example of short term tenancy disputes might be of interest to Senators.  As a general rule, under Article 16, proceedings involving disputes concerning immovable property or tenancies of such property must be taken before the courts where the property is situated.  An exception to this rule concerns proceedings involving tenancies of immovable property concluded for temporary, private use for a maximum period of six consecutive months.  This provision refers essentially to short term holiday lettings.  In such proceedings an action may be taken in the courts where the defendant is domiciled, provided the landlord and tenant are natural persons and are domiciled in the same contracting state.  This provision would be of assistance where an Irish person rents property owned by another Irish person in, for example, Spain.  In such a case a court action could be brought before the Irish courts and it would not be necessary to go before the Spanish courts.  The rule is even more flexible under the Lugano Convention in that only the tenant must be a natural person and what matters is that neither the landlord nor the tenant is domiciled in the state where the property is situated.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor stressed the importance of continuing to develop our legislation and Senators O'Donovan and Costello were also anxious that we would continue to make improvements in this area.  It might, therefore, be useful to refer briefly to the fact that, under the Treaty of Amsterdam, provisions are made for enhanced judicial co-operation in civil matters between EU member states.  Such co-operation is part of the process whereby the objective of <Col N="1459" /> maintaining and developing the EU as an area of freedom, security and justice can be achieved.</P>
    <P>The areas covered by the proposed co-operation in addition to recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters include improvement and simplification in the system of serving legal documents, co-operation in taking evidence and measures aimed at the elimination of obstacles to the good functioning of civil proceedings generally.  An important element in the Treaty is that, for the future, measures falling within this area of EU co-operation will become a Community responsibility. This arises as a result of the transfer from a largely intergovernmental framework of the Third Pillar &mdash; known as Title VI or the Justice and Home Affairs provisions of the EU Treaty &mdash; to the First Pillar or EC Treaty.</P>
    <P>While these changes, which are aimed at strengthening co-operation between member states, are to be welcomed and are evidence of the interest in developing this area of Community activity, Senator Connor and other contributors to the debate will be happy to note that it is already the case that civil judicial co-operation under the present Title VI of the EU Treaty is progressing at a steady pace.  The Convention on the service in the member states of the Union of judicial and extra-judicial documents in civil and commercial matters has already been negotiated under the Title VI arrangements.  That convention was signed in May 1997.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Donovan and Costello referred to the Central Authority for Maintenance.  This Authority came into being in November 1995 pursuant to the Maintenance Act, 1994.  It is, at present, operating from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Authority assists Irish people who wish to recover maintenance payments from persons residing in over 40 countries worldwide, including all the EU countries as well as the United States, Australia and New Zealand.  I thank Senator O'Donovan, in particular, for his positive remarks about the work of the Central Authority.  A total of 26 incoming applications for maintenance recovery has been dealt with by the Central Authority for Maintenance and the Authority has dealt with 34 outgoing applications since it was set up.  Most of the cases involved the United States.</P>
    <P>Regarding Senator Costello's point about the Irish language version of the text, The First and Second Schedules contain consolidated texts of the 1968 Convention with the amendments made to it by the later accession conventions as well as the 1971 Protocol on the interpretation of the conventions by the European Court of Justice. These Schedules would be the most useful texts for practitioners and anyone else who needed to refer to the conventions.  Not to add too much volume to the text, we decided to limit the Irish text published in the Bill to those two Schedules. I am glad to be able to say that all the Schedules are published in Irish and are available in the <Col N="1460" /> Official Journal of the European Communities. Senator Costello will note that the Ninth Schedule, which deals with domicile, contains text in both Irish and English.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello inquired whether a system is in place to monitor proceedings where jurisdiction is grounded on the Brussels Convention. There are no statistics available at present in respect of such proceedings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the any plans to compile statistics?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consult with the officials in my Department to see what can be done about compiling statistics in that field.</P>
      <P>Another point to which Senators Costello and Connor referred involves trading relationships with other countries and the importance of non-EU states in this area.  A substantial portion of our trade is with our EU partners.  I do not have precise figures, but I estimate this is in excess of 70 per cent.  This openness to trade makes it very important that legal certainty exists for those involved in the import-export business by specifying precise rules of jurisdiction and ensuring that judgments given in accordance with the Convention can be easily enforced.  The Convention creates a climate which is conducive to the expansion of trade.</P>
      <P>We are aware of the desirability of extending the principles of the Convention to countries outside the EU.  Within the Hague Conference and private international law, work is taking place on a worldwide judgments convention.  While they are at an early stage, a successful conclusion to those negotiations would be welcome.  I am sure Senators would like to see more progress in that area.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor inquired about the grounds for refusal of recognition.  Article 27 sets out the grounds on which a judgment shall be refused recognition.  It states that recognition of a judgment shall be refused: if it is contrary to public policy in the state in which recognition is sought; if it is given in the defendant's absence where the defendant has not been served with the document instituting the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time to arrange for his defence; or if it is irreconcilable with a judgment given in a dispute between the same parties in the state in which recognition is sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Connor and Costello also inquired about applications of enforcement of judgments made to this country in recent years.  The number of applications under the Brussels and Lugano Conventions for enforcement of judgments has increased from a low of four in 1988 &mdash; the first year of operation &mdash; to approximately 30 applications in 1997.  Despite our increased &ldquo;Europeanisation&rdquo; in the decade of operation of the Brussels Convention, the overwhelming majority &mdash; approximately 80 per cent &mdash; of applications for enforcement came from the UK.  In almost all cases, applications for enforcement lodged with <Col N="1461" /> the Master result in an order being made.  The subject matter is usually commercial, involving enforcement of a contract or payment of a debt. Over 300 applications for enforcement of judgments were made to the Master's office from 1988 &mdash; the first year of operation of the Judgments Convention &mdash; to date.  There were 33 applications in 1997, 35 in 1996 and 47 in 1995.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, another Convention &mdash; the draft Convention on Jurisdiction Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Matrimonial Matters &mdash; is close to finalisation and should be signed shortly.  Ongoing work involves the review of the subject matter of this Bill, namely, the 1968 Brussels Convention on the Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters between EU states and the parallel 1988 Lugano Convention between EU states and EFTA states.  Consideration is also being given to the possible introduction of further simplifications in the procedure for the recognition and enforcement of certain civil and commercial judgments between EU states.</P>
    <P>The new Treaty provisions move judicial co-operation in civil matters closer to the centre of EU activity.  This recognises that the Union has the possibility to be a judicial space as well as an economic power and that compatibility within our legal systems can be a force which will impact favourably upon our citizens.  Against that background, the Judgments Convention may assume even greater importance than it has to date and may be utilised even more intensively that it is at present.  I hope the Bill will help to make people more conscious of the fact that their legal rights have a genuine European and extra-territorial dimension.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation to the Senators who took part in the constructive and useful debate on this technical Bill and I thank them for their support.  I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage and to the passage of the Bill through the House.  I assure Senators I will take note of their suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to this House on the detailed proposals for the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which were unveiled by the European Commission on 18 March.  Let me say at the outset that while I accept the need for CAP reform, these detailed proposals as presently constituted are unacceptable to Ireland.  Before setting out why the proposals are unacceptable, I will first of all remind the House of their background.</P>
      <P>The proposals, which were presented by the Commission in outline form last July, are designed to address the implications of enlargement of the Union to include ten Central and East European countries and Cyprus, and analyses and forecasts of world agricultural markets which suggest that surpluses could re-emerge on the Union market, particularly in the light of possible further trade liberalisation resulting from the next round of WTO negotiations.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Luxembourg last December took the decisions necessary to launch the enlargement process for the Union and the negotiations were set in train this week in Brussels.</P>
      <P>With enlargement to include all eleven applicants, the number of consumers in the European Union will rise by 100 million to around half a billion.  Agriculture plays a much greater role in the economies of the Central and Eastern European countries.  More than 20 per cent of their workforces on average are employed in agriculture, compared to an average of 6 per cent in the Union.  There are serious problems to be tackled in these countries, particularly in relation to the structure of primary agriculture and of the food processing and marketing sectors; but if these deficiencies are addressed, it is quite clear that they have enormous potential for increasing food production.  The Union must therefore take account of this prospect as it looks at policy adjustments into the next century.</P>
      <P>Trade in agriculture was effectively brought within international trade rules for the first time in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations under the aegis of the GATT, the World Trade Organisation's predecessor.  That round saw agreement on a considerable liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products.  It is likely that the next round of trade negotiations under the WTO, which is due to begin in 1999, will see a continuation of the process of agricultural trade liberalisation, involving further restrictions on export subsidies and further dismantling of protection. Although it is obviously impossible to predict the extent of future liberalisation, preparations have to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> The EU Council of Agriculture Ministers accepted the broad thrust of the Commission's outline proposals last November.  Among the conclusions reached then were the following: the model of European agriculture must be versatile, sustainable and competitive and it must be capable of conserving nature and responding to consumer concerns regarding food quality and safety, environmental protection and the safeguarding of animal welfare.  This model of European agriculture would serve as a reference for the future thrust of the applicant countries' agricultural policies and provide a powerful force for integration in the enlarged Union.  The long term outlook for the main agricultural markets given in Agenda 2000 was an acceptable working hypothesis and, without reform, significant surpluses could emerge.  In those circumstances the reform process begun in 1992 should be continued and deepened. The framing of a rural development policy had an important role to play in preserving and creating permanent jobs both on and off farms. Agricultural regulations and procedures should be streamlined with more subsidiarity for member states and the arrangements to be established should not distort competition nor lead to renationalisation of the CAP.</P>
    <P>While Ireland subscribed fully to these conclusions, which were endorsed by the European Council in Luxembourg last December, we totally reject the Commission's detailed proposals which have now been unveiled.  I forcefully indicated our position both to Commissioner Fischler, at last week's Irish Farmers Journal Conference in Dublin Castle and most recently at Tuesday's Agriculture Council meeting in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Let me turn now to the main elements of the Agenda 2000 proposals and to their impact on Irish agriculture.  In general terms the Commission's proposals on beef continue along the route charted in the MacSharry reform of the beef sector.  The result the Commission aims to achieve is a balanced EU beef market on the basis of increased domestic consumption of beef and greater penetration of non-EU markets without the aid of export refunds.</P>
    <P>The proposals, most of which would be phased in over the three years 2000-2, include a cut of 30 per cent in the support price for beef; 24 per cent increase in the suckler cow premium to £143; a 56 per cent increase in the special beef premium for steers to £136; a new beef premium of £35.75 per dairy cow; an annual amount per member state, called a national envelope, to be distributed at the discretion of the member state within parameters set by the EU &mdash; Ireland's envelope will be £104m; an increase in the extensification premium from an average of £35 to £80 but with more restrictive eligibility conditions; abolition of the suckler cow premium supplement of about £20 paid by FEOGA in Objective One regions; a reduction in suckler cow premium quotas with effect from 2000 &mdash; the reduction proposed in Ireland's case is 8 per cent; a reduction in special <Col N="1464" /> beef premium quotas with effect from 2000 &mdash; the reduction in Ireland's case is 22 per cent but, as we have under utilised the quota in the past, the reduction by reference to 1997 usage is 8 per cent; the abolition of intervention from 1 July 2002 and its replacement by a scheme of aid for private storage.  The premium rates to which I have referred have been converted from ECUs at the current Irish pound central rate.</P>
    <P>These proposals are of crucial significance given the central importance of beef production in the economy and the sector accounts for over one third of agricultural output in Ireland.  As the largest net beef exporter in the northern hemisphere we export 90 per cent of our annual beef output to other EU member states and third country markets.  We are uniquely sensitive to the nature of the EU support arrangements with such dependency on export markets.  The litmus test, not only for Ireland but for all other member states, is whether the proposals of the Commission, if implemented, restore market balance and sustain producers' incomes.</P>
    <P>A 30 per cent price reduction is significant and we cannot be entirely sure about its impact.  The proposals are designed to increase beef consumption in the EU by reducing beef prices while at the same time enabling EU beef to be exported to third countries without subsidies, thereby avoiding GATT constraints on subsidised exports. Beef consumption within the EU should increase if the price is substantially reduced, but it is difficult to predict by how much.  Also, it is debatable whether the EU can achieve the export market penetration envisaged with the level of price cuts proposed.  Much will depend on the price structures and production potential of the EU's major competitors.</P>
    <P>Given the uncertainty which must exist, the future EU beef regime cannot afford not to retain an adequate intervention safety net.  The BSE problem erupted in March 1996 out of the blue and caused severe market difficulties.  A safety net of intervention was needed and we do not know what marketing problem might arise in future.  I will strongly argue and negotiate for a retention of intervention in the event of difficulties. Reliance on aids to private storage, as the Commission envisages, would not be adequate in difficult market circumstances and where major market imbalance remains a threat.</P>
    <P>We cannot be expected to accept such a cut in market support without adequate compensation and support arrangements for the market.  The key element for consideration in terms of the future direction of the beef regime is the maintenance of a reasonable income for European beef producers.  I will seek to ensure any price cut is fully compensated.  It is widely known, particularly from the annual study by Teagasc, that beef producers are among the lowest income earners in the profile of agricultural enterprises.  This situation needs to be improved and so that reasonable family farm incomes are maintained. The Commission's proposals would result in <Col N="1465" /> losses to the sector of approximately £152 million a year.  There is no alternative but to reject these proposals because of their seriously adverse impact on the economics of beef production in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Commission has proposed to increase the extensification premium by a substantial amount from an average of £35 to £80.  This is an effective encouragement to extensification as it a substantial increase on the face of it.  However, it has also proposed to include hitherto uncounted animals while maintaining the qualifying maximum stocking rate at 1.4 livestock units per hectare which will adversely affect qualifying limits.  The combined effect of these extensification proposals in Ireland's case is broadly neutral.  Not only is there no incentive to further extensification, but many farmers who find themselves pushed beyond the 1.4 stocking density are likely to decide to make up for the loss of extensification premia by turning to intensive production.  We should not penalise extensive producers by taking away their extensification premiums and in the process encourage them to become intensive, which is hardly in the best interest of the beef industry either in Ireland or EU.</P>
    <P>I turn to the dairy sector.  The main proposals are a reduction of 15 per cent in price supports over the four years 2000-3; compensation for the price support reduction by the following new direct payments, also phased in over the years 2000-3, including a new dairy cow premium of £80 and an annual amount or national envelope per member state to be distributed at the discretion of the member state within parameters set by the EU &mdash; Ireland's envelope will be £32 million; an increase in each member state's milk quota of 1 per cent, with priority to be given in its allocation to young farmers and the increase to be phased in over the years 2000-3, and an increase in milk quota for mountain areas as defined by EU law amounting to 1 per cent of the total EU quota, to be phased in over the years 2001-4 &mdash; Ireland does not benefit from this increase.</P>
    <P>The Commission approach in the milk sector is that expected market developments do not require extreme measures, but that the present system, with its intrinsic rigidities, cannot last forever. I agree with the Commission analysis in principle.  Despite the rigidities associated with strict supply control, the quota regime has largely benefited the dairy sector since 1984.  In general, the operation of the quota has maintained high income levels among dairy farmers.  The role the milk quota system plays is of equal importance in Ireland in maintaining viable farming activity in less advantaged rural areas through instruments, such as restructuring and the temporary leasing scheme, as well as ring fencing of quota in these areas.  It has been a successful tool of economic development in rural areas.  It has shortcomings. If one has a substantial quota it is a valuable asset, but for younger people who do not there is a difficulty with this supply control instrument.</P>
    <P>Commission analysis suggests that the world <Col N="1466" /> market for certain dairy products is expanding.  I broadly share this view and this will continue to be the case over the coming years.  It is commercially and economically important that the EU maintains a strong presence on that growing market. Any retreat from this position over time would seriously undermine the long term viability of the EU dairy sector, but any changes to the current system designed to enable the EU to enhance its presence on world markets should not result in a worsening of the income of dairy farmers. An overriding principle is that any price reductions or other changes having an adverse effect on price should be accompanied by an appropriate direct aid system.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the milk sector are seriously damaging to Ireland and would result in a loss to the sector of over £50 million per annum. The most severe cut is the proposed method of allocation of the second 1 per cent increase in milk quota.  This system is incomprehensible and discriminatory.  It allocates milk quota on the basis of the mountainous areas within member states and, as I said, Ireland receives no allocation from that 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>The proposed allocation of milk quota is also incomprehensible because it ignores a solemn commitment which Ireland obtained from the Council when the quota system was first introduced. That commitment was clear and unequivocal. It stated: &ldquo;When distributing quantities added to the reserve, priority will be given to Ireland&rdquo;. At that time there was a lot of public debate on it and great emphasis was placed on the fact that, if there was any increase in the future, Ireland would receive priority because the milk industry was so important to its economy.  It is difficult to understand how the Commission can bring forward a proposal that ignores a solemn commitment of the Council.</P>
    <P>In addition to this extraordinary proposal on milk quotas, the Commission has proposed a further 5 per cent price reduction.  This price reduction is without compensation in the few member states, including Ireland, not benefiting from the maize silage subsidy or the quota increase for mountainous areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to the arable crops sector, the key element of the Commission proposals is a reduction of 20 per cent in the intervention price in one step in the year 2000, with compensation by way of an increase of 22 per cent in direct payments to £55 per tonne.  Compulsory set-aside will be reduced to zero but will be retained as a market management measure, penalty set-aside for exceeding a national or regional base area will be abolished and the maize silage subsidy will be retained.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals stem from its analysis that intervention stocks are expected to reach 58 million tonnes by the year 2005-6 unless some reform of the sector is undertaken.  While I believe that the predicted growth in world demand and price trends would facilitate the disposal of increasing quantities of cereals without <Col N="1467" /> export subsidies on the world market, one cannot escape the conclusion that there is indeed a clear risk of a return to substantial levels of intervention stocks with resultant strains on the EU budget and its capacity to fund adequate levels of support for farmers in all sectors.  However, if the Commission's response &mdash; a 20 per cent price reduction &mdash; is to be accepted, then the reduction in price must be fully compensated so that the incomes of cereal growers are not reduced.</P>
    <P>The level of compensation for the proposed price reduction remains the same as last July and would lead to a loss in the sector of about £22 million, but the net position for producers would worsen because of the new proposal for the abolition of monthly increments and the later date of payment of the compensatory aid.  Therefore, the proposals fall short of full compensation and we must reject them.</P>
    <P>The following table sets out my Department's estimate of the annual output losses, premium gains and net position for beef, milk and arable crop producers, if the proposals which the European Commission has recently brought forward were implemented in full.</P>

    <P>The overall net loss is £226 million to the Irish agricultural sector.  The milk and beef sectors account for almost 75 per cent of production and cereals accounts for another 3.6 per cent.  Therefore, the beef, milk and cereal sectors account for 80 per cent of the sector.</P>
    <P>These estimates assume that market price reductions will be of the same magnitude as the proposed support price reductions in the various sectors and use the current central rate of the Irish pound in converting all premium amounts, which are designated in ECUs.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the stark reality in financial terms of the loss to Ireland as a result of the current proposals.  Over the next 12 months we will have difficult but vigorous negotiations with the Commission, particularly because our agriculture sector plays such a huge role in our economy compared to any other member state.  We will be insisting on a fair outcome to these negotiations. I am pleased the farming organisations, the industry itself and the marketing bodies all support my Department in consultative groups.  I established these groups so that we can get the best possible economic figures and indicators to support Ireland's case.  We will all work together over the next year to make sure these proposals are tailor made for us.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1468" /> Last week when Commissioner Fischler came to Dublin he said that these proposals were not written in stone and that there is room for significant modifications.  As an agricultural economy, we cannot afford to have £226 million per annum taken out of Irish agriculture sector.  Again I will remind Europe that, as member states, we have behaved well and wisely spent our EU Structural Funds from which the economy has benefited but we started from a very low base and still have a lot of ground to make up.  The average farm income is well below the average industrial wage and the European average.  Farm enterprises still have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>The next few months will be spent ensuring Ireland gets a significant improvement on these proposals.  The next meeting of the Council of Ministers will be held in mid-May.  Before then there will be a meeting of the Heads of Government in Cardiff where I will have an opportunity to meet representatives of the farming organisations and the industry itself.  This will enable me to put together a comprehensive case for Ireland and I will enlist the support of the Taoiseach and the Government at that meeting.  I will highlight the importance of agriculture to the overall economy and try to ensure everybody makes the most of this round of negotiations which will take us into the next century.</P>
    <P>For structures and rural development the main elements are the effects of the loss of full Objective One status for Ireland in general, resulting in both lower EU co-funding rates and a lower absolute level of funds across all structural measures: as Members know, the funding rates up to now were 75/25 and the likely outturn will be to bring that to 50/50 which will make it more difficult for many enterprises and projects to go ahead.</P>
    <P>Another element is a transfer of certain expenditure from the guidance section to the guarantee section of FEOGA.  There will also be a change from headage payments per animal to area payments per hectare under the disadvantaged areas scheme.  This will be a fundamental change as up to now we were all familiar with the headage payment per livestock unit.  The scheme will now be based on area payments rather than headage payments.</P>
    <P>A scheme of compulsory cross-compliance will be introduced under the disadvantaged areas scheme with payment conditional on certain environmental practices being observed.  The EU is very strong on environmental issues and the possible negative effects of a scheme.</P>
    <P>There is a requirement to go beyond good farming practice to qualify for the rural environmental protection scheme.  FEOGA grants for the food industry will be confined to basic processed products and will no longer be available for certain highly processed products nor for the promotion of agricultural products.  The provisions for grant aiding advisory services seem to be much more restrictive.  Teagasc and the advisory services made the best possible use of FEOGA <Col N="1469" /> funding and a significant proportion of their budget came from Europe and any restrictions in that area would be quite serious for our main advisory and research body.  Provision for research in the specific areas of agriculture, food and forestry is excluded under the new FEOGA regulation.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposals in this area are complex and their full implications will not be clarified until the Council Working Group commences in April.  However, I welcome the consolidation of all existing agricultural structural measures into one regulation and I am also pleased to see that some very positive changes are proposed in a number of areas.  I made the case to Commissioner Fischler that many people are availing of the farm retirement scheme at 55 years, allowing younger people to run the farm, but there two conditions causing great difficulty. One is the additionality clause, where farmers had to have additional land to qualify.  With local land scarce, this caused prices to rise.  In some cases farmers went considerable distances to acquire land they did not want, other than to qualify for the scheme, and it added to the cost. The second problem was part-time farming, that the bulk of income had to be earned in farming, so those who had an off-farm job found themselves excluded from the scheme.  Many people in rural areas work with local authorities, the Office of Public Works or in local fisheries.  The future of many rural communities depends on the availability of local employment.  I am pleased those difficulties will be eliminated in the proposals.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the proposal to move funding for certain rural development and structural measures to the guarantee section of FEOGA.  Such a transfer would diminish the headroom in the guarantee section and it would be imprudent to do so at a time of great uncertainty.</P>
    <P>Although not the subject of specific proposals in Agenda 2000, incomes of sheep farmers have fluctuated greatly over the past few years.  We are dependent on the French market and the number of sheep in the UK, which sometimes floods the market and creates price difficulties for Ireland. In the environment which will exist under these proposals, consumption of sheepmeat could be significantly affected by a 30 per cent reduction in beef price supports.  That will affect the price of lamb.  Nonetheless, there is no proposal whatever for the sheep industry, it is not even mentioned. Sheep are important to Irish agriculture, there are 47,000 sheep farmers and for many disadvantaged areas the income generated through them is critical.  I asked the Commission to ensure the sheep sector is referred to in the proposals as it is not the subject of specific proposals in Agenda 2000.  Consumption of sheepmeat will also be significantly affected by the reduction in pigmeat and poultry prices which would flow from a reduction of 20 per cent in cereal prices.  I have therefore asked the Commission to consider the implications of Agenda 2000 for the sheepmeat <Col N="1470" /> sector and to submit a report on these to the Council together with appropriate proposals.</P>
    <P>Other elements covering all sectors include proposals that direct payments will be subject to certain environmental conditions being observed; member states may modulate within certain limits direct payments per farm taking account of employment levels on the farm; direct payments per holding between £83,000 and £166,000 a year will be reduced by 20 per cent and direct payments above £166,000 a year will be reduced by 25 per cent.  The modulation and capping of payments will be a critical matter.  It is fine to have a national envelope but that puts the onus on the national government and the Minister of the member state to decide where the cuts will be made.  Before the EU could be blamed but in future if people say it would be a good thing to level out the payments and to have more going to the smaller person and less to the larger person, taking from one to give to the other will create domestic political problems.  We will face that when the time comes.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I refer to the common general approach which the Council of Ministers adopted last November.  A key element of that approach was that the details of reform in the various sectors concerned need to be designed in such a way as to arrive at economically sound, viable solutions which are socially acceptable, which make it possible to ensure fair incomes and which strike a fair balance between production sectors, producers and regions and avoid distortion of competition.</P>
    <P>The principles enshrined in this extract are essential elements in the formulation of major policy at EU level but they are being ignored in the changes which the Commission have made, particularly in the beef, milk and cereal sectors, since last July.  The changes which have come about since the outline proposals are all negative. I indicated at the Agriculture Council on Tuesday that I could not accept the proposals.  I can assure Senators that I will do my utmost to ensure that Ireland's crucially important interests in the agriculture and food sectors are protected in the forthcoming negotiations and that the final package will be equitable and will provide the optimum framework for the development of those sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank him for coming in for this important debate.  For weeks people have been talking about the Santer proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Fine Gael Seanad spokesman on agriculture, I want this debate to be comprehensive and constructive.  Above all, I want this debate to be of benefit to the State, the farmers, the consumers, the co-operative workers and all those associated with agriculture.  As everyone knows, agriculture is the backbone of the Irish economy, despite the dwindling number of farmers, and will continue to be so into the next millennium.  There are approximately 140,000 depending on the land <Col N="1471" /> for a living and thousands more working in related industries.  This is a huge number by any standards.  Many towns and villages depend solely on agriculture for income, even the bigger towns. Agriculture is going through huge changes and in the past five years we have seen massive changes in the rural way of life.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals are the most draconian proposals made by Europe since Ireland joined. Many people are amazed and the nation is worried about them.  The Minister mentioned the figure of £226 million as the loss to the economy. However, other agencies, including farming organisations and independent observers, which carried out assessments on the potential loss to the economy estimate figures closer to £260 million. The situation is worse than the position highlighted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Town and village should unite to fight the proposals which will interfere with and have a bad effect on communities.  I call on the chambers of commerce and other bodies involved in business in rural Ireland to become involved in opposing the proposals.  The Fine Gael Party will do everything necessary to fight them and, if necessary, schoolchildren should also be involved because many of their future lives in rural Ireland depend on agriculture.  It will be ruined by the proposals, so children and everybody else associated with life in rural Ireland should be asked to back the Government and fight the package.</P>
    <P>A major Government initiative is required which involves not only the Minister for Agriculture and Food but also the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the other members of the Government.  A huge effort must be made on our behalf.  My suggestion that the Taoiseach should be involved is not light-hearted. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is committed to the agriculture brief but he has not proved himself a tough negotiator in foreign countries. He has many questions to answer about his performance on the issue of the reopening of the live cattle trade.  The Minister is not strong enough to break the political wall on this matter on his own. The Taoiseach and other members of the Government must be involved.</P>
    <P>The Commission proposals would damage our economy more than any other member state due to Ireland's greater dependence on agriculture. Beef production is ten times more important to Ireland while milk production is six times more important relative to EU averages.  This is a major selling point and could form the basis of a special case that should be put on our behalf.  The worst proposal involves serious discrimination against Ireland's extensive grass based production system.  It clearly favours the intensive Continental system.  The tightening of the extensification premium is ample proof of the purpose of the proposal in terms of grass producers in Ireland.  I am pleased the Minister acknowledged this point and said the proposal would be of no benefit to Irish producers.  It is a crazy proposal given that <Col N="1472" /> the rural environment protection scheme has been so successful and has had a major effect. Some people criticise certain aspects of the scheme, but it is a good initiative and has worked well in many places.</P>
    <P>The proposal with regard to milk quotas is also crazy.  Ireland has been served well in some areas by the milk quota system but many aspects of it need clarification.  I was made aware recently of one of the most unfortunate cases I have come across in a long time.  A family from Minister of State Davern's constituency visited me last week. A mother wanted to give her daughter her 16,000 gallon milk quota.  The daughter and her husband's quota was only 10,000 gallons but there was no way the family could transfer the mother's quota.  This is terrible and such cases must be addressed under the proposals if the numerous problems with the milk quota system are to be properly tackled.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not made a sufficiently strong case with regard to the importance of milk production to the fabric of rural Ireland and its quality of life.  People depend on milk production for their livelihoods and way of life.  Of the various categories of agriculture which will be affected, the worst proposal is the 30 per cent cut in beef prices.  This will have far reaching consequences. Reducing the price to 60p a pound is totally unrealistic because it is less than the cost of production. This is a disgraceful and it must be fought.  The suckler cow premium will only be increased to £143.  This is no compensation for the cuts that will be made.  This also applies to the small increases in the special ten month and 22 month beef premia.  These increases will not counteract the proposed cuts.  We must aggressively fight the proposals relating to the beef sector and also the dairy sector.</P>
    <P>We must fight every aspect of the proposals with great determination.  While some of the changes regarding rural development may be welcome in certain areas, it is fair to state that they will have a devastating effect on rural Ireland. The lack of proposals with regard to the sheep sector is a major omission on the part of the Commission because it will be affected by the price cuts in other sectors.  It is a pity there are no proposals to increase the sheep subsidies, particularly when sheep farmers are undergoing such a difficult time.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to fight the proposals to the greatest extent possible on behalf of the nation.  The future of Ireland and later generations depend on a strong case being made by the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.  They will be helped by the Opposition in both Houses because the proposals if implemented will have devastating effects on rural Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryKiely" hpid="Mr. R. Kiely Mr. R. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend Senator Tom Hayes for his sensible contribution, which was non-political except for one trivial lapse.  I commend the Minister, as have the press and the farming <Col N="1473" /> organisations, for the efforts he is making to reject the proposals.  I wish him well and urge cross-party support for him.  The Minister mentioned the farm early retirement scheme.  I am pleased that difficult requirements associated with it are being eliminated &mdash; especially the requirement with regard to extra land which deterred people from retiring &mdash; in order to facilitate early retirement and the passing on of farms to younger farmers.</P>
      <P>We support the concept of reform of the CAP. We accept that European agriculture must be positioned to cope with the rapid changes taking place both in agriculture and in society in general. It must also meet the challenges which will inevitably arise over the next few years, including what is intended to be the biggest enlargement of the EU to date with the consequential increase in production capacity as well as from the next round of WTO.  Equally, it is clear from experience that there is no advantage in delaying the inevitable.  We also recognise that, by and large, the MacSharry reforms have worked well and a continuation of that approach was not unexpected.</P>
      <P>Having bought into the concept of reform, we need to be satisfied with the direction of reform, the pace of change envisaged, the impact on different sectors and the equity of that impact on different member states.  In particular, we need to be satisfied with regard to the ultimate outcome. Will the reform process leave Irish and European agriculture better positioned?  The starting point for the reform process is the CAP.  We perceived the MacSharry reforms as having been favourable to this country, yet, ironically, we did not fully recognise this in 1992.  On the other hand, there may be an exaggerated view in other member states of the benefits we obtained.  The advantage was in the beef sector, but it is worth noting that the highest levels of FEOGA expenditure per hectare of agricultural land are in the Netherlands and Belgium &mdash; Ireland comes roughly in the middle of the table.</P>
      <P>The objective of the reform must be to protect and strengthen the special character of European agriculture.  The identity is best outlined in a document agreed at the November 1997 Agriculture Council.  While it is a broad statement accommodating the view of 15 member states it emphasises certain essential elements.  European agriculture has its own specific characteristics which include different regional facets, a variety of products and a large number of family farms. It needs to be versatile, sustainable, competitive and spread throughout Europe and to be consumer and environmentally friendly.  We can subscribe to that vision of agriculture.  It is important that we work to this model because there are countries, mainly outside the EU but some within the EU, who want a more one dimensional approach.  Our policy recognises the multi-functional nature of agriculture and should continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1474" /> The CAP and the agriculture policy in general had been criticised for not being sufficiently consumer friendly &mdash; a point Senator Quinn makes frequently.  The criticism may well have been justified but things have changed particularly in the past few years.  The traditional argument focused on the fact that the consumer subsidised the cost of the CAP through a higher price for food, although I might add that the achievement of the policy in building up a secure supply of food has been virtually forgotten.  However, the requirements of consumers have moved beyond the simple demand for cheap food.  They want choice, convenience, safety and quality and they want assurances about the origin and conditions of production. Control systems and the implementation of the CAP have moved substantially in recent times towards meeting those concerns.  This point needs to be considered not simply in the context of consumer orientation but in the framework of supporting agriculture.  Taxpayers and consumers are prepared to support agriculture, even if that implies higher prices for food.  In return they are entitled to expect good quality, safe food, acceptable systems of production, a clean and well kept rural environment and equity in regard to targeting support.  It is possible to have an agricultural policy which delivers on these objectives and which serves farmers and consumers.  In any event, a policy which tries to do otherwise is doomed to failure.</P>
    <P>The Agenda 2000 negotiations will shape agricultural policy over the next decade.  Despite the favourable balance of the MacSharry reforms, the beef sector is the area which has experienced the most difficulty over the past two or three years. Much of that can be explained by the turmoil caused by BSE but, these difficulties notwithstanding, it is doubtful whether our beef industry is properly positioned or structured to achieve its true potential.  Many of the problems arise from volatility in some of the markets we supply.  Thus, there is an attractive logic in the Commission's approach of reducing prices and increasing the level of direct payment.  The critical issue is achieving the right balance.</P>
    <P>Despite reservations about having such a large proportion of farm income depending on direct payments, our experience of direct payments has not been bad, especially when judged against the support system which went before them.  A major problem is the balance between intensive and extensive production.  Virtually all experts have agreed that the future for the European beef industry should be based on extensification and natural production, as Senator Tom Hayes emphasises.  Given our production systems we can contribute strongly to that strategy.  By extensification we mean a realistic level of stocking which would allow producers to earn a decent income and, at the same time, be environmentally sustainable.</P>
    <P>As we are highly dependent on third country markets and the vagaries of the export refund system we can see merit in a system which, all other <Col N="1475" /> things being equal, would reduce our dependence on refunds.  However, we have four concerns about the price reduction of 30 per cent, which is a significant reduction by any standards.  First, will it achieve its objective of increased exports and consumption and, in particular, will it open new markets, especially in Asia?  Second, the level of compensation on offer is not enough. Third, the production base is also being attacked through reductions in the suckler cow quota and in the special beef premium.  With a price reduction of that magnitude, should it also be necessary to cut the production base?  Fourth, we have concerns about dispensing totally with the intervention system.</P>
    <P>The reforms in the milk sector also present serious problems and as currently formulated are much more than the modest adjustment which was suggested in July.  Apart from the obvious problems with regard to the allocation of milk quota, which is discriminatory against this country, and the inadequate compensation, there are internal tensions in the Commission's proposals.</P>
    <P>The future of the quota regime has been the subject of much analysis in this country and in other member states.  While some states favour the abolition of quotas, for widely varying reasons, a view was emerging that extra quotas could be made available as a signal to the industry, as a method of loosening the regime and possibly creating the scenario whereby quotas could be abolished in 2005 or 2006.  It is also clear that the rigidities of the present system are creating their own pressures, not least in Ireland.  The proposed moves against dormant quotas and the suggested clawback on leases are designed to ease some of the pressures.</P>
    <P>However, what is now emerging are additional quotas not necessarily to deal with problems in the milk regime but for other problems.  At the same time the dairy cow premium will be related to quotas, which will create more pressure for quotas.  Rather than releasing the pressure on the system, the measure proposed could have the opposite effect.  In addition, a price reduction of 15 per cent creates circumstances where extra products, mainly cheeses, could be exported without refunds.  However, the way extra milk has been allocated does not necessarily mean that the potential will be realised.  We recognise more than most the social value and dimension of milk quotas and would not quibble with this aspect being addressed, provided we get a fair share.</P>
    <P>Under the proposals, countries like Finland and Austria stand to get a quota increase of 7 to 8 per cent while Ireland &mdash; which has a commitment from the EU, dating back to 1984, to priority access to extra quotas &mdash; stands to get an increase of only 1 per cent.  I was delighted to hear the Minister say he would remind the Council of Ministers of that 1984 agreement and will press that it stands by it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1476" /> As this is the first time that a proposal to increase milk quotas across the board has been tabled by the EU since the early eighties, both the IFA and ICOS are pressing for an 8 per cent quota increase, equivalent to that proposed for Finland.  This would give Ireland an extra 89 million gallons of milk.  Commissioner Santer's current proposals for the distribution of the additional quota discriminate blatantly against Ireland's milk producers.  We would get only 1 per cent extra quota against a proposed 4 per cent for Spain, 7 per cent for Austria and 8 per cent for Finland.  This is intolerable to Irish milk producers. Ireland has a better justification and a greater ability to produce a 7 to 8 per cent increase within the overall EU 2 per cent increase proposed by Commissioners Santer and Fischler.</P>
    <P>Back in 1984, the EEC recognised Ireland's special dependence on dairying by giving us an increase in milk quota over 1983 deliveries while other countries had to cut back substantially.  We were also given a commitment that our special dependence would continue to be recognised, with priority access to additional milk quota.  To date, this commitment has only been debated in the context of milk quota cuts, with little success.</P>
    <P>Now for the first time we are faced with a proposal to increase the EU's milk quota.  The 1984 commitment, written into the minutes of the March 1994 Agriculture Council meeting, must be called on by the Minister to deliver a greater share of the 2 per cent overall EU increase for Irish milk producers.  He guaranteed us today that he would remind the Council of Ministers of the 1984 commitment.  An 8 per cent increase would be worth up to £100 million to the Irish economy and would allow for genuinely substantial development by smaller and younger farmers, who are the most dependent.</P>
    <P>From this year butter fat content determines a farmer's milk quota.  The base year will be 1984. Some farmers are disputing the annual results because the results in their milk records are different from what the Department establishes as their quota, based on information from the co-ops. This matter must also be addressed.  The levels should be measured fairly, whether using butter fat content or some other method as a guide, to ensure Ireland's milk quota is not improperly reduced.  I commend the Minister and the Minister of State in contesting these proposals which are damaging to Ireland's agriculture and economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure all Members condemn these proposals as they could cause huge potential damage to this country.  Their effect on the total economy, not just agriculture, would be significant so they must be fought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been down this road before &mdash; the MacSharry proposals of 1991-3 were also severe initially.  Irish agriculture was at that time presided over by the current Minister for Agriculture and Food.  In those years he was a weak and ineffective Minister and he has given me no <Col N="1477" /> reason for greater confidence since he returned to office last July.  Without wishing to make a political point, he convinces neither me nor many other people that he has the wherewithal to carry forward this battle.</P>
    <P>The proposals of 1991-3 had to be fought but it was not Ireland who won that battle &mdash; perhaps because of the often attenuated arguments the Minister put forward at the Council &mdash; but France.  The French were allies of the Irish and had similar interests to us.  When they said no, the MacSharry proposals were greatly watered down to become much more favourable and did not have the damaging effect on Irish agriculture which was envisaged when they were first published. That is a warning to us that this battle is only beginning.  The Commission's position as outlined on 18 March is a bargaining stance. Thankfully Commissioner Fischler was in a mood for compromise when he addressed last week's conference in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental problem with budgeting and it is disappointing that the Irish Government has not made an issue of this.  The funding for the agriculture budget throughout the 15 EU member states is 1.2 per cent of EU GDP &mdash; that has been constant for years.  The current proposals have been introduced because of the decision to enlarge the Union, which we all support. Enlargement involved taking in countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic which have a much higher dependence on agriculture in terms of the percentage of the workforce engaged in it and its contribution to the national GDP.  When something with such fundamental implications is about to happen, I am surprised that the Government never seriously raised the need to increase even marginally the budget for the CAP.</P>
    <P>At present the CAP budget is about 42.6 billion ECUs, that is, about £34 billion.  While the percentage will remain constant, economic growth in the Union will result in growth from 42.6 billion ECUs to 49.3 billion ECUs by 2006, or approximately £39.2 billion at constant 1999 prices.  We must finance all of these reforms from that budget.  In addition, the transfers to the five applicant member states must commence after 2002. However, no significant amounts of money are to be transferred to the applicant members by 2002 or by 2006, at the time of full accession.</P>
    <P>I understand approximately 1.7 billion ECUs will be paid in agricultural subsidies to the five by 2002, which will have increased to something under 4 billion ECUs by 2006.  This money is in addition to the 42 billion ECUs and the 49 billion ECUs which will be spent within the 15 member states in that period.  The sums of money are not very great and there will probably be a small adjustment in GDP take to the agricultural budget of the EU.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that the Government has not made this a major negotiating point on behalf of the country, and not just the agricultural economy. The suckler cow premium is currently £140 <Col N="1478" /> per head; it was £170 per head when the original Santer proposals were published last July but it will be £143 per head under the new Fischler proposals. The special beef premiums which are paid at ten and 22 months are currently £90 per head; they were £184 per head under the original Santer proposals and will be £135 per head under the Fischler proposals.  Bone meat premium is currently £112 per head; it was £293 per head when the original Santer proposals were published but, under the Fischler proposals it is down to £175 per head from 18 March.</P>
    <P>How did the Government allow this?  The original proposals were made by the President of the EU Commission, Mr. Santer.  However, the Agriculture Commissioner was allowed to publish significantly reduced figures last month.  Given our crucial interest in this area what did the Government do?  What did it do when the original figures were released last July?  What did it do to ensure that Mr. Fischler's figures would not be significantly lower?  I hope the Minister of State will address these matters in his reply.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State rightly made much about beef.  This is an important sector in the agricultural economy.  It is proposed that by 2002 the price for beef will be down to 60p per lb; at present one can get 90p per lb and last Christmas the price was as low as 80p per lb.  A price of 60p per lb for beef four years from today is an unimaginable prospect.  It will wipe out the beef industry.  It takes at least 75p, perhaps as much as 80p, to produce a lb. of beef on the farm.  Yet it appears we are willing to accept a proposed price of 60p per lb.  There is a supposed promise of compensation for 80 per cent of any loss. However, the real compensation could be much less.</P>
    <P>We need to know the consequences of these proposals.  We need a strong Minister and the involvement of the Taoiseach.  He must build alliances with other member states who have a similar interest to ours to ensure that these proposals &ldquo;shall not pass&rdquo;, to quote Marshal Petáin. Unfortunately, I do not believe the Taoiseach has a full appreciation of agriculture.  The fact that he does not come from an agricultural background need not work against him or against his appreciation of the importance of the industry.  However, his role will be crucial because the EU Heads of Government will be very important when finally deciding the shape of this package.  They were extremely important on the last occasion.  I paid tribute to the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, for using his position as Head of Government to influence his colleagues, especially the French President, to ensure that the shape of the proposals that emerged in 1991 were greatly enhanced in terms of their advantages to Ireland by 1993.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people have left rural Ireland in recent years.  I live in a part of the country where the rural population had declined by 10 per cent. In the middle 1980s there were 10 per cent more people on the register of electors in most parts of <Col N="1479" /> the county in the west.  The same is true of areas west of the River Shannon, west of a line drawn down the middle of the country and peripheral regions.  Despite the evidence of decline in rural areas we are building towns and cities with nothing but social problems &mdash; including overcrowding, bad services, crime, etc.  We are destroying and eliminating a part of the country that affords a wonderful quality of life.</P>
    <P>Thousands of people fled from rural areas to a very bad quality of life because they could not generate an economic living.  While we will not fully arrest the problem because it is a worldwide phenomenon.  we have an opportunity to take some action.  The applicant member states on the threshold of joining the EU must look at the balance between their urban and rural populations and extract from the Union much more sensitive policies which will preserve their rural populations.</P>
    <P>It is madness to continue to urbanise the country, with all the social problems that ensue, while, at the same time, denuding the rural areas.  Yet it is a crazy imbalance that is officially blessed and encouraged.  I have no doubt we will renegotiate and get concessions on 70 per cent of the proposals because these are just the opening shots. However, if most of it is implemented the inevitable result will be to diminish the rural population and increase our urban sprawl and the associated social problems.  I appeal for national unity on this issue across all sectors.</P>
    <P>The Minister said £260 million per annum will be lost in reduced transfers but the farming organisations seem to agree it will be closer to £280 million.  We cannot take such a loss on board.  Some people say Ireland always has a begging bowl out looking for EU transfers.  We are entitled to those transfers because we gave up a great deal when we became members of the then EEC.  We are very good members of the EU and we maintain strong public support for membership.</P>
    <P>Our membership meant some hidden losses for us, such as the job losses which were sustained in many traditional industries.  Thirty years ago our clothing and leather industries employed thousands of people but those jobs were lost due to the competition which resulted from free trade. That is just a small part of the price we paid for membership of the Community.  The people who glibly say we have a béal bocht attitude and are constantly holding out a begging bowl to the EU are wrong because we are entitled to those transfers.</P>
    <P>We will now get fewer transfers because of our economic growth.  However, the agricultural part of our economy is contracting.  The agriculture industry is contracting worldwide, nevertheless, it is very important for Ireland.  In 1900 over 85 per cent of Europeans lived in the countryside but there have been huge changes since then.  There comes a point when we must cry halt.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> We have an opportunity here to ensure this vital national interest is fought for and that the battle is won.  This battle can be won because we have a good case.  However, I hope those who make our case do everything that is expected of them.  Our negotiators have the necessary influence but whether we fail or succeed will depend on the skill of those who carry the battle forward for us.  I am sorry to have to express a lack of confidence in some of the main players who will carry that battle forward for us on the basis of their past and recent performance, but I hope they will get the message.</P>
    <P>There has been a failure to pay farmers premia which have been due to them for months.  Tens of thousands of farmers have not received special beef premia, suckler cow premia or cattle headage which were due last September.  I cannot understand what is going on in the Department. Last year all those payments had been paid by this stage.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that money is paid as soon as possible.  The people who rely on these premia have lower incomes today than last year.  There is no justifiable excuse for withholding those payments.  It is not an EU problem but a problem in the Department.  I appeal to the Minister to honour the agreement made by the previous Minister with the farming organisations on a timescale for these payments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express my views on the recent announcement of what are commonly called the Santer proposals. Everybody was taken aback by the proposals when they were formally launched by the Commission, particularly in view of the information we received some months ago and the changes which occurred between then and now.</P>
      <P>This is, as other speakers have mentioned, a primary national issue.  It is one of the biggest issues facing this country over the next number of months.  As the Minister and others said, it is a case of getting everyone on board and focused on deciding our bargaining position so that we can fight these proposals in the country's best interests.  We must examine the cards we hold and play the game properly.  We are extremely good negotiators in Europe and, provided we do our homework properly, we can improve the situation of the agriculture industry in these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important to examine this opening shot from the Commission.  The suggestion that beef prices should be reduced by 30 per cent, dairy prices by 15 per cent and cereal prices by 20 per cent is totally unacceptable.  Others have rightly said this country is far more dependent on <Col N="1481" /> its agriculture industry than any other EU country, including the next ten countries which are seeking admission to the Union.  Agriculture continues to play an enormous role in this country. The fact that 90 per cent of our beef produce is exported is indicative of how serious these proposals are for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the proposals will lead to a reduction of £250 million for our beef industry. That figure must be seen in the context of the very low incomes earned by beef producers for many years.  The annual farm income figures produced by Teagasc show that beef farming is always at the bottom of the league.  Most, if not all, beef producers have a much lower income than the average industrial wage.  I do not say that to make comparisons but to put the figures into context.  A number of large beef producers are doing reasonably well but many small producers are not even scraping a living out of their enterprises.  They have invested in these enterprises over the years and are committed to them, perhaps because of the type of land they have, and cannot leave them.  Are we to cast these people aside?  We cannot do that.  It is the role of everyone in this country to look after those in need.</P>
    <P>The proposal by Commissioner Fischler to increase extensification payments from £35 to £80 is welcome for other countries, but not for Ireland.  The objective behind it is laudable and we want to see more extensification for many good reasons.  The consumer wants it because the quality of the beef being consumed is of primary importance and we must give the best quality we can.  We need to move more towards extensification but not by aiding certain countries through increases in the maize silage premium as proposed.  That works against our grass based production, particularly our beef which has always been grass based.  It will not do the country any good to give a maize silage premium to those not engaged in grass based production.  We need people to continue to produce grass based beef.</P>
    <P>The inclusion of non-premium animals in the extensification livestock units also works against this country.  We want to keep the number of livestock units per hectare low because that aids extensification.  To include other animals will not help from our point of view and it must be vigorously opposed.  We will consider any proposals to raise the level of livestock units per hectare, otherwise the situation should be left as it is.</P>
    <P>One of the frightening aspects of the beef proposals is the suggestion that intervention will be abolished in the year 2002.  This will undoubtedly cause problems.  As the Minister said, had intervention not been available in March 1996, I dread to think what would have happened when the market was totally disrupted by the outbreak of BSE.  I am not saying that intervention should be used as it has been used in the past, but we need a safety net in the event of a major marketing catastrophe.  These proposals must be vigorously <Col N="1482" /> fought because they work against this country which is more dependent on beef and beef exports than any other country in Europe.</P>
    <P>There is much concern about dairy quotas.  We were given a commitment in 1983-4 by the European Council which stated: &ldquo;When distributing quantities added to the reserve, priority will be given to Ireland&rdquo;.  However, the Commission is reneging on that commitment.  A 1 per cent increase in quotas is not enough for this country. If the increase being considered throughout the EU was distributed equally, we would get a 2 per cent increase which would result in an extra 22 million gallons.  I would welcome discrimination in favour of allotting that to young people because we need to encourage them to become involved in the dairy industry.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent increase is based on the Commission's projections of the consumption rate in the years ahead.  There has been a considerable increase in the consumption of dairy produce throughout the world over the past five years which has been greater than the Commission forecast.  There are plenty of reasons to suggest that growth over the next five to ten years will be far higher than that for which the Commission has allowed.  If we were to take a relatively conservative estimate of what that growth would be, there would still be scope to increase the quotas further.  It has been asked if quotas should be abolished and if this country would be well served by that.  I remain to be convinced by that argument because economically the safety net of quotas has stood to us in the past.  We should continue to try to increase our quotas.</P>
    <P>We cannot accept an overall reduction of £22 million in the income of cereal producers.  The great fear is that these proposals will lead to an increase in intervention.  We want to move away from our dependence on intervention.  The reason it may become more important in this area is that a reduction in prices will lead to a certain growth in demand.  However, that will not compensate for the increase in production which will take place as a consequence of these proposals.  We must be careful about proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to regard these proposals as discriminating against Ireland.  That may be because the Commission believes we did well in the past but is that any reason to discriminate against us?  We have performed well and we want the opportunity to continue to do so.  We are aspiring to keep as many people as we can in rural Ireland.  It is important to increase the numbers of those involved in agriculture because of the consequences if that does not happen.  In its November submission to the Council of Ministers the Commission stated this would be the thrust of its proposals.  I suggest these proposals are contrary to that and are discriminating against this country because of our good performance in the past.  If someone does well, should they be discriminated against?  I do not think so and we must fight these proposals tooth and nail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1483" /> Many young farmers are concerned about whether they should continue in farming or agricultural production.  If these proposals are accepted there is a great fear that we will have few farmers in the years ahead and that those who continue in agriculture will be big producers. That is not a good direction in which to go.  The onus is on the Government, the Taoiseach, the Minister and every interested party to get together and plan our best strategy to fight these proposals and to get the best outcome for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to contribute to this debate by taking a long term view.  While I respect people's instinct to hold on to what they have as long as possible, the best interests of the farming community will be served by taking a long term approach.  Irish agriculture will not be helped by the short term approach which, unfortunately, is often expressed when this subject is debated.  I had, I am afraid, a sense of this short term view of agriculture from what the Minister and many of my colleagues said today.  We tend to be reactive rather than proactive.  We must initiate change rather than merely attempt to respond to it.</P>
      <P>The food industry presents vast opportunities. I had the opportunity last weekend to visit New York and spend some time with Senator Hazel from Nebraska.  He mentioned that in the next 25 years more meals will be consumed in the world than have been consumed in the last 10,000 years. In a climate where we often hear of the decline of agriculture it is important to remember that we have a vast and growing marketplace.</P>
      <P>The Santer proposals deal with the reality that, in the 21st century, we will have a radically new European Union.  It will have a wider membership, a broader political agenda and, as the Minister said, 100 million new citizens.  It will be a long way from the cozy group of six countries who, 40 years ago, had as one of their primary aims the creation of a community that would be self-sufficient in food and could, effectively, close itself off from the rest of the world.</P>
      <P>How the world has changed since then.  Our challenge, in the new European Union is that agriculture will have a smaller and less dominant role.  That change is inevitable but the reaction of farming interests to this emerging reality is not. The choice is between sticking our heads in the sand and trying to resist change as long as possible or choosing to embrace change and seeking to benefit from a new set of opportunities. Neither option is without pain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my belief that Ireland could play a leadership role in taking the forward looking approach. I believe, also, that it is in Ireland's interest to do that because agriculture is more important to us than to many member states.  May I offer, from the perspective of one who sells rather than produces food, four suggested approaches that <Col N="1484" /> are needed to take advantage of 21st century realities in agriculture.</P>
    <P>A couple of weeks ago I spoke at a very interesting IFA meeting in the Curragh and I heard words used which I had never heard before.  Speakers referred to &ldquo;managing the market&rdquo;. I do not understand that term.  I am used to a marketplace which is unmanageable.  I respond to what is happening in the market rather than manage it.  I heard of &ldquo;unacceptable prices&rdquo;.  I come from a world where any price which the customer is prepared to pay is acceptable.  I entered a business in Dublin in 1965 which, since then, has seen 18 grocery and supermarket chains go out of business.  I heard none of them say it was unfair that their business had been taken away, that people no longer wanted to buy their produce or that the world had changed.  We had to recognise that the world changes and we had to adapt to stay in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>My first proposal, therefore, is that the agricultural community should adopt a customer focus. Since we joined the EU the emphasis has been on the producers' need rather than on the needs of the customer.  That is changing fast and the only sustainable future for a profitable agriculture sector is one that is firmly based on the marketplace.  Agricultural decisions need to be taken on the basis of what customers actually want.  The priorities that should be followed are those of the customer.</P>
    <P>Customer priorities today are safety, health, taste and value.  Customers want to know if a product will kill them or make them sick?  Is it good for them?  Will they enjoy and relish it and is it a good deal?  These are the questions customers ask every time they buy a product which is produced on a farm.  These are the priorities which should drive European agriculture in the future but they were not the priorities in the past.</P>
    <P>My second proposal is that farmers should take quality more seriously than they have done in the past.  When customers consider value nowadays they are not just talking about price.  They are talking about quality and price.  Increasingly customers, whether they are buyers from big supermarket companies or individual shoppers, make it clear that quality comes before price.  They will no longer tolerate products which are below par or about which they are not given full information. For the farmer of tomorrow, quality can no longer be an option or a vague concept.  It is an essential which will need, more and more, to be quantified and demonstrated to the consumer. I am not sure that is understood.  When I hear someone speaking about quality I say, &ldquo;give me another word for quality&rdquo;.  The alternative is usually a word such as taste, tenderness or flavour. We must think in terms of these words if we are to understand the idea of quality.</P>
    <P>Irish agriculture should position itself firmly as the source of quality products, and only quality products, because we are a small enough global player to concentrate entirely on the quality end of the market rather than on mass produced, generic <Col N="1485" /> products which are all the same.  Such a position at the quality end of the market does not come naturally or as a right.  It must be earned by proven dedication to quality at every stage of the production and distribution chain.  It cannot be bought by writing large cheques for marketing campaigns.</P>
    <P>My third suggestion is that farming interests declare war on the enemies within.  One or two of my colleagues were with me when I spoke about the enemies within at the IFA meeting in the Curragh.  In a marketplace which depends so much on reputation, the odd rogue who will not play by the rules cannot be tolerated.  A few such cheaters can destroy the reputation of the whole farming community.  Neither Irish nor European farming has been totally free of the cowboy element in the past, whether we are talking about swindling the EU or using banned feed products or growth stimulators.  I think of how Lord Haw Haw, during World War II, used tease the British with his knowledge of what was happening in their country, thus letting them know that there were German spies there.</P>
    <P>The farming community must root out those individuals who are doing untold damage to the future of agriculture in this country.  They must take this opportunity and not be worried about being called &ldquo;spoilsports&rdquo;, &ldquo;scabs&rdquo; or &ldquo;tell-tales&rdquo;. A change of attitude is needed so that those practices are clearly seen as crimes against the agricultural community and the wider national economic community.  I suggest that a &ldquo;zero tolerance&rdquo; policy, which will be attractive to the Government, be put in place in this area.  Until members of the farming community state that they will not tolerate such behaviour, we will not be able to eradicate the problem.</P>
    <P>My final suggestion is that farmers must wake up to the fact that agriculture alone can no longer sustain rural communities and they should give their full support to rural development.  Senators Connor and Gibbons recognised the fact that the agricultural community will not be able to provide the number of jobs it did in the past.  The farming community must do something about that recognition.  Tomorrow's reality is that no country, even those supported massively by the European Union, can provide an increasingly costly infrastructure for the benefit of an ever-diminishing number of farmers.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that 6 per cent of the workforce in the EU are employed in agriculture.  In the countries likely to join in the coming years, 20 per cent of the workforce are thus employed. However, I understand that this figure will be dramatically reduced.  We can assume that fewer people will be employed in farming in the future, but we must discover a way to ensure that rural development takes place.</P>
    <P>Farmers should adopt rural development as their cause, even when what is proposed has nothing to do with agriculture.  They should support rural development not from the short term perspective of &ldquo;What is in it for us?&rdquo; but from <Col N="1486" /> the long term perspective that it can help share a burden which was borne by agriculture alone in the past.  By adapting in a timely fashion to inevitable change, Irish agriculture can stabilise the employment it provides, increase the economic value it produces and become the centre of a rural lifestyle which will be desired by everyone else in the country.  If the choice is to bury our heads in the sand and resist change, the alternative is certain decline and decay.</P>
    <P>What I have been saying reflects Irish national interests as I perceive them.  However, we must also take account of the world perspective.  In that context, Ireland can adopt a leadership role in the European Union.  Europe is not an island that can cut itself off from the rest of the world.  Europe, as the largest marketplace and the second richest continent, has a responsibility in the global production of food.  As I stated last year on World Food Day, we in Ireland, with our folk memories of the Famine, should be more conscious than anyone else in Europe of the unacceptability of having some people starve while others eat well or to excess.</P>
    <P>Our perspective should lead us to bear in mind not only Irish and European interests but also the interests of the entire world.  We should be leaders in Europe of an attempt to integrate the continent's food policy with global realities.  We must ask ourselves and our partners in Europe whether the future we envisage for European agriculture is morally defensible in the light of those global realities.  Are we doing enough to share our food products with the rest of the world?  Do our trade policies on food make the problems of the least developed countries worse?</P>
    <P>Time and again the Irish people have proven to be spectacularly generous in giving to countries and people less well off than themselves.  We should extend that role to the European arena. We should lead the way in ensuring that European policy on food is not only good for farmers or European consumers but is also a positive and benign force in addressing the global food challenge.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals do not go far enough in one direction.  We must take action on the aspects of these proposals by which we feel threatened. We must look on them as an opportunity to do something to solve problems rather than merely as an excuse to react to threats.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Santer proposals on the future of the Irish agriculture industry are of great concern to everyone and they offer a great challenge to those involved in that industry.  I urge Members to put aside their political differences of opinion and unite in support of the Government &mdash; particularly the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Walsh, and their ministerial team &mdash; in its efforts to negotiate a package of reforms which are acceptable to Ireland and will allow the vital national industry of agriculture to develop and support a standard of living for <Col N="1487" /> farm families in rural areas.  That is vitally important for Irish society.  Irish people have a special dependence on agriculture and I know the Minister and the Government will ensure that this is protected and safeguarded beyond the year 2000.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's statement about quality, the standard of food has improved tremendously in recent years.  I agree that more could be done, but the farming community must be complimented for embracing the great change which has taken place in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor stated that the Minister for Agriculture and Food is not strong enough. However, in my opinion we have a strong ministerial team comprising the Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his Ministers of State, Deputies Davern and Ned O'Keeffe.  Combined with the Taoiseach and other members of the Government, I believe they will do a good job in the negotiations on the Santer proposals.</P>
      <P>Irish farmers have worked hard to develop their holdings and businesses to provide a better future for their families and generations to come. Their great work is easy to see as you travel through rural areas.  Improvements to the land through reclamation, re-seeding, etc. &mdash; even in areas where land quality is not good, such as parts of Counties Monaghan and Cavan &mdash; are a great credit to farmers.  They deserve praise for their enormous investments in farmyard structures, cattle housing etc., and their efforts to use environmentally friendly farming methods, particularly control facilities to stop pollution of lakes and rivers.  The cost of these investments often went beyond what was financially viable for many farmers, but they made them because of their commitment to their businesses and also to meet the challenges of the future.  In addition to this enormous investment, farmers, their wives and families work long hard hours on their farms. It is this above all else which provides us with the quality of food products the consumer enjoys.</P>
      <P>The agri-business sector has developed enormously in the past 20 years, processing a quality product which is the envy of the international food market.  We must defend all involved in this great progress and development of Irish agriculture against the current Santer proposals.  If implemented, these proposals will be disastrous and our key agricultural sectors will not be viable.  This will spell disaster for all of rural Ireland.  I have every confidence that this Government will defend our vital national interest of agriculture.  I urge all our political leaders and farm organisations to unite behind the Minister as we head into these negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reform of CAP is ongoing and inevitable for a number of reasons, including GATT, world trade negotiations, EU enlargement to the East and EU budget negotiations.  However, these pressures should not mean the destruction of <Col N="1488" /> Irish farming as will result if many of these proposals are introduced.</P>
    <P>The beef industry in this country has been through a very difficult period over the past two years because of the BSE shock.  Farming confidence is low and the Santer proposals have come at a time when the sector appeared to be rounding the corner with 90p per pound for steers available, and the continuing efforts of the Minister paying off.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals on beef are outrageous and must be rejected totally.  The 30 per cent beef price cut will result in a reduction in price to 60p per pound.  It is accepted that production costs are approximately 85p per pound, with intervention to be abolished.</P>
    <P>The proposed cuts in national quotas for suckler cows would reduce our national quota by 93,000 premia and the proposed cut in special beef premia would cut our quota by 258,000.  The proposal to include heifers in stocking density calculations must be rejected.  This would bar many farmers from claiming the premium and make any proposed increases useless.</P>
    <P>Any moves to world market prices must be very slow, and guaranteed to be fully compensated for in Ireland.  As our system is intensive and grass based, intervention must be safeguarded. The national envelope involves only 6.7 per cent of the EU shareout, whereas Ireland currently obtains 12.5 per cent of total EU premia. With no compensation for premia cuts and only 80 per cent compensation for price cuts, the beef sector could face loses of almost £200 million. This cannot be allowed to happen to our beef industry.</P>
    <P>The proposed cuts in milk price of approximately 16.5p per gallon and a 1 per cent increase in quota offers little reward for the financial investment in dairy hygiene by farmers in recent years.  The increase of only 1 per cent in quota to Ireland concerns me for a number of reasons.  In 1984, it was widely agreed that Ireland had a special problem with the introduction of milk quota and it was felt that quotas would be increased for Ireland.  This never happened and there were only some reductions.</P>
    <P>I worry about whether compensation payments in the future will be secure.  This 1 per cent quota increase should be much larger, because a good sized quota in 1984 is no longer viable.  In 1984, a 20,000 gallon quota was seen as good; today a 40,000 gallon quota is required for survival.  A large percentage of Irish farmers would not qualify for the proposed dairy cow premium due to the gallonage calculation.</P>
    <P>The 20 per cent cut in cereal prices, the equivalent of £57 per tonne, will make cereal production in Ireland very unattractive.  When these proposals were announced by Commissioner Fischler on 18 March, one could immediately feel the effect on farmer confidence for the future, particularly for young farmers taking up a career in the industry.  It is essential that young people enter farming if a vibrant industry is to be maintained.  <Col N="1489" /> With compensation payments forming the main income source in the future, it is more uncertain.  Direct payments are highly politically vulnerable and a decision at a Council of Ministers' meeting could cut the level of supports drastically.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that these proposals will result in a cut in prices to below the cost of production. In the production of beef and cereals, this means direct payments become 100 per cent of profit. Non-production on the yields of good land will be more profitable while many in the world starve. Another great cause of concern is that this type of 100 per cent profit from direct payments will lead to a low cost-low output agriculture with implications for food quality food processing, the farm inputs sector and also for those servicing the agricultural sector and farming, such as agricultural contractors, builders etc.</P>
    <P>With the enlargement of the EU, it appears the system of direct payments will not apply to the farmers of the new member states.  How long will the new member state Governments accept the sale of their products at a low price while other member states get assistance?  The enlargement of the EU will have major implications for the CAP budget in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The Santer proposals will undoubtedly bring changes to many areas.  The proposals for agriculture are unacceptable, while those for Structural Funds must be strongly resisted.  I urge the Government to ensure Border counties retain the Objective One status because of the problems in the area in recent years.</P>
    <P>I urge all interested in the welfare of Irish agriculture to unite behind the Minister for Agriculture and Food in the forthcoming negotiations in Brussels as he defends a vital national interest given the current proposals would cost Irish agriculture substantially in terms of output and £250 million in losses in farm income.</P>

      <P>Agriculture is an important industry and the Minister has our support in his endeavours at the upcoming negotiations on these proposals.  He faces a difficult task but this is a crucial time for the economy because agriculture cannot be seen in isolation.  The debate involves not just the Santer proposals but the future of the rural economy which is facing a period of unprecedented change.  It behoves us to think carefully about the implications of the proposals published recently and to proactively examine ways in which the challenge can be faced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> In the context of EU enlargement and the liberalisation of world trade there are many changes on the way; this has been known for some time. There are more farmers in Poland than in the entire EU and the vast majority of them are poor, existing at the level Irish farmers were at 1940s and 1950s, and we will be seen as the rich farmers of Europe following enlargement.  I saw at first hand the problems in the former East Germany, particularly in agriculture, before Christmas.  It is difficult to take in when one thinks of what is required to transform those agricultural economies and achieve a standard which has been taken for granted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I urge the Government to produce an integrated and strategic policy to ensure the worst social effects of these changes will not be experienced and to look at how we could ensure that rural populations do not decrease so much that life as we know it will not disappear because of the drop in the numbers engaged in agriculture. These economic trends have implications for schools, post offices, shops, villages and the environment. I have not seen any evidence that we are doing anything but reacting to an agenda set in Brussels and elsewhere.  With a diminution in the standard of farming, no space has been left for developing any proactive policy for integrating our industrial, agricultural and rural development and environmental policies which is required in terms of a response.</P>
    <P>I am bothered that the agenda has largely been set in Brussels.  While it is fine to rely on Brussels in good times, one must have a safety mechanism and a strategic sense of self-determination in that we must have control over our destiny when it comes to the rural economy.  I live in north Tipperary which is already experiencing huge change and I am sure that will continue.  For instance, there will be a continuous drop in the number of people engaged in agriculture and the proposals, particularly in the beef sector, will accelerate that change.  What is a small farmer?  There was a time when 100 acres provided a good living to support a family but nowadays, depending on quota size, one needs a great deal more land than that.</P>
    <P>There are dangers inherent in the increase in part-time farming where an individual who works in a big electronics factory will be easily tempted to give up farming and work full-time.  This ensures the next generation will have no involvement in farming.  Will this be allowed to happen or will incentives be put in place to ensure people remain in farming in light of the potential social effects of a rapid decrease in the numbers on the land?  One can drive around different parts of the country any day and see abandoned farmhouses, etc., which is a visual representation of an economic fact.  We are experiencing the effective wiping out of the small farmer.  While the amount of money circulating in the agricultural economy may not drop significantly, particularly if there is success in maintaining the level of direct aid, it will be concentrated in fewer hands.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I wish to clarify the Government's thinking on rural decline and depopulation, to see imaginative proposals, for instance, on the interdependence of a town and its agricultural hinterland, and to know whether the Government might consider incentives to ensure there would be seasonal employment to maintain farmers on the land, particularly during the winter period.</P>
    <P>When the Sugar Company in Thurles was in operation it was common practice for small farmers in the locality to take up seasonal work in the factory to supplement their farm incomes, thus ensuring their survival in farming.  Unfortunately, this type of seasonal employment is no longer available.  There may be part-time or shift work available in companies like Digital in Galway or Dell in Limerick.  Some IFA representatives have thought along those lines but I do not see any development of an integrated strategy in relation to the future of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn's favourite subject is food, particularly its quality and marketing.  I agree with a lot of his comments.  While we may think we have done enough to market Irish produce, it is only when we travel abroad that we realise that our high quality cheeses, which we consider to be world renowned, have never been heard of.  We need to market our produce with a more creative and strategic approach because we are faced with major challenges.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister and the Government in the future negotiations, which will be very difficult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for the outline he gave at the Commission's meeting last week and for his statement this afternoon. We must kept in mind the huge task that lies ahead for the Minister and the Government.  We are confident the Minister, the Ministers of State, their team of officials and the Government will achieve a successful outcome in relation to the current proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many aspects have already been covered.  Most Senators have mentioned the different sectors, particularly the 15 per cent cut in beef, 30 per cent cut in dairy and 20 per cent cut in the cereals sectors.  It is natural for us to call for the cuts to be enhanced with proper payments so that there will be no reduction in incomes.  Those cuts and all the anomalies within them are unacceptable because many farmers will not survive in the industry if they are implemented.  It is against this background that we can see the conditions that have to be overcome in order to maintain a thriving rural population.  The agricultural sector could possible survive with only 20,000 farmers but that is not what we are talking about.  We need a balanced rural population.  I call on the <Col N="1492" /> Minister to make two radical changes.  First, we are all conscious of isolated small farmers producing beef, milk, etc.  In relation to the milk industry it is important to have a transport subsidy to assist those farmers.  Many small farmers are getting out of milk production because of the requirements imposed upon them such as dairy hygiene, etc.  ICOS support a transport subsidy of 3p or 4p per gallon in order to combat Santer's proposals.</P>
    <P>Premium payments for maize is also included under Santer's proposals.  France grows 1.5 million acres of maize while Ireland has about 2,000 acres of maize.  Other European countries grow a lot of maize and, therefore, we should also have a maize subsidy.  If we had one we should also have a grass or silage subsidy because our industry is grass based.  I call on the Minister to seek these subsidies.</P>
    <P>The main reason the proposals are so unacceptable is that the enlargement of the EU is creating budgetary difficulties.  If there is to be an expansion of the EU &mdash; there are currently 11 applicants &mdash; then there should be an increase in the budget to cater for the needs of the new entrants.  We also have to bear in mind that Brussels is engaged in three major activities.  These are: the enlargement of the Union, the single currency and the negotiations with the World Trade Organisation.  The Minister correctly pointed out that these matters affect these proposals and they reflect poorly on this country.  The Minister is well acquainted with the problems.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the changes he has negotiated in terms of the early retirement scheme for farmers.  It is something for which I called in the past.  I am glad he announced it here this afternoon because we are talking about young people entering farming and these two changes will assist greatly in bringing them into agriculture.</P>
    <P>Cereal growing gets little attention.  If the proposals now before us are implemented, cereal growing will stop in this country.  I ask the Minister to protect the growing of cereals.  The users of grain as a feed base benefit from good grain for rations for feeding animals, be they dairy, pigs, poultry or for beef production.  We need a continuing cereal industry and I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure the continuing production of cereal in this country.  The losses would be around £20 million less the production costs.  The compensation will not match that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Callanan for sharing his time and I welcome the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that the most recent proposals are so damaging to Ireland that he could not even commence discussion on them.  That puts down a marker in time.  The proposals discriminate against Ireland as a full member of the European Union since 1972 by not taking into account the vital national interest agriculture constitutes to Ireland.  We are an island and must find export markets for 70 to <Col N="1493" /> 80 per cent of our main commodities, beef, milk and sheep.  Export refunds, while of assistance to market produce outside the EU, are no replacement for access to the strong markets within the EU.  The current proposals go against the thrust of previous reforms by not encouraging extensive methods of production.  Holland and Denmark will gain more in the dairy proposals than Ireland. Our environmentally friendly, grass based agricultural economy appears to be discriminated against.</P>
    <P>The proposal to pay premia on heifers is welcome and I ask the Minister to include area based payments for farmers unable to access premia currently.  I am concerned that the inclusion of all stock in the extensification calculation will result in a substantial number of farmers not being able to avail of extensification premia.  I hope the Minister will clarify the position on this matter.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand the rationale behind the substantial cut in the suckler cow premia as currently proposed and as originally proposed in the Fischler document last July.  Lack of adequate compensation has every farmer in the country frightened about the future.</P>
    <P>The maize silage subsidy will not only benefit French and German farmers, but remove the competitive advantage the Irish grass based production system enjoys.  It is up to us to identify our own equivalent to maize silage and to fight for it in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his stand on seeking more quota for Ireland and reminding the EU of commitments made on the introduction of the milk quota.  I feel the dairy regime should be loosened up to allow more young farmers to enter dairy farming.  Young farmers are the lifeblood of farming in this country.  Some months ago Teagasc published a profile estimating that there were 150,000 farm holders in the State. Farming is the sole occupation of 103,000 of those and 47,000 have a main occupation other than farming.  Teagasc projected that by 2005 there will 130,000 farms of which 30,000 will be commercial farms, 43,000 part-time farms, 33,000 farmers dependent on agriculture with inadequate incomes and 24,000 elderly farmers without successors. The age profile states that only 12.5 per cent of farmers were under 35 years of age and only 31 per cent under 45 years.  Almost 50 per cent of farmers were in an age bracket of over 55 years.  That is worrying.  We must do something to encourage younger people to enter farming. We can only encourage them into farming if those young, well educated farmers see a livelihood for themselves.</P>
    <P>I am concerned the current rural development regulations will not facilitate development of the rural economies to allow them to absorb those leaving agriculture.  Rural development should be about more than deer farming and forestry.  Area community based rural development programmes are the best way of maintaining rural populations as well as catering for the inevitable increase in part-time farming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> Some of the proposals are unrealistic as far as farmers are concerned.  If we continue to produce quality, traceable produce we will win with a premium price for our quality products.  We must always remember the customer pays the price, therefore he calls the tune.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor condemned the Minister on cattle prices.  From my point of view as a practicing farmer, I saw his Minister being hailed as he stood over a drop in beef prices form 105p per pound to 78p per pound when he was in Government. The present Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Party Government have ensured prices have risen to 90p per pound.  We do not say that is enough for farmers to stay in there but it is a move in the right direction and credit should be given where it is due.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his work on behalf of the farmers and this country.  I thank Ministers of State Treacy, O'Keeffe, Davern, Moffatt and Minister Walsh for their attention to the agricultural scene in this country</P>

Many of them live in mountainous and disadvantaged areas.  I hope the schemes for severely handicapped regions will remain in place because they are vital.</P>
      <P>Beef prices are still too low.  I wonder what happened to the much heralded promise of the Government when in Opposition to reopen and expand the live export markets.</P>

      <P>The Government's efforts have been ineffective.  The truth is that beef producing farmers are still at the mercy of the factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the negotiations are unsuccessful, the Santer proposals could represent the greatest disaster ever to befall the land.  We face the most difficult negotiations of this age.  The possible immediate and consequential adverse impact of the proposals, if implemented, is incalculable.  We must never allow any high flown European political objectives to steamroll the legitimate interests of our farmers and rural economy.  We must not be prepared to write off our family farm structure which is unique and valuable, although not in <Col N="1495" /> monetary terms.  It behoves us to ensure its continued viability.</P>
    <P>The proposed cuts in beef and cereal prices to below the cost of production would leave producers very exposed.  They would be totally dependent on direct payments and liable to extinction if the Eurocrats decided to tighten matters further.  It will not encourage young people into farming.  If we must take this road, the very minimum that would be acceptable are long term guarantees on CAP direct payments and the preservation of premia and area aid.  I agree wholeheartedly with the farming organisations that the European model of agriculture, based on the family farm with a living rural economy, the protection of the environment and consumer demands in relation to food quality and traceability, must be legally enshrined in the next WTO agreement.</P>
    <P>Beef and milk production represent vital national interests.  Accordingly, this must be reflected in the final CAP reform decisions.  Beef production is ten times more important and milk production is six times more important to our economy in comparison to the EU average. Therefore, at a minimum, we must hold our current share of the EU beef premia budget, not suffer any reduction in our suckler cow quota and be given priority in the increased EU milk quota.</P>
    <P>There have been huge delays in all categories of payments to farmers.  Under the charter of rights, farmers are entitled to payments on time. However, many farmers awaiting payments had to make arrangements with banks for extra borrowings on which they had to pay interest, even though the delays were the responsibility of the Department.  Depending on the bank with which they dealt, many farmers were probably front loaded.  Will the Minister give a commitment that payment schedules will be met this year and from now on?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for agreeing to a further division of time.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important debate and we cannot understate the seriousness of the current proposals.  If implemented, they will have an extraordinary and extensive impact not only on agriculture but on all of society and community life, particularly with regard to the traditional family farm which, unfortunately, has been eroded over the past 25 years.  Members from the west recognise the reduction in the number of farm holdings and farming families.  The Department of Agriculture and Food, in conjunction with many other Departments, should formulate and implement a proper rural development policy. Its main priority should be to at least maintain the current level of farm families.  However, if the Santer proposals are implemented, there is no way that objective will be met.</P>
      <P>It is usual for the Opposition to criticise but I have sympathy for the Minister.  All Members have a responsibility to work together on this matter in the national interest and to secure the country's future.  It is important that the views expressed in this and the other House are unanimous in their call for strong negotiations.  The strongest possible negotiations in Brussels are necessary in the year ahead.  The skill and expertise developed over the years in the Department of Agriculture and Food and other Departments will be fully tested on this occasion.  I wish the officials every success, and they will need the full support of all parties to ensure a successful outcome.</P>
      <P>The proposals are shocking and frightening. The Minister suggested that the total loss to the economy would be £226 million.  However, other research puts the figure at £260 million.  It is important the facts are clear before the negotiations begin.  We must know the exact premise of our argument in terms of what may happen in the future.  The Department should double check those figures.</P>
      <P>The beef sector has become increasingly important, particularly since the introduction of the milk quota system.  It is important to all sectors of the community, from east to west and north to south.  The proposed reduction of 30 per cent in prices is totally unacceptable.  It is excessive and out of order.  It must not be accepted by the Minister in the negotiations in Brussels.  Proper intervention price support must be maintained. This is vital to the beef sector.  In addition, the suckler cow premium is important to small farmers who have moved out of dairying and introduced a suckler herd as a replacement for the dairy herd.  Proper support for these herds is most important.  Grant aid should be increased to at least £250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current limit on the number of cattle qualifying for the special beef premium is 90.  There is a case for a review of this limit with a view to <Col N="1497" /> increasing the number.  I will not suggest what the number should be, but there is a case for substantially increasing it.  It is also most important that the Government is prepared to increase the national contribution in that regard.  It has been suggested that our suckler quota should be reduced by 93,000.  That is unacceptable.  It must at least be maintained at the present 1.114 million level.  It is also proposed that the special beef premium quota be reduced by 258,000 which is also unacceptable.  It must remain at the 1.258 million level.</P>
    <P>Dairying is being reduced in importance in my part of the country, given the numbers of small and medium sized farmers who are going out of business.  In the early 1970s it was recognised that dairying was nine and a half times more important to Ireland than the other member states.  It is now considered to be six times more important to our economy than other member states.  On that premise alone the Minister has a strong argument to use to seek special allocations for the dairy sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing time with me.  The Minister's place in the record books depends on his getting this change right.  It is critical for the agricultural and food industries to ensure the right result for Ireland over the next 12 months of negotiations.</P>
      <P>When we joined the EEC I understood the original premise was that production would be concentrated in the areas of natural advantage.  I considered that was why we had so much to offer to Europe beyond our size and economic impact in gross product terms.  Can the Minister explain where this set of reform proposals meets the premise of concentrating production in areas of natural advantage?</P>
      <P>The natural advantage for the Irish agricultural sector lies in grass based production and the extensive nature of Irish farming.  Look what is being done to the beef and dairy sectors and to the extensification principle.  The better extensive farmers will be driven into intensification because of the change in the criteria to meet the 1.4 livestock units per hectare that would be required. Every animal on a farm is now to be included. That said, I could never understand how a farmer could qualify on livestock units per hectare yet only count some of the animals.  At the same time, we need to be more generous with the livestock units per hectare and still allow extensification because the better farmers will be driven back into intensifying since it will be the only way for them to continue to operate.  It makes no sense when talking about grass based, environmentally friendly farming, which is where our natural advantage lies.  There is a principle underlying Irish agriculture and what we bring to the wider European arrangement and that principle is being abused by the proposals before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence in the changes proposed to the CAP of rewarding quality production.  A farmer can produce a scraw of an animal and <Col N="1498" /> receive the same premium and headage payment as for a quality beast, having bred a cow through a quality bull or having it meet the fat and protein requirements.  Farmers are being rewarded for producing poor quality products at the same rate as those who go to the trouble to get quality production. The balance of advantage should lie with quality production and we should reward it.</P>
    <P>In the early 1970s we traded any advantage in the Common Fisheries Policy for advantage in the CAP because we saw that as being where our advantage lay, given the importance of the agricultural sector to our economy and being a net exporter of agricultural produce.  We let down our fishermen, let our fishing waters go and we did not fight the fishing issue because of the advantage of the CAP.  The CAP has already been reformed once and it is now to be reformed again and so further disadvantage Irish agriculture.  We must look carefully at the advantage we are to trade away.  We must welcome the accession of east European states whose agricultural sectors are in a poor state and we must also accommodate the requirements of the WTO, but we must not sell out the agricultural sector as we sold out our fishermen and our fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House.  I take as read the significance of Irish agriculture to the national economy and in the European context, our dependence on exports and the percentage of the population engaged in agriculture.  Those points are a major factor in terms of the negotiations ahead.  I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, for his attendance this afternoon.  I commend the Minister, Deputy Walsh, for his address and I hope he will be successful in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I agree that there could be a potentially great negative impact on the country, not just on farming and agriculture but on the economy as a whole.  However, despite the challenge that confronts us, there is also a major opportunity.  We must be clear that this process started in Punte del Este with the original GATT negotiations. Whether we like it or not, the next world trade round is bringing us to a point where it is expected that at some stage the prices on the European market will be those of the world market, whatever they may be.  The difficulty that arises is how to protect agricultural population within the EU, particularly in Ireland, in that context. We must be aware that is where the train is going.  The speed of that journey is what is at issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have benefited enormously from the CAP and our membership of what is now the EU. There has been a significant positive impact on rural life and on the national economy.  The most <Col N="1499" /> recent agricultural statistics would give some cause for concern.  Last year agricultural incomes in the EU declined by 2.8 per cent.  In Ireland the decline was at about that level whereas in the UK and Italy the figure was of the order of 25 per cent and there were a few countries where the income increased.  It is the first time for many years in which the incomes have declined.</P>
    <P>We need to be aware of the country's capacity to compete.  Senator Avril Doyle is right that the original doctrine was about comparative advantage. When the MacSharry reforms were instituted they were about comparative advantage &mdash; production would go to those areas best capable of undertaking it.  In that context the country has a significant advantage, not just in the EU but globally.  We are highly competitive in milk, beef and grain production.  Our grain yields are highly competitive.  We have a structure capable of exploiting that comparative advantage in international markets which is comprised of the plcs and the agriculture co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The heroes of the Celtic tiger are people like Mr. Pat O'Neill of Avonmore/Waterford, Mr. Denis Brosnan of the Kerry group and Mr. Philip Lynch of IAWS.  They have the capacity to put Irish agricultural production to the forefront in the world.  If they cannot do it within the context of what is produced in Ireland they do it internationally by establishing their companies abroad, and they are to be congratulated for setting up in the US, the UK and further afield.  We must ensure that the capacity within those companies to exploit that comparative advantage in production is expressed in the market place.</P>
    <P>That leads us to wonder about the milk quota, which was introduced as a vehicle for controlling production and guaranteeing income.  When it began it was contested hotly and there were negative feelings about it but it succeeded in its objective. The difficulty with quotas is that when the international market requires more milk or meat, we are prevented from expressing our comparative advantage on the world market.  That is particularly so in the case of milk.</P>
    <P>The inevitable consequence of the idea that co-operatives should be able to process as much milk as possible &mdash; because unit costs will come down and they will have a competitive advantage &mdash; is that there will be fewer people on the land, because it will be more difficult for them to create an income to sustain their livelihood.  We will then have a few large farms producing all our milk and beef, which has huge disadvantages.</P>
    <P>The task confronting the Government and the EU is to resolve this basic conundrum.  How do we get to the place where the World Trade Agreement is directing us while at the same time protecting the rural communities which are so central to the social and economic life of Ireland and Europe?  That task would face the Government whether it was led by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael and I would have confidence in either to <Col N="1500" /> fight that battle all the way.  There are huge potential opportunities for us, we must be aware of them and within that context protect the vulnerable.</P>
    <P>That leads us to another inevitable conclusion &mdash; the only way to do it is through the &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; system.  As Professor Séamus Sheehy of UCD said, the only thing worse than a cheque in the post is no cheque in the post, and we must bear that in mind.  It is possible to combine the task of optimising our production and competing on world markets with protecting the vulnerable. In certain circumstances we must accept that this is as much a social welfare problem as anything else, unpalatable though that may be.</P>
    <P>There is a huge and fundamental contradiction in European policy.  It is stated that the model of European agriculture must be versatile, sustainable and competitive, but how does that explain headage payment schemes which lead to the destruction of the hills of Connemara, Mayo and Kerry?  We are ruining those environments &mdash; I have walked those hills and I know what is happening.  The EU has a lot to answer for; I do not blame the farmers because they were told to stock those hills with sheep and that they would be paid for every head.  How can the EU have a rural environment protection scheme on one hand while allowing the hills to be destroyed with too many sheep?  It is a total contradiction and I expect the Government and the Department to tackle it in the talks.</P>
    <P>We must also be concerned about the renationalisation of the CAP.  There is talk of subsidiarity and modulation, whereby countries would be given money and allowed to spend it.  That is fine, but if the wealthy German economy can provide its farmers with a VAT refund up to five time greater than ours, there are huge consequences for us in the marketplace.  If anything is to be achieved we must have a level playing field in which the wealthier economies like Germany and France are not allowed to re-nationalise their policies, while our Exchequer attempts to pay what those countries can meet comfortably. That must be stopped.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who have contributed to this discussion on the Agenda 2000 proposals.  These reform proposals present a formidable challenge to us and the stakes are high in the forthcoming negotiations.  The ultimate objective is to secure an outcome which will involve no loss or disadvantage to our agriculture or food sectors but will provide them with an environment within which they can expand incomes and employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outcome of these negotiations will be crucial because two of the sectors concerned, beef and milk, account between them for 71 per cent of Irish agricultural output, 37 per cent and 34 per cent respectively.  In the entire EU the only agricultural sectors which exceed those percentages are the meat sectors of Luxembourg and <Col N="1501" /> Finland.  When the contribution of agriculture to the economies of the member states is taken into account, the economic importance of beef and milk to Ireland far exceeds that of any agricultural sector in any other member state.</P>
    <P>The Government, in particular the Minister for Agriculture and Food, is fully alert to the implications of these proposals and will work strenuously for a satisfactory outcome.  In making Ireland's case we will have the benefit of the expertise of the four consultative groups established by my Government colleague, the Minister, Deputy Walsh &mdash; one each for beef, milk, arable crops and rural development, on which farmers, processors, promoters of rural development and academics are represented.  We are looking forward to solid, positive contributions from these groups and the formal bodies which are representative of the agriculture and food industries.  We must make a concerted effort to win the changes necessary to these proposals.</P>
    <P>Senators raised important and interesting points and I endorse what they said.  Their sincerity, commitment to and knowledge of the industry is obvious and I will comment in response.</P>
    <P>The EU has been a source of major financial support to Ireland.  A couple of key statistics put the matter into perspective.  In 1997 Ireland received some £2.3 billion from the CAP and the Structural and Cohesion Funds.  This represents 5 per cent of Ireland's estimated GDP and 56 per cent of the estimated PAYE income tax receipts for the year.  In practical terms EU funding plays a huge role in our major infrastructural projects and some of our key social programmes.  The CAP is the cornerstone of farmers' incomes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The stakes are clearly high for Ireland in the Agenda 2000 negotiations.  We will approach them in a positive frame of mind.  We have always adopted a positive approach to our EU membership. We have not been afraid of change but always sought to participate actively in shaping this change in the best interests of Ireland and Europe.  When the Council discussed the original Agenda 2000 proposals the Minister, Deputy Walsh, reluctantly accepted their broad thrust. While he was deeply concerned about the inadequate levels of compensation then being proposed, he was prepared to accept the proposals as a reasonable basis for the commencement of negotiations.  The present proposals contain major, unexpected changes which will adversely and fundamentally impact on Ireland.  As a result the new proposals do not constitute a reasonable basis for negotiation.  They are, in short, absolutely unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I will briefly indicate the more significant adverse changes.  If implemented, Ireland will seriously suffer from the reduction in beef and dairy premia to create the &ldquo;national envelopes&rdquo;. The proposals include reduction in the male beef premium ceiling, the introduction of a suckler cow premium ceiling, the abolition of the suckler <Col N="1502" /> cow supplementary payment, the abolition of intervention before the full impact of the price reduction can be known, and the larger price reduction for milk.  In addition to these losses, Ireland does not gain from the allocation of milk quotas to mountainous regions.  the restoration of the maize silage subsidy, or the increase in the extensification premium because of the changes in calculating the stocking rate.</P>
    <P>The balance of the proposals has changed dramatically for Ireland since last July.  We realise there are losses involved in the changes for other member states but there are also compensatory gains.  For Ireland the changes are overwhelmingly negative.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in these proposals which will assist the sustainability of our very important sheep industry.  That is a great pity.  We are now in the spring lamb season and the market is volatile. On behalf of the farmers of the country, who have toiled so industriously all winter, I call on the meat factories to recognise their responsibilities and ensure there is a commercial, transparent and bona fide market price immediately available for spring lamb and thus ensure there is no impediment, latent or otherwise, placed in the way of a proper return to hard working sheep farmers for the new crop of lambs coming onto the market at this time.</P>
    <P>The negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals commenced at the meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers last Tuesday. The proposals for the various sectors have been referred for detailed discussion in a number of EU agricultural working groups.  They will be difficult and lengthy, probably lasting at least a year. In any event, there will be no conclusions before the German elections next autumn.  In the meantime, the Minister will be endeavouring to secure support for the Irish position at meetings of the Council and through bilateral contacts with other agricultural ministers and the Commissioner for Agricultural and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely questioned whether the Commission's proposed cuts in beef prices would result in improved access for our exports to Asian markets.  I believe there is a reasonable prospect that the proposed cut in prices will permit EU traders to export beef, especially cow beef, without export refunds.  The difficulty is in determining the quantities involved.</P>
    <P>Senator Connor questioned the efforts made by the Minister to shape the proposals considered by the Commission.  Since last July, the Minister met Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions to impress on him the issues of vital importance to Ireland.  In addition, senior officials in the Department have been in constant touch with senior officials in the Commission for the same purpose.  In the final analysis, the detailed proposals now put forward seriously disadvantage Ireland and most other member states.  The Minister has made clear to Commissioner Fischler and his fellow Ministers that the current proposals are unacceptable and he will leave no stone unturned <Col N="1503" /> in trying to ensure they are suitably amended to meet our concerns.</P>
    <P>The Senator also expressed concern about delays in headage and premium payments.  In so far as payments under the 1997 headage and premium schemes are concerned, the position is that, to date, almost £650 million has been paid to farmers under the various schemes.  The vast bulk of eligible farmers have been paid their entitlements. For example, 97 per cent of applicants under the 1997 disadvantaged areas headage scheme have been paid and 96 per cent of 1997 ewe premiums applicants have also been paid. Some 94 per cent of May 1997 suckler cow applicants have been paid their first advance, while 89 per cent have been paid their balancing payments.</P>
    <P>A similar pattern emerges in so far as the 1997 special beef premium is concerned.  In the case of balancing payments under the scheme, the 40 per cent balancing payment cannot be made until such time as the definitive position is known regarding our national special beef premium quota usage.  When it was brought to the attention of the Department of Agriculture and Food that the overshoot in quota would lead to a delay in making the 40 per cent balancing payment, it was immediately arranged for a second advance, representing 30 per cent of entitlement, to be paid.  In the past few days alone, £26 million was issued under this arrangement.  Any remaining amounts due when the quota cut has been taken into consideration will be paid during the month of May.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Brien raised the question of national envelopes.  We would like to see a greater proportion of the overall compensation for the beef sector being devoted to general increases for the premia rather than to the national envelopes because the proposed distribution key for the national envelopes is based on the share of EU beef production.  It tends to favour member states where beef is a by-product of dairying and is more intensive.  Ireland has 12.1 per cent of EU premia but only 6.7 per cent of EU beef production. The reason for creating a national envelope system is to provide funds to permit member states to aid certain production which would not benefit at all, or insufficiently, from the premia payments.  In our case we could use these funds to compensate heifer producers, for example.  The economics of heifer production would be extremely precarious following a 30 per cent fall in cattle prices and unless appropriate measures are taken there would be a serious question mark over the future of this segment of beef production, which accounts for 27 per cent of cattle slaughterings in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The envelopes could also be used to assist those producers who do not benefit significantly from the premium system or to top up existing premium.  While we have no problems with the principle of national envelopes, we have serious <Col N="1504" /> concern regarding the distribution key and we will make every effort to ensure this is changed.</P>
    <P>Efforts have been continuing to reopen the live cattle trade with third countries.  On 10 March an invitation was issued by our embassy in Rome to senior Libyan officials to visit Ireland for discussions on any remaining obstacles to a resumption of the trade.  A response to this invitation is still awaited.</P>
    <P>The House is aware that Egypt prohibited imports of live cattle from Ireland since January 1997 because of the BSE crisis.  Detailed proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle was presented to the Egyptian authorities last November but no decision has been taken on the proposal. I assure the House that the Minister will continue to make every effort to ensure that exports of live animals to Libya and other third countries can recommence as soon as possible.  I am also pleased that exports of Irish beef to Egypt increased substantially in the last year, almost doubling that of the previous year.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators who spoke for their interest in this important issue.  For the foreseeable future, agriculture will continue to be a substantial employer and creator of wealth in Ireland as productivity improves.  However, employment in primary agriculture is likely to decline.  There are 136,000 in Ireland who put agriculture as their primary occupation, with approximately another 157,000 working part-time in agriculture.  Gross agricultural production in 1997 was just over £2,608 million, or 6.2 per cent of GDP.  It is in the long term interest of Europe and Ireland that European agriculture should become more competitive on world markets and be developed on a sound, stable and sustainable basis.  A fundamental plank of our position would be to ensure the maintenance of a fair income for farmers, or, in the words of the Treaty of Rome to ensure a &ldquo;fair standard of living for the entire agricultural community&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Farm incomes must remain at an acceptable level, not only for reasons of equity and social cohesion but also because the predominance of agriculture as an economic activity in rural areas makes it so important to them.  In his opening statement the Minister stressed that he had told the Agricultural Council last Tuesday that the current proposals were not acceptable.  I assure the House and the farmers of this country that he will do his utmost to ensure that Ireland's crucially important interests in the agriculture and food sectors are fully protected in the forthcoming negotiations and that the final package will be equitable and will provide the optimum framework for the development of our agricultural and food sectors.  I thank Senators for their dedicated contribution to this vitally important national debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pleasure to welcome my old colleague from this House, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen. This matter is concerned with the restoration of an 18th century building, something with which the Government, since the publication of its very important document on our Georgian heritage last summer, has shown itself to be in tune.  It is also a subject in which I have taken a specific interest.</P>
      <P>I have been expertly briefed by the Droichead Arts Centre.  The director is Paul O'Hanrahan, co-ordinator Nick Reilly and the chairman is Michael Holohan.  It is a professional group of people.  The group's board of directors is advertised on its notepaper.  It comprises a distinguished group of people, including Michael Holohan, Senator O'Dowd and a former Member, Alderman Jimmy Mulroy.  There is, therefore, cross-party and consistent political support at a high level locally for this kind of project.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about Barlow House, which I am sure the Minister of State is familiar with. Urgent action is required to save this very important house, probably the single most important remaining early Georgian building in Drogheda.  It dates from 1734.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will recall, as I do only too well, the scandal surrounding the destruction of Drogheda Grammar School, which is a similarly fine building.  It would be a tragedy if this fine building is allowed to decay or put to inappropriate use by virtue of the fact that it appears to be falling between at least two, if not three or four stools.  I note that today and Monday are important dates in terms of decisions.  I hope something positive can emerge from this afternoon's meeting.</P>
      <P>Droichead Arts Centre, Drogheda, has been asking the Government to grant the use of the old Garda station in Drogheda for an arts space, which would comprise studios, rehearsal rooms, a café, craft studios and an outdoor performance space, for the past two and a half years.  I have been involved in similar projects, for example, with the old fire station in Buckingham Street which has been extraordinarily successful in regenerating life in that area of Dublin's north inner city.  Such projects have in the past been spectacularly successful in terms of both the local community and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During this two and a half year period in which this very active board has been pursuing the matter the centre applied to a variety of funding agencies to cover the cost of the conservation and restoration of the building, as well as the creation of a new set of buildings in the backyard area.  Its efforts have met with a certain degree of success. A recommendation has been made that the project receive substantial funding from the INTERREG programme, estimated at £250,000. In addition, it has the possibility of generating a <Col N="1506" /> further £150,000 through fund raising.  However, this funding will be lost within the next couple of days if the Office of Public Works does not make a decision on the future of Barlow House.</P>
    <P>The recommendation for INTERREG funding was made on the basis that the Government leases or donates Barlow House to the Droichead Arts Centre.  However, reaching such agreement has not proved to be an easy task, so much so that the centre has just been informed by its major funder that if it cannot secure a signal of intention from the Office of Public Works by the end of March the funding will be lost.  The Minister knows my track record in this respect.  I am involved in the James Joyce centre in North Great Georges Street and I remember being derided and denounced and told we would never get the money for it.  I invite anyone who still has doubts to see how successful 33 North Great Georges Street has been.</P>
    <P>The difficulty has been that since the Garda vacated the building in April 1997 the Office of Public Works has been trying to establish whether another Department requires the building for office accommodation.  That is perfectly reasonable, but surely a year is enough time in which to make that ascertainment.  In the 12 months which have elapsed, it appears all potential Government tenants have rejected the building on the grounds that it is generally unsuitable or would be too costly to convert.  The delays in this cumbersome process is likely to cost the town of Drogheda a rare opportunity to do something positive with a splendid old building.</P>
    <P>It is highly probable that by the time the Office of Public Works comes around to declaring the building surplus to State requirements the grant to restore and conserve it will have gone, which would be a real tragedy.  This trend must be stopped.  The only people who can prevent more losses are Drogheda people themselves by acting in a unified and purposeful way.  They have clearly demonstrated their energy, dynamism and capacity to plan in the intelligence of the programme they intend to implement if they are given proper support from central Government.</P>
    <P>Barlow House was built in 1734, which makes it a very early and significant building as Georges Street was built between 1760 and 1800 and Henrietta Street was built in the 1740s.  It was designed by the architect Richard Cassels, who was also responsible for Leinster House and Iveagh House, which is now the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The building is in a good state of preservation, generally speaking, and contains many original features.  An Foras Forbatha listed the building as being of national importance in 1986 and it is one of the last great Georgian buildings in Drogheda.</P>
    <P>Drogheda has seen its fair share of destruction, both legal and illegal.  The entire southern section of the medieval town was demolished in the 1980s, while the famous grammar school was illegally destroyed in 1989.  The restoration of the building would ensure that one major public <Col N="1507" /> building from the Georgian period would be saved and open to the public.  In other words, it would be part of our general possession as a people.</P>
    <P>The proposal for the restoration of the house is a significant and worthy one.  The Droichead Arts Centre has requested one of the country's foremost experts on Georgian architecture, John Redmill, who is personally known to me and is a man of considerable international reputation, to supervise the restoration programme.  In addition, a set of innovative modern buildings in the rear yard will be created as a performance space and crafts colony.  The development would provide the opportunity to create a new public space, known as West Gate Square, which would create a new and vibrant public space at the ancient north-western entrance to Drogheda.  In addition, artists and crafts people will be able to engage in economically worthwhile activities in the new crafts colony.</P>
    <P>Ironically, the memorandum recommending that funding should be given to restore Barlow House states &ldquo;. the approach to the conservation of the building is a good one and to be commended as Drogheda is in need of some conserved buildings&rdquo;.  A further irony is the fact that the Department of Finance is co-ordinating the funding and the Minister for Finance has political responsibility for the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>All that is required is the making of two simple administrative decisions &mdash; first, a declaration that Barlow House is surplus to the requirements of the State, which it clearly is, and, second, a decision by the Minister for Finance that Barlow House will be provided for the common good and not put on the open market.  It is hard to think of a good reason for not handing over a building, unlikely to ever see service again as a Government office, to the community as a heritage and cultural resource, particularly in a town such as Drogheda which has had such a spectacularly bad history in the conservation of historic properties. The Droichead Arts Centre has been informed that if the Office of Public Works does not decide in the next couple of weeks on its future intentions the centre will lose the funding to restore the building.</P>
    <P>I will reiterate the two necessary decisions on which I hope the Minister will indicate this evening there has been some activity.  The first is that the Office of Public Works expedite its review of Civil Service accommodation needs in Drogheda.  This assessment should be realistic and indicate whether Barlow House can be feasibly refurbished.  I gather from my information that it has already been touted around various Departments and no one really wants it.  The second necessary decision is that the building be declared surplus to the requirements of the State and for the Minister for Finance to exempt it from the normal tender process and grant it on a peppercorn rent to the Droichead Arts Centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> I hope those two decisions are taken at least partially as a result of our intervention this evening.  If that is the case, I look forward to a reception in Barlow House at which the Minister and I can jointly congratulate this very energetic and vital group.  We will, of course, also invite the Cathaoirleach.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for raising this important issue and for his warm personal words to me, which are greatly appreciated.  I agree with much of what he said and I hope I will have some up-to-date news for him.</P>
      <P>As the Senator said, Barlow House was built in 1734.  Its design is sometimes attributed to Richard Cassels, but is more likely it was designed by Francis Bindon who collaborated with Cassels on a number of buildings.  Despite some internal and external alterations over the years which have detracted from the original design, it remains an architecturally significant building with a number of listed features.</P>
      <P>The building was most recently occupied by the Garda, who vacated it in April 1997 and moved to a new station.  The Office of Public Works requires accommodation in Drogheda to meet the requirements of a number of Departments. It has very carefully examined the feasibility of meeting those needs in Barlow House but has decided reluctantly against this option.  The property is now considered surplus to the State's requirements and the Commissioners of Public Works will, therefore, be disposing of it.  The House will be aware Government contract procedures require that, apart from in exceptional circumstances, buildings must be disposed of by public competition.</P>
      <P>The Droichead Arts Centre has applied to have the building allocated to it for development for use by the people of Drogheda as an arts annex to be used for artistic, educational and community purposes to complement the centre's existing premises in the municipal centre building.  The centre in its application has indicated that in developing the building for its purposes, it would endeavour to retain the building to reflect its architectural character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are now considering how best to dispose of the property and the Droichead Arts Centre's application is being fully considered in that context.  The views of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands have been sought.  The options lie between selling the property on the open market or allocating it to the arts centre.  Sale on the open market would be expected to realise a considerable sum for the taxpayer and would also release the development potential of the property which, I have no doubt, can be realised, while fully respecting and perhaps even enhancing its architectural qualities for the benefit of the town.  On the other hand, it is argued that allocating the building to the Droichead Arts Centre would equally release its full development potential <Col N="1509" /> while at the same time benefiting the development of the arts and social community activity in Drogheda.  I assure the House that in coming to a decision the Commissioners of Public Work will carefully consider all the arguments.</P>
    <P>Two particular arguments have been advanced by some people recently in support of the case for allocating the building to the Droichead Arts Centre.  One is that because of the building's listed architectural features, it would be inappropriate to dispose of it to private developers and the second is that if an immediate decision is not made to allocate it to the arts centre, the centre will lose INTERREG funding for its development. I cannot accept the view that disposal to the private sector would endanger the preservation of the building's architectural character. The Office of Public Works is, with good reason, proud of its achievements in conserving our architectural heritage and in the excellence of its current building design.  It would, however, never suggest that it has a monopoly on excellence in this area.  The most important architectural features are listed in the local authority's development plan and this should offer adequate deterrent to any developer who might contemplate violating them.  Local authorities also have considerable powers to ensure that buildings are not permitted to become derelict.</P>
    <P>As regards INTERREG funding, I am advised that no funding has yet been allocated for the project.  I understand, however, that it is standard practice in considering funding applications that applicants are required to demonstrate an ability to carry out their projects within certain deadlines and I accept, therefore, that the Droichead Arts Centre could lose potential funding if the building is not allocated to them or if a decision is too long delayed.  I emphasise, however, that any loss of funds to the centre would not result in a loss of EU funds to the State.  The funds would be available for allocation to other projects in the normal course of programme reviews.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I and the Office of Public Works are fully aware of the excellent work being done by the Droichead Arts Centre and of the many representations received in support of its proposal.  These will be taken into account in deciding on the disposal of Barlow House.  I assure the House that every effort will be made to reach an early decision in this case.  I am arranging to meet the representatives of the Droichead Arts Centre within the next two weeks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his courteous reply.  Private developers have a spectacularly bad track record.  I am a little concerned that we rely on the fact that certain features are listed. Listing features does not protect them; they are routinely destroyed.  This lamentably is what happens if private developers are involved and not rigorously supervised.  This is an urgent matter.  I presume the Minister cannot give me a date when a decision will be made by the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, to the House.</P>
      <P>It is clear that a full review of the DART service, particularly its operation times, is overdue. This service, which has been a tremendous success, has been in operation for over ten years. However, certain aspects of it need attention.  The times of the last DART trains need to be reviewed with a view to extending them so that the DART is available as an extra traffic option late at night.  From Monday to Saturday the last train from the nearest station to this House leaves at 11.18 p.m. for the north side of the city and at 11.22 p.m. for the south side.  That is too early for people who are at parties, in pubs or working late. In most other European cities one can avail of public transport at a later hour.  The various authorities should discuss this matter and agree to extend the DART's operation times.  Perhaps we could introduce different times in summer and winter or when the licensing laws are changed. This issue must be looked at particularly when one considers that many licensed premises have extensions to 12.30 a.m. if not later.</P>
      <P>We should link the DART service to the other transport facilities.  There is vast room for improvement in the taxi service and in areas serviced by the Nitelink buses.  A concerted effort to improve transport services only seems to be made at Christmas.  I ask the Minister to provide the necessary extra funding to ensure that proper facilities and the necessary staff are provided.</P>
      <P>We should also examine Sunday services on the DART, which are totally unsatisfactory.  When it was first set up, work practices were different and people respected the Sabbath.  That is no longer the case as people work on Sundays.  The first DART on the north and south sides of the city runs at 9.30 a.m. or 9.45 a.m. That is not satisfactory for those who wish to avail of the service. We are trying to encourage more people to leave the car at home and use other transport.  This morning my party members agreed to come to work by different transport methods.  If we want to stop people from travelling into the city in cars and clogging up the system, we must encourage them to use the DART.  On Sundays many tourists avail of transport facilities to catch trains or the boat at the North Wall.  We must ensure a good Sunday service is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who travel to Greystones have told me that extra rolling stock must be made available when the new service is extended there.  People who get on the DART in Greystones may not notice the problem until they are close to Dublin. <Col N="1511" /> Extra rolling stock must be made available if the already overcrowded trains are not to become even more so.  I know the Minister will agree with much of what I have said.  Improvements will need money and also a sense of commitment to giving a better service.  The DART service has been a great success and will, I hope, improve further with the laying of lines to the airport and the extension of the line to Greystones.  The service is needed at times of the day when it is not available at present and I hope the Minister will reply positively to my suggestions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising this most important issue.  I agree with many of the points he made, particularly the need for additional rolling stock to serve extensions to the rail services.  Some of these extensions are particularly close to my heart as they involve my own constituency.</P>
      <P>Córas Iompair Éireann receives an annual subvention from the Exchequer for the provision of socially necessary services which cannot be provided on a fully commercial basis.  In determining the level of subvention to be paid to CIE each year, the Government has to find the right balance between a range of competing demands across all sectors of the economy.  The State makes substantial resources available to Córas Iompair Éireann each year; in 1998 this will amount to £107.2 million.  Indeed, the level of commitment shown by successive Governments to CIE is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, over the past ten years, Exchequer funding amounted to approximately £1 billion.  Iarnród Éireann has received about 90 per cent of this amount to fund its operations, including the DART service.  I should explain that this figure does not include Iarnród Éireann's receipts from the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs in respect of the operation of the free travel scheme in that period.</P>
      <P>The allocation of the State subvention to the individual companies within the CIÉ group is entirely a matter for the board of CIE.  It is then a matter for the individual companies, such as Iarnród Éireann, to decide on the distribution of this allocation in support of particular areas of its operations.  The House will appreciate that these are internal matters for the CIE group and I have no function in relation to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Transport Acts, the question of providing <Col N="1512" /> rail services in the Dublin area is a day to day operational matter for Iarnród Éireann.  In responding to the requirements of the travelling public, including the requirement to provide additional services, the company must apply the overall resources available as cost effectively as possible having regard to the wide range of demands which it faces for new and improved services.</P>
    <P>The question of operating the DART service late at night is not hampered by a lack of capital investment.  Extending the service late at night would, however, impose extra cost on Iarnród Éireann for the provision of additional drivers, station staff, security staff, lighting and so on and there is no evidence that revenue from additional ticket sales would come close to offsetting that cost.  Iarnród Éireann's passenger surveys show that demand for DART services drops off after about 9 p.m.</P>
    <P>Iarnród Éireann is very much alive to the need to develop and improve the quality of the service it offers to customers in all areas, including the Dublin area.  The company keeps its services under regular review so as to identify measures which can be taken, within available resources, to improve services for its customers.</P>
    <P>A suburban rail development programme is under way, including extensions to Greystones and Malahide, the acquisition of new rolling stock, the improvement of existing stations and the development of new stations.  Additional rail cars are on order for the suburban rail network and new stations are being provided on the Maynooth line.  A review by CIE of suburban rail investment requirements, for consideration in the context of securing EU funding after 1999, will be completed later this year.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Transportation Office is also urgently carrying out a short term review of transportation strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  The purpose of this review is to identify what additional measures can be taken between now and the end of 1999 to address the transport challenges facing the capital city.  This will look, in particular, at public transport provision as well as traffic management.  A key question that has to be addressed in any review of the public transport provision in the city is how best to use scarce resources and how to ensure the optimum value for money from any planned expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 5.50 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 7 April 1998.</P>
