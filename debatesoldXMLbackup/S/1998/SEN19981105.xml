      <P>I have notice from Senator Leonard that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to provide increased funding to the health boards for the housing aid for the elderly scheme and also the need for increased numbers of FÁS employees to be made available to carry out the necessary works under this scheme.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 2 and 3.  On item 2, Second Stage is to be taken today.  Item 3 is to be taken at 2 p.m., with each statement not to exceed 15 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed.</P>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging the statements on the legal aid board.</P>
      <P>Most people will be encouraged by and will want to support the action taken by the transport workers who are picketing the headquarters of some of the most highly paid and most cosseted public officials in the world who on the one hand are determined to preserve their extensive duty free facilities while at the same time are threatening the small perk which most ordinary people get from duty free sales and, more importantly, the jobs which are dependent on duty free sales. I am sure the view of probably everybody in this House would be that if duty free is abolished it should apply all round and if it is to stay, at least the hypocrisy which is now surrounding this issue should be shown up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that point.  Furthermore, there was a time when tax arrangements <Col N="1418" /> for public representatives were better than and different from those for the rest of the community. At some stage we came to the conclusion that the idea of one law for one and a different law for another, or an upstairs downstairs system of entitlement was wrong and unacceptable. Today's news of a special arrangement for senior European public officials is completely and utterly wrong and it cannot be sustained.  These people should make their positions clear.  It has nothing to do with the personalities who hold those jobs at present.  I understand this arrangement has existed for a long time.  It is unacceptable and we should say so clearly.</P>
      <P>Over recent weeks people have raised various pre-budget submissions.  The House could do a good service, both to groups which make pre-budget submissions and also to the debate on the budget, by adding to the debate and informing people in a fuller way.  I ask that the Leader consider having a full day of discussion on pre-budget submissions.  Everyone in the House has interests in and commitments to various areas and many people have received pre-budget submissions.  I do not need to list them because we all know what they are.  It would be a useful addition to the budget debate that we would have a debate next week to discuss the pre-budget submissions of various interest groups.  I ask the Leader to consider that.  It should be followed up by a proper debate on the budget like that of last year.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to consider having a meeting to discuss setting out the House's business.  The House is too much at the mercy of the other House in terms of when legislation is passed there.  We should decide our sitting days at the start of the session so that people can organise their business, diaries, work, committee meetings, council business and so on.  The other House and Departments should relate to that.  I am not blaming the Leader for having to call us in on certain Tuesdays and Fridays but people should have more notice.  The only way we can achieve that is to strengthen the Leader's hand by stating our decided days of sitting, whether it be two, three or four days per week, over the next two months. In that way we will fit in our business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly support the call by Senator O'Toole for a day long discussion on pre-budget submissions but it would be extremely important that we would have the Minister for Finance in the House.  I ask the Leader to arrange the debate in that context.  There is not much sense in us talking to ourselves unless the Minister for Finance is here to listen to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to duty free, I refer to the motion in the names of Labour Party Senators, item 12, motion 17, where we support the EU campaign for the retention of duty free status at airports and ferries.  There was a debate on this some time ago but we are now approaching the deadline, July 1999, for the abolition of duty free.  However, it appears it will be retained as a perk for an EU <Col N="1419" /> hierarchy while it will be abolished in airports and ferry ports for the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the House should arrange a debate on this issue so Members can make their stance clear.  If duty free shopping is to be abolished, it should be abolished for everybody.  I do not believe it should be abolished because it is a valuable means or window for a nation to present its goods.  It is also a tremendous facility for the citizen who derives great enjoyment from such shopping.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Costina family whose members were arrested a couple of days ago without a deportation order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a motion on the Order Paper relating to the Costina family.  The debate on that motion should not be pre-empted on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to it in the context of item 27.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most grateful to the Cathaoirleach for drawing attention to my motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an excellent motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello can request an early debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have something different in mind.  I understand the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is due to make a decision on the Costina case tomorrow, so an early debate will probably not be possible. However, will the Leader of the House bring to the Minister's attention the concern about this matter expressed in the Seanad?  Will he also ask the Minister if letters of support on humanitarian grounds, sent by a large number of prominent people in the community, have been received in the Department?  There is concern that they were not considered when the original decision was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support yesterday's plea by Senator Bonner with regard to safety at sea which is an important issue.  In addition to the tragedy off the Donegal coast, there was another drowning near Whiddy Island in west Cork in which a young man lost his life and his body has not yet been found.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take a fresh look at the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956?  There is a real need for updated legislation to cover gaming and amusement arcades, casinos and so forth. Will the Leader find out if new legislation is proposed and when it might come before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Leader will also be of assistance with regard to the final matter I wish to raise. There is widespread use of mobile telephones but I have been made aware that all seagoing vessels <Col N="1420" /> which have simple radio equipment, whether fishing boats or commercial ships, can clearly pick up conversations conducted on these telephones. This is most unusual.  People conduct commercial and legal business over these telephones while many discuss private, confidential matters and it is unsettling that boats can easily pick up such conversations.  This should be investigated.  In this day and age of technological sophistication, there must be some system to prevent this happening. I am most concerned about the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently, there have been disturbing reports about the development of another reprocessing facility by BNFL at the Sellafield plant.  There are also reports about a waste storage depot in Pembrokeshire.  Although they are separate issues, they cause equal concern.  Would it be possible to have a structured discussion on this in the Seanad?  Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, could come to the House, make a ten or 15 minute statement on the current position of the proposals by BNFL and the Government's response to them and follow that with a question and answer session in which all Members can participate.  This would produce an informed discussion on the issue.</P>
      <P>Statements will not suffice because, while Members will be allowed to put their views forward, the Minister of State's reply might not take all their points into account.  It would depend on which civil servant prepared his script in advance. Some Ministers are able to respond specifically to points raised in a debate while others depend on a script.  That is their prerogative and I respect that.  However, I am seeking a structured discussion such as I have outlined, on BNFL's proposals and the proposal for the waste dump in Pembrokeshire, to take place in the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>There is much heat and not much light on BNFL's activities in Britain, particularly on its west coast.  Self-determination means nothing if it does not mean that we have control over our health and environment.  The lack of consultation and communication by the British authorities with the Irish authorities is an abuse of power.  I seek a debate on the matter so Members will have the opportunity to represent the views of their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the great achievements by the green movement in Europe was the closure of nuclear power plants.  In forthcoming elections, the electorate might remember the political parties which have been most consistent in resisting nuclear power.  The parties of the left in Europe have also done a particularly good job in seeking the elimination of nuclear power.  This will inevitably lead to the closure of Sellafield.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not but I am impressed by its activities.  I share many of its views on Europe, as everybody is aware.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning about the gross hypocrisy of the European Commission.  There is a parallel for this behaviour.  Similar luxurious shops existed for the privileged throughout eastern Europe before the collapse of the Iron Curtain. The European Commission is yet another unelected, privileged bureaucracy claiming privileges for itself and it is time this practice finished. The Commission is an extraordinary institution. It is unelected, unaccountable, has powers it will give to nobody else and privileges it prefers nobody to know about.  I am glad Senator Manning, a confirmed Europhile, was the first to raise the issue rather than somebody such as I whose motives on these matters are always and understandably suspect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader of the House find out the state of progress on the deregulation of the licensing laws?  The Government said it is committed to such deregulation.  This emerged when the report of the Competition Authority was published but the issue appears to have gone to ground since then.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Toole on the need to order how the House does its business.  On a previous occasion I asked that the House consider making its sitting times family friendly, a request that produced considerable hilarity.  I do not know whether it was because I made the suggestion or because I am a man and a man is not supposed to mention families.  However, it is nice for families to know when its members will be at home or absent.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Senator O'Toole that it would be useful to discuss the pre-budget submissions. Many of the organisations believe they disappear into a chasm and are never seen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>It makes a major contribution to community life in rural areas.  Everyone knows that in many ways FÁS is the life blood of the social, cultural and supporting services.  We often hear concerns expressed by the providers of those services and what might happen if the role or community focus of FÁS changed.  I believe Seanad Éireann could play an important role in the debate by taking on board those concerns and making a positive contribution to what the projected role of FÁS might be in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate on the abuse of alcohol.  A number of murder cases came before the courts recently where it was alleged that the accused had over-indulged in liquor consumption. There are reports of third level students missing college on Mondays and Fridays because of the abuse of alcohol.  Ten year old children are attending national schools with hangovers.  The accident and emergency services in our hospitals are overloaded every weekend as a result of alcohol abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot debate this matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise the need for a debate on alcohol abuse and the damage this is doing to the young, the old and to families at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues who called for a debate on the issue of duty free.  It is a scandal that EU Commissioners have an allowance of 20,000 cigarettes, 400 litres of wine and 90 litres of spirits duty free each year.  This is outrageous. We are now a two-tier Europe.  It would be reasonable to abolish duty free if there was a harmonisation of tax regimes.  However, there are discrepancies between the tax regimes and I do not believe that the abolition of duty free should be introduced until there is complete harmonisation of tax regimes.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's comments regarding the plight of the Costina family.  There is a motion on the Order Paper on this matter.  I would ask the Leader to undertake to transmit the strong feelings I am sure exist on all sides in this House in this regard.  This family has been shamefully treated and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should be required to give an explanation and ensure that this treatment does not continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Leader to draw to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda the situation which continues to obtain in the north city centre area regarding the behaviour of people after pub closing time.  There was a newspaper headline not so long ago which read &ldquo;Scandal of Club Drugs&rdquo;.  The article stated that the gardaí are targeting 12 discos and pubs on the south side.  In the last couple of weeks one of these joints I know of was being refurbished and one could skate on the Ecstasy pills rolling <Col N="1423" /> out from beneath the chairs.  What are the gardaí doing about these problems on the north side of Dublin city?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation come into this House to discuss the funding of sport both nationally and internationally?  This funding is not being spent properly given that sport plays a part in the promotion of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator O'Donovan's request for a debate on safety at sea.  In the last session the Minister for the Marine stated he would bring forward new regulations and lay them before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I ask the Leader for the up-to-date position and for a debate on the matter.</P>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government what is the position on the extension to urban boundaries because local elections will take place in the not too distant future?  An extension to urban boundaries was granted during the last local elections and it is farcical that these extensions are still not in place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Doyle's call to have the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, come into the House to discuss the BNFL situation. This arises following the dishonourable and despicable behaviour of the British Government by reneging on an agreement entered into by both Governments to terminate processing of nuclear waste within the next few years at the plant and the announcement that processing facilities are to be expanded.  I assume I will be given an opportunity to make my contribution to this debate given that Senator Doyle has already made her contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senator Manning and others said about duty free.  This matter has been discussed repeatedly in the past number of years.  It is time for this House and the Government to call on the Commission to ensure that duty free is not abolished.  Some 4,000 jobs are at stake in Ireland and 148,000 jobs are at risk throughout Europe.  It is imperative that we focus on the Commission at this point and that the hypocrisy which exists in relation to EU Commissioners is brought to light.  They must be requested to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in relation to duty free and the serious problem in relation to job losses must be highlighted.</P>
      <P>Despite repeated representations in this House and outside to the Minister for Agriculture and Food in relation to the fodder crisis, there are still severely handicapped and disadvantaged areas excluded from the winter fodder scheme.  I ask the Leader to again bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the request for a debate on the abolition of duty free.  While one cannot condone the double standards of EU Commissioners regarding their allowances for duty free goods, if they smoke all the cigarettes and drink all the wine to which they are entitled they will not have a long healthy life.  It is important that the Minister comes to this House to discuss cushioning the effects of the abolition of duty free on our airports and ferry ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the question of which towns will qualify for the urban renewal scheme and the failure of the Minister to reach an agreement in Brussels on the matter.  I ask the Leader to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister.  Various local authorities have made submissions in this regard and they want to know if the Government has failed to get agreement in Brussels.  I would like clarification of this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's comments on the abolition of duty free.  I ask the Leader to invite a Commissioner to this House so that we can express our strong views.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Senators Manning, Costello, Ryan, Norris, Taylor-Quinn, Chambers, O'Toole and Moylan's expressed concerns about the abolition of duty free, the President of the Commission will attend this House on Thursday, 19 November.  If Members wish I will provide time for a debate on the matter prior to his visit. I agree that the harmonisation of taxes has not taken place and there is not a level playing field. There are vast differences in the cost of motor transportation and various discrepancies in the tax bands in that regard.  It is unfair that this proposal is being implemented and I will meet with the leaders this morning to see how best we can approach this.  I have no problem with arranging another debate.  However, as the President of the Commission is coming to the House, perhaps we can organise to show our protests and let him know how we feel about the duty free issue.</P>
      <P>There is a requirement on the House to pass legislation and the number of sitting days necessary for that must be left aside.  This morning there were calls for a large number of debates on important matters of concern to Senators.  It is a difficult issue.  Any Senator who has a worthwhile suggestion will find I am available to listen and I will see how I can facilitate Members on sitting days.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Donovan and Burke called for a debate on safety at sea.  I will leave time aside for this in the next four weeks.  Senator O'Donovan announced to the House that boats at sea can pick up conversations on mobile phones.  This is alarming and I will inform the Minister of this immediately after the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Doyle, Ryan and Fitzgerald called for the Minister, Deputy Jacob, to come into the House to discuss the updated position regarding the BNFL proposals.  I will contact the Minister's <Col N="1425" /> office today to see if I can make some progress on this.  Senator Ryan also called for a debate on the deregulation of the licensing laws.  I will contact the Minister to see what the position is in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Ó Murchú requested a debate on FÁS and the major contribution it has made to the cultural, voluntary and other organisations which have benefited from its establishment.  I will allow for a lengthy discussion of this in the House over the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell called for a debate on alcohol abuse.  I will certainly leave time aside for this.  It is one of the most important issues mentioned today.  There were 7,000 new admissions to alcohol units last year.  This is disgraceful and we as legislators should act on it immediately and highlight it to the best of our ability.  I will leave time aside for this before the end of this session. Senator Norris expressed concern about the disruption caused by teenage drinking in the north inner city after the pubs and clubs shut.  I will pass his views onto the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan called for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to come into the House.  I can inform the Senator that the Minister will be in the House in two weeks' time.  Senator Taylor-Quinn's concerns will be passed on to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes asked about urban renewal.  We are awaiting a reply to the queries from Europe and we hope to be able to make an announcement at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>I have no objection to this.  If there is to be a pre-budget debate we would like the Minister to be present.  We will see if he is available.  As the Senator knows, there are only a few weeks left before the budget but I will make a request today for the Minister to attend and will inform the House of the answer tomorrow morning.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to update the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Act, 1980, to take account of new developments in the area of plant breeders' rights, which have been adopted internationally since the Act came into force, and to provide for Ireland's ratification of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, as revised in 1991.  The convention was signed by Ireland, subject to ratification, in February 1992 <Col N="1426" /> and the proposed Bill will give effect to the provisions of that convention.</P>
      <P>The European Union, under Council Regulation 2100/94 EEC, has set up a separate system of community plant variety rights, based on the UPOV Convention but operating parallel to the national plant breeders' rights system in each member state.  The Union legislation requires member states to provide corresponding penalties for infringements of community rights as apply for infringements of national rights and I have provided for this in section 12 of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Act, 1980, provided for the establishment of a system of plant breeders' rights in Ireland based on the principles set down in the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants as revised in 1978.  States which are party to the convention constitute the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, known as UPOV.  UPOV currently comprises 13 member states of the European Union and 24 other states including the USA, Australia, Canada and South Africa.  Ireland acceded to the UPOV Convention in 1981 because Irish plant breeding interests needed protection against infringement of varieties bred by them, many of which they also exported.  As a State where agriculture is of such importance, we needed to have access to the very best varieties, such as grasses, sugar beet and cereals, which might not otherwise have been available to us in the absence of a national system of protection for plant variety rights.  Most of the varieties for which plant breeders' rights are taken out are varieties that are of very considerable significance to Irish agriculture.</P>
      <P>The central principle of the UPOV Convention is that the breeder of a new variety of a plant is granted a title of protection the effect of which is that the breeder has the exclusive right to reproduce and sell material of the variety and to authorise others to do so on conditions which he may specify throughout the territory where he has been granted plant breeders' rights.  He can also apply to the appropriate authorities in other UPOV states to have the same rights granted to him in respect of his variety.  Accordingly, breeders are enabled to obtain royalties from reproduction of their plant material and protection against infringements of their rights.</P>
      <P>The main conditions to be satisfied for the grant of a breeder's right are that the variety must be novel, distinct from other varieties of the species, uniform, stable in its reproduction and given a suitable name or other designation.  Novelty is essentially a legal condition to be satisfied at the time of filing the application for breeder's rights. Distinctness, uniformity and stability are established by means of growing trials under agreed UPOV protocols.  The results of such technical examinations can be purchased from other UPOV member states under bilateral agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards agricultural crops, the breeder's right is circumscribed to the extent that, under <Col N="1427" /> the various marketing of seed regulations, only seed of a variety which has been officially certified may be marketed.  The seed can only be of varieties registered in the National Catalogue of Agricultural Plant Varieties or the European Community Common Catalogue of Varieties of Agricultural Plant Species which is an amalgam of all member state catalogues.  Acceptance of varieties into the national catalogue is based on growing trials which establish value for cultivation and satisfactory use under Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>The Irish plant breeders' rights system is administered by the Office of Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights.  The controller is an official of my Department and holds his office under the general supervision and direction of the Minister for Agriculture and Food but acts on his own and not under the name of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Under the Act, the controller is responsible for any decision taken under the Irish plant breeders' rights system, including the granting of compulsory licences.  The scale of the operation of this office is modest.  However, since 1980 it has received 487 applications for plant breeders' rights and issued 354 grants of plant breeders' rights, of which 112 are still extant.  The office has also published 35 official journals of plant varieties and maintained the register of plant breeders' rights.</P>
    <P>Under the UPOV Convention of 1978 there were clear weaknesses in the system.  Other breeders could use a protected variety in order to produce a new essentially derived variety to compete with the protected variety without the payment of any royalties to the breeder.  The many advances in the biological sciences since the 1978 convention only served to worsen the position. Plant improvement methods, such as selecting mutations of vegetatively propagated varieties or backcrossing sexually reproduced varieties, have had the effect that often, at little cost, another breeder produces a new variety from the protected variety.  Such a variety is considered an essentially derived variety.  It will possess all the characteristics of the initial variety and differ from the initial variety in one or a limited number of characteristics.  The second breeder thereby takes full advantage of the investment made by the breeder of the initial variety without making any contribution to the costs of the development of the initial variety.  In addition, breeders were concerned at the extent of the use by farmers of seed saved from previous harvests to grow their next crop without payment of financial contribution for use of the protected variety.  Additionally, plant breeders' rights applied only to varieties of cereals, grasses, potatoes, fruit trees, ornamental shrubs and roses.</P>
    <P>The International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, UPOV, was revised in 1991 to strengthen the protection afforded to holders of plant breeders' rights and to enable them to obtain a fair return on the investment made in their varieties from persons <Col N="1428" /> making commercial use of such varieties.  The Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Bill, 1997, incorporates the principles of the revised convention.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, protection will be extended to all plant genera and species of the plant kingdom. In practice, I expect that only a limited number of applications for plant breeders' rights will be received from Irish breeders.  These will relate to the small number of cultivated species on which breeding work is being done and which are necessary to protect, and from nationals of other member states of UPOV who wish to market selected varieties in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The right to apply for a grant of breeder's right belongs to the breeder and, where the grant is made, the breeder's authorisation is required in order to carry out certain acts of exploitation of the variety.  Section 18 of the Bill provides that the breeder's authorisation is required for acts involving the propagating of material of the protected variety and, in certain circumstances, to harvested material of the protected variety.  These are cascading provisions.  Unless the breeder has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to the propagating material of the protected variety, he can exercise his right to harvested material obtained through unauthorised use of such propagating material.  If the defendant can demonstrate that the breeder has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise his rights with regard to the propagating material, the breeder is barred from exercising his rights against the harvested material in question.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that the holder of plant breeders' rights shall have the same rights in respect of a variety that is a dependent variety. Dependent varieties are those whose production requires the repeated use of the protected variety, namely, hybrid and essentially derived varieties. An essentially derived variety is a variety which is predominantly derived, but still clearly distinguishable from the initial variety by a limited number of characteristics.  Typically it is obtained by selecting natural or induced mutants within the variety, by backcrossing and transformation by gene technology.</P>
    <P>The extension of rights to the dependent variety means that the holder of rights to an essentially derived variety cannot exploit the variety without the permission of the holder of rights in the initial variety.  However, the holder of rights in the initial variety does not hold plant breeders' rights in the essentially derived variety.  Accordingly, it is envisaged that the two holders will reach a commercial agreement which will allow the holder of rights in the essentially derived variety to exploit them.  However, if there is no such agreement between the two parties, the holder of rights in the dependent variety may apply to the Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights for a compulsory licence where the holder of the rights in the initial variety unreasonably refuses to authorise exploitation of the essentially derived variety.</P>
    <P>A compulsory licence is only issued in the public <Col N="1429" /> interest and requires that the holder of the breeders' rights in respect of whose variety such a licence is issued shall receive equitable remuneration.  Legal provision for compulsory licensing of exclusive rights in the public interest is standard in all member countries of UPOV.</P>
    <P>The 1991 convention requires a member country of UPOV to safeguard the interest of the breeder during the period between the filing or publication of the application for the grant of plant breeders' rights, and the granting of such rights.  The holder of the breeders' rights is entitled to claim equitable remuneration in respect of such acts as would have infringed his exclusive rights had the grant been in force during the period of interim protection.  I have made such provision in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 19, respectively, provide for the exhaustion of the breeder's right and for the application of exemptions to the breeder's right which are very narrow.  The holder of a breeder's right can only exercise his right and be paid royalties once in every production cycle.  However, breeders' rights are not exhausted where further propagation of the protected variety takes place. The minimum period of plant breeders' rights under the Bill is 30 years for trees, vines and potatoes, and 25 years for all other species.  The maximum period of protection for trees, vines and potatoes is 35 years and 30 years for all other species.</P>
    <P>Section 19(1)(d) of the Bill provides for the farm saved seed exemption which has come about more through traditional practices than legal rights in the area of protection of intellectual property.  The UPOV Convention of 1991 provides that a breeder's rights may be restricted within reasonable limits and, subject to safeguarding the breeder's legitimate interests, permits a farmer to use his farm saved seed on his holding.  The section applies the equivalent provisions under national legislation as apply under European Union regulations for the community protected variety.  The Minister will have powers to specify by order the species, such as cereals, fodder plants, oil and fibre plants and potatoes, to which the restriction applies.  The Minister will also lay down by regulation the necessary arrangements to enable the farm saved seed exemption to operate.</P>
    <P>Farmers who have saved seed of varieties of these species will be liable to pay holders of plant variety rights equitable remuneration which must be sensibly lower than the royalty charged for the use of those protected varieties.  The amount to be charged is for the holders and farmers to decide between themselves.  Small farmers will be exempt from the requirement to pay for the use of farm saved seed.  Under EU legislation, small farmers are those whose cereal and fodder plant production will not exceed 15.13 hectares, excluding permanent pasture established for more than five years.  In the case of potatoes, small farmers are those whose production area does not exceed 6.3 hectares.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> When making regulations and orders in connection with farm saved seed, the Minister will apply the provisions of EU legislation establishing the implementation rules of the agricultural exemption on farm saved seed &mdash; EC Regulation 1768/95 of 24 July 1995.  A particular problem arises for breeders of ornamental varieties such as rose bushes and pot plants, in that they face major difficulties in enforcing their rights, particularly in relation to royalty payments. These varieties are easily propagated, pass through many channels before they reach the consumer and are sold from a wide range of sales outlets.  Unless the breeder knows the source of the plants being sold, he cannot establish if the material has been taken from an authorised propagation.  It is not only the breeders of ornamental plants, but also traders who properly pay royalties, who are put at a disadvantage by illegal propagation of plant varieties.</P>
    <P>The Bill enables breeders to exercise their rights more effectively by tracing plant material back through the supply chain from the retail sales outlet.  Under its provisions, the holder of a breeder's right for the protected variety or his or her agent will serve an information notice on the trader asking him or her where he or she has obtained the harvested material being offered for sale.  If the trader does not supply the information within the time limit laid down in the notice, certain presumptions will operate in any subsequent infringement proceedings in the civil case, unless the defendant proves otherwise or shows that he or she had a good reason for not supplying the information in the first instance.</P>
    <P>In any proceedings in court between the holder of the rights and the trader, the holder of the breeder's right will have to prove the link between the harvested material which was the subject of the information notice and the harvested material which is the subject of the infringement proceedings in order to activate the presumptions.  The presumptions are that the harvested material was obtained through the unauthorised use of the propagating material and the holder did not have a reasonable opportunity, before the harvested material was obtained, to exercise his or her rights in respect of the unauthorised use of propagating material.  Any information obtained by means of an information notice can only be used in proceedings in connection with infringement of plant breeders' rights and any abuse of such information can be similarly proceeded against in the courts.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes provision for the annulment and cancellation of grants of plant breeders' rights.  Revocation or nullity is retroactive to when the grant was made whereas cancellation is from the current date.  Revocation or nullity arises where the grant of a breeder's right should not have been made in the first place, while cancellation will arise if the holder fails to meet obligations imposed on him or her arising from the grant of such a right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> The Bill is based on the principles of the UPOV Convention, as revised in 1991, which I indicated earlier was signed by Ireland, subject to ratification, in February 1992.  The Bill will establish equitable relations between breeders, holders of breeders' rights and patent owners and between holders of breeders' rights for ornamental plants and traders.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is important in that it seeks to protect the livelihoods of plant breeders who put considerable effort and energy into their work.  Although this is an aspect of agriculture I have not spent much time studying, I wish to comment on certain aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>The subject of genetic engineering automatically springs to mind when one talks about plant breeding and is something which is creating a great deal of controversy at the moment.  A great deal of irrational comment has been made on the issue, with people being frightened by very exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims.  It is incumbent on the Government to show some leadership in this area and to promote a constructive and meaningful debate on the issue.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is addressing this issue which the entire agriculture industry must become involved in.  The Oireachtas could promote debate on the subject through the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</P>
      <P>The Bill is principally concerned with the amendment of existing legislation to take account of the principles of the 1991 convention.  Is it capable of dealing with all the technological and genetic advances which have occurred in the interim or does it need to be updated to deal with these developments?  For example, does the Bill control the extraction of large royalties by multinational monopolies in the area of genetic engineering? Can those who have a worldwide monopoly on a particular breed and are in possession of plant varieties derived from genetic engineering charge what they like for royalties?  Is any control mechanism provided for in the Bill?  Fine Gael supports the Bill at this Stage but we reserve our options to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will have an important effect on Irish farming, particularly in regard to grain production. Grain farming has undergone a major change in recent years.  Many farmers have bowed out of the area and prices and margins have become very tight.  We must protect the people who have remained in the business and we must ensure the varieties they use are high yielding.  In the past year, we have seen varying degrees of output from various varieties of grain, particularly in the malt area.  That has had a huge effect on profitability levels.  It is important that all new varieties introduced into the market benefit the industry.  It strikes me that it is much more difficult to obtain a patent for plant breeding than for <Col N="1432" /> industry.  Perhaps the Minister will inform us if the granting of patents will be policed.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinarily difficult to keep track of varieties which cross again and again.  I do not understand the process fully but I know that in the process of genetic modification, a scientist or breeder could perfect a new variety which would come under the criteria in the Bill and necessitate a patent being obtained.  There is a danger that people's work could be hijacked and they would not benefit from it.  The Bill seeks to ensure this would not happen.  To every book its cover and every cow its calf is the basis on which the Bill is founded.  People with the capabilities to invent new plant varieties will have their rights protected.</P>
    <P>Although Ireland is a small country, we have a great plant breeding history.  We have produced wonderful potatoes, particularly the Rooster variety. We must seek to develop varieties which best suit Irish conditions, be they white clover, perennial rye and grass, sugar beet or cereals.  We must ensure maximum returns from such crops because we are competing on a European stage.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the unsung scientists involved in this area which is an aspect of Irish agriculture few have an opportunity to witness.  The annual information received on cereals is a case in point. It is very important to know which varieties do well and which are problematic.  There has been a great deal of comment recently on the use of sprays and pesticides on Irish farms and their possible link with cancer.  This issue must be examined without fail.  We should try to do something about it as accusations have been made and people are very concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always a pleasure to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern.  He adds good humour to the proceedings.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as it affords greater protection to plant breeders as new developments in this area are continually taking place.  While a relatively small group, their work is of enormous importance in the agriculture sector and in an agriculturally dominated economy such as ours. We must all strive for new varieties of plants.  This Bill is necessary to update the 1980 Act to allow for the progress of new varieties of plant.  It is very important that Ireland, other EU member states and the 24 other states which are part of the UPOV Convention give effect to the protection of that convention as is proposed in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the UPOV Convention is that breeders of a new variety of plant are granted a title of protection which means they have exclusive rights to reproduce and sell material of those varieties and to allow others do so on conditions which the breeder may specify in the area they have been granted breeder rights.  The breeder can also apply to the appropriate authority in other UPOV states to have the same rights granted to him in respect of his variety.  This <Col N="1433" /> allows breeders obtain royalty from reproduction of their material.</P>
    <P>I believe the Irish plant breeders system operates well under the control of the Office of Controller of Plant Breeders Rights under the direction of the Department of Agriculture and Food. In 1981 Ireland signed the UPOV Convention as Irish plant breeders' interests needed protection for varieties bred by them, many of which are exported.</P>
    <P>As an agriculturally dominated country, we need access to the very best varieties of grass, sugar beet and cereals, something which might not be otherwise available to us if a protection system was not in place.  Most of the varieties for which plant breeders' rights are taken out are of very considerable value to Irish agriculture.  As a farmer I am very aware of the need for top quality grass varieties to be available to farmers to produce quality grass, the cheapest feed for animals. This was never more important than at present when cattle and sheep prices are being severely hit.  Farmers must cut costs and rely more on grass for lower production costs.  The high quality of Irish grass is due to the fact that, before seed can be marketed, it must be of a variety officially certified by the Department of Agriculture and Food and registered in the national catalogue of agricultural plant varieties. It can only be registered following growing trials under Irish conditions.</P>
    <P>The advances in recent years in science, etc., require the international convention for the protection of new varieties of plants to be revised to strengthen the protection afforded to holders of plant breeders rights and to enable them obtain a fair return on investment in their variety.  Under the Bill protection will be extended to all plant species of the plant kingdom, whereas before rights only applied to varieties of cereals, grass, potatoes, fruit, trees, ornamental shrubs and roses.  The Bill offers protection, and I urge the House to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just watering myself as an especially sensitive plant variety.  I do not welcome the Bill; I will oppose it.  It is appalling and scandalous and has all to do with intellectual property.  I noticed this some years ago during the GATT negotiations.  There is no doubt that the net effect will be to further disadvantage people in the Third World.  We are going to force them to pay for materials to which, in my opinion, they have a perfect and reasonable right.  The issue concerns property and advantage.  It is American driven and we ought to have taken warning from recent cases, one in particular concerning a doctor-patient relationship.  Genetic material was abstracted from a patient by a doctor for tests relating to cancer.  Without the knowledge of the patient the DNA material was patented by the doctor.  The patient found out and took a case which went to the Supreme Court where it was found the doctor had a perfect right to patent the DNA structure of an individual without his permission <Col N="1434" /> or knowledge.  This is the direction in which we are moving.</P>
      <P>This is not the direct subject of the Bill, but I am sounding a warning that we are in very dangerous territory.  It is all about profit and plant breeders' rights.  We are implementing the UPOV Convention.  I received material from a research unit associated with the EU Parliament which says that if the Bill is enacting UPOV 1991 it is moving us a long way on the road towards an intellectual property régime for plants which is not far short of a patent system.  This is the direction in which we are going.  The Minister acknowledged this and invoked UPOV as if it is something of which we should be proud and pleased.  I do not believe this is the case.  Neither do I believe that all these varieties are new.  They may be newly discovered to Europe but may not necessarily simply be the product of the intellectual resources of the companies concerned.  It is the interest of companies which is at stake.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the phraseology: &ldquo;. a fair return on the investment made in their varieties from all the persons making commercial use of such varieties .&rdquo; There is also a very sinister passage:</P>
      <P>These are cascading provisions.  Unless the breeder has had a reasonable opportunity to exercise his right in relation to propagating material of the protected variety, he can exercise his right in relation to harvested material obtained through unauthorised use of such propagating material.</P>
      <P>In other words, I can see a situation where, for example, someone would own the patent in material.  I would like to put on record what the situation is with regard to the ownership of patents in Third World countries.  According to the World Intellectual Property Organisation, citizens and corporations of industrialised countries hold 95 per cent of patents in Africa, 85 per cent of patents in Latin America and 70 per cent of those in Asia.  The patent system operates for the northern economies.  We bleat continually about our concerns about famine, yet we steal the intellectual property rights of people.  Africa is rent by famine, but 95 per cent of its patents are owned by America.  We are facilitating them in giving them the right not only to colonise these unfortunate people, to steal their genetic material, and then to patent it, but they have these cascading rights.  As a good republican, I oppose these cascading rights of the capitalist régimes of the western world.  It is outrageous that we are moving in this direction and I will strongly oppose the Bill for this reason.  Other methods can be found to safeguard the real interests of traditional seed merchants in Ireland, for example, who have worked to produce certain useful varieties of grass.  However, let us not fool ourselves.  This is part of a rolling system which will damage the world economy and which, for various technical reasons, will not even increase plant diversity or strength; it will weaken plants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1435" /> Let us look at organisations that work in this area.  Monsanto, recently convicted of criminal charges in the United States, said not long ago that its job was not to protect people from the possible malign impact of its products; it was the governments.  Let us see governments do that job.</P>
    <P>I spotted this during the GATT negotiations.  It is a technical area and we all feel diffident about it because we are not trained as scientists.  I listened with respect to Senator O'Brien because he is a farmer.  I am neither a scientist nor a farmer but I try to keep up to date with the documents that come from Brussels and I am sometimes alerted by matters that worry me.  When I noticed this matter during the GATT negotiations, the argument being made was that the absence of strong intellectual property rights in developing countries was a barrier to trade which was costing industrialised countries approximately $200 billion in lost royalties per annum.  The TRIP agreement was expressly designed to ensure that intellectual property rights could be universally applied to all technologies, especially those which had previously been declared unsuitable for monopoly rights at national level.  This is clearly moving us in the direction of monopolies.</P>
    <P>This legislation is being used to establish monopolies over plant types and varieties.  Every time I think of this I remember the remarkable native American chief who was eventually coerced into ceding property rights to the federal government. He plaintively said that it was outside his imaginative scope to understand how people could claim to own the sky or the earth.  We are now claiming ownership of plants, and I am not fooled into thinking that all these plants are completely the product of western ingenuity.</P>
    <P>These technologies include pharmaceutical products and biological materials such as plants and micro-organisms, all of which must now be eligible for private property rights.  The idea of extending patents to biodiversity was strongly resisted by developing countries during the GATT negotiations.  This was based on evidence that monopolies in the areas of food and health harm the interests of the world's poor and efforts to conserve and make genetic resources available. The new commercial opportunities opened up through developments in biotechnology have resulted in a massive campaign to wrest market control over biodiversity through the patent system, as well as to change the rules of that system in the process.</P>
    <P>Why would the developing countries not oppose this regime?  We own 95 per cent of what they are naturally entitled to own.  We have passed through the celebration of the Famine, and we have bellyached and whinged about how the British administration engaged in <i>laissez faire</i> capitalism to the disadvantage of the people of that time, yet we are co-operating with these macro-economic structures in order to visit the same kind of situation on the people of the under-developed world.  The justification for this <Col N="1436" /> is an economic one: it will be good for business, it will inspire people to do research, without patents companies will not invest in genetic engineering and without genetic engineering we cannot feed the world.</P>
    <P>A number of assumptions are made.  The first is that intellectual property is a matter of national sovereignty and policy because it establishes monopolies, which are in themselves dangerous. Historically, countries have taken great care with national intellectual property rights systems in order to protect the balance between private incentives and the public interest but the possibility of doing so is now forfeited to serve the imperative of the TRIPs agreement.  Biodiversity represents cultural and ecological heritage developed over generations and upon which our collective survival depends.  Subjecting this heritage to a legal regime of commercial monopoly rights will destroy the conditions for its conservation and sustainable use, especially by communities, and thereby destroy society's access to diverse food and medicine.</P>
    <P>Examining the situation where such a regime has been implemented would be helpful as we can learn from mistakes made there.  The obvious example is the United States.  The rare studies conducted in countries where plant variety protection has been in effect for decades, such as the United States, show that this kind of legal system has resulted in little impact in terms of stimulating plant breeding, reduced information and germplasm flows from the private to the public sector and a decreased role for public plant breeding.  Inevitably, there are increased seed prices for farmers, and farmers should look at the long-term situation if we become involved in this.</P>
    <P>They will make plenty of money for the commercial interests and will pay a higher price for seed.  Let us look at meat.  Farmers are on television every night saying that they are not getting a fair price and that they are stuck at profit levels that existed three or four years ago, yet the consumer is paying more all the time.  Beware of being enticed by this carrot of an increased revenue yield to farmers &mdash; it will be the multinational corporations and people who hold patents which they should never have been allowed hold, who will make the profits.</P>
    <P>The rules set by UPOV hinge on genetic conformity as a requirement for monopoly rights. They also exact payments for farmers, the source of biodiversity on which breeding is based. Neither system, patent nor PVP, has any mechanism for sharing benefits between IPR holders and germplasm or knowledge donors, a requirement that is squarely embedded in the CBD objectives.</P>
    <P>I always find it very irritating when people pose as having greater knowledge than they do by using a few initials.  I think some people invent these initials &mdash; they talk about the PRSQ &mdash; and nobody dares penetrate it.  However, for the record, the CBD is the Convention on Biological Diversity, which was part of the Rio Earth Summit Treaty.  Seen from the perspective of the Convention <Col N="1437" /> on Biological Diversity, the rights conferred by TRIPs over biological resources are astonishing.  By 2000, developing countries will have to implement a regime of private property rights on their own biodiversity for the benefit of northern transnational corporations.  The West, particularly the United States, owns 95 per cent of this property in Africa, where there is famine. Such countries will be required to submit to this regime by 2000.</P>
    <P>I am really worried about the situation which is developing here.  This is not the end of this system but the beginning.  It may be soft sold as the introduction of a system but I am warning about what is coming next.  It is all part of a move by western monopoly capitalism to increase its profits as the result of naked greed.  I have no doubt it will cause difficulties for people who are disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>I also received a document from sources close to the European Parliament research unit about the <i>sui generis</i> trap of the TRIPs situation, to which the Minister of State referred.  The implementation of the <i>sui generis</i> option for plant varieties under TRIPs means that, first, the majority of developing countries will need to provide some form of intellectual monopoly right on food and medicinal biodiversity for the first time; second, many countries may be lured into adopting the UPOV model of PVP, which imposes genetic uniformity as a legal requirement for monopoly rights; and, third, developing countries might rush to join UPOV before the 1978 Act closes &mdash; which it will, as the Minister of State knows, in April 1999.</P>
    <P>Seed prices will rise in poor countries and the seeds will be tailored by transnational corporations to suit their related commodity market interest in agri-chemicals processing and trade. Farmers' access to diversity, their choice of planting material and options for management systems will be significantly impaired.  Farmers' rights to save and exchange seed will be legally restricted, if not prohibited, because of protection granted only to the holders of the interests of monopolies. Varieties further selected by farmers from those with IPRs will be considered genetic derivations, falling under the extensive legal ownership of the original IPR holder.  I am delighted the Minister of State used the word &ldquo;cascade&rdquo;&mdash; we will be drowned in this cascade if we are not careful.</P>
    <P>The top seed companies will further consolidate their control of the industry, with 40 per cent of the world market already in the hands of ten firms.  Corporations will be able to secure legal ownership of plant varieties which contain genetic information obtained from farmers' own fields in the South, which they will then sell back to them with an added royalty charge.  Does the Irish public realise this is the kind of piracy we are at?  We are taking over genetic material from the most deprived people on the planet, forcing it to be registered internationally and then, as if they were not poor enough, we are exacting royalties from them for planting their own seeds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1438" /> The biodiversity and associated community knowledge systems which form the basis of the adaptability of agriculture to population and other pressures will be lost.  Food security and agricultural innovation will severely decline.</P>
    <P>As I said, I am not an expert on these matters but this worried me when it came through under the GATT negotiations quite a number of years ago.  I sought some briefings on it and everything I have read and all the information I put on the record of the House today makes me more worried about it.  It is scandalous that a country with our record and history of starvation and the operation of <i>laissez faire</i> economics under an imperial control system in the last century should &mdash; perhaps unwittingly or without due examination &mdash; give in to these interests in Europe which are not in the general interests of humanity at large.  It may be ineffective to do so, but I will oppose the Bill and I will seek an opportunity to vote against it.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill.  I wish to open with what Senator Tom Hayes said &mdash; to every book its cover, to every cow its calf.  That is what we are talking about in this Bill.  Senator Norris addressed what will happen tomorrow.  We might have some comments to make on that, but of course with less dramatics.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill, the purpose of which is to facilitate Ireland's ratification of the 1991 International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants &mdash; the UPOV convention &mdash; and to take into account the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2100/94, which set up the community plant variety rights system.  The UPOV convention was signed in 1991, at which stage the terminator gene technology was not an issue because people were not aware of it.  It was a new concept, which I will address later.  The Bill is straightforward.</P>
      <P>Ireland acceded to the convention in 1981 and adopted the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) Act, 1980, to establish a system of plant breeders' rights in this country.  As the Minister of State said, the Irish plant breeding interests at the time needed protection against the infringement of varieties bred by them, many of which are also exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country must have access to optimum varieties of agricultural crops, which might not have been available to us without a national system to protect plant varieties.  As a food producing island, we need access to top variety seeds to produce good quality food and to maintain market viability.  If we did not sign this convention and bring its conditions into law, we might be denied access to optimum plant varieties which would give good yields.  I have no problem with <Col N="1439" /> supporting the Bill and I am pleased the Minister of State has brought it before us.</P>
    <P>The central principle of the UPOV Convention is that the breeder of a new variety of plant is granted a title of protection.  The effect of this title is that the breeder has the exclusive right to:</P>
    <P>&mdash; reproduce and sell reproductive material of the variety, and to authorise others to do so on conditions which he may specify throughout the territory where he has been granted plant breeders' rights, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; to apply to the appropriate authorities in other UPOV Convention states to have the same rights granted to him in respect of his variety.</P>
    <P>Breeders are thus enabled throughout the territories of the contracting parties to the convention to obtain royalties for reproduction of their plant material and protection against infringements of their rights.</P>
    <P>The 1991 UPOV Convention was substantially revised in 1991 and Ireland signed, subject to ratification, on 21 February 1992. There was a weakness in the earlier UPOV Convention from the unqualified nature of the breeders' exemption. The breeders' exemption is the cornerstone of the plant breeders' rights system in that a plant variety may be freely used to create new varieties by crossing two varieties and selecting from their progeny a variety which will be better than the original.  However, the production of an essentially derived variety from the protected variety could be done by using modern plant improvement methods such as selecting mutations, backcrossing or genetic modification without having to pay royalties.  This gave rise to an abuse known as cosmetic breeding which the Minister mentioned and which has been tackled by extending the scope of the plant breeders' rights to essentially derived varieties.</P>
    <P>I am happy to endorse the Bill which will give breeders greater control over their protected varieties of plants to take account of developments in plant breeding technology and provide that the holder of rights in the essentially derived variety cannot exploit the variety without the permission of the holder of rights in the initial variety.  The holders concerned will have to reach an agreement so that the variety concerned can be exploited.  If they fail to agree, the holder of the rights in the essentially derived variety may apply to the Controller of Plant Breeders' Rights for a compulsory licence, which can be granted in the public interest; extend the scope of protection to cover additional acts in relation to propagating material of the protected variety and to harvested material where this has been obtained from unauthorised use of propagating material; extend protection to the entire plant kingdom; allow the marketing of varieties for up to 12 months before an application for plant breeders' rights is submitted; provide for a minimum period for the grant <Col N="1440" /> of rights and for certain plant genera and species for a maximum period of grant of rights; provide provisional protection to all applicants from the date of publication in the Official Journal of Plant Varieties until the date on which the rights are granted &mdash; during that period applicants will be entitled to reasonable compensation for acts within the scope of the breeder's right done by others during that period; and provide that farmers who sow seed saved from a previous harvest on their land will have to pay to holders of rights equitable remuneration which will be sensibly lower than the royalties charged from certified seed sold in this country.  I ask the Minister for a better definition of the term &ldquo;sensibly lower&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that this provision is similar to that adopted under the Community plant variety system.  Farmers who are designated as small farmers will be exempt from paying this charge.  A person is designated as a small farmer if, in the case of cereal seed and oil and fibre plants, they grow plants on no more than 15.13 hectares &mdash; 37.4 acres &mdash; including pasture established less than five years, in the case of seed of fodder plants if they grow them on no more than 15.13 hectares and in the case of potatoes if they grow them on no more than 6.3 hectares.  This matter requires clarification.</P>
      <P>I come from an area where grain is a typical crop.  Seed wheat, barley &mdash; both malting and feed &mdash; and oats are substantial crops in the area in which I reside.  From time to time farmers with a good strain or variety of barley or wheat would wish to retain a couple of tonnes of seed for the following year.  If a farmer has 100 acres, for example, may he use farm saved seed on 37.4 acres?  The Minister comes from an area in which there is intensive grain growing.  Will he clarify that point and recognise that a portion of grain grown from farm saved seed is an important part of farm husbandry?  We are not talking about sowing 1,000 acres of farm saved seed, but only a small proportion to make the job easier and to make the farmer more competitive.  In these difficult times for grain growing, we need to protect that interest.  If that is the definition of a small farmer, I have no problem with it.  If not, I will have something else to say.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With less enthusiasm and dramatics than Senator Norris, I would like to deal with an issue of concern to me.  I share some of the concerns expressed by Senator Norris but, as I said at the outset, the UPOV Convention was signed in 1991 and terminator gene technology was not known at that time.  The convention could not consider something which was not known.  There is a need to look at the way in which multinationals have entered into the grain assembly practice.  Senator Norris referred to Monsanto which has acquired two enormous grain assemblers in the United States.  It is before the United States Government seeking patent rights.  That would confirm what <Col N="1441" /> Senator Norris said and I would share that concern if the multinationals were given a patent which gave them an almost exclusive right to worldwide rights.  If they become the owners of plant breeder assemblies, we would face severe difficulties.  Speaking as a farmer, I see an enormous difficulty.  The Minister who is an enlightened member of that community will also see that difficulty and why it should be addressed.</P>
    <P>The seed industry worldwide accounts for about $40 billion in sales annually.  The commercial value of seed used by farmers globally is estimated at somewhere between $60 billion and $75 billion, so one can see that there is substantial use of farm saved seed.  Reference was made to the Third World and I am aware of the convention held in Mexico at which South America and other Third World states rejected this development. One can understand that because they have developing economies and they do not want impositions which could lead to exclusions or inclusions of certain things.</P>
    <P>The issue which is of the greatest concern to me and obviously to others in the House is the use and development of terminator gene technology. It would not only apply to plants and seeds.  We import semen from high quality bulls from abroad for dairy and even beef purposes and have high quality male breeding animals. Would terminator gene technology spread as far as this field?  Would that suit us?  The answer is clearly &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  This Bill gives me an opportunity to put down a marker.  This area needs further study and I appeal to the Minister to take this on board and ensure that we are well covered in that regard.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the goal of genetic engineering in food production which is to ensure that food is produced cheaply and in large quantities to avoid the recurrence of famine. Genetic engineering claims to feed the world, but terminator technology gives exclusive control to one or two companies.  This case involves Monsanto and a dangerous development which must be dealt with in the near future.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this matter is nearer to home.  Companies with this technology can hold farmers to ransom when it comes to what they can charge for seed.  A copperfastened farm seed guarantee gives the farmer a bargaining chip to negotiate a more realistic price for his seed.  At present in the US one of the biggest seed producers in the world, Monsanto, is negotiating with the US Government for sole rights to the terminator gene technology patent.  If this happens, we can be sure that this company will introduce this technology in all its seed products.  The size and speed at which Monsanto is growing is dangerous. I have given thought to this matter and I do not make that point lightly.  I am aware of Monsanto's involvement in genetic breeding of sugar beet in Ireland.  I have no problem with that or anything which advances science and technology.  I have been a recipient of pharmaceutical technology in the past and I benefited from it.  However, there <Col N="1442" /> is a point which should not be passed.  This is the point of monopoly and I caution against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I was most interested in the comments made by Senator Norris, Senator Callanan and others.  I have tried to follow the scientific developments in genetic engineering and plant breeding.  While I feel the scientific side is relatively secure, I wish one could get more information when one is trying to establish exactly what is happening in this field.  Senator Dardis has been most kind in trying to get information for me from Monsanto because I was worried about what I thought was its monoculture philosophy regarding the development of seeds and plants.</P>
      <P>While all the information is interesting and useful, it contains absolutely no references.  One has no idea of the scientific papers on which its assertions are made.  It is fine to be told that methods have been tested on different types of soil and leeching does not take place.  However, one would like to be in a position to examine the scientific papers on which these assertions are based so one would know if the tests are done by independent assessors or the company.  I am inclined to think that they are done by the company.</P>
      <P>My concern with the Bill relates to the philosophy behind the current type of plant breeding and the fact that it may lead to a lack of diversity which can be dangerous.  While something may appear to be extremely good and useful now, one may find after one or two generations of breeding that it was not such a marvellous development.</P>
      <P>I am depressed by the assertions that these developments will feed the hungry of the world and save people from famine.  Usually those who starve to death are in areas where sufficient food could be brought to them if transport was possible. Famine takes place because of lack of roads or wars.</P>
      <P>This is also a feminist issue because 80 to 90 per cent of the agriculture of Africa is carried out by women.  Women with hoes will not be in a position to buy any of the modern developments in terms of seeds.  In common with Senator Callanan, my view is that the development of terminator seeds is vaguely immoral.  I am sure that the scientific developments will make some tremendous breakthroughs in various areas, but there is a need to consider the philosophy of the developments in these areas as well as the practical implications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It occurred to me that Edmund Burke on one occasion in the House of Commons <Col N="1443" /> spoke for two and a half days.  I do not intend to do the same on this Bill and I am sure the Leas-Chathaoirleach would not allow me to do so in any event.  There is a temptation to make hay with this matter and to discuss whether it should be plant varieties or cultivar and other similar obtuse points.  However, the Leas-Chathaoirleach will be pleased to hear that I will also resist that temptation.</P>
      <P>I support the legislation and I understand the need for it.  It is reasonable to expect in a society where inventions of every nature are afforded protection that this area, which is effectively an invention in the context of new varieties, should be afforded similar protection.  It is reasonable for the people who are responsible for generating the new varieties to expect protection and to gain some financial benefit.  This is not wrong.  It is the commercial world in which we live.</P>
      <P>However, certain trends within this industry are not wholly desirable.  One is the increasing tendency of Ireland and the United Kingdom to disengage from this activity.  It is widely known that my party, the Progressive Democrats, is very much in favour of removing the State from many areas of commercial and other activity.  However, there are instances where a strong case can be made for State involvement for the benefit of society and mankind.  This is one such area and it is regrettable that over the past 40 years there has been increasing disengagement.</P>
      <P>Many of the leading cereal varieties grown by tillage farmers in Ireland over the past 20 years originated from the plant breeding institute in Cambridge.  Until recently, it was a state body in that it came within the ambit of the university and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. However, this institute, in common with many other bodies, is now in private hands.  This was part of the Thatcherite agenda and I am not sure it is wholly desirable.  The commercial imperative in terms of what emerges by way of new varieties may not always coincide with the societal or common good imperative.</P>
      <P>Many of the institutions in the UK and Ireland, some of which still exist, have a very good record that bears close scrutiny in terms of the benefits they have conferred on their countries, mankind and also the developing countries.  It is noteworthy that the Nobel Peace Prize was won on one occasion by a plant breeder in Mexico, Dr. Borlaug.  This is a measure of what is at stake in terms of plant breeding and welfare.  I am open to correction but in certain parts of Bangladesh and India grain is now in surplus.  It was in huge deficit and the change is primarily the result of the work done in Mexico in terms of the breeding of dwarf wheats.  There are great potential benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris to a large degree in wondering how the developing countries will cope.  I sometimes wonder about the benefits to Ireland of being party to the treaty.  I have considered this matter for some time.  It might be <Col N="1444" /> argued in some quarters that we should not be a contracting party to some international agreements. However, if we were not, while we would not have to pay royalties, many imported varieties on which we depend would not be available to us.  This would throw us back on our own resources and would have a negative effect on the productivity of Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>Over the past 30 years yields have risen by about 2 per cent per annum overall, due partly to improvements in plant breeding and partly to invention of fungicides and modern production methods.  It is a striking advance when viewed over an extended period.  With regard to plant breeding it was argued that in terms of partitioning 50 per cent of the dry matter would come from the grain and 50 per cent from the straw and that it would be difficult to push the grain element beyond a theoretical limit.  I understand that those barriers which in the past were perceived as immutable have been advanced.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a good record in this field.  An example are the achievements of Dr. Harry Keogh in Teagasc at Oak Park, County Carlow. Rooster and Cara potatoes and other varieties were commercialised as a result of his work. Were a plant breeder to come up with two or three varieties over a lifetime he or she would be regarded as a success.  Dr. Keogh has done even more than that.  The benefits from such achievements should accrue to the breeder and the institution to which he or she is attached.  I note that provision is made in the Bill for arrangements to be made between the person who invents the variety, so to speak, and the institution where the person works.</P>
    <P>Varieties of rye grasses and white clover have also been bred at Oak Park by Mr. Vincent Connolly and they have been commmercialised. Many years ago we used to grow Banba, Herta and Beorna barleys because these were the varieties bred in Ireland from the work done in Ballinacurrra, County Cork.  More recently Dr. Eddie Walsh of Lyons Estate bred the Urrin and Boro bean varieties.</P>
    <P>Although we have a good tradition in this regard in Ireland, that work was within the State sector and the benefits which accrued did not result in a large increase in production costs.  It is interesting to note the difference between the prices of grain and seed 20 years ago and their prices now.  At one point in the past we got £120 per tonne for wheat and we get £70 to £80 per tonne for barley nowadays.  The price of seed has not reduced, rather it has increased.  The seed manufacturers can give very plausible reasons for the price increases.  However, I wonder why I must pay £315 per tonne for oat seeds when I am lucky to get £70 per tonne for dried oats off the combine.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge there are commercial realities at play but there are issues about the degree to which the State should disengage and whether we should be a contracting party to the treaties.  On the latter issue, although it may not be wholly <Col N="1445" /> desirable, we do not have much choice.  We must remember that the seed manufacturers are in business for commercial gain.</P>
    <P>The horticulture work being done by Teagasc at Kinsealy is also worth a mention.  In one commendable programme they have gone to some of the country's old gardens, such as that at Birr Castle, and recovered varieties from them which would have disappeared otherwise.  Some of the varieties recovered have disappeared from the gardens recently.  It is apparent that quite a few of the varieties are likely to be propagated and may go on to commercial use.  It was a worthwhile project on which Teagasc should be commended.</P>
    <P>The issue of genetically modified organisms is relevant to the debate.  In a few years time we will have to deal with legislation to address the issue. The Department of the Environment and Local Government has produced a consultation paper on genetically modified organisms and the environment. What emerges from the report is the multiplicity of Departments and agencies with responsibilities in this regard.  The report indicates that environmental control is only one aspect and that other aspects include regulation of the marketing of novel foods for which the Department of Health and Children is responsible, a directive on the marketing of plant protection products for which the Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible and a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of exposure to biological agents at work for which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible.</P>
    <P>There will be a need to come to grips on this issue because the technology is advancing at a rapid rate and it will present difficulties unless legislation keeps up with it.  The issue that needs to be addressed is whether the gene or the variety will be patented.  If it is the gene that will be patented it may or may not be a matter for the controller and the Department; if it is the variety derived from the recombination or insertion of a gene, it will be a matter for the controller and the Department.</P>
    <P>The definition of a variety in section 2 refers to the expression of the characteristics resulting from a given genotype or combination of genotypes, the distinction from other plant groupings and being considered as a unit.  Where does the genetically modified organism fit into that category? Does a variety which has been created by the insertion of a gene fall within the definition?</P>
    <P>There have been great advances in Senator Henry's professional field, that is medicine, as a result of biotechnology.  Insulin is a good example.  In the past it had to be extracted from pigs but with the use of biotechnology it can now be manufactured and it is identical to naturally produced insulin in every respect.  Some of the opponents of genetically modified organisms trot out the tired example of the effects of DDT. There is no question that it did great environmental damage, especially to the top end of the food chain.  However, we should not forget that it <Col N="1446" /> saved millions of lives in Africa.  All technological advances have attendant gains and risks.  It is a matter of balancing the two, having the proper regulation in place and allowing the environmental agency to make judgments on whether the crops should be grown here.</P>
    <P>It is also a matter of doing research in Ireland to ensure that the information emerges which is relevant to our conditions.  It is correct to take and consider information from other countries but there are climatic and husbandry circumstances prevailing in Ireland which do not prevail elsewhere.  There are varieties which are well suited to Irish agriculture but which did not work well elsewhere.  A classic example of this is Midas barley which has a high susceptibility to brown rust.  It could not be grown in east England because the climate there was favourable to brown rust but the variety was very successful here.  Unless varieties are tested in Ireland it is probable that unsuitable varieties will be introduced to Irish agriculture.  Given Agenda 2000 and the imperative to ensure that we have the best technology available to us, it is essential that the testing continue on the varieties, even if they are imported varieties or varieties which will generate royalties.</P>
    <P>One of the concerns with the Bill has to do with the length of time which the protection would be afforded to the variety.  If one takes the breeding of a potato, for example, one is looking at the order of eight or ten years before one gets to the field.  Therefore, the breeder of the potato has submitted his or her application to the controller but it will take quite some considerable time before that potato actually gets into the field.  For example, some of the classical varieties, such as Wilja in Holland, have been on the market for about 100 years.  It has been available commercially for a long time.  I wonder whether the 30 year limit is sufficient.  I do not propose to table an amendment in that regard but I wonder about it.  I think it was 35 years in the case of potatoes &mdash; the Minister can correct me if I am wrong.  I wonder whether the limit is long enough and whether it should be longer.</P>
    <P>As to some of the sections of the Bill, one of my other questions relates to section 4 and the controller.  Almost everything else is defined at the start of the Bill but the controller is not defined.  I expect, and I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong, it is defined in the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Section 3 states that &ldquo;the Government may by order declare one or more foreign countries, which foreign country, or each of which foreign countries, shall be one whose government or any of whose departments of state is a party to the convention or agreement, to be a Contracting Party for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;.  I do not have any difficulty about that statement but I wonder do we have the competence to do it.  Can we declare what another country should be?  I do not know if we are allowed do that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> The matter of the genetically modified organisms relates to the essentially derived variety which is dealt with under section 5.  This again relates to the question of GMOs.</P>
    <P>Hybrid varieties are certainly of interest.  There have been attempts over several years to introduce hybrid wheats.  Of course they exist in the horticultural area where they are quite widespread. There were always great claims as to what they might achieve but the delivery has not been quite as good as the hype which attached to them when it was being done.</P>
    <P>There are several other queries but we can probably deal with them on Committee Stage if that is necessary.  To return to the question of home saved seed, I am one of the people who indulged in the practice of saving seed at home. The Minister can by regulation remove the obligation in certain circumstances.  There is the question of the small farmers having to pay royalties on home saved seed, but I wonder who is ever going to come after me.</P>

      <P>In practice, where is the police force?  The penalties under the Bill largely mean that it is a matter of civil action by the people who own the variety rather than the unit within the Department arriving on my farm to tell me to promptly desist or divvy up the money and go away.  When the Department arrives at my farm to tell me that I must pay the royalties I will then resort to section 19(1)(a) and state that an authorisation in relation to a protective variety shall not be required for any act done for private and non-commercial purposes.  I would argue most vigorously in the present circumstances that my farming activities are assuredly not for commercial purposes at least not until the area aid cheque arrives from the Department.</P>
      <P>On that somewhat frivolous note I thank the Minister for his attendance.  It is not my intention to oppose the Bill.  I support its passage through the House and I hope it will have the effect which the Department desires for it.</P>

      <P>I thank all those who contributed to this essentially technical Bill. Senator Tom Hayes raised the GMO concerns.  It is the role of the bio-tech directive rather than the plant breeder directive to police the GMOs. Of course that is under the EPA also.  Senator Hayes asked whether the Bill controls the rate of royalties.  It does not.  This is strictly a matter for the breeders.  The controller has no role whatever in regard to the royalties but high royalties are essentially restricted by the price of seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the matter of patents. Plant breeders' rights systems are, in all EU countries, based on a unique system of plant protection and they are different from the patent system. <Col N="1448" /> If new varieties cannot be protected, who would bother improving varieties and who would bother making all the improvements which have been made over many years?  It costs between £1.5 million and £2 million to breed a new variety over a ten year period &mdash; for example, in the case of a new grass or cereal variety, so we must in fairness protect those who invest in research and development.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris raised the issue of bio-diversity concerns.  Bio-diversity conservation also deals with the conserving of public genetic materials and those found in the wild.  Plant breeders' rights deals with the private property and breeders are entitled to protect their creations.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris spoke about cascading effects. These are restricted under the UPOV Convention and the breeder must collect his or her royalties on propagating material at the earliest opportunity.  It is only in restricted circumstances that breeders can collect royalties on harvesting material, cut flowers and protected products derived from the harvested material, that is perfumes, etc.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan asked what are sensibly lower royalties.  It would probably take a court of law to decide that.  However, essentially sensibly lower royalties are practised in Ireland and some 50 per cent of the royalties are charged on the certified seed of cereals.  This figure was agreed between the IFA, grain growers and the Irish Plant Royalty Office.  Therefore, it is officially done.</P>
    <P>Senator Callanan asked what is the definition of a small farmer.  A small farmer is one who produces no more than 37 acres of cereals.  If he produces more than 37 acres, he must pay the royalties on the use of farm saved seed of a protected variety on his farm.  That is, if he grows 100 acres of barley from the farm saved seed, he pays 50 per cent royalty.  It is sensibly lower.  If the Senator wants to stand up here and say that he is reproducing from it, as a previous Senator admitted in the House, he is inviting people to visit him and look for their royalties.</P>

      <P>I notice the Senator did not state that he had a vested interest.</P>
      <P>The terminator systems, to which Senator Callanan referred are protected under the bio-tech directive.  Plant breeders' rights have no role in excluding a variety containing such a gene. However, the EU seed directives which control marketing may be the best avenue to use to prevent such varieties being sold.  It is important to state that it has nothing to do with this Bill but it can be done under the marketing section.  There is a common interest in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concerning generic resources, to which Senator Dardis referred, the Department of Agriculture and Food provides £50,000 annually to conserve old varieties of plants and rare breeds of animals like the Dexters.  Old varieties of breeds <Col N="1449" /> provide the building blocks for the new varieties. That is something which is not often appreciated.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis asked if inserting a gene to improve variety constituted a genetically modified organism.  One can patent the gene but not the variety.  The variety with the inserted gene can only be protected by the plant breeders' rights.  He also asked about the duration of rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1450" /> In the case of potatoes, the rights are of 30 years duration.  The first ten years of production of a new potato variety is usually used to multiply the variety.  The EU limits protection for potatoes to 30 years.  It can be extended to 35 years under the EU regulation by legislation and, under such legislation, by statutory instrument.</P>

    <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Plant breeders' rights shall not apply to a variety containing a terminator system, where the inclusion of such a system inhibits the use of seed defined under the &lsquo;farm saved seed exemption&rsquo; referred to in section 19(1)(d) of the Plant Varieties (Proprietary Rights) (Amendment) Act, 1998.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The reason for my amendment is the commercial value of seed used by farmers globally which has been estimated at between $60 billion and $75 billion.  The difference in these values is due to the widespread farm practice known as plant back or farmers' privilege.  Farmers often plant seed saved from a previous year's harvest for next year's production instead of purchasing certified seed from a seed company.</P>
      <P>This practice is particularly common in the major field crops of high commercial value such as wheat and soya bean.  To a lesser extent, it is common in some production regions for cotton and for potatoes in this country.  Because these crops are over-pollinated parent plants transfer traits uniformly through seed to the progeny plants.  Thus, for these crops, as long as the farmer is satisfied with the performance of the previous year's crops, there is a limited incentive to purchase seed.</P>
      <P>Generally, the price of over-pollinated seed is a small premium over the commodity value of this seed.  The premium is based on the cost of cleaning and conditioning the seed plus a charge to offset breeding of improved varieties.  Only the hybrid crops, where progeny segregate into non-uniform populations with varying traits relative to their parent plants, is a practice of plant back selection.</P>
      <P>However, with the onset of the new terminator gene technology, companies can prevent second generation progeny from the non-hybrid seed germinating.  The economic climate of this new technology must also be noted.  It comes at a time when many of the larger seed companies are being acquired by major multinational agro-chemical companies.  The recent multi-million pound takeover by Monsanto of Delta and Pine Land See Company, producing an agri-business giant which wholly controls the new seed sterilising technology, is worrying.  Again, it is not the science but the economic appliance of the science which causes major concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a unique opportunity to strengthen our farmer privilege as outlined in section 19 and <Col N="1451" /> to include this proposed amendment so as to legislate for this terminator technology, which was commercially announced on 11 May this year.  The many areas and sections of gene technology must be legislated for in a case by case fashion.  In this case, the amendment outlined will, in a forward thinking manner, allow for such effective legislation.</P>
    <P>This newly patented technique that genetically alters seed so that it will not germinate if replanted a second time could jeopardise the food security of 1.4 billion people as these resource poor farmers in the southern hemisphere depend on farm saved seed.  These farmers are responsible for feeding between 15 per cent and 20 per cent of the world's population.</P>
    <P>Terminative technology is a powerful tool to control the propagation and reproduction of any crop.  The principle of the Bill is to balance the rights of the breeder with that of the farmer to use farm safe seed.  I remind the Minister of the historical background to the farm safe seed section.  The right of the farmer to safe seed to grow a second crop is historically based in the threat of famine.  It allows the farmer to grow a second crop to stave off starvation and ensure the survival of his family. Today we do not have that risk in Ireland but it exists in other parts of the world.  While this legislation will not impact outside the State, it will set down a principle in the Statute Book and leave the door open for less developed countries to follow suit.  For a country which prides itself on helping others facing famine, it will strengthen that position.</P>
    <P>Companies with this new technology can hold farmers to ransom in relation to what they can charge for this seed.  A copperfastened farm seed guarantee gives the farmer a bargaining chip to negotiate a more realistic price for this seed.  At present in the United States, Monsanto, one of the largest seed producers in the world, is negotiating with the American Government for sole rights.  If this happens we can be sure that the company will introduce the technology in all of its seed products.  I am aware of the need for the introduction of terminator genes in genetically engineered plants as this prevents their proliferation in the environment.  However, without the amendment which allows farmers to use farm safe seed, it will be obsolete.  Having discussed this with officials in the Department, I have been informed that, on foot of legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, the Minister does not intend to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight other points.  Many countries and humanitarian organisations in the EU and elsewhere now realise the full implications of this technology.  The Dutch Parliament recently moved to oppose the European patent directive by appealing it to the European Court of Justice. The terminator patent was one of the key issues which promoted it to renew its objections to the patent directive.  Rural Advancement Foundation <Col N="1452" /> International has launched an international campaign to stop the negotiations between the American Government and the subsidiary of Monsanto regarding the right to the terminative gene patent.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and leave the power in the hands of farmers and not solely in the hands of a small number of multinational companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  Of course intellectual property has to be protected and I understand why the patent rights are being introduced.  While this legislation only applies to this State, one does appear to subscribe morally to the support of the terminator gene system. Senator Hayes has made a good case in asking how this will appear to Third World countries. We suggest we will give them help then support legislation which will be so detrimental to agriculture in those countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have given serious consideration to the amendment and we have sought advice from the Attorney General. On his advice the amendment cannot be incorporated into the Bill.  Plant breeders enjoy comprehensive rights under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties under the UPOV Convention of 19 March 1991.  Under Council Regulation 2100/94, which came into operation in April 1995, those rights constitute a community plant variety right.  The use of farmsafe seed is not a right but a limited derogation from the community plant variety right.  Ireland is under international obligation to implement the breeders' right but the proposed amendment would instead abrogate the right in order to protect the derogation.  The State has no authority to do this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary purpose of the UPOV Convention is the protection of the rights of plant breeders, thereby establishing the identity of the variety's inventor and the protection of the plant breeder's exclusive right to reproduce and sell reproductive material of the variety and to authorise others to do so.  Article 5 of the UPOV Convention is clear. There shall apply to the plant breeders' rights no condition for protection other than those specified and no provision is made for the exclusion of a variety with a terminator gene.  The use by a farmer of a safe seed, under the UPOV Convention's optional exemption from the plant breeders' rights, is exercised in Ireland under the authority of Article 14 of Council Regulation 2100/94 on plant variety rights, which prescribes the conditions on which the derogation may be given.  It does not include the exclusion of varieties containing terminator genes as a condition to give rise to the derogation on the use of farm safe seed.  The derogation finds expression in section 19 of the Bill, which includes the use by farmers of farm safe seed among the acts exempted from <Col N="1453" /> the requirement of authorisation from the plant breeder.</P>
    <P>The amendment would authorise the complete removal of the plant breeders' right to protect farmers from having to purchase new seed every year.  This conflicts completely with our international obligations and Ireland is not permitted to legislate in this manner.  The UPOV and EU agreements must be implemented as they stand. The plant variety protection system does not reach decisions on whether a variety is a good or bad variety but whether a variety is distinct from other varieties and is sufficiently uniform and stable under Article 5 of the UPOV Convention. Other legal regulations aside, in the EU varieties of agricultural crops cannot be marketed unless it can be shown it has a viable cultivation and use &mdash; VCU.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt the emerging issues relating to new technologies in the plant world will be debated at political and technical levels within the international and European fora.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak to Seanad Éireann and exchange views on the operation of the civil legal aid service provided by the Legal Aid Board.  I will be listening carefully to contributions made by Senators and expect that this discussion will ensure that we are better informed on the situation with regard to the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Legal Aid Board on the production and content of its annual report for 1997. I am sure Senators will agree that the publication is attractive in appearance and laid out in a clear and informative manner, with a useful and a detailed index.  Most importantly, it is full of meaningful information on the services provided by the board, and relevant statistical information presented in an easily understood manner.  It is a <Col N="1454" /> model of clarity which other bodies could emulate when producing annual reports.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board was established in 1979 to administer the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  It provided a legal service in civil matters to people with limited means and operated on an administrative basis until 11 October 1996 when the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, was brought into effect.  Under the Act, as under the scheme, persons who are provided with legal services are required to pay a contribution related to their income.  In many cases, this contribution amounts to £4 for legal advice and £23 for representation in court, although it can be increased where costs or damages are awarded in favour of its client.  In accordance with the terms of the 1995 Act, the Legal Aid Board has the power to waive or reduce the contribution that a client may be required to pay.</P>
    <P>The seminal years of the Legal Aid Board coincided with a serious economic recession and, accordingly, development was slow.  Between 1979 and 1992 the board opened 16 law centres. When the Fianna Fáil led Government took office in late 1992, the board was preparing to open its 16th law centre.  Conscious of the demands which the continuing programme of legislative reform in family law, including proposals for divorce, was making on the board's resources, the Government approved a programme of expansion and development for the Legal Aid Board.  When the present Government took office in June 1997 it continued to provide additional resources to the Legal Aid Board, resulting in a board which provides legal services from a nationwide network of 30 law centres.  The board has a staff of 261, of which 219 are in the law centres.  In 1998 the Exchequer grant will be £9.615 million.  This is in stark contrast with the position prior to the Fianna Fáil led Government coming into office in 1992, when the board comprised 15 law centres, 99 staff and had an Exchequer grant of £2.685 million.</P>
    <P>As a result of the expansion in the number of law centres and the recruitment of additional solicitors and support staff, there has been a significant increase in the number of persons receiving legal services from the board.  In 1997, 7,784 persons received legal advice compared with 3,420 in 1992.  In the same period, the number of applicants provided with legal advice and representation in court increased from 1,854 to 6,021.  Of the 1997 figures, about 96 per cent of court cases and 90 per cent of legal advice cases were in the family law area.  This ratio has remained more or less constant since the establishment of the board.</P>
    <P>The board also operated the private practitioner pilot project for six months between October 1993 to March 1994.  This project has continued to operate in the Dublin area since April 1994.  Under the project, it is open to persons granted legal aid certificates to choose a solicitor from a panel for representation in the District Court in respect of barring orders, maintenance, safety, access, guardianship and <Col N="1455" /> custody cases.  In 1997, 862 people granted legal aid certificates availed of the private practitioner pilot project, a significant increase on the 1996 total of 655 certificates.  The board expects to be in a position to extend the scheme nationwide in the near future.</P>
    <P>The significant increases in the resources allocated to the Legal Aid Board in recent years have facilitated the development of a nationwide civil legal aid service.  However, these developments have been outstripped by the increase in the number of people requesting the services of the board.  This has placed a very heavy demand on the board and has resulted in increasing delays in waiting times for appointments with solicitors. This fact is evident at many of the board's law centres.  The situation has been compounded by the increasing complexity of many classes of cases, especially child care cases, and a consequential increase in the proportion of cases being heard in the higher courts.</P>
    <P>While there are a number of factors involved, the main reasons for the increase in demand relate to the rapid pace of sociological change over recent years.  This has resulted in an increase in the number of families experiencing problems, less reluctance than heretofore on the part of both women and men to acknowledge these difficulties and to seek redress, frequently by recourse to the courts.</P>
    <P>Since the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, there has been a significant increase in the number of legal reliefs and remedies available to people who are experiencing difficulties in their relationships.  Accordingly, the increase in waiting times at the board's law centres can be attributed to a significant degree to the continuing increase in the level of demand on the board's services arising from the introduction in recent years of such additional family law legislation.  The Domestic Violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996, are two of the most important pieces of this new legislation.</P>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Act, which was introduced on 27 March 1996, strengthened the power of the courts to make orders for the protection of persons in the home whose safety or welfare requires it.  Also, it extended that protection to co-habitees and parents.  The Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1997, which came into operation on the 27 February 1997 had an immediate impact on the board.  When that Act came into force, 1,062 persons sought the board's assistance in relation to divorce proceedings and had their names placed on waiting lists.  During the remainder of 1997, a further 1,113 people sought services from the Legal Aid Board for divorce proceedings. Of these, 2,175 people, 957 were on waiting lists at the end of the year while of the 1,146 applications for legal aid certificates relating to divorce proceedings received in the board's head office, 938 were granted.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> Conscious of the deteriorating situation with regard to waiting lists at the law centres, in July 1998 Minister O'Donoghue approved 25 additional posts for the Legal Aid Board.  Of these, 17 posts, including five solicitor posts, are for the law centres.  In addition, he sanctioned the making permanent of six temporary staff in the law centres, three relief solicitors and three clerical officers, and the engagement on a temporary basis of a librarian for head office.  I am confident that these additional staff will be allocated by the Legal Aid Board in such a manner as to make the greatest impact on waiting times at the board's law centres.</P>
    <P>The high incidence of marriage breakdown illustrated by these statistics gives cause for concern, both in financial and human terms, because when a marriage breaks down, children of the marriage are very vulnerable to consequential damage.  Such damage is particularly likely where the marriage has ended in bitterness or where the children do not have a continuing relationship with both parents.  As I have already intimated, changes in the social climate in Ireland over recent years, characterised in terms of increased openness of public discussion and changed social behaviour, have contributed to an increase in awareness among people that society no longer demands that couples should continue in an unsatisfactory, unequal or abusive relationship. Victims of previously unmentioned and hidden abuses, such as domestic violence, incest and rape, are aware that concern for their plight is shared by community and State.  Both are sympathetic to their plight and are involved, separately and collectively, in attempting to alleviate their situation.  In this regard, since 1989, this House has passed a significant volume of legislation extending the range of remedies available to members of families experiencing difficulties in their relationships and providing for easier access to those remedies.  This has had a major impact on the demand for the legal services of the board.</P>
    <P>Conscious of the vulnerability of the family members caught up in such proceedings, and in particular children, more recent legislation has directed people towards counselling and mediation as a means of resolving their marital difficulties, as an alternative to availing of the adversarial judicial systems.  Examples of this are to be found in the 1989 Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, the 1997 Family Law (Divorce) Act and the recent 1997 Children Act, all of which contain provisions requiring that applicants seeking relief under one or other of these Acts would be advised of the availability of counselling and of mediation.  The hope is that by these means the integrity of the family unit would be preserved, notwithstanding difficulty and breakdown in marriage relationships.</P>
    <P>A committee was also established by my Department to co-ordinate services for marriage support and marriage breakdown.  The Legal Aid Board participates fully in this committee.  In <Col N="1457" /> relation to mediation, the board has actively encouraged its solicitors to consider whether cases are appropriate for mediation.  Of course, solicitors are required by the terms of the relevant legislation to advise clients of a range of matters including availability of counselling and mediation.  In pursuit of this objective, the board arranged for the head of the Family Mediation Service, which provides mediation services to separating couples, to speak to its solicitors and law clerks in relation to the availability of its services and the types of cases which are most appropriate for mediation.  When the Family Mediation Service opened its permanent office in Limerick, the board also arranged for a special regional meeting to be held with its solicitors in order to promote the use of mediation.  Following from this meeting, the solicitor in the Tralee law centre encouraged the setting up of a mediation clinic in the Tralee area and this is serviced from the Limerick family mediation centre.  I understand from the board this is working in a most satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995, and its predecessor, the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice, provides that certain criteria must be met before a person will qualify for legal aid.  The most important of these are the means and merits tests.  With regard to the former, there is a statutory requirement that a person must have a disposable income of under £7,350 per annum before he or she will qualify for legal services under the 1995 Act.  Disposable income is defined as the income that remains after various deductions have been made in respect of dependants, mortgage/rent, income tax, social insurance and such like that are incumbent upon a person to pay.  An applicant with such a disposable income would be obliged to pay the maximum contribution while a person with a disposable income of £5,060 or less per annum would be obliged to pay the minimum contribution totalling £27.  I refer Senators to pages 42 and 43 of the board's annual report which give a clear definition of what is required of an applicant in order to qualify for the services of the board.</P>
    <P>A person applying for legal services from the board must also satisfy a merits test with regard to the nature of the case he or she wishes to pursue. Basically, this means that the person concerned must have a case that is sustainable and be reasonably likely to be successful in the court proceedings.  Obviously, it would be a waste of the board's resources to pursue an action which has little chance of success or where, if successful, the benefit accruing to the successful aided person was of nugatory dimensions.  Where the board refuses to provide a person with legal services on whatever grounds, that person may appeal the decision to a committee of the board.</P>
    <P>The board recognises that certain cases will have an urgency attaching to them which is not present in all cases.  Therefore, as a matter of policy, it has directed its staff to provide applicants with priority in certain classes of cases.  The following <Col N="1458" /> is a list of cases falling into this priority category, which is of general application throughout the law centres: child abduction proceedings; circumstances where there is a real danger of children being taken out of the jurisdiction without the consent of the applicant; child care proceedings; domestic violence; where, under the Statute of Limitations, there is a danger of the time limits for issuing proceedings expiring unless immediate action is taken; where there is a danger of time limits in other legislation expiring; where there is a danger that assets may be dissipated so that they would be unavailable to meet the claims of the applicant and, District Court appeals, where the case has been dealt with under the private practitioner project which is run by the board.  A substantial number of appointments are given each month on a priority basis.  For example, 165 of the 910 appointments offered in law centres in September 1998 were for priority matters.  None of those accorded priority was put on waiting lists.</P>
    <P>I hope the circumstances I have outlined will be of assistance to Senators in developing a broad understanding of issues in relation to the Legal Aid Board.  I thank Senators for this opportunity to address them on this important issue and I look forward to hearing their statements on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I echo her compliments to the people who drafted the report of the Legal Aid Board.  It is a model of what such a report should be in that it is clear and the information is well presented.  It also outlines a number of case studies in order that people can see what the board does and what is its core work.  The people who prepared the report are to be complimented.  It is written in clear, well presented English.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech has also been helpful and has provided a fair amount of information. However, I wish to make one small criticism of it.  I do not know why people feel the need to score spurious political points.  The clear implication in the Minister's speech is that the current revival or increase in free legal aid activities can be dated to 1992.  On a number of occasions she referred to the Fianna Fáil led Government being responsible for this.  However, for five years before that, Fianna Fáil was in Government, namely, in the period 1987-9 and the period 198992 with the Progressive Democrats.  The clear impression that Fianna Fáil alone was responsible for the growth in free legal aid is nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person more than anybody else responsible for the growth in legal aid activities is Mervyn Taylor who was part of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government, or the Fianna Fáil led Government to use the Minister's term.  It is not helpful to anybody if for whatever reason we try to disguise the reality.  We are long enough around to know that no Government gets everything right.  Legal aid has been on the agenda for a very long time.  Even before it came into existence <Col N="1459" /> there were people working for it.  Every Government within its economic circumstances has sought to promote it.  If credit is being given I would single out Mervyn Taylor as the person who, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, focused most attention on it.  I was not going to make this point, but the reference by the Minister, which was perhaps inadvertent, slightly irritated me and distorted the reality.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board is a success story.  From small beginnings in 1979 it has grown in a sustained way.  It has a very skilled and dedicated staff and performs a range of valuable and essential services which, were it not for the board, would not perhaps be performed.</P>
    <P>Clearly there are problems which are highlighted in the report.  The biggest problem is the length of the waiting lists which in many cases are now unacceptably long and are likely to become even longer.  Each case on the waiting list represents either a personal tragedy or enormous personal difficulty.  There are real people behind the statistics.  There is stress, emotional disruption, etc., which attends on people who are waiting even for their first appointment.  The delays in some cases are as long as nine months in Kildare and ten months in Offaly.  These delays create their own sense of stress in the board. Those on the board often get a sense of not being on top of things, of struggling against a list which is increasing and of fighting to simply stay afloat. This immersion in the sea of ongoing cases is bad for morale and sometimes makes it difficult for the lawyers to keep up to date with developments in their own area.</P>
    <P>The Minister was very clear about the reason for the increase and I agree with her.  The increase should not have surprised anybody.  We are an increasingly litigious society.  The Legal Aid Board, because it is publicly funded, may find itself more vulnerable than private practices in terms of people seeking its services.  Private practice can either demand money up front or not take a case if it does not suit them.  However, the Legal Aid Board is simply more vulnerable to answering all cases.</P>
    <P>The other reasons for the increase are the very important developments in legislation, especially in family law and child care.  It is fair to say that ten years ago there was virtually no family law. By and large the family courts were inadequate in numbers and for the most part the judges were not particularly well trained to administer family law.  Frequently the family court almost became a punishment detail for a judge who himself had a problem.  This atmosphere has changed dramatically.  Today there is a very developed corpus of family law which culminated &mdash; although I suppose it will never culminate &mdash; in the divorce legislation.  Family courts are more numerous than in the past and the judges for the most part are better trained.  A level of courtesy and understanding prevails in the family courts which did not always exist in the past.  The practitioners <Col N="1460" /> are more professional, even if my own impression is that the services on offer outside Dublin are not as good as those in the city &mdash; I am interested to hear Senator O'Donovan's views.  There is an extra burden and hardship on those in the non-metropolitan area and there is enormous room for improvement.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, the growth in family law has put a huge strain on the services of the Free Legal Aid Board.  From my research I understand the quality of the service being offered by the Legal Aid Board in family law is second to none.  Apart from the delays the quality of the service is first class.  However, it is certain that the need for its services will increase dramatically.  We will need more family law courts and family law judges.  The Legal Aid Board will need significantly more resources in this area.  Otherwise a totally unacceptable backlog will build up which will endanger the entire system.  The warning signals exist in the report and are evident to those involved in family law throughout the country.  The Free Legal Aid Board is only one part of the problem.  However, unless it is provided with more resources in this area it may become submerged by one aspect of its work, namely, family law.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the growth in child care legislation.  In terms of society and legislation we are now starting to catch up after decades of neglect.  We are still at an early stage. Every party and responsible person in the country is serious about facing up to the problems in this area.  However, with this seriousness must come a realisation that huge resources will be necessary and that what we are doing at present is simply not adequate.</P>
    <P>The need for the services of the board will grow, often I suspect in areas which will require dramatic and immediate reaction.  I listened carefully to the Minister and I ask the Free Legal Aid Board to ask itself whether its procedures currently operating in the thankfully rare but dramatic cases of child abduction and parental kidnappings, especially those involving a parent living outside the jurisdiction, are as speedy and flexible as they might be.  I discussed this matter with lawyers involved in such cases and got an impression that while the Legal Aid Board was doing everything by the book and with the best will in the world, there was an absence of a necessary degree of flexibility which can be important. I am not making any charges &mdash; far from it &mdash; but I am simply asking the board to look at its involvement in such cases and satisfy itself &mdash; perhaps it is satisfied &mdash; that its procedures are as flexible and speedy as necessary.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with the Minister on the issue of resources.  The Minister has done very well by the Free Legal Aid Board in the provision of new staff.  The work of the Minister and what he has got from Government is impressive.  However, I wish to make some observations about the way in which resources are deployed.  As I understand it, one of the biggest problems facing the board is <Col N="1461" /> the provision of staffing at the service levels. There is a major shortage of permanent secretarial staff, something which is not uncommon in other areas of the public service, largely due to rates of pay, conditions, etc.  However, there is an over-reliance by the board on temporary staff recruited from agencies, with the result that it is often not possible to build up a sense of permanence, of people being in jobs for a long time and knowing what they are doing.  People can be there one week and gone the next without any opportunity or inducement to become permanently attached to the job.</P>
    <P>I am told that much of the routine work often falls on the shoulders of solicitors, keeping them from doing what should be their core task of looking after clients.  In its own way this adds to the backlog of cases and damages the morale of people who feel they should be doing the work for which they were hired.</P>
    <P>I am told by people connected with the board that the public service aspect tends to make it over bureaucratic.  A former staff member who wishes the board well described it as being top heavy with bureaucracy at times.  That can happen to any organisation in the public service.  Are there too many forms to be filled in?  Is there too much of the Civil Service mentality in the board? Can it look at simplifying its own managerial and procedural arrangements?</P>
    <P>The board should also look at its infrastructure, though it is probably doing so on an ongoing basis.  If one compares the board to equivalent private practices, there is an absence of backup. Office managers and other informational resources are taken for granted in most private offices but sufficient equivalent resources have not been deployed by the board.  If that were done, lawyers would be freed up to get on with their core business.  Through the absence of resources and infrastructure, the offices do not compare with what is taken for granted in progressive private firms, though that is no fault of those working for the board.  If this is the case, it means that those working for the board must put up with second best in many cases.</P>
    <P>Those depending on legal aid should not have to take second best, nor should the selfless lawyers who serve the public in this way, often at considerable financial sacrifice to themselves. They should not be asked to accept a level of backup that would not be acceptable in the private sector.  I may be wrong, but my comments are based on discussions with people who have worked for the board and who want it to be in the strongest position possible to carry out its mandate.  We see the danger signals regarding the deployment of resources and I wish to be helpful in asking whether the board needs to take a hard look at its own organisation.  Generous resources are available from the State, and the best possible service for clients of the board should be given. At the same time, the Minister will fight to get extra resources for the necessary growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> Lest I appear churlish, I compliment the Minister of State on a helpful speech which contained a lot of useful material.  I have no doubt about her commitment and that of her Department to the growth of the board, which is a success story. It is our job to encourage the Government to ensure it remains so and that it grows.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and compliment her on her excellent work, particularly regarding her responsibility for people with disabilities.  She is doing an excellent job.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning, by and large the Legal Aid Board has been a success.  However, I am a legal practitioner in a peripheral area of rural Ireland and the board does not reach out to rural areas.  For example, a person in Castletownbere, Schull or Cahirciveen with a problem &mdash; usually it is a woman having difficulties with her husband or partner &mdash; may need a solicitor urgently to apply for a protection order or barring order.  More often than not she does not have a car, it is over 100 miles to Cork city and there may not be a bus service.  That is the sort of difficulty I see.  A place like Dunmanway is central to many towns in west Cork like Macroom, and it should have a free legal aid centre.  This should be the case with more areas in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>Law practices in rural Ireland witness cases like this every week, most of which involve women with very little money who are in very difficult situations.  Rather than going 60 or 70 miles to a free legal aid centre, they usually end up going to their family solicitors.  More often than not, and I speak in praise of my colleagues, that case is taken on to help out a person whose family has been a client for some time.  A woman may come to my office on Monday morning after a difficult weekend, but the next sitting of the district court is in Kinsale, 80 miles away, in district number 18. If she can get to Cork city, there may be problems with someone from the free legal aid centre going to meet her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the free legal aid centre has been a success, it has not been so in remote areas of rural Ireland.  A pilot scheme has been introduced to use private practitioners, and this is the route to take.  If more free legal aid centres cannot be opened, then solicitors in remote areas such as Dingle, Westport and areas in Clare should be able to take on cases in a way that is similar to the criminal legal aid scheme for a basic fee.  The board cannot reach every remote area.  The pilot scheme is available in Dublin, where it is working reasonably well, as Senator Manning said, though there are delays.  There are serious difficulties in remote areas and people experiencing problems, most of whom are women, should have access to a solicitor.  This work is not very highly paid and some solicitors will not do it, but most offices have a solicitor who would gladly take the work on.  If more legal aid centres cannot be provided in remote areas, this pilot programme should be <Col N="1463" /> expanded.  I ask the Minister of State to examine this issue.</P>
    <P>A huge amount of money has been pumped into the free legal aid system in the past two to three years.  There was a 30 per cent increase in Exchequer funding for the scheme in 1998 over the previous year.  That increase was needed because when the divorce legislation became law in February 1997, there was obviously a huge backlog of cases to be met.  Whether we like it or not, a large number of relationships had broken up, and people happy in other relationships were waiting for the new legislation.  I compliment the Minister on investing those funds in the scheme and urge him to do the same in the coming year. More staff should also be appointed.</P>
    <P>A fault with the criminal legal aid system, particularly in the larger centres such as Dublin, Cork and Galway, is that there are four or five practitioners who may be earning £250,000 per annum.  Judges appoint these lawyers and the Judiciary should examine this matter.  Work should be assigned more equitably because if there is a huge workload people may not get the service they deserve.  The initial free legal aid scheme commenced almost 20 years ago and now there are 222 people working full time for the scheme.  Its budget is close to £10 million and it will probably exceed that next year.  The Government must be complimented on its work in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Manning is right that there was no family law in Ireland 20 years ago when this service began.  It was introduced as an optional subject in 1975 when I was taking my degree in UCC and was made compulsory three or four years later.  Therefore, although I am still in my early forties, when I was training to be a solicitor family law was a new concept.  As Senator Manning pointed out, many people, especially older members of the Judiciary, were not up to speed with the changes in the law when this was thrust upon them in the 1980s and early 1990s.</P>
    <P>The first Act to bring the area of family law into focus was the Family Home Protection Act, 1977, which prevented one spouse &mdash; usually the husband &mdash; from mortgaging or selling the family home over the head of the other spouse.  There was a subsequent plethora of legislation &mdash; at least 12 or 15 Acts &mdash; covering various areas of family law.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Legal Aid Board says this is not a free service.  However, advice costs £4 and handling court cases costs £27.  If one offered any private practitioner £4 for advice he would say goodbye.  That is the reality of the situation.  In essence, the service is very heavily subsidised, which I do not dispute.  The specific guidelines put in place by the Legal Aid Board to compute who is entitled to aid are clearly laid out on page 42 of the report.</P>
    <P>Over 90 per cent of the work of the Legal Aid Board involves family law cases &mdash; maintenance orders, barring orders, protection orders and so <Col N="1464" /> on &mdash; with the remainder involving areas such as landlord and tenant law.  The basic minimum fee charged by any solicitor for handling a fairly straightforward judicial separation or divorce case is about £5,000.  The fee will obviously be much higher for wealthy people with a great deal of property.  People with lower incomes of £10,000 or £12,000 and liabilities such as mortgages would be left in limbo without the help of the Legal Aid Board.  I compliment the board on all its efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>In 1997 some 2,175 persons sought the services of the board, particularly in regard to divorce and legal separation.  That was a huge workload thrust on the board.  The Minister and the Government must be complimented on reacting by providing a great deal of extra staff and funding.  One could argue it was inadequate, but an Exchequer topup of 30 per cent on the previous year must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State that we must look further at mediation in the area of family law.  The lack of knowledge about the availability of mediation and counselling facilities is amazing. The use of such facilities can sometimes avoid trawling through the nitty gritty and airing of dirty linen in court in very contentious separation or divorce cases.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, I do not think the system is entirely fair.  I hope my criticisms will be seen as constructive rather than just nit-picking.  Some 85 or 90 per cent of family law cases are brought by the female partner.  For example, a female partner or wife in rural Ireland whose relationship has broken down and who is living with a partner with whom she cannot get on is under terrible psychological pressure and suffers constant crises at home.  She is advised that she will qualify for help from the free legal advice centre.  In my experience, however, it takes about six weeks to get an appointment, unless it is an emergency, despite the fact that this person could be living under desperate emotionally stressful conditions. It takes a further six or eight weeks after getting an appointment to be assessed for a free legal aid certificate, which is a considerable delay.  The next step is the issuing of proceedings.  In reality, it takes up to three years to get a judicial separation or divorce if one has to rely on free legal aid.</P>
    <P>Some women are forced to borrow £4,000 or £5,000 from friends or credit unions in order to go the quick route, which is regrettable.  In many instances the male partner decides he can put up with the hassle and that he will stick it out.  He ends up getting the full help of the Legal Aid Board while his partner has to pay for it herself.</P>
    <P>Another inequity occurs where a man who has been barred from the home somehow gains entry to the home and terrifies his wife or partner and perhaps their children.  She flees the house, raises the alert in the Garda station and he is arrested. When he is brought from custody the next day to face the district justice for breach of a barring or protection order he is immediately entitled to the <Col N="1465" /> criminal free legal aid system because he is likely to go to jail, while his partner may have to travel 60 or 70 miles to get help.  These aspects must be looked at.</P>
    <P>In case I may appear to be critical of the Legal Aid Board, I wish to say quite emphatically that it has done extraordinary work since its inception in 1979.  However, as someone from rural Ireland, I feel it has not reached the furthest parts of our society.  There are similar problems to those of Dublin in places such as Cork, Schull, Cahirciveen, Dingle, Westport and Ballina.  The two possible solutions are to create more free legal aid centres in peripheral areas &mdash; small offices which would open for two or three days a week &mdash; or the better option would be to extend the private practitioner scheme used in Dublin.  I do not know why it is used in Dublin, which seems to have everything going for it.  Under this scheme private practitioners can receive some compensation &mdash; probably not the going rate &mdash; for giving advice and initiating proceedings.  That must be looked at seriously for parts of rural Ireland, otherwise, there will be a major flaw in the facilities of the board.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I congratulate the board on producing a very succinct, concise, colourful and imaginative report which is easily read.  I also laud the Minister of State on her contribution today.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  She was a valued colleague when we fought side by side on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights.  Anything I say should not be taken as a criticism of this Minister.  There is a problem of scarce resources as we all know. I did battle here, not with any malice or in a partisan fashion, with my dear old friend Mervyn Taylor on this very issue.  I remember fighting to try to get the remit of the Legal Aid Board extended to cover other cases which were excluded.  The reason he gave was that there were not enough resources but he gave undertakings that the Government and Department would make the best possible effort to ensure that the cases which came before the board were effectively serviced.</P>
      <P>I note from the report that the Legal Aid Board indicates that there is a substantial increase in the number of cases.  This is worrying because they are very human situations.  When one gets to law, it is usually the end of a rather tragic series of events which have a personal dimension.  Waiting or hanging around is an additional strain which we should try to keep to a minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that the situation is far worse than that indicated in the Legal Aid Board's report for 1997.  The situation has become <Col N="1466" /> dramatically worse since the figures were compiled. I refer to an article in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 25 October 1998, indicating a 300 per cent increase in the waiting period in many of the areas serviced by the board.  Since June 1997, the period covered by this report, it has increased 300 per cent, so the delays are much worse.  The worst hit area is the South Mall in Cork where people seeking legal aid face a wait of 19.5 months compared with five and a half months in the previous year.  Wicklow is also badly hit where the waiting period is 19 months whereas up to June 1997 it was ten months only.  In Galway the waiting period is 17.5 months compared to four and a half months in June 1997.  The situation in Newbridge is similar.</P>
    <P>Of the 30 legal aid centres around the country, ten have waiting lists of over ten months and a further six centres have a delay of over six months compared to a national average of four months last year.  It is a real crisis.  The Legal Aid Board indicates that it is changes &mdash; welcome changes I may say &mdash; in family law which have greatly increased the need.  It attributes it to the domestic violence Act, 1996, and the Family Law (Divorce) Act, 1996.  I have a table with all the increases listed.  I have given a representative selection, so I will not place all the statistics on the record of the House.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a further dimension to this issue.  I have been in touch with the Free Legal Aid Advice Centre.  It is interesting that the Legal Aid Board indicates that this massive increase is due to family law situations and that the over-whelming burden of its cases are in this area.  If it is true, as the board suggests, that 96 per cent of court cases and 90 per cent of legal advice cases are in the family area, why has this happened? Why is there this enormous preponderance because it leads to a type of distortion?  Is the Legal Aid Board concerned about this curious imbalance in its case work and what are the proposals to redress it?</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts there is a high take up of services in the area of family law.  However, the experience of FLAC suggests there is an equally heavy take up in other areas and a similar demand for advice, assistance and information. FLAC runs a telephone service, an information referral line, which shows a different picture. Each year the statistics from the service FLAC runs show that family law queries make up 25 per cent only of calls and the remaining areas comprise employment, housing, consumer issues, death, personal injury and social welfare law.  The imbalance is not reflected in the report of the board.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons, as the Minister knows well, is that many of these categories are excluded from the remit of the board, and this is the area in which we argued with Mervyn Taylor.  I remember him saying that the resources simply were not there.  I tabled an amendment which was passed but the Minister deleted it in the Dáil.  He was afraid the whole system would collapse.  It <Col N="1467" /> shows there is a large demand if we are really talking about free legal aid being available to people in critical areas.  This means people with cases under the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, the Payment of Wages Act or the Redundancy Payments Act cannot get legal aid regardless of their income level or the merits of their case.  These are the areas in which the boot really pinches.</P>
    <P>Similarly, a person whose social welfare payment has been cut cannot get legal aid and the claim is brought before a social welfare appeals officer.  These cases are taken to vindicate income generating rights and those are pretty fundamental to the people's survival and welfare.  The right to redundancy and welfare payments are the type of rights most relevant to those on low incomes or living on the threshold of poverty.</P>
    <P>I know it has been argued that these tribunals are designed to be informal dispute resolution mechanisms but the experience of FLAC suggests that with developments in law, particularly European law, increasingly cases brought before these tribunals involve complex issues of law which the ordinary person might not understand and for which they would need proper legal advice to be able to deal with them.  The action taken by more than 70,000 married women for arrears in social welfare due for the period 1984 to 1986 is a good example of the legalistic nature of many of these claims with which the average person would not be able to deal.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the imbalance in favour of family law is that the board does not publicise its service and many people remain unaware of it. The board should have a programme of public advertising so that people are aware of their entitlements.  I recognise this would gum up the system even more but if people, including the most vulnerable, are entitled to a service, we should ensure they know they are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>The waiting time is really pretty chronic and difficult at the moment.  This issue was addressed by Mervyn Taylor when he introduced the Family Law (Divorce) Act.  He said resources for legal aid would be increased to cope with the additional load.  Obviously, whatever the good intentions, not enough resources have been made available as yet.</P>
    <P>There are about 5,000 solicitors in practice at the moment and the number employed by the board is 82.  The number entitled to the use of this service is 870,000.  Some 82 solicitors are expected to service the needs of one third of the contentious population while nearly 5,000 private solicitors serve the remainder.</P>
    <P>An important point is the extension of the use of private practitioners.  However, there is one important caveat here which is that the use of private practitioners for District Court applications only should be discontinued.  The reason is that if a client is appointed a solicitor, they should be able to have that solicitor right through to the conclusion of the case and not have to <Col N="1468" /> change horse mid-stream.  It is terribly confusing and damaging to a case if a private solicitor makes the application but the minute the case is about to go through the court system, there is a change of solicitor.  That is unfair.  The means test was established in August 1995 but the criteria have not yet been reviewed.  It is obvious that four years down the line they should be reviewed again and brought into line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Norris for sharing his time.  I congratulate the Minister on her speech.  Like other Senators, I pay tribute to Mervyn Taylor for what he did for the free legal aid scheme.  Huge improvements were made to the scheme during his time in office and I am sure the Minister will do what she can also.  The delays are very worrying and Senator Norris rightly pointed out that they are apparently worse than recognised in the report.  In terms of the delays mentioned in the report, of the 2,175 people who came to the service in 1997 regarding judicial separations and divorce, 957 were still on the waiting list at the end of the year.  As Senator Manning pointed out, many of these cases are very traumatic and emotional and such long delays are very difficult for those involved.</P>
      <P>I support the suggestion of Senators O'Donovan, Manning and Norris that more use should be made of private practitioners.  It might even be cost effective.  It would be worth considering the cost of the private scheme and examining whether private practitioners, following training, could be appointed as satellite officers in areas where there is no legal aid office.</P>
      <P>A great number of the cases mentioned in the report involved drugs, drink and violence.  These are extremely serious, especially where the care of children is involved.  As I have requested previously, I ask the Minister to consider whether something can be done about getting independent reports for the courts on family law cases. Several Acts, including the Family Law (Divorce) Act, other family law Acts and the Child Care Act, state that the Judiciary should be in a position to ask for independent reports on family cases.  The Probation and Welfare Service prepared reports on a grace and favour basis up to two years ago.  It had to stop because of the increase in the number of criminal cases with which it had to deal.  Independent reports could be prepared by the Probation and Welfare Service or the health boards.  However, they are both overworked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise the social services are very much overworked but when one considers the number of times cases must go to court, part of the problem for the Legal Aid Board is that it does not have enough back-up.  Cases go to court without independent assessments and I am sure many judges would prefer to have these reports rather than, as some of them have done, visit houses to see the family circumstances for themselves or interview <Col N="1469" /> children in their chambers.  This is a job for the professionals.</P>
    <P>It is most important that there are sufficient social workers to deal with the cases which come to the free legal aid scheme.  In some cases, lack of social workers may mean that the courts have more work.  For example, a serious case is mentioned in the report where a couple separated. The wife had an addiction problem and the husband had a previous problem, although he had been rehabilitated.  There already had been problems dealing with this couple and when an emergency care order was sought for a child, a student social worker became involved.  Further communication problems arose which resulted in a confrontation between the father and the social workers.  An assault took place and, as a result, the health board issued further proceedings.</P>
    <P>Was somebody sent out on that case who was not capable of dealing with it?  In the heel of the hunt, either the father or the mother may have faced a criminal charge.  I know resources are scarce but it is most important in these cases, each of which appears more serious than the next, to try to ensure that there is proper professional help.  There is more to social work than going out, standing about and listening.  They must be able to make informed judgments and decide what best can be done for the family.  In the case I outlined, which is mentioned on page 14 of the Legal Aid Board report, there were 15 different applications to the court.  This wasted a great deal of time and effort.  If a social worker had been available initially, there might have been a better outcome.</P>
    <P>The board points to the need for shelter for people who must flee violent homes.  I realise the centres try to do what they can in emergencies, but violence, drugs and drink cause terrible disruption in many families.  While mediation is the favoured option, unfortunately, the adversarial system in the courts too often wins out.  As we are aware, there is a waiting list for free legal aid and then to get into the courts.  I congratulate the Minister of State on her efforts and I hope she continues to build on the work of the former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, which was mentioned by Senator Manning and Senator Norris.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister of State on the nature and quality of her work since her appointment.  It has been most impressive.  She has taken a hands on and focused approach to her brief.  I have watched her with much admiration and I wish her luck in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Legal Aid Board on its work and the production of this admirable report.  It is a valuable yearly document for Members to have at their disposal.  It gives us an opportunity to assess how the laws framed in the Houses of the Oireachtas and provisions made in budgets are working in practice.  It provides us with the chance to consider whether laws are having the intended result and if not, why not.  These issues must be monitored in terms of what progress is <Col N="1470" /> being made in all areas at an equal pace.  The provision of a well worked out scientific report of this nature is extremely valuable.  I commend the board on the report and its work.</P>
    <P>We have been slow with regard to social legislation and making provisions in that regard.  It is only in recent times that we, as legislators, have addressed the needs in this area.  I commend former Minister, Mervyn Taylor, for his input.  I was a Member of the Dáil at the time and I saw the painstaking nature of his work.  He is no longer a Member of the other House, but I want him to know that his work is valued and appreciated and is being developed by a worthy successor.</P>
    <P>As other speakers mentioned, the jurisdiction of the Legal Aid Board relates mainly to family law.  Many of the cases dealt with by the board are very harrowing.  One of the aspects which struck me strongly when I read the report was the degree of delay.  The delays have built up gradually and constantly over the years.  Senator Norris mentioned figures which are different from those in the report.  However, I will mention the statistics in it.  There are two centres in Cork city.  In Pope's Quay in 1995 and 1996, the average delay was four and a half months but in 1997 it was six months.  In the South Mall the duration of delay in 1995 was three months, but it more than doubled in the two following years.  The average delay is now seven months.</P>
    <P>The reason for the delay is indicated in the report.  Despite the fact that additional provisions have been made by this and the previous Government, the extent of the demand has outstripped the level of provision.  This element more than any other should be addressed as a matter of urgency.  An attempt must be made to cut down on the delays because, unquestionably, they add to the difficulties.  It is difficult for those of us who have been lucky in life to envisage fully the degree of misery, suffering and raw torture in some cases that is inflicted on victims of domestic violence.  It is difficult for us to empathise fully with such victims.  The impact of domestic violence on women in particular is horrendous.  Any undue delay which would add to that misery should be minimised by the service providers. The Minister of State should make it a priority to ensure that the duration of the waiting period for legal aid should be at a minimum.  When incidents of violence occur and it becomes known to the perpetrator of the violence that the victim is seeking legal aid, a new level of viciousness may creep in.  There must not be too great a delay in waiting for legal aid.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator O'Donovan that the services of the board do not reach out to certain geographic areas.  An isolated case in Castlegregory is as deserving of a service as a case in Castleknock. It is not practical to have a legal aid centre in every small population centre.  The way to reach out to those in remote areas who need a service is to extend the private practice system which is working in Dublin.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that approach is taken.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> Senator Manning spoke at length about the administrative and secretarial back-up services as opposed to the provision of solicitors.  He expressed his fears that this aspect of the service is not funded as well as it ought to be.  I understand that to be the case from my contacts with people in certain key centres.  These services should be examined with a view to upgrading the standard of service provided.</P>
    <P>In all cases the first person a victim meets in the legal aid centre is the secretary, invariably a woman, at the reception desk.  Based on the quality of that first encounter the victim may have the confidence to proceed.  It is very important that provision is made to enable continuity of care at that level.  People who are appointed in a secretarial capacity should be remunerated to the extent that they will continue to work in that capacity.  Senator Manning made the point cogently and I repeat it to endorse his sentiments. If the first point of contact gives confidence to a victim that person will proceed.  The Minister of State should examine this aspect closely.</P>
    <P>I was pleased with the Minister of State's statement, particularly the emphasis she put on mediation services.  If and where possible we must try to introduce a culture of conflict resolution. Cases involving families involve people who had feelings for each other at some time.  It must be a shortfall of our education system that young men in particular are so poorly equipped to communicate their needs or feelings and that, often, their only means of communication is to draw a swipe or deliver an insult.  Without wishing to stray too far from the subject, one of the most uplifting experiences we have had this year was to witness the manner in which Mr. George Mitchell dealt with people who had been in open conflict for generations &mdash; the calm and cool manner in which he got them to sit together and to listen to each other's views.</P>
    <P>Good mediation should be tried in many cases as the first approach.  If it fails, by all means let a case proceed to the courts.  However, good family mediation should be tried and we should aim to put good family mediation services in place.</P>
    <P>In the other House I dealt with issues of juvenile justice and I did a detailed study of the way in which the children's panels work in Scotland. These are special panels composed mainly of lay people, often successful parents, and some professional expertise and they are the first port of call for children who may be in trouble with the law.  They work very effectively.  They are a variant of the mediation procedure.</P>
    <P>There is a group of women in Cork who work in the community and call themselves &ldquo;Mná Feasa&rdquo;.  The name derives from Irish mythology when Fionn MacCumhaill's mother in preparing him for life sent him out to be fostered by one of the mná feasa or wise women &mdash; women who had learned the skills of life from the university of life. Many of the members of the group in Cork have been the victims of domestic violence and they <Col N="1472" /> assist, advise and support one another, especially in the process of vindicating of their rights.</P>
    <P>However, the vindication of rights is only one step in the process.  There is a great need to heal the hurt and psychological damage and the work of this group is very encouraging because they assist one another so that women whose lives have been broken by violence can, with the proper level of support and advice, begin to put their lives back together.  There is scope for the Minister of State to encourage and fund such groups. Cases of family law involve human misery and much pain can be averted before cases go to court.</P>
    <P>However, when cases go to court it is important that the services of the best available solicitors schooled in family law are available to the victims. That is what the Legal Aid Board has been doing.  It has been extending its services in a satisfactory and professional way.  It has taken on a large additional workload since the enactment of domestic violence legislation in 1996 and divorce legislation in 1997.  The likelihood is that its work will continue to grow.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the board for the manner in which it discharges its duty and I wish it well in the future.  I also wish the Minister of State well in her work to ensure that the board's additional needs for funding are met.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little for me to say at this stage; it has all been said.  I welcome the Minister and congratulate her on all her fine work to date.  I congratulate her in particular on her grasp of her brief.  She does her homework well and it is comfortable to work with her.  I am always happy to speak on any of the areas under her remit because they are worthwhile.  The Minister made a fine speech.  I will take it away with me to read again when I have more time to assimilate the various points she raised.</P>
      <P>I also congratulate the board on this fine document. It is one which I will read again.  This afternoon I picked up a great deal of information from listening to the statements and I feel I am already knowledgable about the board.  The reason I say that is I was not knowledgeable when I decided to speak on this matter.  Perhaps that is from where we are coming.  We are not knowledgeable because we are comfortable people.  The people who are most vulnerable are those who do not know where to find this free legal aid service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only in the past couple of years that the Free Legal Aid Board's services have become visible. It is a great success story and it is all contained in the report.  I know that now.  However, as a guidance counsellor by profession, I knew little about the services of the Free Legal Aid Board.  I should have known about them because there would have been many times when I dealt with the vulnerable children of parents whose family had broken down &mdash; I would have detected it through the various systems in the school.  That area, between the schools, the guidance counsellors and the family, is where we could deliver a <Col N="1473" /> tighter service.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set up a committee which is co-ordinating the mediation services and reorganising the board but it could be opened up further.</P>
    <P>I welcome the funding also.  My good friend and colleague, Senator Manning, quipped that perhaps it was our good friend, Mervyn Taylor, the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, who spearheaded it.  Although he was there, I would like to think it was led by a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the increased funding in 1997-8, which acknowledges the passing of the divorce Act, the Domestic Violence Act, the breakdown of marriages and the vulnerability of young people in society.  We need that money.  In fact, I will be looking for more.  We cannot have enough in an area where there is such vulnerability and sociological change.  The definition of family must be looked at, for instance.  Unless there are the background services of mediation, the Free Legal Aid Board and staff to acknowledge the breakdown in society, then we are not achieving anything with this board.  While I acknowledge the success of the board, the fact is that although it has received a great deal of funding and the Minister has increased the number of staff, I still feel what is done will never be enough considering the kind of support which is needed.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could send a leaflet to every guidance counsellor to outline the service which is available in their areas.  It would be information for the library.  A parent might come to the guidance counsellor in the school, probably the first port of call because he or she might not know where else to go, through the teachers, the guidance counsellor and the home/school link, this might be the best way to help.  This might be the way to reach out to inform people of the services available to help the most vulnerable in society.  That is the major area of concern.</P>
    <P>With regard to reorganisation, I support Senator Manning's point about clerical staff.  It is so important that the board's solicitors are good at their job.  There is such a thing as horses for courses.  There can be good politicians and bad politicians and good teachers and bad teachers. There can be bad solicitors in the sense that technically they could be good but they would not have that sensitivity to reach out.  It is terribly important that one gets the right person to deal with the vulnerable.  When somebody comes into the office, the right kind of solicitor with a feel for what he or she is doing, might not be available. Therefore, the criteria for a family solicitor are also important to bear in mind.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I will have a keen interest in future worthwhile reports.  The Legal Aid Board is a success story.  The Minister should spread knowledge of the service so that it reaches people who might be able to help the solicitors, those who provide backup services and the mediation services which the Minister will set up to link in with this board, etc.  This <Col N="1474" /> would create a co-ordinated service for those most vulnerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators for their constructive approach to today's statements.  I greatly appreciate their support of the Free Legal Aid Board, particularly the positive remarks with regard to the success stories around the board, with which we would all identify.</P>
      <P>A number of issues were raised and I will attempt to cover as many of them as I can. Senator Manning made a point, to which Senator Ormonde referred, about the developments of the board from 1992.  My intention in mentioning that was merely to point to the time when the expansion and development of the board began. I had no intention of denigrating any contribution of other colleagues.  I wanted to say that prior to 1992 when there were 16 law centres, that number has almost doubled today.  The expansion to which we all referred needs to continue.  A great deal of progress has been made in that period.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Quill and Ormonde referred to the importance of staff in dealing with waiting times.  This is definitely a key issue which needs to be continually looked at.  The announcement made in July last by Minister O'Donoghue, to which I referred, was specifically around this area of posts which play such an important part. The Minister approved 25 additional posts for the Free Legal Aid Board of which 17 are for the law centres, including five solicitor posts, as well as making six temporary staff in the law centres permanent, three of whom were relief solicitors and three were clerical staff.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Ormonde and Quill, in particular, referred to the importance of support staff.  Senator Quill made the point that these are often the first people with whom somebody coming to the law centres comes in contact.</P>
      <P>With regard to the numbers around the country, there are 89 solicitors and 127 support staff. I hope those figures and the increase in the number of positions shows the seriousness with which the board views the importance of having such support staff.</P>
      <P>Senator Quill drew attention to the waiting times at the two Cork law centres.  I am pleased to be able to state that both centres are to be assigned an extra solicitor as a result of the staffing posts sanctioned by the Minister.  I hope that is of assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan and Senator Henry mentioned the stress and trauma of having to wait for the board to provide assistance.  As I said, the board operates a priority system.  If a woman is in physical danger, which was Senator Henry's concern, she would receive priority.  Unfortunately, this cannot be done in all cases although there is a prioritising in the board's work.  Senator Henry also asked if I could provide independent reports on family law cases.  This is outside the <Col N="1475" /> remit of the Legal Aid Board but I will raise the matter with my colleague.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill was concerned about the extent to which demand will outstrip the additional resources.  Demand is increasing at the same time as resources are increasing.  This point was also raised by Senator Norris who said that waiting times have increased by 300 per cent.  The waiting times increased in 1998 but I hope the measures currently being taken by the board, the increased grant aid in recent years and the recent sanction of extra staff posts will have the necessary impact on the waiting times and alleviate this pressing problem.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill and Senator O'Donovan referred to the private practitioner pilot project in rural areas.  It has operated in the Dublin area since April 1994 and the board expects to be able to extend the scheme nationwide in the near future. Senator Norris mentioned the provision by the board of legal aid to those taking cases before tribunals.  The purpose of tribunals is to provide alternative forms of dispute resolution that are cheaper, quicker, more accessible and less formal than the courts.</P>
    <P>It was never the intention that labour tribunals should be flooded with legal representation, making them more formal and the hearings longer and more expensive.  It is the widely held view of representatives of both employers and employees that legal representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal has increased to an extent that was never envisaged when that tribunal was established.  Legal representation at social welfare appeals tribunals has not increased to the same extent.</P>
    <P>A major problem, however, is how legal representation could be contained if legal aid were available as a matter of course.  This is one of the reasons the Seanad reversed an amendment it had made on Committee Stage to the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  No Government could accept a situation where a good deal of the Legal Aid Board's resources, 95 per cent of which are currently directed to family law cases, should at once be directed to legal representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the social welfare appeals tribunals.  This issue was debated at length in the House but it is no harm to explain the reasons for the decision.</P>
    <P>Many other important issues, such as family law, the cost of the board, clients of the Legal Aid Board, European law and mediation services, were raised and I have taken note of the Senators' comments.  The Department continues to monitor the working of the board on a monthly basis to ensure it is fulfilling its mandate under the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their genuine interest in this subject and for the recognition they accorded to the board's successes, in addition to the complications and difficulties that have arisen on foot of the additional legislation in this area.  It is positive legislation and it is heartening to see the dramatic <Col N="1476" /> effects it has had on the work of the Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their comments and I will take on board the important points they raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for taking this motion on the housing aid for the elderly scheme which is administered through the health boards.  The matter is also of relevance to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment because of the number of FÁS workers involved in the scheme.</P>
      <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme has been invaluable since its introduction to deal with minor repairs, such as replacing windows, wallpapering, painting and replacing gutters. However, over time the scheme has expanded and at present in the North-Eastern Health Board area it is responsible for more major repair works, such as installing showers and water and replacing roofs.  There are other grants and schemes available for such work through the local authority under the essential repairs grant and the disabled person's grant scheme.</P>
      <P>The housing aid for the elderly scheme affects many more people.  The people who avail of it own their own homes and are elderly.  Due to not having sufficient finance at a stage when they should enjoy life and a measure of comfort, many of them are now obliged to go into debt to have these repairs carried out because of the current waiting lists under the scheme.</P>
      <P>I have received numerous representations from people who have applied to have repairs carried out on leaking roofs.  Some of the applications were made four or five years ago.  The scheme in Cavan and Monaghan is extremely well run. However, approximately 150 people in Cavan and 140 people in Monaghan who applied some years ago for works to be carried out are still awaiting approval.  In Cavan there are 60 people who have received approval but who are waiting for work to be carried out.</P>
      <P>This is considered priority work but only approximately 36 to 40 jobs can be carried out each year.  If there are 140 people on a waiting list who have not even been approved, obviously it will be five or six years before the work is carried out, and that is not taking into account new applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not criticising the health board.  The scheme is excellent and has worked extremely well in my health board area.  However, it involves both the health board and FÁS workers. The FÁS workers and their foremen have created an ideal partnership with the North-Eastern <Col N="1477" /> Health Board.  Members of other health boards envy that rapport.</P>
    <P>Much remains to be done.  While more money is needed, that is not the only problem.  Monaghan previously had three teams of FÁS workers with each team completing about 18 jobs each year.  This year, however, there are only two teams so money alone will not solve the problem. Additional FÁS workers are needed.  At present, there are so many people on the high priority list in Monaghan that the health board is considering getting contract workers to do certain jobs to make the homes habitable.  It has reached the stage that some homes are almost uninhabitable for the winter.</P>
    <P>The scheme requires extra funding and more FÁS workers.  One might ask why the health board does not get contract workers to complete the jobs.  It is cheaper to pay FÁS workers under the community employment scheme and youth training programme than to pay contract workers. The work consists of replacing windows and providing other basic facilities which everybody, one hopes, would have in their home.</P>
    <P>It can be argued that the local authority is the body with responsibility for the provision of housing. However, in the long term the health boards will carry more of that responsibility because elderly people are more at risk of illness and of being attacked in their homes.  That causes greater problems for the health boards so it is in their interests, particularly for the safety and health of the elderly, to administer this scheme.</P>
    <P>We have an ageing population who should be allowed to remain healthy and independent for as long as possible.  These are the people who built the society we are lucky enough to enjoy.  It is unfortunate that the people who most need assistance tend to be forgotten.  Some people say that the elderly do not contribute to society by paying their taxes.  In fairness, many of the people I am talking about paid their taxes all their life and they deserve something in return.  Many of these people are willing to contribute to society; they just need a little help.  This scheme has been extremely useful in my health board area and I am sure this applies across the board.  I urge the Minister of State to make more resources available for this scheme in the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Leonard for raising this important issue and apologise that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be here this evening. He asked me to thank Senator Leonard for raising this important issue and to explain its origins and present status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme, administered by a task force, under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, is funded by the Exchequer.  A budget provision of £1 million was allocated to a task force which was set up in 1982 to undertake an emergency programme to <Col N="1478" /> improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living on their own in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. The task force includes representatives from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, FÁS, ALONE, local authorities and the Departments of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Social Community and Family Affairs.  The scheme is operated on the ground by the health boards under the direction of the community care programme managers and the work is generally carried out by contract or by FÁS trainees working under the supervision of health board foremen.  Labour costs are met in full by FÁS in the latter case.</P>
    <P>Funding at an annual level of £1 million was continued up to 1985, after which it was increased to £1.5 million.  A sum of £2 million was provided each year from 1989 to 1993, inclusive.  In 1994 the Government granted a special additional sum of £2 million to the task force on a once-off basis out of the proceeds of the tax amnesty.  This helped reduce the number of outstanding applications and helped put the scheme back on a more even footing as we approached 1995, allowing health boards better scope for dealing with new applications.  In 1995 the allocation was increased to £3 million, in 1996 to £4 million and a further increase in 1997 to £4.132 million.  A special budget day allocation increased the 1998 provision to an all time high of £5 million.</P>
    <P>As can be seen, the level of funding has been increased each year since 1994 to enable the health boards to continue a high level of activity under the scheme and in recognition of the valuable work being done.  It is estimated that almost 32,000 cases were dealt with between 1982 and the end of 1997 and more than 1,300 jobs have been completed in the period ending 30 June 1998.  Funding levels for 1999 are at present being considered in the context of the settlement of the Estimates and will be announced in the near future.</P>
    <P>The operation of the scheme is continuously monitored and assessed by the task force.  In making annual financial allocations to health boards, due cognisance is given to returns by the boards of activity under the scheme and the number of applications on hand within each health board area.  It is a matter for each board to determine, within the funds available, the priority of individual cases on hand and to consider which applications should receive assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard rightly pointed to the concern of health boards for the elderly population and the fact that the cost to the health boards would be much greater if these people were in institutional care rather than living in their own homes.  Coming from the same health board area as the Senator, I am aware the health board is considering employing contractors to relieve the situation.  This is an extremely valuable scheme but waiting lists are causing some concern.</P>
    <P>The primary area of support from FÁS to the health services is through the community youth <Col N="1479" /> training programme.  Through this programme support is provided by way of helping to make living standards in accommodation better for the elderly or for people with disabilities.  Senator Leonard pointed out that grants such as the essential repairs grant and the disabled person's grant can also be utilised.  Persons to be supported are nominated by the health board local social services and 200 trainees from the community youth training programme would be involved in providing this support.  This programme is operating at full strength within its budgetary capacity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1480" /> As we approach the 1999 Estimates, I thank Senator Leonard for raising this issue.  The figures she quoted with regard to Cavan-Monaghan will be relayed to the Department of the Environment and Local Government so that it will be aware of her concerns in this matter.  I join Senator Leonard in complimenting all those involved in this excellent scheme &mdash; members of the task force, the health boards, FÁS and the other voluntary bodies associated with the successful operation of the scheme over recent years.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 3.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 6 November 1998.</P>
