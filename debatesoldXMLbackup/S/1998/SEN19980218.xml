      <P>I have notice from Senator Avril Doyle that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the concerns of the Dublin Horse Owners' Association about the lack of implementation of the Government's recommendations regarding local horse projects.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to give urgent and favourable consideration to the provision of substantial financial support to the National Community Games Movement.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to take immediate steps to ensure that young children are not endangered when accompanying their parents or guardians who are selling the &ldquo;Big Issue&rdquo; magazine at major traffic intersections in Dublin.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Connor of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to review our bilateral aid agreement with Zambia in view of the anti-democratic trends and human rights abuses in that country.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Doyle and Finneran as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Ridge and Connor may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 8, motion No. 15.  Item 8 is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. There is no mention of the foreign adoptions issue on the Order Paper.  I do not intend to move an amendment today but we would like to see promised Government action on the matter by Friday.</P>
      <P>Recent news stories about the current over-crowding in Mountjoy Prison, which continues to be a great blemish on the legal system, report that people continue to imprisoned for defaulting on debt.  A solicitor from County Mayo is on hunger strike in the prison.  While I do not intend to discuss the merits of his case, he is in prison because of a debt that has not been paid.  There must be other ways of tackling this problem in this day and age, either through community service or attachment orders of various kinds.  It is appalling that people are going to prison because of their inability or refusal to settle matters of outstanding debt.  We should discuss the matter and I ask the Leader to make time available in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Employment Equality Bill, Committee Stage, is not to be concluded today will the Leader indicate when he intends to have it concluded?  It is an important Bill and appropriate time should be allocated to it.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Manning's request in relation to the Adoption (No. 2) Bill.  The matter has been raised repeatedly.  Too many commitments have been made about the insecure position of people who have adopted children from South America. Independent legal advice has been sought and the Attorney General has also taken legal advice. The Government knows where it stands and Members have asked for this matter to be restored to the Order Paper.  If that does not happen this week, Members have a responsibility to make the Government aware of the matter every day on the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>I asked the Leader previously to arrange a debate on industrial relations in terms of a national minimum wage and other aspects. Members need to be informed about this matter and the exact position of opposing sides.  The most important aspect is the recognition of trade unions and the dispute involving Ryanair and its attempt to undermine national agreements and good faith.  I ask the Leader to arrange a debate on this topic next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. In the context of Senator O'Toole's points about industrial relations, what is the position regarding the commission on the national minimum wage that was supposed to report by the end of December?  This was to be the starting point of a <Col N="367" /> debate on the issue and perhaps the Leader could use it as a basis for a discussion on this area.</P>
      <P>Item 5 is the Protection of Workers (Shops) (No. 2) Bill.  It deals in the main with Sunday trading but perhaps it could be extended to cover the wider area of union recognition and the issue of low pay in Ryanair and elsewhere.  This would be most desirable in terms of a debate on industrial relations in general.  Such a discussion would be most appropriate at this time.</P>
      <P>Does the Leader have any information on the proposed visit by Senators to St. Ita's Hospital in Portrane?  This visit was requested by several Members and the Leader raised the matter with the hospital management.  Senators want to make that visit as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Regarding item 7 and the Bill relating to the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty, my colleague, Senator Gallagher, has repeatedly pointed out that the wording is unchanged in the Order Paper despite the Government's decision to change it.  Will the Leader indicate when that referendum will take place?  Will it be on a Friday? The two forthcoming by-elections will be held on a Wednesday.  This is most unusual and there is no explanation for that decision.  There are tremendous advantages in holding elections on a Friday because it maximises the number of votes.  Will the Leader give the House information on this matter?</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the important matter of the office of the insurance ombudsman.  There has been a considerable amount of public comment on the fact that the insurance ombudsman will not be replaced.  However, she is not in a position to speak about the matter.  Everybody must deal with insurance companies and the office of the insurance ombudsman has offered great protection for people in the last five years. I ask the Leader arrange a debate on this topic so Members can find out if the suggestion is correct that her independence is the cause of her dismissal from office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the comments of my colleague in the other House, Deputy Flanagan, about the ridiculous time at which &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; is broadcast.  I read an article by a journalist which did not depict Members in a glowing light.  However, viewers should have the opportunity to decide whether we are good at our jobs.  The quality of debate and level of courtesy in the House are examples to other politicians. The public should not be denied the interest, and perhaps pleasure, of watching us on occasions. The 2.30 a.m. time of broadcast is not suitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Leader of the Opposition in his call for a debate on imprisonment for non-payment of fines and failing to meet financial obligations.  Transporting people to prison with two gardaí in a taxi is also a great expense to the State and is an inappropriate way to transport prisoners.  It is time we examined this matter.  I join in the call for a debate on this issue. Other avenues should be pursued where people are sent to prison for not paying a fine of £25. This merits debate in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The workers at Seagate Technology today collected their redundancy cheques. While I recognise the Tánaiste was courteous and addressed us before she addressed the Dáil when the issue arose, could the Leader of the House ask her to come before this House so we might find out what is happening?  People in south Tipperary are extremely concerned about replacement industry.  Other areas seem to be getting them and, while I welcome employment being created in any area, people in south Tipperary feel left out.  I request that the Leader ask the Tánaiste about this matter immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House for a debate on the most appropriate way to celebrate the new millennium.  We should not lose sight of the fact that it is the 2,000th anniversary of the birth of Christ.  Already there are media gurus objecting to any monument connected with this.  We should debate how we feel the millennium and the birth of Christ should be properly recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for a debate in this House on the restructuring of local authorities.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come before this House as soon as possible?  We understand he has plans to restructure local authorities and create new positions within the system which will require many changes.  This is the appropriate House for an in depth debate on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am beginning to think Senator Ridge and I, who are friends of long standing, have a mental electricity between us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to be discreet Senator Ridge.  I was going to go further than the Senator and suggest that the committee on broadcasting would convey to RTE the views expressed in the other House.  This seems to be is part of an agenda within RTE.  It happened first on radio and, as a broadcaster, I was annoyed for some years that Oireachtas Report intruded on my own broadcasting time.  Then it was shifted to a slot very late at night.  On television it was a moveable feast.  This matter is of real concern as it is the <Col N="369" /> only television outlet for the proceedings of the Oireachtas and, as has been pointed out, it has a significant audience.  I endorse everything Senator Ridge said.</P>
      <P>I also ask the Leader for a debate in Government time or for time to be made available for statements on the development of digital television. Digital television will impact on this House in that proposals already in the public arena from cable operators suggest there will be several channels available with one channel dedicated to the proceedings of the Dáil and Seanad throughout the day.  This will be a significant and welcome development for the general population who cannot visit these Houses unlike many of our constituents who can watch proceedings from the public gallery.  Due to rapid developments in this area I ask the Leader to arrange a debate so we can all express our opinions in order that it may be of assistance to the Minister who will be bringing forward legislation in this area before the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Senator Henry, in her remarks about the insurance ombudsman.  It seems that the insurance ombudsman was so independent that his backers have withdrawn their support.  This is a serious cause for concern in ethical terms.  I ask the Leader if we can have a debate on the whole question of ethics in the financial area.  The debate should cover not only the insurance industry but also the banks and matters such as the use by the banks of huge amounts of money left in dormant accounts for which they make no effort to trace the beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate when the Education Bill will come before this House? Will he impress upon the Minister for Education the importance of having adequate funding provided for the implementation of the relationships and sexuality programme in our national schools? They find it very difficult to put this programme in place because of the cost of aids and so on.  It would be a pity if this vital and good programme could not continue through lack of funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the call by Senator Henry for a debate on the independence of the insurance ombudsman.  Last week I asked for a debate on the same issue.</P>
      <P>I also support Senator Norris's call for a debate on banking institutions particularly on a day when one of the two main banking forces here, the AIB, has announced record profits.  I am not impressed with those profits.  I know these banks have a responsibility to their shareholders but they have lost sight of their customers.  I am particularly concerned about referral charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Mooney mentioned mental electricity I was reminded that we were due to debate the safety of mobile 'phone masts. When will a debate on this issue be scheduled?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> Since last October I have mentioned the need to have a full audit of blood and blood products with reference to the possible risk of contracting the new variant of CJD through that process.  The Leader indicated before Christmas that we could have a health debate shortly after our resumption in which that matter could be concluded.  Following the latest episode whereby it seems information was communicated to the people concerned, we should have an urgent debate on health and I would like it placed on the agenda of this House as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, support Senator Henry's call in regard to insurance in view of the fact that the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced a month ago that disclosure would be dropped from the draft regulations on the selling of insurance products and, now that the Competition Authority has disagreed strongly, I ask the Leader if we can expect a U-turn like that announced by the Minister for Finance on another matter yesterday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole and Finneran expressed concern at the delay in replacing the foreign adoption Bill on the Order Paper.  I hope the Bill will be discussed before the end of this week.  I will endeavour to have it restored to the Order Paper at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I can facilitate Senators Manning, O'Toole and Finneran's request for a debate on the imprisonment of people who default on debts or fines.</P>
      <P>I understand that a new wording has been agreed by the Leaders for the Referendum Bill and we await its publication.</P>
      <P>Senators Henry, Norris, Bonner, Costello, Ridge and Mooney requested a debate on the independence of the ombudsman for the insurance industry.  I can agree to their request.  I noted with great interest the number of contributions in last Friday's debate.</P>
      <P>Senator Thomas Hayes called for the Tánaiste discuss the closure of Seagate in this House.  I will relay his request to the Tánaiste's office.  A debate on the millennium, requested by Senator Farrell, would be timely.  This could be included in Fianna Fáil's Private Members' time.  Senator Burke is consistent in his request for a debate on local authorities. I will try to have time made available for this.  I will come back to Senator McDonagh this afternoon with an answer to his query about the education Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher added his voice to the call for a debate on mobile 'phone masts.  I intend to facilitate this debate within the next two weeks.  I also support his call for an update of information on new variant CJD.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 2, to delete &ldquo;a deliberate&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;an&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Many amendments have been tabled on Committee Stage.  I look forward to a wide-ranging debate and the Minister's co-operation in improving an extremely important and valuable Bill.</P>
      <P>Members on this side of the House believe that use of the word &ldquo;deliberate&rdquo; gives employers an out clause in the context of this important section which deals with interpretation.  The amendment is designed to narrow the range of the section and prevent the creation of an out clause.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of the term &ldquo;Act&rdquo; contained in the Bill was taken from the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and it has been tried if not tested.  The definition has proved adequate for 21 years.  In those circumstances I see no compelling reason to change the terminology in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), lines 16 to 19, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;with&rdquo; in line 16 down to and including &ldquo;1997,&rdquo; in line 19.</P>
      <P>This amendment attempts to broaden the scope of the Bill which, as already stated, is good legislation. The purpose of Committee Stage is to debate in detail how a Bill can be improved and to hear views from all sides of the House in that regard.  The amendment inquires why the subsection refers only to employment agencies and we are interested in broadening its scope.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;contract of employment&rdquo; is in accordance with the scope of the Bill.  It extends to all employees, including agency workers.  The proposed amendment would have the effect of extending the scope of the Bill beyond employees to the self-employed and independent contractors and would, therefore, fundamentally alter the purpose of the legislation.  I am unable to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response because it is narrow.  I hoped for a more flexible approach and that he would look at our amendments in the spirit in which they were intended, which is to improve the Bill.  We are not being critical necessarily about how it is drafted.  My party is largely responsible for the Bill in its current incarnation and is trying to be <Col N="372" /> constructive, not critical.  I hope the Minister approaches our amendments in that regard.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 8, subsection (1), line 30, to delete &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>What is the effect of the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; since deleting it removes any possibility of discrimination taking place?  Will it be used in a temporary fashion?  If so, how temporary?  How long does &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; continue?</P>
      <P>The spirit of the Bill is to avoid discrimination but it may occur because of the inclusion of the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;.  Will the Minister consider what we are trying to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 deals with interpretation and a number of meanings are set out for the word &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  Paragraph (b) states &ldquo;disability means the presence in the body of organisms causing, or likely to cause, chronic disease or illness,&rdquo;.  That is not the only ground upon which a person may be deemed to be disabled within the terms of the legislation, but the term &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; in this context is the same as the definition set out in the Oxford English dictionary where it is defined as &ldquo;lingering, long continued or inveterate&rdquo;.  The inclusion of this term in the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; is to reflect such a meaning.</P>
      <P>The legal and medical advice available suggests the omission of the term &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; could lead to the common cold or other minor viral infections being construed as a disability for the purposes of the Bill.  I am sure the Senator does not intend that an individual would be deemed to suffer from a disability just because he or she happened to have a cold and that is why we have included the term &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; in the legislation.  The Senator will agree on reflection it would diminish the value of the Bill considerably if it was amended along the lines suggested by her and I hope she will consider withdrawing her amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 34, after &ldquo;divorced&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, cohabiting, annulled&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 4 is inspired by the Committee Stage debate on the previous Bill.  In fact, this amendment is not original in the sense that it was proposed by Senator Keogh who was then a Deputy.  While it was not accepted by the then Minister, I was not a Member of the previous Oireachtas so I do not feel obliged to accept what happened there.  On reflection we felt that it was a valuable and worthwhile amendment and I was happy to table it.  It achieves a great deal by <Col N="373" /> inserting the words &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; and &ldquo;annulled&rdquo; in this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  The broadest possible definition of marital status is the one which we want.  In a Bill which distinguishes itself by referring to the question of sexual orientation, it would be a pity if the definition of marital status was not broadened.</P>
      <P>I find forms on which one is asked to indicate marital status rather embarrassing.  What should I put down?  I simply do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hopeful.  Of course I am, but my hopes have been satisfied for the past 23 years.  I think I should be able to put down &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo;.  I normally put down something provocative if I can find the most provocative formula.</P>
      <P>On a serious note, relationships should be given respect.  For that reason, the definition of marital status should be broadened as much as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment for a reason which may seem a little obscure but which has concerned me since I read this Bill.  One of the identified laudable grounds on which discrimination is prohibited in this Bill is sexual orientation.  The Bill could mean that a person could not be discriminated against because of a particular sexual orientation.  Nowhere is it explicit that a person cannot be discriminated against because he or she is in an unconventional relationship which might involve a relationship with a person of the same sex.  I do not know which is the intention of the Bill &mdash; to prohibit discrimination against people who are actively homosexual or to make the slightly Jesuitical distinction which the Roman Catholic Church holds, which is that people should not be discriminated against because of their sexual orientation but that any active sexual expression by somebody who is gay is wrong.  If the Bill does not state clearly that employers cannot discriminate against people because they are active homosexuals, then it is deficient.</P>

    <P>One way of sorting out this matter about sexual orientation would be by including the term Senator O'Meara suggested here because <Col N="374" /> cohabiting with a person of the same sex could not be used as a ground for discrimination.</P>
    <P>My view is that without this the clause on sexual orientation will state that if one is gay and celibate, one cannot be discriminated against. Otherwise, what it says is that if one is actively gay there is no protection in the Bill.  I do not believe that it was the intention of the original authors and I hope it is not the Minister's intention that actively gay consenting adults could be discriminated against other than in the sections of the Bill which allow major bolt holes for those with different religious sensitivities from me.</P>

      <P>The principle underlying the amendment is laudable.  The Bill defines marital status as &ldquo;. single, married, separated, divorced or widowed .&rdquo; and if that were considered a narrow definition which did not cover the relationships of the kind referred to by Senators, the Bill would contradict itself.  If that is the case, although I am not sure it is, the amendment will have some value.  The term &ldquo;single&rdquo; is rather important in this regard.  I do not know if there is a legal definition of the term that would exclude persons in different kinds of relationships.  As I understand it, &ldquo;single&rdquo; defines a person who is not married in the legal sense of that term.  If that were the case &ldquo;single&rdquo; would encompass people in the relationships such as those referred to by Senators and the Bill would adequately address their concerns.</P>

      <P>The definition of marital status in the Bill is standard and it draws on legally recognisable areas.  It would be inappropriate to introduce in the Bill a new status which does not have any legal basis.  It is not my intention to add cohabitation as a category of marital status. I understand Senator Norris does not want to be provocative and I hope he does not regard this matter as having evoked a provocative response from me.  A person who is cohabiting is covered as having a marital status, because the individual is either single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  The categories are covered by the present definition which has a basis in law and has been commented on judicially.  If a marriage is annulled the former partners to the marriage become single.  I thank Senators for their proposals but I am not in a position to accept the amendment on the grounds that the definition in the Bill already applies whether an individual is cohabiting or whether an individual's marriage has been annulled.</P>
      <P>With regard to Senator Brendan Ryan's comments on sexual orientation, I would point out that sexual orientation is defined separately in section 2 as meaning heterosexual, homosexual or bisexual.  Therefore, the Senator's point is also covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested and not provoked by the Minister's response except to further cerebration on the issue.  The Minister's reply that <Col N="375" /> this is a standard definition is the key to the matter, because it is not good enough.  These definitions pre-exist not only significant alterations in the law introduced by the Minister's party some years ago but also a change in social attitudes.  It is not acceptable that the reality of a person of homosexual orientation should be defined exclusively in terms of a heterosexual person's reality &mdash; that is like saying there are Roman Catholics and non-Roman Catholics.  I do not find myself flattered by such a negative definition.  The Minister says everyone is covered because everyone is single, widowed, married or divorced but I have no access to that reality.</P>
      <P>He may say this requires legislation of a different sort and I agree.  I hope, particularly in the light of the positive response from the Government benches to the trend of these ideas, that it will soon be found possible to introduce legislation which would give legal recognition to relationships outside the narrow existing definition of marriage.  Nonetheless, for the reasons I give I hope the Minister will find it possible to look again at this matter.  Although the Bill purports to protect people against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, its language does not recognise changes in legislation and public attitudes so the legislation itself operates to discriminate, particularly against gay people.</P>

He is a member of the legal profession and I am not but I understand the term has such a basis and would be recognised in law, as would the word &ldquo;annulled&rdquo;.

      <P>This is a simple question: does the Minister believe this legislation will prevent an employer discriminating against a person because the employee is living with a person to whom he or she is not married?  Using this legislation, can employers be prevented from discriminating between two people applying for a job because one is living with a person to whom he or she is not married?  The answer is either yes or no; if it is yes we can argue about whether the Minister is right but if it is no we have a fundamental disagreement.</P>

      <P>I, too, would like to hear the answers to the simple and direct questions put by Senator Ryan and I support what he and Senator Norris have said about the legislation.  As will be said on more than one occasion, this is the Employment Equality Bill which is designed to outlaw, remove and prevent discrimination in employment across a large number of areas.  We <Col N="376" /> said on Second Stage we would be neglecting our duty if we did not point our that the Bill is deficient in this regard and the amendment seeks to meet and address that deficiency.  The questions raised by the Senators are important and fundamental to the principle of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>All this is very interesting.  I assure Senator Connor that I have no interest in objecting for the sake of it or because I happen to be the Minister of the day.  We are here to tease out the Bill and to produce the best possible legislation.  I hope the Senator will accept my good faith in that regard.</P>
      <P>The question of cohabitation which Senator Norris raised is very interesting.  However, the reality remains that the term &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; does not have a legal basis in this country.  It is true that certain legal consequences can flow from a couple of whichever sex cohabiting but there is no legal basis for it.  Senator Norris and others seem to be suggesting there should be a legal basis for cohabiting couples of whatever sex. However, there might be a considerable number of people who want to cohabit but do not want that status recognised because otherwise they might as well be married.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris referred specifically to the situation of cohabiting homosexuals.  However, it must be remembered there are far more cohabiting heterosexual couples than homosexual couples.  Therefore, there is no discrimination against people with a given sexual orientation in terms of cohabitation.  I anticipate that a considerable amount of difficulty would flow from giving a legal basis to the term &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; in this or any other legislation.</P>
      <P>There are provisions in the Bill which prevent indirect discrimination.  For example, Part III may be invoked if an employer discriminates against people of the same sex.  The case law will decide, in due course, how this will progress.  I have no doubt, given the development of legal precedent in this country, that will be done in a very fine way.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan asked whether an employer will be prevented from discriminating against an individual on the ground of his or her sexual orientation, and the answer is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  One of the purposes of the Bill is to prevent such discrimination, which is why it is called an Employment Equality Bill.  There is a considerable number of measures in the legislation specifically geared towards ensuring we will not have such discrimination in our society in future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My central point is that whether an individual is cohabiting or not, or is a heterosexual or a homosexual, the legal reality is they are single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  A person whose marriage has been annulled is a different proposition, but I respectfully submit that such a person is regarded as single by the law. The common law definition of an individual as being single, married, separated, divorced or widowed has stood the test of time for hundreds <Col N="377" /> of years.  Any Senator who can name an individual who is cohabiting but who is not single, married, separated, divorced or widowed wins today's prize.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister whether the Bill prohibits discrimination against homosexuals or heterosexuals; I know it does, but is it the intention to make it impossible for employers to discriminate against people who are cohabiting in a sexual relationship when making decisions about who to employ?  It is possible to discriminate for a list of things, and that is very worthy, but is the Bill intended to protect those in non-standard relationships?  This is a simple question, and I presume the Department of Justice can answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be tedious about this matter, but I wish to correct one of the Minister's statements.  He maintained that the situation is exactly the same for cohabiting heterosexual couples as it is for cohabiting couples of the same sex.  That is not true.  Marriage and legal recognition of relationships remain an option for cohabiting heterosexual couples; there is no such option for gay couples.  They can do nothing other than cohabit.  That form of cohabitation has been removed from the sanction of criminal law only recently.  We have moved a certain way, but to say the situation is the same for homosexual couples as it is for heterosexual couples is not true.  Heterosexual couples have the option of marriage from which gay people are precluded.</P>
      <P>I share Senator Ryan's concerns.  Would Eileen Flynn be protected under this section?  Her difficulties were caused not by whether she had been married but by the fact that she was living outside the bonds of holy matrimony with a man who had previously been married.  It does not seem that she would necessarily be protected under this section because she was cohabiting.  The marital status of the individuals in the relationship was not of the slightest consequence.  The fact that they were living together outside marriage was held to be in conflict with the ethos of the church. The cohabiting issue is central.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">

      <P>In an attempt to be helpful and to reflect the debate, could the Minister consider looking at &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; in the amendment rather than &ldquo;cohabiting and annulled&rdquo;?  If a marriage is annulled the people involved are single again, but we are more concerned with the issue of cohabiting.  What would the Minister's response be to having &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;cohabiting and annulled&rdquo; in the amendment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a State annulment as meaning the marriage is dissolved and the contract is over.  Under a State annulment, those party to that contract are now single persons by definition.  Given that definition and the Minister's elaboration of the Bill's definitions, the <Col N="378" /> term &ldquo;annulment&rdquo; would not be irrelevant to this argument.</P>
      <P>Given the debate on Second Stage, which referred to principles of equality of opportunity for employment and promotion, I have no difficulty with most of Senators Norris's and Ryan's points.  However, the argument being advanced seems separate from the context of the principle of the Bill.  It seems that what is at issue is the question of a contract for different types of relationship, not the issue of outlawing discrimination in employment, to which the Bill refers. Social prejudices in many areas must be addressed, and this Bill outlaws discrimination on the grounds of age, race, sexual orientation, etc. However, I am inclined to view the arguments advanced on cohabiting as relating more to aspirations to a legal contract rather than fulfilment of the terms and principles of the Bill.  The Bill seeks to ensure fairness and equality of treatment for all categories of persons against whom discrimination was so common.</P>
      <P>I support the Bill fully, but I would have difficulty in going along with an argument that advanced something which seems outside the scope, intent and principle of the Bill: an argument for a legal contract status for persons in different categories of cohabiting situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A yes or no answer from the Minister would be very helpful.  &ldquo;Cohabitation&rdquo; is a frequently used term.  There are many references to it in social welfare legislation.  I remember debating the legal meaning of cohabitation with Deputy Woods when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  I argued that it discriminated against heterosexual couples because his definition of cohabitation specifically referred to a man and a woman, meaning that homosexual couples could not lose their social welfare if cohabiting but heterosexual couples could.  As far as I know that is still the position.</P>
      <P>My mother is now 81 and took great exception to a note she received about her pension.  It warned her that she would lose her pension if she married or cohabited.  The term &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; occurs everywhere in the legal system and has a legal basis.  However, the real question is whether the Bill intends prohibiting discrimination simply because people are cohabiting, whether as part of a homosexual or heterosexual couple.  The protection of homosexuals in this Bill is meaningless if they are not protected when sexually active.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a full discussion of this matter.  It is true that people cohabit, and that those people can have pension entitlements changed as a result of cohabiting.  It is true that certain legal consequences flow from cohabiting, but a cohabiting couple is not a legal entity for the purpose of legislation if one is referring to marital status.  An individual is married, divorced, widowed, separated or single, all of which are marital status positions.  No Senator has been able to say to me that any of those particular <Col N="379" /> positions do not apply to a cohabiting person.  I maintain that if an individual is cohabiting, one of the marital status positions outlined in the legislation applies to them.</P>
      <P>This legislation is not about marital status but about discrimination where employment opportunities are concerned.  It touches on an individual's marital status to the extent that it ensures that such an individual will not be discriminated against.  Senator Brendan Ryan asked me if an individual can be discriminated against if he or she is cohabiting.  I point again to section 31 which I referred to earlier when I spoke about indirect discrimination.  That section will require interpretation by the courts before case law spells out in detail replies to specific questions.  Even from a cursory reading of the section, I am convinced that if an individual is discriminated against as a result of cohabiting, section 31 should catch that in legal terms.  It would then require case law to spell out what the position would be in precise terms, which is why Senator Brendan Ryan's question was a good one.  The direct answer is yes in terms of section 31.</P>
      <P>This legislation seeks to ensure equality in employment and to eliminate prejudice and discrimination. It does not seek to change the marital status of individuals or provide for different types of marital status.  It utilises long recognised marital status positions to elaborate the anti-discrimination measures in that context.</P>

We will eventually drag it into the 20th century, although it will probably be the 21st century by the time we get there.  Does the Minister consider it appropriate to include discriminatory language in legislation which purports to outlaw discrimination?</P>

      <P>The Minister has.  Being a good Kerryman, I am sure he knows the phrase, &ldquo;if the shoe pinches, do not ask the shoe ask the foot&rdquo;. The Minister asked for the name of one person who was not single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  I am that soldier because I know perfectly well whether I am single.  I am not and I can give the Minister a telephone number in Jerusalem which he can ring and ask him if I am single.  I am not married because that possibility does not exist in this State.  I am not separated, except geographically, and I am not divorced or widowed.  Where does my reality fit into this?  It does not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I say the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is so tedious is that we had these same arguments five or eight years ago when I pushed to include sexual orientation clauses.  It could not be done because it had not <Col N="380" /> existed in legislation before; it was not in other comparable Bills.  Of course it was not because we were trying to move forward as legislators. When the Minister says the phrase, &ldquo;cohabiting&rdquo; has no legal meaning in terms of this Bill of course it does not and will not have until we include it.  If we include it in this Bill it will acquire legal status.  We are legislators; we make the law.  Perhaps that is why the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not like it because then it will start to creep into other legislation.  That is exactly what happened with sexual orientation clauses and that was the reason I pushed to include them and why I want to include this phrase.  It should be comparatively simple and painless to do that and it will not pose a charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The family is also defined in this section.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;member of the family&rdquo;, in relation to any person, means&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) that person's spouse, or</P>
    <P>(b) a brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece, lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of that person or that person's spouse; That means I do not have a family either.  I am like Topsy; I just growed.  There are a few more growing around the country even in County Kerry.</P>
    <P>This should be broadened because it does not recognise a form of reality which I accept may not be as widespread as heterosexual couples living together.  However, it might not be that far behind if one looks at the figures.  Marriage is available to and is still the majority choice for heterosexual people so people wishing to live together can be siphoned off into that institution but that option does not exist for gay people.  Any gay person in a relationship is cohabiting because they are not legally married.  It seems it would be possible to discriminate against them.</P>
    <P>I know of a large number of people who were discriminated against and fired from their jobs because they were persons of the same sex living together.  If I were an employer who wished to continue that practice, I would look at this Bill and say I did not discriminate because you are single, married, divorced, separated or widowed but because you are a pair of fairies living together and I did not like it.  That type of practice is not outlawed by this Bill.  The Minister will be hard put to satisfy me that it is.</P>

      <P>In reply to Senator Brendan Ryan's question, the Minister referred to section 31 and the fact that the courts would have to interpret the section or delineate its limits.  That is not a sufficient response to the important questions raised by him and by Senator Norris. Cohabitation does not have a legal status.  The Minister will not give it a legal status in this Bill, yet certain legal consequences flow from it.  We know that under the social welfare code cohabitation <Col N="381" /> has a status, although not a legal one. While I understand the Minister's reluctance to insert it in this Bill, it does discriminate against a growing number of people.  I urge the Minister to take on board what we said and to respond to my earlier question about removing the word &ldquo;annulled&rdquo; from the section.</P>

      <P>To return to the question of discrimination against homosexuals, it is clear this legislation ensures there will be no discrimination in terms of employment opportunities against people because of their sexual orientation.  We all agree on that point.  On the question of whether there could or would be discrimination against cohabiting homosexuals, this is covered by section 31 and it is a form of indirect discrimination which is outlawed by the legislation.  I repeat that case law will have to build up in that regard.</P>
      <P>I do not want to engage in a game of ping-pong with Senator Norris or any other Senator on this matter but a state of mind is not a marital status in law.  It may do a man's health a great amount of good if he floats down Grafton Street thinking he is married to Naomi Campbell, although he is not.  We cannot have a state of mind operating as a marital status because it is not possible.  There are people of both sexes who are very committed to one another who cohabit.  I do not want to be overbearing on this matter but &ldquo;marital status&rdquo; clearly means an individual who is single, married, separated, divorced or widowed.  There is no cohabiting person, homosexual or heterosexual, who is not in one of those categories.</P>

      <P>The final question which Senator Norris and Senator Ryan, in particular, and Senator O'Meara, to a lesser extent, want answered is will cohabiting homosexuals be covered by the legislation? In other words, can they be discriminated against?  Section 31 will ensure this will not happen, although I have repeatedly acknowledged that case law will have to build up in that regard so that specific instances may be replied to in greater detail.</P>
      <P>I confess I share Senator Norris's concern in relation to tedium.  However, I assure him there is no tedium in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

If that is his intention, he should anticipate that determination by making it explicit in the legislation.  I will approach this issue in a completely different way and try to undermine his resistance to the inclusion of this phrase.  Since the Minister believes the inclusion of this phrase is unnecessary &mdash; which means it is fairly neutral &mdash; can he turn it on its head and explain if its inclusion would damage the legislation? If not, he should be in a position to accept it to reassure those of us who have made a strong argument for its inclusion.</P>

Even a cursory reading of section 31 cannot but convey the clear assurance that individuals living in a homosexual relationship and cohabiting may not be discriminated against in terms of employment under the Employment Equality Bill, 1997.  The question of marital status and so on is a different matter but I am satisfied section 31 covers the position about which Senator Ryan and Senator Norris in particular are concerned.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the Bill, as it stands, ensures there will be no discrimination against people on the grounds of sexual orientation, which is inaccurate.  Unless we manage to remove, delete or dilute the operation of section 37, nothing could be clearer than that this Bill enshrines the capacity to discriminate on the grounds of sexual orientation by excluding <Col N="383" /> churches and other groups from its operation. The Minister may not believe me but the Roman Catholic Church is not shy about making this clear not only in Ireland, but all over the world. For example, Cardinal O'Connor of New York paraded around the Border counties saying he was opposed to discrimination against Catholics in employment and housing and then went back to New York and led a campaign to enshrine discrimination against gay people in employment and housing.  Despite this, section 37 provides that if the lifestyle of people conflicts with the ethos of the Catholic Church they can be fired.</P>
      <P>Let us not pretend with the Minister that the Bill effectively outlaws discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation; it enshrines it in section 37.  Perhaps with a fair wind we may get rid of section 37, or at lest effectively dilute it.  In terms of its protection of gay people it is incorrect to say they are protected; they are not.  Not in this respect, nor in respect of section 37.</P>

      <P>The amendment relates to the European Court of Justice which ruled that pay, as interpreted, for example, under the Equal Pay Act, 1974, includes pensions.  The Pensions Act, 1990, also includes equality provisions but the test is different and does not present a model of equality.  We are not satisfied that the provision in this Bill is in line with EU law, indeed we suggest it is regressive in that it removes an equality protection in the pensions area.</P>

      <P>The Senator's amendments would have the effect of introducing pensions equality into the Bill.  There is already a sophisticated code of equal treatment law in the form of Part VII of the Pensions Act, 1990.  Any amendments to the pensions legislation would be pursued by my colleague, the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  He has responsibility for this matter and for the application of EU obligations on equal treatment of pensions and the development of proposals for equality of pensions outside the gender area.  This provision is, therefore, inappropriate to this legislation.</P>

      <P>Based on our advice I must disagree with the Minister.  This is a fundamental <Col N="384" /> point.  We are all concerned about pensions.

As the Senator outlined, a complex volume of European Court of Justice law exists which has arisen from cases of equal pay for work of equal value.  However, these judgments impinge as much on Part VII of the Pensions Act, 1990, as they will on cases arising under Part III of this Bill.  On balance, there is no specific advantage at this stage in deviating from the policy provided in the Bill.

      <P>I thank the Senator for the amendment which seeks to appeal statutory instruments which were made under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  I understand how it could occur to a person with a tidy mind &mdash; mine is not &mdash; that it would be desirable to repeal statutory instruments in the same way as the 1977 Act will be repealed in this Bill.  However, I am firmly and soundly advised that it is not the convention to repeal such instruments.  The reason for this is what is described as the horse and carriage syndrome; once the primary legislation is repealed, the statutory instruments made under it also fall.

      <P>These amendments are extremely important.  The Minister may have a sense of <i>déja vu</i> about amendments Nos. 13 to 16, inclusive, because they relate to discrimination on the basis of political opinion or belief, trade union membership and other equally important aspects.  Similar amendments took up much time during the discussion of the previous Minister's Bill and I noted during my research that Senator Keogh said much about this area and moved amendments.</P>
      <P>Political opinion and belief and membership of political parties, trade unions and other organisations are important elements of activity in society.  The amendments have been tabled to section 6 because it contains general provisions in relation to discrimination and political opinion or belief should not be a cause of discrimination. The amendments are appropriate to this section because we want to ensure that such discrimination is outlawed.  The amendments also make it clear that racial discrimination will not be legalised where exceptions may apply.  I read the Committee Stages debates of the previous Bill and it is important to introduce these amendments at this point.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments.  One tends to think that legislation is intended to cover current events, but this Bill will apply in the future and we do not know what changes will occur in terms of views about membership of trade unions or political parties.  We do not know what political parties may be formed in the future and we may not agree with them.  However, people should not be discriminated against because of their membership of such parties.  I said plenty about this matter during the debates on the previous Bill.  The amendments should be accepted because they are most important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled amendment No. 16 more in hope than confidence that the Minister would accept it because one of the most extensive grounds of discrimination is one's address.  A vast number of young people are aware from an early stage of their education that if they live in certain areas of Cork and Dublin cities and apply for a job, they need to use the accommodation address of their grandmother, uncle or another person, otherwise, their applications may not even receive a reply and they have even less chance of getting the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the general principle.  The specific issue in the city in which I reside is the widely held view that one of the reasons places in two fee paying boys' schools are in great demand is that it guarantees the pupil will be further up the <Col N="387" /> pecking order in terms of employment in many areas relating to financial services in Cork city. This aspect is built into society but we do not like to talk about it because we consider ourselves egalitarian and democratic.  However, Ireland is riddled from top to bottom with snobbery and a belief in the almost unshakeable nature of social advantage and its privileges.  My amendment states that it should be illegal to discriminate against people in terms of employment just because of their address.  This is practised extensively.</P>
    <P>The amendment relating to membership of a trade union is particularly apposite at present. This is not something, as Senator Henry almost suggested, that might happen in the future.  We are in the throes of a dispute about the rights of people to be represented by a trade union which will determine the way society is organised in the future.  We will either have social partnership or that will not be the case.  The right to membership of a trade union is a necessary prerequisite to social partnership.  There cannot be social partnership if one half of the partnership is not allowed to be represented by institutions of their choice.  If employers can decline to employ people because they are members of a trade union, the basis of social partnership will be undermined.</P>
    <P>Society, because of the way it is organised, believes membership of a trade union is not neutral but good.  It believes trade unions are good and they constitute one element of social partnership. Therefore, it should be wrong for employers to discriminate against people because they are members of trade unions, otherwise, it makes a mockery of social partnership.  However, many people are starting to think that social partnership as practised in Ireland is a mockery of social partnership.</P>

      <P>From a cursory glance at the amendments, one would consider them laudable principles that should be included in the Bill. However, when one considers them in greater detail one can envisage a number of additional areas which would merit equal attention by the Minister in terms of inclusion in the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why were they not covered in the amendments?  Amendment No. 14 refers to trade unions and their role in social partnership. Any parliamentarian worth his or her salt who analyses the value of social partnership in recent years will agree that it has been very meritorious, it has worked spectacularly and should be promoted in every way possible.  The purpose of the amendments is to legislate for trade union membership and social partnership.  I do not want to think employers would discriminate against a person solely because he or she is a member of a trade union, but would such legislation be coercive? Would it border on coercing people in certain <Col N="388" /> respects?  It could be said we are coercing people by virtue of legislation in many other ways, but until now social partnership has evolved on the basis of its voluntary dimension.  It has been extremely successful.  The argument inherent in amendment No. 14 is do we make progress by coercing people or do we continue the voluntary evolution of the partnership?  I am inclined to go along with the latter.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 refers to a background characterised by social, educational, income or other disadvantage.  We all have the experience of people coming to us to make complaints about alleged discrimination due to social background. There is ample evidence of it and it concerns me. I appeal to the Minister to examine this issue as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>There are grounds for concern in relation to other areas which the Senator has included in these amendments but it is a case of which areas should be included and which should be excluded.  The Minister set out on the basis of a principle that identifies nine specific areas.  If the four areas identified in the amendments were taken on board in addition to the nine areas targeted by the Minister, it could be said that we were deliberately excluding others which should be equally targeted.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments.  This is the second time in a short period that the Houses have given attention to this legislation.  It will have received so much attention by the time it is enacted that it is unlikely it will be revisited very quickly.  It is important, therefore, that we ensure it is as comprehensive as possible.  It is only logical, in relation to amendment No. 13, that we should outlaw discrimination on the basis of political opinion.  It is accepted that expression of political opinion is a basic human right.  It follows from that it should be part of our domestic law.  Anyone who discriminates in employment on the basis of political opinion should be seen to be committing an offence.</P>
      <P>Political expression is a basic human right and should be protected in our legislation.  One might say discrimination on those grounds is unlikely to arise but in the other jurisdiction on this island cases of discrimination have occurred not alone on grounds of religious belief but political belief. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility to expect the same might happen here.  We should safeguard ourselves against this danger by clearly stating now that discrimination on the grounds of political belief is against the law rather than amending the legislation later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the previous speakers about the importance of amendment No. 14 which would disallow in law discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership.  It is sad to return to this subject at the latter end of this century . The social partnership since 1987 may have lulled many of us into a false sense of security.  Social partnership can be credited with contributing to a large degree to the economic turn around of the <Col N="389" /> last decade but from a macro point of view that turn around has blunted our senses to much of what is happening to people.  The Ryanair dispute shows attempts are being made to discriminate on the basis of trade union membership.</P>
    <P>Those of us in touch with employment on a daily basis will know not only is it a potential ground for discrimination to belong to a trade union, it can be grounds for discrimination to even inquire about becoming a member of a trade union.  When we laud the advantages of the social partnership, we should not forget many of the new jobs are in sectors unprotected by trade unions where employees have no right to be represented by a trade union.  I can give examples where the names of those thinking about joining trade union have been blackened so they have been prevented from gaining employment in that particular area.  This is something which would have happened during the 1913 lockout or in a production of &lsquo;Strumpet City&rsquo;.  It is our duty to realise that discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership, or attempted membership, is still thriving in some sectors of our socalled thriving economy.  We might have thought this problem had been solved.  Not only is it not solved, it is growing.</P>
    <P>Many new jobs are in low paid service areas.  I am a trade union member and I do not absolve them from complacency in this regard.  The fact trade unions have been well established in organised employment has blunted their senses in regard to many people who need their protection. I am glad many of the larger unions are trying to recruit in the newer, less protected sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>It should not take until 1998 for us to protect someone from discrimination on the grounds of trade union membership.  This amendment is entirely reasonable and should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Brendan Ryan's remarks about discrimination on grounds of social, educational, income or other disadvantage.  People from certain areas will not put their address on a job application because they know from experience it will lessen their chances of employment. There are many institutions dealing with social inclusion.  This would be a practical way to combat social exclusion, by ensuring wherever a person lives in the State they are given a fair chance when making a job application.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>A proposal to add three new discriminatory grounds to those already provided for in the Bill is an attractive option.  Amendments tabled by Senator O'Meara identifying trade union membership, political opinion, social, educational, income and other disadvantages are some of a range of options for amendment presented here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been achieved on this Bill on the basis that it was focused.  The focus has been to give effect to the Government's commitment to enact legislation which would outlaw discrimination <Col N="390" /> on the grounds of sex, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religious belief, age, disability, race and membership of the traveller community.  My predecessor, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor, was pressed to accept the whole gamut of analogous amendments when the Employment Equality Bill, 1996, was introduced.  In response to proposals made to him at the time he agreed to broaden the scope of the Bill and added subsection (4).  This subsection commits the Minister to review the operation of the Bill within two years of its enactment.  Accordingly, I regard the principles for change to the Bill contained in these amendments is a matter for another time.  In other words, I am not discounting these amendments but the legislation as presented has been focused and is the reason so much progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the legislation is complex and straddles a fine line.  It has been difficult to draft.  In those circumstances additions to the scope of the Bill would involve a lot more drafting work but, more importantly, would involve policy developments which go far and beyond the simple amendment of section 6 as proposed in these amendments.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons I hope Senators will understand that, no more than it was practical for my predecessor to accept the gamut of analogous amendments, it is not possible for me to accept them either.  I am not rejecting the amendments on the grounds that they are not laudable but because the legislation must remain focused at this time.  The legislation will be reviewed in two years time.  It is possible that that will be the time to carry out the necessary drafting work and to develop policy along the lines mentioned in these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite the fact that a short time has elapsed since Mr. Taylor's original Bill was before the previous Dáil, much has changed outside the Dáil.  Obviously the Ryanair dispute has put a different complexion on the reality faced by trade union members throughout the country and they are deeply concerned.  Another example is Seagate which finally closed today.  Its workers were not unionised either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says more drafting and policy development would be required to again look at how the inclusion of this principle might affect the Bill but now is the time to do that.  This is an urgent matter which cannot wait for a review in two years time.  We do not know whether the fragile nature of social partnership will have been shattered by the Ryanair dispute in the interim. We, on this side of the House, feel that this issue is extremely important if only because of the Ryanair dispute.  As pointed out by Senator Fitzgerald and others, we have happily muddled along on the basis of the voluntary nature of social partnership hoping that the current situation would not arise, in other words, that the partnership would be put to the test by an employer <Col N="391" /> who simply refuses to recognise the rights of a union to negotiation and the rights of workers to be members of a trade union.</P>
    <P>This is the discrimination general provision section which states: &ldquo;For the purpose of this Act discrimination shall be taken to occur where. . &rdquo; on gender, marital status, etc.  Now is the time to include this section in the Bill.  This is an employment equality Bill and relates to one's experience as an employee.  For many people, particularly those in Ryanair, trade union membership and the conditions that pertain to them as employees are specifically relevant at this time because we are debating this legislation.  If it requires more drafting and examination of policy we should do it.  We could postpone the Bill for a few weeks.  This issue is extremely important and I urge to Minister to take this on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an axiom of 20th century life that the poor always have to wait.  Notwithstanding the rhetoric of social exclusion the legislative basis for ending it is always something which needs further consideration.  Like Senator O'Meara I do not want to force into a Bill an amendment which the Minister says the Government has not had adequate time to consider in terms of the technicality of drafting amendments.  Having read the 105 page Supreme Court judgment on the previous legislation, I sympathise with the Minister in terms of the problems of drafting legislation like this.  We could accept the principles here and postpone Report Stage for two months while the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government take time to consider them.  To do otherwise would imply that these principles are not as important as others.</P>
      <P>My view is that for a huge number of people living in our major urban areas some of the issues mentioned, particularly the issue of knowing that you are discriminated against from the day your are born, are far more important in their lives than many of the grounds for discrimination that are being prohibited in this Bill.  As it is written, there is a degree to which this is middle class legislation but it protects and deals with the preoccupations of the Dublin liberal intelligentsia.  I support all these preoccupations but it does not represent the priorities of those who are most at risk of discrimination in our society.  It is over-whelmingly on one side of a class division.  It provides for a whole lot of laudable objectives which I support but it leaves out the most disadvantaged in Irish society.  We do not want the Minister to revolutionise the Bill now but there is a fundamental issue here about whether equality applies to people who are poor or to people in certain categories who are in a position to make a fuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has refused to accept the amendment.  I find that strange.  The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or are believed to be&rdquo;.  The paragraph would then read: &ldquo;that <Col N="392" /> they are or are believed to be of different sexual orientation. ..&rdquo;.  If people object to your lifestyle or general behaviour, and wish to deny you your rights or discriminate against you, then that is very important and I cannot understand why the Minister will not accept this simple amendment.</P>
      <P>Discrimination against someone in the workplace because they wish to join a trade union or introduce a trade union into a place of employment breaches a fundamental right.  The Ryanair dispute has brought this question home to all of us.  I accept that the Government is unhappy with what is happening in Ryanair and with the attitude of the company in the dispute and the Minister has an opportunity to put Government feelings into legislative effect.</P>
      <P>I have had experience of discrimination against trade union activists in the workplace.  Employers will deny promotion and responsibility to an active trade Unionist and will see such an employee as a troublemaker.  The Minister says the amendments are laudable.  If they are why can they not be inserted now instead of waiting for a review of the legislation in two years time? Enough is happening to convince us of the need for these amendments.</P>

      <P>All that glisters is not gold.</P>
      <P>The fact that these amendments are laudable does not make it practicable to insert them now. The issue of freedom of association has been considered in the courts.  The question of whether membership of a trades union should be a ground for discrimination has constitutional implications. It would not be possible to come back in a couple of weeks and amend this legislation in the way proposed.  A considerable amount of work would have to be done and a considerable amount of legal advice taken.  Even then I do not know if the grounds stated would be constitutional.  The interpretation of the constitutionality of legislation is a matter for the Supreme Court.  That said, analogous amendments were put before the previous Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Taylor, and he amended the legislation only minimally.  He did not accept analogous amendments. There were very good reasons not to do so then and, even if circumstances have changed, there are still very good reasons.  Not least of these are those I have outlined.  There are others which I outlined in my initial contribution.  They relate to the question of the development of policy in the areas with which the amendments deal.</P>
      <P>The legislation will be reviewed in two years time and I have said that I would be amenable to amendments.  Irrespective of how many grounds for discrimination are included in the legislation, an argument could be made by any half decent philosopher that the list of grounds for discrimination is not exhaustive.  Some grounds are clearer and require to be tackled more urgently than others.  I intend to maintain the focus of the legislation on this occasion and the question of further amendments must await another day.</P>

      <P>These amendments are textual in nature.  The Bill provides a wide definition of the ground of race which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origin.  I take it that the Senators do not wish to alter the definition itself but merely to change the name of the definition in the Bill.  The change is one of nomenclature and is not intended to impact on the purpose or scope of the anti-discrimination provisions of the Bill.  I am not convinced that significant benefits are to be gained by acceding to the Senators' proposals and I ask them not the press these amendments.</P>

      <P>The amendment seeks to reduce the age of discrimination and is inspired by an amendment put down by the Minister's party on Report Stage in the Dáil during the debate on the original Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator seeks to lower the age threshold in respect of which age discrimination in employment applies under the Bill.  One rationale for the age threshold provided in the Bill is the unique and special protection afforded to employees under the age of 18 in the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1996. It is comprehensive in its safeguards for young people and as a result of this legislation persons under the age of 18 are not entitled for socially good reasons related to their protection from exploitation, to participate on an equal footing with other employees in the labour market.</P>
      <P>The age threshold of 18 only applies in respect of age discrimination and does not apply in respect of protection against discrimination on all the other grounds covered in the Bill.  In addition, access to vocational training is governed by a separate age threshold, which is the minimum statutory school leaving age.  Accordingly, I am not disposed towards accepting the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed amendments are not considered necessary as subsection (3) does not in any way limit the application of subsection (1).  The purpose of subsection (3) is to clarify the entitlement to equal pay in respect of work of equal value and extends to a situation where lower paid workers do work of greater value.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 22 is a matter of drafting style which I do not propose to accept.  With regard to amendment No. 23, when the Bill was drafted there was a conscious decision not to overlook the position of agency workers.  However, the labour market for them is considerably different to that for employees generally.  For example, their pay levels, hours of working and contractual arrangements are often at variance with those of employees generally.  To generalise, I would say that the pay of agency workers is characteristically higher than that of other workers, but their working and contractual arrangements are commonly less beneficial.</P>
      <P>If, under this Bill, I were to provide for equality between agency and non-agency workers, the consequences are evident.  Agency workers would tend to claim equality with workers generally in respect of those aspects of the contracts of other workers which are more beneficial than those of agency workers.  Other workers, in turn, would seek to attain, through equality cases, those elements of the agency worker's contract which are more beneficial than their own.  In an ideal world I would be well disposed to the Senator's amendment.  However, the complexity of the labour market makes it essential that agency and non-agency workers should be distinguished under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to make the position of agency workers who are employed for a period longer than two months identical with that of non-agency workers covered in the Bill.  Quite apart from the difficulties to which I have already referred, there is potential for considerable problems if a timescale such as two months employment were to be introduced for eligibility for agency workers under the Bill.  For example, employers would be likely to let agency workers go just as they come up to the two month threshold. The development of such a practice, even <Col N="397" /> to a limited extent, cannot be in the interests of agency workers.  In the circumstances, I deem that the provisions in the Bill protect the interests of all workers, including agency workers, and employers.</P>

      <P>This amendment is also inspired by Senator Keogh's contribution in the Dáil during the debate on the previous Bill.  It was designed to meet a particularly worthy concern about the job description versus what one might be doing in reality.  The comparison applies to what they do more than what they are employed to do.  It provides clarification and additional protection.  It is a short amendment but it would strengthen the operation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment does not add anything to the text of the Bill, as drafted.  It may be based on a misreading of the Bill.  It does not matter in section 7(1) whether an applicant for equal pay can or cannot establish that the work she is doing is in accordance with her terms of employment.  What matters is that she can establish that the work actually being performed by her is the same as that of another employee, is similar in nature to that being done by another employee or is of equal value to that being done by another employee.  In other words, what matters is that the employee can satisfy one or more of the conditions set out in paragraphs (a) to (c) of subsection (1).  Once that fact is established the applicant for equal pay must be regarded as employed to do like work with the other employee.</P>

    <P>(c) the work which is performed by one is equal in value to the work which is or would be performed by the other, having regard to such matters as skill, physical or mental requirements, responsibility and working conditions.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment and amendment No. 24 raise the issue which is central to this legislation.  It is a point which has dogged this legislation from the beginning, but it is a particularly important one. It is the notion of a comparator or how one compares work, particularly for the purposes of eliminating discrimination.  My concerns with it reflect the concerns of ICTU, the National Women's Council, etc. , specifically in relation to people who are largely in low-paid employment.  My concerns reflect those raised by Members of the then Opposition at the time the previous Bill was debated, specifically Deputy Woods and Senator Keogh, who was then a Deputy, who were happy to make arguments on this issue.  It would be wrong of us not to look at it again in that regard.</P>
    <P>I know it is an extremely difficult subject which caused great drafting and other difficulties for the previous Minister.  However, I appeal to the Minister to look at it again because the question of a comparator and being able to compare work is central to an Employment Equality Bill, particularly because it largely relates to work areas where women, for the most part, are grouped in low-pay environments.</P>
    <P>Having regard to what Senator Ryan said about his earlier amendment, this should not be seen as legislation which applies only to the concerns of middle class people.  The laudable objective of the Bill, which is largely achieved, is to proactively root out discrimination.  This central point is extremely important in achieving that and that is why we tabled amendments Nos. 21 and 24.  I appeal to the Minister to consider these amendments carefully.</P>

      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to introduce the concept of the notional or hypothetical comparator into the Bill. There is little doubt but that there is some merit in the proposal.  It was, in fact, considered by my predecessor.  When I took over at the helm of the Department, I, too, gave this matter my consideration. Having considered it deeply, both Mr. Taylor and I would appear to have reached the same conclusions.  Unfortunately, for Senator <Col N="399" /> O'Meara, that conclusion is that the amendments should not be accepted.</P>
      <P>I was and am still, indeed, interested in finding a means to gradually dismantle vertical and horizontal segregation in the labour market.  Unfortunately, it does not appear to me at this time possible to develop a viable model for a hypothetical comparator which would achieve the results which are intended by the amendments.  I regret, therefore, that I am not in a position to accept the Senator's amendments.  I understand precisely from where she is coming.  I appreciate the desirability of the change which she is suggesting. Unfortunately, I, like my predecessor, am unable to come up with a viable model now.  In those circumstances I must reject the amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that it is a difficult area, but I would have hoped that we would not just abandon trying to achieve the objective here on which we are all agreed.  In fact, I had hoped the Minister would table an amendment on the matter which would indicate that at least his Department and the Government were anxious to address this problem.  I wonder if the Minister has given any thought as to whether there is another avenue for dealing with it. Obviously, this legislation setting out a statutory authority and giving it various powers to have a conscious and proactive approach to outlawing discrimination must have some powers to address obvious discrimination against a group.  Other sections of the Bill give the authority some scope in that regard.  Has any thought been given to how one might deal with this matter or whether it might be addressed in the context of other legislation?  I am disinclined to leave the matter lie because it has been a policy issue of considerable importance, particularly to women's groups and the ICTU.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to abandon the matter.  I hoped for greater discussion on it and that the initiative would not come from me alone.  I am disappointed the Minister did not put forward an amendment.  Are we going to give up on this issue?  Is there no other means by which to pursue it?  Can the Minister assure me that there may be another means of tackling it in the broader context of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If one were to condense the amendments into one idea it would be the elimination of low pay.  In so far as I have been able to do so in this legislation within the constraints in which I operate, I tried to expand the rights to equal pay.  For example, the place requirement restriction which existed in the previous legislation has been deleted.  I also provide that a comparison can be made with the a previous incumbent of a job, not necessarily with someone currently employed.  They are advances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tackling low pay should be considered in the context of minimum pay legislation, not in the context of this Bill.  The Programme for Government <Col N="400" /> specified that the introduction of a national minimum hourly wage should be priority.  To give effect to this commitment, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has established a National Minimum Wage Commission which is examining the issue.  I understand that the commission is to issue its report in March.  When that report is available and noting that the objective of a hypothetical comparator is desirable, I may revisit this issue.  If so, I will do so in the context of a minimum wage.</P>
    <P>I trust these commitments are sufficient.  The Bill has been amended from the original legislative proposal to achieve some of the desirable objectives which these amendments seek. However, I was constrained in what I could do because it is very difficult to come up with a viable model and we have not done so to date. The issue can be revisited appropriately in the context of a minimum wage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his remarks.  I agree that the issue could be dealt with in the context of the minimum wage but that is not sufficient.  This Bill seeks to outlaw discrimination on a number of grounds, including gender. The Minister's party declared in its manifesto &mdash; a document with which I assume the Minister had some input &mdash; that it would amend anti-discrimination pay legislation to allow the use of notional comparators and it indicated that this would mean that workers in occupations which are over-whelmingly female would be able to base equal pay claims on the earnings of other groups of similarly qualified workers doing similar jobs.</P>
      <P>I accept that on taking office and examining the matter the Minister encountered the same difficulties as his predecessor.  However, this problem applies largely to female workers and, in that context, it is correct to look at it in discrimination legislation.  One of the primary objectives in this Bill is to increase the powers of the equality authority and to specifically examine the way in which women are discriminated against.  Unless we deal with this issue we will fall short of achieving our objectives.</P>
      <P>I accept there are great difficulties in coming up with a viable model that could be successfully included in legislation.  I urge the Minister to engage in discussions with the National Women's Council, the women's committee of the ICTU and unions representing women in low paid occupations, to consider how the problem might be tackled other than by a minimum wage.  It must be possible to come up with a legislative framework. We can aspire to achieve all we want with codes of practice, ministerial statements and task forces.  We want to eliminate low pay for women and young people but without a legislative framework we will not do so.  That is why this reforming legislation is so welcome.  It creates an authority with power.  It is disappointing that this issue appears so intractable and I am sure it is one to which we will return.</P>

      <P>I support the sentiments of the amendment and I understand the complexity of the issue.  However, a good place for the Government to start would be to make sure that women who work in the public sector are paid properly. I attempted to assist people in Cork who are paid £1.70 an hour by the State to work as home helps. The simplest, albeit expensive, solution is to ensure that women who work for the State are not discriminated against in employment is to ensure they are paid properly.  That would be a good start.  I would find it easier to be at one with the Minister's bona fides if the State paid its employees properly.</P>

      <P>I ask Senators to consider the impact of the Bill and reflect on the wide range of additional discriminatory categories which require to be addressed in the extensive review of agreements and orders.  I also draw attention for the need, in that review process, to examine not only provisions which give rise to direct discrimination but also those less obvious, indirectly discriminatory provisions.  In all these circumstances and in deference to the contribution which the social partners can make to implementing this legislation effectively, I continue to support the one year derogation provided in the section and appeal to Members to do so also.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (4), line 24, after &ldquo;false&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or who publishes or displays and advertisement contrary to subsection (1)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 10 is extremely important and welcome because it covers advertising and we have seen instances where advertisements for employment obviously discriminate.  We will now have a legislative and statutory framework to ensure that is outlawed.  It is a comprehensive section and I look forward to seeing it applied.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, there will only be an offence if a false statement is made, in other words, publishing a discriminatory advertisement without making a statement in relation to it does not appear to be outlawed by the legislation.  Amendment No. 28 is designed to make it clear, in the strongest possible terms, that any type of discriminatory advertising or false statements would be outlawed.  It is a constructive amendment designed to ensure the section has the widest and strongest possible application and is allowed to do everything which it sets out to do.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's amendments.  Some employment advertisements can be blatantly discriminatory and the Bill goes almost all the way towards addressing this problem, as I said on Second Stage.  Nevertheless, these amendments, especially amendment No. 28, are eminently reasonable and I urge the Minister to accept them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to prohibit employment discrimination on nine specified grounds by means of providing redress for persons who have suffered discrimination. Under the Bill, discrimination is part of the civil code; criminal offences do not arise except in limited circumstances, for example, where a person knowingly and deliberately acts in an illegal matter such as in the circumstances set out in section 10(4) and there is no other appropriate remedy.</P>
      <P>The effect of the proposed amendment to subsection (4) would be to make the publication or display of a discriminatory advertisement an offence even in circumstances where the person publishing or displaying the advertisement is unaware that it is discriminatory.  Such a broad provision would, in my view, be contrary to natural justice.  In any event the existing procedures set out in section 10(5) provide more satisfactory results for those who would suffer disadvantage as a result of discriminatory advertising.  This amendment would leave the matter open for interpretation by the courts as to the appropriate redress in cases of discriminatory advertising.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) is clear in its purpose and empowers the equality authority to seek a High Court or Circuit Court injunction to prevent the filling of a post in a discriminatory manner.  In addition, the authority is empowered under section 79 to refer an advertisement which it considers to be discriminatory to the Director of Equality Investigations for investigation, or to the Circuit Court or the High Court to seek an injunction to prevent a further publication or display of a discriminatory advertisement.  I am not disposed to accept amendment No. 29 because the policy I wish to pursue is one of injunctive relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to amendment No. 30, the right to seek an injunction in respect of discriminatory advertisements is confined under subsection (5) to the authority, as the publication of such advertisements is considered a public interest issue rather than one which affects any one individual.  If individuals were allowed to refer such cases to the courts, one advertisement could result in the unnecessary reference to the courts of a multiplicity of cases and that would not be desirable. In addition, no discrimination will have occurred against any individual under the Bill until the individual comes in contact with the advertiser and he or she is treated less favourably than another person responding to the same advertisement. At that point a prospective employee would have a right of redress under the Bill in the <Col N="404" /> normal way.  I, therefore, do not propose to accept the amendments.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 18, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where an educational or training body wishes to apply to reserve places in a vocational training course it shall, after consultation with the Authority, prepare and publish a statement describing the religious ethos of the institution and explaining why it proposes to reserve <Col N="405" /> places.  Such a statement shall be prepared and published by the persons responsible for the day to day management of the institution.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Members of these Houses have probably had an earful of this topic over the past five years.  It is true these sections have been scrutinised by the Supreme Court and found, to the surprise of many people, to be constitutional.  However, the judges said that just because a provision is strange or anomalous does not render it repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am happy to send my children to a denominational school because I value a great deal about that.  However, I greatly resent institutions which are not directly involved using education, training and health as instruments of power by proxy.  The purpose of these amendments is to render accountable the power contained in sections 12 and 37 to give some rights to defend religious ethos in its variety of fashions.</P>
    <P>This Bill is extraordinarily carefully worded in many ways but it leaves the Minister with the power to extend the application of section 12 beyond the named institution, which is the Adelaide Hospital.  We all understand why this is being done and agree with it.  However, section 12(4)(b) refers to &ldquo;or places in a vocational training course specified in an order made under subsection (5)&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) allows that where an education or training body applies to the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children &ldquo;for an order permitting the body concerned to reserve places in a vocational or training course offered by the body&rdquo; the Minister may &ldquo;by order allow the body to reserve places in such as number as seem reasonably necessary. to meet the purposes set out in subsection (4)&rdquo;.  The purpose of subsection (4) is to ensure the availability of nurses and primary school teachers of a particular denomination.</P>
    <P>If people believe they have a right to this &mdash; and most of society would accept that principle, in so far as it is honestly articulated &mdash; then we, as a society, are entitled to know precisely what they want.  Orders under this section to extend this privilege to reserve places ought to be made in as public, transparent and accountable a fashion as possible, so that they do not do more than is intended under this legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 states that:</P>
    <P>Where an educational or training body wishes to apply to reserve places in a vocational training course it shall, after consultation with the Authority [it seems appropriate to specify consultation with the Employment Equality Authority], prepare and publish a statement describing the religious ethos of the institution and explaining why it proposes to reserve places.  Such a statement shall be prepared and published by the persons responsible for the day to day management of the institution.</P>
    <P>I used that language in the amendment, which is similar in spirit to one which I have tabled later, <Col N="406" /> because if people wish to seek recognition of their ethos they ought to have to explain to us what is meant by that ethos.  It ought not to be a moving target so that, depending on which issue they wanted to make difficult for people at a particular time, they could invoke vaguely worded provisions and argue in private with the Minister for Education and Science or the Minister for Health and Children.  Where people want to exercise these rights, they should make public the basis on which those rights would be exercised.</P>
    <P>This is a very simple request which is not trying to take anything from them or to inhibit their right to look after the well being of the schools or hospitals which concern them.  It is simply saying that we are entitled to know what is meant by an ethos and that that knowledge must have a legal basis.</P>
    <P>These rights should be sought by the people who run the institutions concerned; it should not be a matter of the Catholic hierarchy or the Church of Ireland hierarchy negotiating with the Government.  Too often, good people in education or health care must front power plays operated by other people, which is why amendment No. 33 specifies that the statement should &ldquo;be prepared and published by the persons responsible for the day to day management of the institution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have never been very keen on the grouping of amendments but I am even less keen in this case because it is unfair both to the House and to me to have to jump from section 12 to section 37, but that is how it is.  Section 37 was trumpeted across the nation, often from a position of hostile, illiberal liberalism.  Some people seem to wish to use legislation to force things on others that they should not be asked to accept.  I have no problems with denominational education.  However, I have a problem with the use of denominational education to enforce a view of Roman Catholic or Church of Ireland morality.  When section 37 makes an exclusion of discrimination on particular grounds and in certain employments, particularly in the cases of religious, educational or medical institutions, the right is being given to give favourable treatment on religious grounds to an employee over another person where it is reasonable to do so.</P>
    <P>Short of saying &ldquo;where it is in the opinion&rdquo; of somebody, that wording is about as weak as one could use, and there are a variety of attempts to change it.  Senator O'Toole and I want to insert &ldquo;taking all the circumstances into consideration&rdquo; and to substitute &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; with &ldquo;necessary&rdquo;. People ought to be able to demonstrate these things.  If it is necessary to discriminate between people on religious grounds because the ethos of the school is at risk, that should be open to intelligent people's scrutiny.  It should not be done behind closed doors by interview panels that are accountable to nobody but the bishop or whoever the patron is.  The process should be open; let us have the reasons why it is necessary to do so, not why it is reasonable to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="407" /> Many people have tremors of horror at the provision that the institution &ldquo;takes action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution.&rdquo; Who undermines the ethos of an institution?  Is it the eminent secondary school teacher, who owns 15 slum dwellings in a small town and rips off the poor, or is it the person living with someone who is not their spouse?  I know which has been sacked and which has not.  These amendments relate to leaving the privilege or right of denominational education to those who wish to have it, but not leaving prejudice and antiquated concepts of morality to them.  Those have nothing to do with a proper Christian ethos.</P>
    <P>My amendments require a school to show that an action has to be proven to be necessary to prevent an employee or prospective employee from undermining the religious ethos of a school. It is one thing to say we cannot have a collection of people with militantly atheistic views propagandising our young people; it is another to say that people who are not accountable to us, to the Minister or anybody else, can look at somebody and say: &ldquo;It is reasonable to believe that something you are doing is undermining the religious ethos of the institution.&rdquo; Those people do not have to define the ethos of the institution.  It is likely that a board of management will not make such a decision.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the wording here is essentially that of the previous legislation.  To quote the Supreme Court on another matter, this is &ldquo;a strange and anomalous provision&rdquo;.  That does not mean it is unconstitutional, but it is assuredly strange and anomalous.  I appeal to the Minister to look at these amendments.  He should at least ask those with these extraordinary powers to be more accountable to those of us who fund them, who give them their legal rights and who entrust our children to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan.  Section 12 and related parts of section 37 contributed to the rejection of the previous draft of the Bill by the Supreme Court.  I acknowledge the difficulty of any Minister in drawing up provisions which would allow the pluralism we wish to see and which would allow people of various religions to act without undue interference by the State.  On the other hand, unwarranted treatment cannot be enshrined or promoted by the legislation.  It is a difficult area in which to draft provisions.  I told the Minister's predecessor that it was easy to offer criticisms, but it was less easy to offer constructive solutions.  This Minister has been willing to listen, and improvements have been made to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 33 is reasonable.  It is in order for us to provide that institutions run by religious orders, in the education or health sectors, may provide for the recruitment or training of their members.  I was involved in the campaign of the <Col N="408" /> Adelaide Hospital to secure recognition of its right to train non-Catholic nurses in the new Tallaght hospital.  I was glad that the then Government acceded to their request.  This type of provision should be protected.  However, when a body such as a hospital or training college applies to the relevant Minister for the order outlined in this section, that body should publish a statement as requested by the amendment explaining its ethos and why it proposes to reserve places.  That will strengthen the legislation against those who criticise it.  I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I also support Senator Ryan's amendment.  Ironically, when this Bill was referred to the Supreme Court, the provisions regarding religious ethos were not the grounds on which the Bill was found unconstitutional.  The effect has been to encourage the Minister not to be inclined to alter any of the sections.  Without pre-empting the Minister's response, I anticipate a certain difficulty in relation to any amendments in this section, apart from the controversy it has caused in the past.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann congratulates the Government on the allocation of £26 million to An Chomhairle Ealaíon in 1998, thereby enabling the Council to complete the implementation of the Arts Plan one year ahead of that envisaged by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Cuireann sé an-áthas orm an rún seo a mholadh. Faoi mar atá luaite sa rún, tá sé soiléir go bhfuil ciste an-fhlaithiúil curtha ar fáil don Chomhairle Ealaíon, sin £26 milliún ar fad.

Chomh maith leis sin is maith an rud é go bhfuil siad ag leathnú amach ní hamháin ins na háiteanna móra ach go mór i measc an phobail go háitiúil.</P>
      <P>It gives me great pleasure to move this motion. There is no doubt that the Arts Council is an integral part of life in Ireland.  It has a proud history and has played a major role in the promotion of the arts.  People would agree that a fund of £26 million is exceptionally generous.  This is based on a specific plan drawn up by the Arts Council to which submissions were made by interested parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the important role of the arts in the world today.  We have always been told, particularly in times of affluence, that attention must be paid to leisure time.  Ireland has a proud history and tradition in terms of creativity. <Col N="409" /> Many people would say that we have made a major impact not only here but throughout the world.  Not a day passes that the name of Ireland does not appear in lights in different parts of the world.</P>
    <P>We all wish the Arts Council well.  We know that the diversity of the arts requires a particular type of approach and policy.  We are all aware of the major national institutions which play a vital role in our lives.  No one would suggest that we should diminish their role as they enhance our lives.  It is important that the arts are accessible to all people, irrespective of their wealth or otherwise. That has been one of the main thrusts of the policies adopted by the Arts Council and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands and her Department.</P>
    <P>We should not underestimate the input to the arts at local and national level.  We must always bear in mind that people, particularly those in amateur dramatics and music, are the bedrock on which subsequent distinctions are developed.  I am not saying they are ignored but it is important to remember that, over the years, people gave their time voluntarily to help others to identify and develop their talents.  While the arts are perceived as elitist, they are also relevant to the people.  I appeal to the Arts Council to consider how it could help amateur as well as professional movements.</P>
    <P>I have a long association &mdash; some say a vested interest &mdash; with Irish traditional music.  Some 20 or 25 years ago traditional music was associated more with the past and it did not qualify as an art form.  However, today it has been given a priority rating.  I recall some years ago the Arts Council commissioned a report on the living arts in Ireland which was subsequently published under the strange title, &ldquo;Audiences, Amateurs and Acquisitions&rdquo;.  That report showed that traditional music was the premier pursuit of the people surveyed in all age groups and locations in the country.  I was disappointed that report was shelved at the time.  It would be worth studying why old native music can compete so well in the modern art world.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to those involved in the music movement through the years.  People might have referred to them as fiddlers, box players and so on and in their time, we may have associated them only with house functions yet today they fill Carnegie Hall, Royal Albert Hall and all the major halls of the world.  We should also recognise Irish dancing.  Many people might have regarded it as a figure of fun to see little boys and girls learning the steps and dancing yet &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; have broken all records.  Today Michael Flatley claimed that &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; will go into the Guinness Book of Records surpassing any other show in terms of attendance.  Already two million people have seen &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; and 2.5 million videos have been sold.  The same would probably apply to &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo;.  We all laud that and are delighted it is the case.  The intrinsic value of the <Col N="410" /> native arts has been recognised by those outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>With a parish pump attitude, I refer to my town and Brú Ború, a centre at the foot of the Rock of Cashel.  When it performed on Australian television it had 10 million viewers.  The station received 180,000 calls as a result of the performance which it repeated five days later to 10 million more viewers.  We are talking about exceptionally large numbers supporting the native arts.</P>
    <P>I hope the Arts Council will find ways and means of redirecting itself.  I appreciate from where the Arts Council came and why it perhaps catered for a particular art form.  In some ways, without excusing it, I understand why the native arts at that time did not feature to the extent to which they should have done.  Through the work of people on the ground and the popularity and momentum which was created, they are now centre stage and that must be recognised by the Arts Council.  While it is only a small area of the arts, I would not let the opportunity pass without mentioning it.</P>
    <P>The £26 million made available is obviously important.  It is not possible to progress, particularly in a competitive world, without funds at one's disposal.  We must be careful in that sometimes finance and creativity are not necessarily compatible.  Some of the best works, including writing, film, theatre and so on, were produced when people were deprived.  When one is challenged, one gets the best from oneself.  I would not like art to become subservient to the box office or to the grant culture.  The Arts Council would probably say that as well but it is important for artists to retain a degree of independence because it cultivates the creativity about which I speak.  It would be worth the Arts Council's while to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>The people will welcome the amount of grant aid made available.  Looking back at any parish, there was always support for drama, music, dance or any form of art and the public wanted to see it prosper.  If the money is well used, I have no doubt but that the public will respond.  I compliment the Minister on her achievements since coming into office.  We are all aware she has looked on the arts in a representative way.  She travelled to many functions and encouraged many people in their work.  All people like to be encouraged in that way.  I am pleased to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and echo the comments of my colleague, Senator Ó Murchú, on her activities in her Department since assuming power.  The decision by the Minister to provide a budget of £26 million in the current year for the Arts Council is a widely welcome injection.  It is an increase of £5.2 million &mdash; a significant 25 per cent over the level of funding for 1997.  I suggest it gives the lie to an unfounded perception which seemed to be abroad that arts policy belonged to one party and Minister.  Lest I be attacked for making a political point, we <Col N="411" /> should acknowledge the excellent work done by the Minister's predessor.  It is inevitable that as he was the first incumbent of a newly created office of State much of the kudos for development will be attached to him.</P>
      <P>However, the activities of this Minister in the past six to nine months have proven a point.  I often heard that somehow Fianna Fáil did not have the same appreciation for the importance of the arts as other parties.  In that regard, the Minister has clearly demonstrated the Government's commitment to the development of the arts.  The most important aspect of the Minister's funding for the arts is that the arts plan published by the last Government will be completed a year ahead of schedule.  This is an astonishing achievement and one which I do not believe has been emulated in any other Department in that funding set aside for a particular area of policy will accelerate that development to such an astonishing degree. It places a heavy burden on the Arts Council in discharging its responsibilities.  While I agree with the aims and objectives of the arts plan which covers all art forms, including music, opera, dance, visual arts, film, literature and drama, the priority of this Government and the Arts Council should be to develop the arts infrastructure outside Dublin and other major centres and make the arts more accessible to a wider population than the traditional middle class.  Let us be honest. Ireland has earned a certain amount of kudos internationally from substantial and important events to which, to take Senator Ó Murchú's point with which I agree, the majority have not traditionally related yet they are important in their own right.</P>
      <P>I support the view that the arts in all its forms should have a higher priority in our education system, especially music and drama, which has not traditionally been the case.  There is a rich tradition of amateur drama in this country.  One of the greatest pleasures of my young life was going to see the great Anew McMaster when he visited my home town of Drumshanbo.  I know I am probably giving my age away but it was an event which I will always remember.  I was ten years of age at the time but such was the impact of this great classical actor on my consciousness that I still vividly remember his Othello and portrayal of St. Patrick among many others which he performed that afternoon on the stage of the local cinema, the only arts centre as such in the town at the time.  It was then I first become aware of the power of Shakespearean tragedy and that God promised St. Patrick on Croagh Patrick that Ireland would disappear beneath the waves seven years before the end of the world.  I never forgot that and I hope he keeps his promise so that wherever I am at the time I will be suitably attired.  Artistic endeavour performed in such a professional manner can be appreciated even by a ten year old so it should not necessarily have to be exclusive to adults or the adult mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="412" /> There is a widespread view in rural Ireland, of which the Minister who represents a rural constituency is probably more acutely aware than most, that money for the arts is distributed among the elite who happen to live in Dublin or Cork. The ordinary person working at community level has little opportunity to access the financial resources necessary to provide an adequate profile for the arts at local level.  I say it is a perception but, as we know in politics, perception is all and reality sometimes does not take much account of this.</P>
    <P>However, I am pleased to note that in making its decisions on funding for the current year the Arts Council concentrated much of its resources on support for the important and innovative work of existing arts organisations throughout the country.  It will support more than 80 festivals nationwide, ranging from the Willie Clancy Summer School to the Cork Film Festival.  I understand that it also supports the Joe Mooney Summer School in Drumshambo.  Although it has the name of my late father I am not directly involved in its organisation.  I applaud those who are involved for not only initiating this event in 1989 after he suddenly passed away in 1988, but also for building it to such an extent that it now ranks second only to the Willie Clancy school in terms of its attraction to people from outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>I note that the press release from the Arts Council tends to single out the internationally known festivals as if it is attempting to impress people that its funding covers artistic activity at a certain level.  Why should it not be as proud of some of the smaller festivals?  This approach represents a mindset rather than the reality and it perpetuates the elitist view.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to spread money around the pork barrel, local festivals, which often have to struggle, should be better supported.  They rely on voluntary effort &mdash; Senator Ó Murchú referred to this when speaking about Comhaltas Ceoilteoirí &mdash; in the absence of which very few of their activities would take place.</P>
    <P>The creation of arts officers in each local authority area supplemented by similar appointments by the area partnership boards in recent times is also to be welcomed.  However, according to the 1995 report, approximately a dozen local authorities had not at that time appointed local officers.  Perhaps the Minister has a view on this, although I understand that most of them have appointed arts officers at this stage.  We never had an arts officer in Leitrim; however, we now not only have one, who is co-financed by our colleagues in Longford County Council, but the area partnership board has two arts officers operating within the rural communities.  They are doing excellent work.</P>
    <P>Traditional music has for long been a second priority in terms of arts funding.  However, it has proved that not only is it acceptable and successful among the Irish at home but also among the non-Irish abroad.  The case for traditional music was well made by Senator Ó Murchú and I hope <Col N="413" /> that the time has long passed when Comhaltas Ceoltóirí and others involved in traditional music had to go cap in hand to the Arts Council to justify funding applications.  I am sure the council has learnt from the great success of &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; and from the enormous explosion of interest in things Irish, especially in the area of music.</P>
    <P>There are many other areas to which this arts plan relates and there are many other areas on which the sum of £26 million will be well spent. However, this is an opportunity to put down a benchmark that after nine months in office the Minister has served her people in the arts well.  I hope this is the end of one chapter and the beginning of yet another glorious one.  I commend the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús báire caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann sé áthas orm go bhfuil mé in ann a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht seo anocht agus cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire.  Tá sé tábhachtach go bhfuil sí ann.  The motion is clear and specific and, taken at face value, is difficult to quibble with.  We welcome the announcement by the Arts Council of its grant decisions for 1998 and the increase in funding to the many arts groups around the country.</P>
      <P>However, many in the arts world know it is disingenuous for the Government to gloat and claim credit in the motion for something which has come about because of the magnificent work undertaken over the past three years by the previous Government.  In this regard, I am pleased Senator Mooney recognised the contribution of the former Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins.  It would be remiss of me not also to pay tribute to Deputy Higgins, a colleague of mine from the constituency of Galway West.  As Minister, his contribution to the arts was enormous and he was the fulcrum around which they revolved.  He brought a new vision to the arts.  It was a time when the seeds were sown and the structures were put in place to transform the intra-arts world.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that those, including the former Minister, who worked so hard to bring the Arts Council and the level of arts funding to their current levels are not here to reap their rewards. Their contribution is not forgotten by those involved in the arts who know that the increased funding and support for the arts resulted from major initiatives undertaken by the previous Government.  The former Minister's work in this area will remain unchallenged in the history of the State.  This is not to take away from the present Minister, who will continue to carry with distinction the torch lit by her predecessor.  It is ironic that both Ministers have a close association with the hurling and banner county of Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not have a major problem with the motion, it should congratulate the previous Government for a legacy which has enabled the Minister to implement an arts plan.  As a serving member of the arts committee on Galway County <Col N="414" /> Council I note that in its general election manifesto Fianna Fáil supported a centre for the performing arts in Dublin, yet, ironically, it wants the Arts Council to place new emphasis on the regions.  I note also that the plan makes no proposals for the development of the National Library or National Museum, which are the showcases of all that is and has been good in Ireland's artistic and literary heritage.  It is also recognised that huge amounts of money are being ploughed into various productions in the capital city.</P>
    <P>Are arts organisations developing a strategy for the arts in rural areas?  The musical and amateur drama societies are almost totally dependent on sponsorship and contributions from local communities. There are huge costs &mdash; anything up to £25,000 &mdash; in staging local musicals.  Enormous efforts are required of local communities to raise this kind of money, yet the Arts Council offers no support.</P>
    <P>As a former secretary of the Western Drama Festival, which was based in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, I am aware that amateur drama societies provide wonderful entertainment, especially during the festival circuits, which commence operations at this time of year.  I am a strong supporter of the Clare-Galway Festival, which is adjacent to my area and value the wonderful work undertaken by people involved in this society, such as Séamus McNulty, Hugh Farrell, Mary Fleming, Tom Lenihan and Garód Hartigan.  They are the unsung heroes of the amateur dramatics scene.</P>
    <P>Work is also being done with little funding in towns such as Tuam, the hometown of the great playwright, Tom Murphy, by people such Kevin Dwyer, who is in the mould of Tom Murphy.  I appeal to the Minister to consider amateur dramatics because it is providing wonderful entertainment for people throughout the country. Amateur dramatics is struggling and the audiences are dwindling.  Digital television will be introduced soon when 500 screens are brought on stream.  The people involved in amateur dramatics are facing a huge problem.  They will be wiped out unless they receive funding and assistance from the Government and the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to consider amateur dramatic groups, such as the Claregalway group and others on the circuit.  The Minister is aware of the groups from County Clare where drama is so strong.  She should assist these groups because otherwise they will be wiped out.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to assist the people involved in the promotion of brass bands and St. Patrick's Day parades in towns.  I also ask the Minister to consider Duffy's and Fossett's circuses. They are doing wonderful work in providing entertainment.  They are opening windows of wonder for so many people with little or no funding. I appeal to the Minister to consider the areas I mentioned.  Despite the points made by Members on the Government side this evening and the patronising and back slapping in which they may indulge, there is still a long way to go. Much needs to be done.  Wonderful work is being <Col N="415" /> carried out and the Minister, Deputy de Valera, will respond to the calls because she has rural Ireland at heart.  I hope I will have an opportunity in the near future to praise her as much as I praised the former Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, with regard to the arts.</P>

      <P>I wondered if I had come to bury Caesar and not to praise him.  However, I welcome the Minister and endorse the welcome for the increased allocation for the implementation of the arts plan.  When it was first published it was the first coherent overview of the arts ever undertaken.  It contained much interesting and challenging information.  One of the points which emerged was that while the arts were thriving in many centres, the exercise was very uneven not only geographically but also on a discipline basis. In the interim a good deal has happened to remedy that imbalance in terms of better provisions for the arts and ensuring stronger arts activity in areas which were previously weak and in sectors where activities had been grossly underfunded.</P>
      <P>With regard to dance, the plan confirmed what most people already knew.  Dance was the cinderella of the arts and I am glad that position is being remedied.  I particularly welcome the allocation of £1 million for the establishment of a national dance rehearsal centre in Dublin, which is, after all, the capital city.  This is a major first step towards developing dance.  I also welcome the work being done by Firkin Crane in Cork.  It is developing on a regional and national basis as a centre of excellence for dance.  I am glad that its allocation has been increased this year by 100 per cent.  It is a major resource in the development of dance not only for practitioners, but also audiences in Cork city.  It is money well spent.</P>
      <P>The plan contained many bleak diagrams and maps of areas in the midlands which had very poor arts provisions.  This is also being tackled and remedied.  For example, £750 was invested in the provision of arts in County Offaly in 1996.  I was delighted to note that figure increased in 1997 to £75,000 and that a literary event was held there.  This type of development is taking place. It is addressing from the ground up some of the concerns expressed by previous speakers.  They said the Arts Council was Dublin driven and orientated and the regions were neglected.  They also said the arts were elitist.  That was the case at one time and although that imbalance has not been completely redressed, I am convinced we are going in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are now 28 arts officers attached to local authorities.  This is a major advance because I recall when there were only seven.  Arts officers spot talent and prime local initiatives in the areas of dance, drama or the visual arts.  They activate and invigorate the process.  They also link up with local authorities which in turn link up with the Arts Council and the Department.  This is a recipe for progress.  This partnership ensures local initiatives are funded, fed and encouraged.  Such <Col N="416" /> partnerships are developing at a rapid rate and it gives me good grounds for optimism.  This major change has been brought about recently.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the regionalisation of arts provision.  This is a splendid idea and I compliment the former Minister.  Senators are nothing if not fair, irrespective of whether they are on the Government or Opposition benches. It was a splendid idea to locate the chamber orchestra in Limerick.  It has revitalised the area and is holding concerts all over the west and midwest. It is commissioning compositions and is a major force in the promotion of music in that part of the country.  It was a very good and sensible move.  Such moves revitalise and re-energise regions.  They also ensure an equal spread in terms of the provision of the arts.</P>
    <P>The concept of the centres of excellence is very good and I welcome that Cork city was designated as a centre of excellence for the visual arts. Cork people think, as the city which produced Seán Ó Riada, Professor Fleischmann and others, that it is also the centre of excellence for music. Indeed, some people think the city is the centre of excellence for everything.  However, the visual arts are thriving in Cork and I was particularly pleased that the Minister approved the Wandsworth Quay project this week.  This refurbished building will house the visual arts, including national printmakers who are located in Cork and a group of art activities.  They were labouring under appalling conditions in cold, damp and badly lit warehouses.  They will now be housed in a suitable building which will unleash all the potential which exists.  It will enable the artists to produce much more material.  It was very good news for Cork this week.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a number of points about art in education.  I am glad the Minister has provided funding for a writer in residence and a composer in residence for Cork city and county.  We need to make that provision in primary education.  I am glad the budget to Graffiti, the educational theatre group, has been increased.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the reliance on FÁS for provision of workers to art centres.  It means there is no lasting base and I fear that will go wrong.  If it does, the impact on the arts would be enormous.</P>
    <P>I support the motion, but we would all appreciate it if the Minister could bring forward an interim report on the progress made on the implementation of this plan.  This would provide us with a better understanding of the progress made, of strengths and weaknesses.  It would enable us to direct funds to the places where there are weaknesses so we could have a coherent debate in this Chamber on arts provision.</P>
    <P>An investment in the arts is one of the best uses to which money can be put.  Not alone is it an investment in our creativity, cultural life and social life, it is a major investment in the economy of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for continuing the work of the previous Minister.  This country has a huge amount to gain from the promotion of the arts.  We are still in our infancy in this area.  The huge potential which exists has only been realised in the last few years.  Senator Ó Murchú touched on his involvement in Comhaltas Ceoilteoirí Éireann and I commend him for the great work he has done promoting Irish culture not just in this country but worldwide.  I compliment him and the organisation on that work.</P>
      <P>When I saw this motion on the Order Paper I could not resist being parochial.  I use this opportunity to put to the Minister a project about which Oireachtas Members from south Tipperary have spoken to her: the Excel project.  This has been thrown around politically but the promoters have grown weary of lobbying people about it.  The previous Minister in the Department committed £650,000.  The promoters are seeking more money, claiming they cannot proceed without more funding.  I have no reason not to believe them.  The proposal is sound: they intend to build a badly needed theatre, an art gallery and workshop, an interpretative centre, two cinemas and shops.  The number of jobs it will create is potentially huge and of great benefit to Tipperary, which has suffered more from unemployment than any other area.  The town needs this project to go ahead to attract the tourists passing through on the way to Cashel, Cahir and Killarney.  The potential for jobs in a centre like this would give a great boost to the town and the surrounding area.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to a head as it has been going on for too long without a brick being laid.  Will the Minister see if the money can be allocated?  Tipperary has a successful track record in this field.  The proposed investment of £750,000 towards a new museum in Clonmel is welcome, but the people of Tipperary town feel left out.  I appeal to the Minister to give it her best shot.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to welcome the Minister to the House.</P>
      <P>I am very proud of the arts in this country.  The development of the visual arts, music and culture have given a great example of what Ireland has to offer other nationalities.  They play a fundamental role in the development of our tourism industry. They give an indication abroad of a great richness of culture.  It is ever evolving.</P>
      <P>The number of creative artists in all areas is most noticeable throughout the country, be it in visual arts, music, drama or literature.  We have developed as a country with a richness which is internationally recognised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to the development of the arts and I take this opportunity to compliment the previous Minister for his great foresight in providing money for that area. The present Minister's continuation of that investment and her commitment to a national <Col N="418" /> plan for artistic development is to be welcomed. It develops in a positive manner a tremendous resource which exists.</P>
    <P>I appointed the first artist in residence and writer in residence in my county.  I remember the small amount of money provided by the county council.  With all the pressures on county councils at the time there was a reluctance to provide money in that area, yet it was one of the greatest investments they could make.  It has played a very important part in the artistic development of the county.  Any counties without a writer or artist in residence, or an arts officer, should act immediately in the interests of their own people and the development of the county.</P>
    <P>The local authorities should work cohesively with the Arts Council.  There should be a link between the county councils and the Arts Council in planning the use of this investment by the State in the development of the arts.</P>
    <P>There are many great exhibitions and displays taking place throughout the country.  I do not know if a figure has been put on the number of people involved in the arts development sector but in towns such as Westport it plays a very important part and provides a lot of part-time and some full-time employment.  That culture exists right along the western seaboard, particularly in towns that have developed culture and drama centres.</P>
    <P>The music network system supported by Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has been a great development. It provides an opportunity for ourselves and people from abroad to see the natural ability of our musicians as they provide cultural entertainment that has been part of our tradition for so long.  There has also been the development of sculpture trails.  We have developed a richness that was not there before and not exploited in the way that it should be.  Set dancing, which used to be confined to County Clare and its environs, is now a national pastime that has developed across all boundaries in every county.  There is also an opportunity for disabled persons to participate in the development of the arts in the future.  Positive moves are being made in some counties in this area.  National Government policy should include people from all walks of life.  Marginalised people should play an important part in the development of our arts.  We should also look at traditional trades like that of tinsmith.  On heritage days held in towns throughout country the most popular displays are those of old traditions.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I extend good wishes to a great artist, Christy Moore, who is not feeling well.  He has provided entertainment for people at home and abroad through his music and songs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the Minister because this is a very important debate.  In the past it was thought that only a small group of people were involved in the arts and culture sector <Col N="419" /> of Irish society.  We were lucky that the Anglo-Irish kept their tradition of visual arts alive and produced a huge number of historical pictures of Ireland in the old days.  We have come full circle.  Last night I watched an RTE programme called &ldquo;Ear to the Ground&rdquo; where a Mayo farmer with ten acres has left farming and with EU funding created a farm museum.  As Senator Chambers mentioned the tinsmith, there was one working in this museum.  These people were maintaining our old traditions.  But for EU funding these traditions would be lost.</P>
      <P>The Minister visited Kells, County Kilkenny, within the past ten days.  It is probably one of the best walled towns in Ireland, perhaps even Europe.  Many people would only have heard of Kells, County Meath.  The Minister will ensure that this situation changes.  One of our most valuable historical monuments in European or international terms is in Kells, County Kilkenny.  The monastery's walled area, which dates back many centuries, is virtually intact.  I am delighted the Minister has guaranteed money for this project in next year's budget.</P>
      <P>Historically, we must remind ourselves that we are a multi-cultural society.  Many of us come from Gaelic or Anglo-Irish extraction.  Some of us also come from French or German extraction. In Galway you will find the Spanish influence. But in many parts of this country we have historical connections with Europe.  These influences which make us special have come from various places overseas, such as North Africa.</P>
      <P>The Minister must recognise the work done by every local genealogical society.  They go into graveyards, write down the names and keep a record of the history of the parish and county. This information is then sent to your office or another relevant one.  Local history, arts and verbal arts must be remembered.  Visual arts are booming in Ireland from the ground up.  There is a huge number of unemployed people, some might call them unemployable because they are a little outside society, who are now painting.  I would like to see extended to them the help given to top artists by way of tax incentives.  Someone in receipt of social welfare should be allowed earn some money from painting or sculpting without the fear of losing their benefits.  In other words, whatever money they make should not be taxed. They should get the same tax benefits as someone who comes in here and makes a film.  These film makers get BSE schemes and all the tax benefits while someone with a talent for painting and sculpting is on the dole.  If they sell their works why should they be taxed when wealthier people are not?</P>
      <P>Kilkenny is a very valuable artistic and cultural resource.  The organisation with which Senator Ó Murchú is associated has done great work in making us proud of our musical heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare recipients who are working artists should get financial benefits in the same way as do better off artists who are in the tax system <Col N="420" /> do.  This would bring about an artistic renaissance in Ireland.  The primitive artists of Tory would never have been known if their talent had not been recognised and cultivated by Derek Hill and Ireland and the world would have lost an important piece of our visual artistic culture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands (Miss de Valera)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for inviting me and for giving me this opportunity to hear the views of Senators on the arts.  Important points were made with regard to amateur drama and what Senator Ó Murchú referred to as the native arts.  Ireland is tremendously rich in both these fields.  My own county of Clare has shown a great interest in and commitment to amateur drama.  The festivals of Feakle, Scariff and Dunbeg are famous.  The value of amateur drama is recognised in many centres throughout the country. I join Senators in paying tribute to Senator Ó Murchú's work with Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.  We owe a great deal to Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann for keeping our musical heritage alive at a time when there was not as much sympathy for our native arts as there is now.</P>
      <P>I agree that art should not be subservient to commercial concerns.  The independence of the arts is important in any democracy.  The arts can flourish in times of difficulty.  Indeed further artistic richness and diversity can sometimes grow out of difficulty.</P>
      <P>References have been made to specific projects and to some of our national institutions.  I congratulate Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, director of the National Library, on his work and particularly on his efforts to extend the opening hours of the library.  The Government is committed to the performing arts centre.  We envisage the centre being situated in Dublin but I have a great commitment to regionalisation.  National institutions must be aware that regionalisation is extemely important for the democratisation of the arts.  The Excel project is being examined in my Department and a decision will be forthcoming soon.  Senator Lanigan is correct in saying that I very much enjoyed my visit to Kilkenny.  I am, however, not in a position to give a guarantee of funding to the Kells project yet.  I look upon it with a great deal of sympathy but I must work within the confines of my departmental budget.  Arts officers play an important part in the regionalisation of the arts and I will refer to them later.</P>
      <P>I wish to reaffirm the Government's and my commitment to the development of the arts in Ireland.  Over recent years there has been an explosion in the level of interest and participation in the arts.  Far from being considered an elitist pursuit, the 1990s have seen the arts become integrated into the fabric of everyday life.  This nation will be incomplete if economic achievement is to be regarded as the sole bench-mark of its success. The soul of Ireland must be nourished as well as the body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government recognises and acknowledges the value of the arts for the development and well <Col N="421" /> being of society and also recognises the opportunities that the arts create for innovative employment and their contribution to the general economy.  This commitment to the development of the arts is very much to the fore in the programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium.  Like any area, financial resources are an essential key to the development of the arts and one of my key priorities in the programme for Government was the provision this year of £26 million for the Arts Council to implement the policies and proposals set out in the Council's Arts Plan.  The Government has delivered on this commitment.  As Senators will be aware, the Arts Plan, 1995-7, was prepared by An Chomhairle Ealaíon/The Arts Council at the request of my predecessor.  The previous Government accepted that this plan, which had been presented to my predecessor in 1994, should be the basis for a programme of action for the succeeding three years, 1995-97.  With the publication of the arts plan, great hope was instilled in the arts community and the general public that the necessary funding would be made available by the previous Government to enable the targets and objectives in the plan to become a reality within the timescale identified.  As everyone is aware, the required level of funding was not forthcoming and the Arts Council felt obliged to recast its plan, prepared at the request of the then Government, as a five year plan from 1995 to 1999.</P>
    <P>While in opposition, I strenuously objected to extending the life of the plan and committed myself and Fianna Fáil to implementing the funding targets set out in the plan at the first opportunity. I made a commitment to this effect in my party's manifesto and in the Programme for Government.  I was pleased to secure the major increase of 25 per cent in the Arts Council grant in 1998, thereby bringing the council's funding level to £26 million.  In providing this funding I have met in full the commitment to facilitating the Arts Council to implement the arts plan by the end of 1998.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the Arts Council has become a centrally important national development and resource agency for the arts in all its forms.  The Arts Council has set out to promote quality and innovation in all aspects of the practice of the arts and to encourage genuine participation in the arts.</P>
    <P>There are sufficient economic arguments, both nationally and internationally, to justify increased investment in the arts.  In a study commissioned by the council in 1994, the arts, as defined in respect of the remit of the council, generated an output of £225 million and employed 14,500 people.  The council now estimates that, in the fourth year of the plan, its activities and its support of individual artists and arts organisations give rise to over 22,000 full-time jobs and stimulate a significant turnover of almost £500 million. The increase to £26 million to the Arts Council in 1998 will see additional direct investment in <Col N="422" /> the arts through an increase in the amounts and the number of awards to individual artists and arts organisations.  This will stimulate further employment and investment in the cultural field and in the economy generally.</P>
    <P>I will now inform the House how the Arts Council has seen the benefits of the arts plan filter through in the eight distinct areas of artistic practice &mdash; architecture, dance, drama, film, literature, music, opera and the visual arts. Senators will appreciate that in making these comments I fully respect the statutory autonomy of the council in deciding what disciplines to support and how it disburses its annual grant allocation from Government.</P>
    <P>To date under the arts plan the Arts Council has supported a variety of architectural exhibitions and publications and has co-operated with the Royal Institute of Architects in Ireland in promoting a major series of exhibitions and lectures about architecture aimed particularly at schools.  The council advises that this support will continue and that the level of funding secured for 1998 will facilitate the retention of a consultant architect who was appointed in 1997 and who has been commissioned to develop a more proactive policy in architecture.  This individual will also be of immense value to the Arts Council in its work to promote greater architectural standards for arts buildings.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is virtually the sole source of support for dance as an art form in Ireland.  The objectives for dance set out in the arts plan were wide ranging and extensive.  The council admits that some of these objectives &mdash; such as the promotion of an appropriate level of infrastructure for dance and the provision of a dancer in residence programme &mdash; have not yet been realised. However, with the funding I have put in place for 1998, the council is confident that these vital elements of the plan can now be progressed.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware that Irish theatre, both in terms of contemporary writing and performance, has achieved extraordinary critical success here and abroad over the years.  We can be very proud of this success.  In allocating its support for drama the council concentrates on quality, creation of opportunities for the individual artist and the provision of access.  The council in 1998 intends to complete the regrading of the 32 production companies receiving annual support and to put mechanisms in place to develop the audience for Irish theatre both at home and abroad.  It will also work on the provision of a code of practice for theatre by and for children and young people.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the incentive schemes in place for the development of the Irish film industry through Bórd Scannaín na hÉireann and tax based incentives, the council believes it has a pivotal role to play particularly in support of the individual film maker as an artist and the encouragement of innovation and experimentation within the art form.  A major review of Arts Council support to film has been completed which identifies as a priority the support of film <Col N="423" /> exhibition.  The increased level of funding will allow for greater support in 1998 for film festivals and for the creation of a designated film exhibition fund.</P>
    <P>Apart from drama the discipline of literature is perhaps the area that attracts enormous international acclaim.  Through the arts plan, the Arts Council plays a very important role in the continued dynamic development of Irish literature in both the Irish and English languages.  The council reports that many of the targets set out in the plan have been achieved and it proposes to continue to support literature through the provision of bursaries and awards to individual writers and to support a range of literary organisations.  It will also continue its very valuable work in the promotion of literature among children and young people.  The Action Programme for the Millennium particularly recognised the importance of support of the arts through Irish.  The two disciplines where this is obviously critical are the areas of writing for the theatre and literature.  I expect that the review of the arts plan to which I will refer later will address particularly the extent to which these disciplines have developed and prospered.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware of the priority I give to music and the development of the indigenous music industry.  There have been several recent reports on the music industry.  These include the IBEC Report &ldquo;Striking the Right Note&rdquo;, the FORTE Report &ldquo;Access All Areas&rdquo; the Report of the European Music Office, a body supported by DG Xl, entitled &ldquo;Music In Europe&rdquo; and the PIANO Report.  Without doubt music has a great deal to offer not only in terms of its intrinsic cultural and artistic value but also in terms of a modem sophisticated industry with enormous potential for employment and wealth creation. For example, the FORTE Report indicates that music already accounts for 10,000 full-time equivalent jobs in Ireland.  It is also a major contributor to other sectors including Ireland's success as a tourist destination and it has greatly enhanced our image abroad.</P>
    <P>We rightly take pride in the international success of Irish artists and can look forward with confidence to Irish music claiming a greater share of a world recorded market which, in 1995, was estimated to be worth approximately £24.68 billion.</P>
    <P>In its arts plan, the Arts Council highlighted several areas in which music can be supported. For example, it highlighted the need to support specialist forms of music, such as jazz, recordings of contemporary music, the Irish Chamber Orchestra, which has relocated to Limerick, etc. The Arts Council informs me that it has been working on all these objectives and can claim notable success in many of them.  The acceleration of the arts plan means that additional resources will be made available to these priority areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="424" /> Opera is another area which will benefit from increased funding in 1998.  The £26 million funding will allow for continued major support to opera companies and, in particular, allow a nationwide tour of three productions by Irish companies to ensure that opera is available to the maximum number of people.</P>
    <P>To sustain a career in the visual arts an artist needs a suitable working environment, time to create and develop and promote their work in addition to access to training and career development opportunities.  The Arts Council is active in all these areas and it offers financial assistance to individuals, studios and other production facilities.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, the arts plan is underpinned by an area based approach.  The area based approach to planning is one in which the needs of a given area are addressed by developing integrated policies and services across all sectors. It seeks to maximise benefits through a planned co-operative approach combining elements of bottom up and top down activity and open to opportunity in a wider social context.  It is important to highlight that with the exception of three local authorities, all now have arts officers who are co-funded by the council and work in close co-operation with it to promote the arts locally.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council advises that progress in identified priority zones and strategic centres of co-operation has been significant.  It states the concept of designating counties and cities in this way has worked most successfully where the response to the designation from the local arts community and authorities has been positive and active. However, the full impact of designation will not be measurable until the end term review of the arts plan.</P>
    <P>The council planned to create an infrastructure in the priority zones which would allow a gradual and appropriate growth in arts activity.  Investment was targeted specifically towards initiatives which would increase the capacity of local authorities, arts organisations and other agencies to support artists in the making and presentation of art within the county and to improve the experience of audiences in terms of more regular opportunities to see art presented and exhibited, and creating opportunities for audiences to enhance the quality of their experience through awareness building initiatives and opportunities for participation.</P>
    <P>I refer to three locations where the council believes this approach works on the ground and additional investment in 1998 will allow for this. In 1996 the Arts Council entered into a formal partnership with Laois County Council to support a planned approach to arts development.  The direct value of the partnership was £60,000 between two agencies.  One of the most significant projects resulting from this partnership is the Laois tapestry project, a two year arts initiative bringing together a consortium of interests, including FÁS and the county enterprise board. <Col N="425" /> The project involves the development of skills among a range of unemployed people and may serve as a model for the arts within local economic and social development strategies.  In addition, a detailed evaluation has been carried out which will serve as a template for a model of evaluation for local arts development projects.</P>
    <P>My second example is in Donegal where major investment has been made into arts venues' infrastructure. A partnership has been created around support to a number of venues.  The Abbey Centre in Ballyshannon received a consolidation grant of £40,000 in 1996 to secure its operations. Funding for the programming and staffing has been agreed for the Letterkenny Arts Centre and a full time manager has recently been appointed. A network of touring venues receives support under the council's drama guarantees against loss schemes and investment in the provision of artists' studios has been made.  Support for two arts development organisations, Artlink in Buncrana and Beyond Borders in Inishowen, has been increased from £1,450 in 1994 to £31,700 in 1997 allowing these organisations to pursue high quality arts programmes at local and community level. In addition, support has been given during the life of the plan to a range of small arts organisations and projects, including Killybegs writers workshop, Inishowen traditional singing workshops and the innovative Oideas Gael project which has served as a model of good practice for a similar initiative in Laois.</P>
    <P>My third example relates to Cork which was given a visual arts designation in the plan.  The Cork Arts Development Committee provided a structure which has allowed the visual arts community to set an active agenda for development in the context of the strategic centre designation. The development of artists' studios was identified as a priority by the group.  The Arts Council has supported this development to the value of £250,000.  The local authority formed a partnership with the Blackwater/Cork Printmakers Group at the instigation of the Arts Council and applied successfully for funding under the cultural development incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the concept of community arts which began to emerge in Europe and the United States during the 1960s.  It has been recognisable in Ireland since the 1970s.  The unique nature of community arts and its constantly changing and evolving emphasis to meet the changing needs of participants makes definition difficult.  It is essentially about empowering communities and encouraging their self expression and is generally associated with the marginalised sector of the community.  While it is undoubtedly true that many more people are accessing art now than was the case previously, many on low incomes in our society are still excluded.  One just has to read the report &mdash;&ldquo;Poverty: Access and Participation in the Arts&rdquo; prepared by the Combat Poverty Agency and the Arts Council and published in 1997 to get a feel for the extent of the problem that still exists.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="426" /> The community arts in Ireland are still relatively young and having developed from many various social concerns, it still suffers from a lack of clear definition.  The development objectives for community arts in the Arts plan centred around the creation and support of partnerships to address the needs of communities.  Community arts are a priority for the council and it has developed a number of initiatives in support of this priority status.  In 1998 the council will build on these initiatives and will engage with the community arts sector to develop a policy and an agreed programme.  There is a need to develop and refine networks consisting of the many organisations involved in community arts in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I refer to the area of arts and disabilities.  The question of access to and participation in the arts is of interest to the Government.  The issue of making arts accessible to sections of society which have been culturally disenfranchised has also been of central concern to the Arts Council and those involved in the arts world for a number of years.  This concern is dominating cultural policy not just in Ireland but in many European countries. I have long been of the opinion that it is a fundamental right of all citizens to have full access to all art forms.  In recent years sound economic arguments have been put forward for investment in and promotion by central and local government of arts and cultural activities.</P>
    <P>However, it is vital that in tandem with this approach, we also stress the real value of the social significance of arts and cultural activities, and particularly how these activities can benefit the marginalised and less well off in society.  Barriers such as access, transport, costs, training, and attitudes to full participation in the arts for the marginalised and people with disabilities must be tackled and increased activity in the arts sector and simultaneous development in the disability sector imply greater opportunities for people with disabilities to participate at every level.</P>
    <P>The Arts Council is committed to increasing the level of participation in the arts by people with disabilities and will support and develop arts and disability through a process of policy development, partnerships and support.  It has already undertaken a number of initiatives, including a programme of disability equality training for its members and staff, and a physical access audit to ensure its premises are accessible to people with disabilities.  Increased funding to the Arts Council in 1998 will allow it to maintain staff resources working in this area.</P>
    <P>The council advises me that the increased funding in 1998 will also enable it to enact measures to encourage and support arts organisations and people with disabilities to devise ways of promoting inclusion of people with disabilities in arts activities.  This will include the development of a programme of disability equality training specifically for arts organisations and the production of a disability resource pack and guidelines which will be developed in consultation with relevant <Col N="427" /> disability organisations.  I welcome the council's commitment to develop a policy and code of practice for arts and disability which will integrate disability issues in all art form areas and activities.</P>
    <P>As a result of the funding provided by the Government in 1998, the Arts Council expects to have substantially completed its arts plan at the end of the year.  The question as to whether there is to be a follow on plan is a logical one.  I am confident such a plan will be developed by the council for consideration by Government.  In this regard my Department and the executive of the council have agreed that an in depth, independent evaluation of the achievements brought about through the significant increased expenditure on the arts over the years 1995 to 1998 will be carried out.  The results of the evaluation will be used to inform the preparation of the follow on plan.  I will be especially interested in the progress made in regard to support for disabled artists and regional emphasis as well as for the arts in and through the Irish language, key priorities identified in the Action Programme for the Millennium.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am happy to say that the investment of £26 million to the Arts Council in 1998 will close the book, or bring the curtain down, on the current arts plan.  There is much more to be done, however.  I am now looking at how best to provide for and support the future development of the arts in Ireland.  The end term review of the arts plan will provide for a comprehensive review by means of research and consultation with both the arts sector and the general public.  The review will also provide the dynamism and framework for the future strategic planning for the arts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive address.</P>
      <P>Many Members of this House will be aware of the great effort which is being made at local level, both through voluntary cultural organisations and local authority arts officers and arts programmes, to ensure that the type of development envisaged in the arts plan, which has been funded by the allocation which the Minister secured for this year, is delivered locally.  It is all very well for us to sit here in Dublin talking about the arts.  It is another thing entirely to ensure that the development in policy and the increase in funding is delivered to the areas in which we live and about which we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I, like all Members, welcome the increased allocation to the Arts Council this year.  I am glad that the Minister has secured it to speed up the implementation of the arts plan, which was developed by the Arts Council and presented to the Government during the tenure of her predecessor. The arts plan and the associated funding, coupled with the capital investment for the arts which was secured through the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, as part of the National Development Plan, has led to an <Col N="428" /> increase not only in interest and funding for the arts but in proper venues for the arts throughout the country.  I am glad the Minister mentioned a number of individual projects and I will refer to them later.</P>
    <P>However, I ask the Minister to look at the way the Arts Council conducts its relationship with the voluntary bodies and local authorities at local level because improvement in communication and mutual understand there could do much to ensure that the plan as envisaged and the promised money can be effectively delivered to the extent that it makes a difference at local level.  As somebody who is involved in the arts at local level and who has fought successfully as a member of a local authority to ensure the funding of a county arts officer, it is my belief that the Arts Council can certainly improve its communication with local authorities and cultural and arts organisations at local level.  Unfortunately, it is still perceived as an organisation which is based in Dublin and sometimes biased towards Dublin.</P>
    <P>My local authority, Offaly County Council, has been seeking to set up a meeting to have an exchange of views with either members or staff of the Arts Council for the past year and a half. To date, I regret to say, we have not been successful in doing so.</P>
    <P>I compliment, however, the work of the arts officers in local authorities.  They provide a vital link between the Department, the Arts Council, the local authority members and the organisations and individuals interested in the arts in each county.  It is my sincere view that the direct communication between the Arts Council and those bodies is no substitution for the excellent work of the arts officers.  I would appreciate if the Minister would follow up on this with the Arts Council and encourage both members and staff to get out around the country as much as possible, to understand local needs and to appreciate what is being done.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the Minister's reference to community arts.  When funding and policy are moving in the direction of better support for the arts we must perpetually guard against people being excluded from what is going on because life experience, educational experience or level of income has not permitted them in the past to develop the creative and artistic side of their lives.  I welcome the prominence which the Arts Council has given that, but that commitment cannot be delivered unless the members and staff of the Arts Council get a feel for what is going on at local level.</P>
    <P>A second area I wish to raise with the Minister is the need for clarification from the Arts Council on the exact policy it is following in deciding whether or not to provide current funding subventions for many of the arts centres which are being built with Structural Funds at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned County Laois, which is in my constituency, where excellent work is being done under the arts officer there, Muireann Uí Chonaill.  They have secured capital funding for <Col N="429" /> an arts centre and it is proceeding well because the local authority has underwritten it.</P>
    <P>In County Offaly we have secured funding for the development of the Oxmantown Hall in Birr, but we have not been able to draw down that funding yet because we are still trying to meet the requirements of the Department for the local authority to underwrite that indefinitely.  I know the Minister is aware of that and I know she is assisting in the matter.  We had a meeting recently with a representative of the Arts Council and it was made clear to us that some centres are receiving funding towards their current costs.  We would like to know which centres are receiving it, how does one receive it and what is the policy, because while the local authority and the voluntary sector in the area have done wonders in raising capital funds and trying to meet the demands for underwriting current expenditure, we would be assisted greatly if the Arts Council could spell out its policy and give us favourable consideration for current funding for the next five to ten years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to mention two areas. Much could be done to promote community arts if the Arts Council developed a straightforward coherent policy which would link them to the area-based partnerships which ADM is funding under the local development programme.  They are doing excellent work throughout the country. They provide a vehicle, which is community based and comprehensive, through which the Arts Council would work.  I recommend consideration of that vehicle in the development of community arts.</P>
    <P>Regretfully, the news about the Laois tapestry project is not as rosy as that which has been presented to the Minister.  There is a great deal of dissatisfaction among the people who have participated in that project that it has come to an end without the type of follow on opportunities for further training, education or employment which they expected.  I know it is not within the Minister's direct area of responsibility, but I would appreciate if the Department would take it up with the Arts Council and get back to Laois County Council, FÁS and the Laois County Enterprise Board to see if those women, who have learned and developed so much over the past two years, can be provided with further opportunities for education, training and possibly employment in the arts in the year ahead.  These people would certainly like such opportunities.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the brief opportunity to contribute, a Chathaoirligh, but I hope we will be returning to the subject of the arts in this House before too long.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her contribution. I am pleased that she has this portfolio under her stewardship.  It is nice to be here to welcome this year's allocation of £26 million to the arts, which speaks volumes for her standing within the Government.  The Minister has a special interest in those who are disabled and who want to make a contribution to the arts.  About <Col N="430" /> 300,000 disabled people wish to be involved in the arts.  The National Arts and Disability Centre sent me a report to pass on to the Minister seeking more help for that organisation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, dance has had incredible success in recent times.  Ten years ago we could not have imagined what the success of dance has done for tourism, culture, young people and how it has provided a show case for Ireland abroad.  The show &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; is set to break the performance record in Wembley Stadium in London by playing for 21 consecutive nights, breaking the previous record of 18 consecutive nights held by Cliff Richard.  That means that about 0.5 million will have seen &ldquo;Lord of the Dance&rdquo; at Wembley.  &ldquo;Riverdance&rdquo; has three troupes performing around the world, displaying Irish dancing and filling theatres in competition will world class entertainers.</P>
      <P>Irish dance and music have unique qualities. They are a trademark for success for future generations. I commend the Minister for her continued support for dance and music.  However, jazz and contemporary chamber music would not have popularity ratings of more than 2 per cent and I question the expenditure of funds on them. There are many brilliant young musicians from rural areas who need assistance but get nothing but the dole.  The Government should take a particular interest in this issue.  These creative young musicians have not asked the Government for a penny, yet the creativity of Irish musicians is recognised the world over.  In the Minister's constituency there is an abundance of musical talent, talent of the kind that the Government should support.  They may not have been the vehicles for Government funds to date but the range of expertise and advice available from those associated with the industry is available to assist the Minister.</P>
      <P>I have spent 20 years seeking funds to create new museum attractions and I have been turned down on numerous occasions.  I have one of the top ten tourism attractions in the country and I was only offered a £40,000 feasibility study in 1977.  I have applied to the Arts Council and other bodies on many occasions.  We employ the only full-time sculptor in the country and we receive no assistance from the Arts Council.  The top tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's which had a throughput of over 11 million people last year.  Yet when a family concern tries to develop something similar here nobody wants to know about it.  I agreed with Senator Gallagher when he spoke about the difficulty of even meeting people from the Arts Council.  It is a shame that a national tourist attraction is not supported. It provides a history of Ireland from Wolfe Tone to the present day Taoisigh and Uachtaráin.  I raise this matter in the House reluctantly.</P>
      <P>I support the Minister in her endeavours.  I am pleased to see a person with her positive attitude in the post.</P>

      <P>Níl fhios agam faoi mholtaí mar seo in aon chor.  Tá moladh tuillte ag an Rialtas os rud é go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó airgid á chaitheamh acu ar chúrsaí ealaíon ná mar a bhíomar ag súil leis agus tá moladh ag teastáil. Bheadh sé níos fearr dá mbeadh dearcadh éigin ag an moladh taobh amuigh de mholadh a thabhairt don Rialtas.  Tá a fhios agam go gcaithfidh na daoine sa Teach seo a thugann tacaíocht don Rialtas moladh a thabhairt dóibh.  Ach b'fhéidir go bhféadfaidís samhlaíocht a úsáid beagáinín níos mó as seo amach chun a mhíniú dúinn cad a theastaíonn uathu go ndéanfadh an Rialtas as seo amach.</P>
      <P>Cé go bhfuil moladh tuillte ag an Aire agus ag an Rialtas ós rud é go bhfuil an oiread sin airgid á chaitheamh anois ná héistímis riamh leis an &ldquo;populist nonsense&rdquo; mar a deirtear sa Bhéarla faoi airgead ar chúrsaí ealaíon a bheith caite ar leataobh nó caite ar spéis atá ag mionlach.  Is mór an trua gur ag mionlach as tír is mó atá suim i gcúrsaí ealaíon ach bheadh an tír go léir níos saibhre in a lán slite dá mba rud é go raibh an gnáth-dhuine ábalta páirt níos mó a ghlacadh i gcúrsaí ealaíon, dá mbéadh an gnáth-dhuine ábalta níos mó tuisceana agus níos mó féin-mhuiníne a bheith aige nó aici as a bheith ag féachaint ar phictiúir, ar scannáin, ar dhrámaí agus a bheith ag éisteacht le ceol agus gan a bheith ag brath i gcomhnaí ar na saineolaithe a bhíonn ag iarraidh a mhíniú dóibh can ba chóir dóibh taitneamh a bhaint as agus cad nach chóir dóibh taitneamh a bhaint as.</P>
      <P>An chomhairle a thabharfainn do ghnáth-dhaoine ná gan na criticí a léamh riamh agus dul amach agus taitneamh a bhaint as pé rud a thaithníonn leo.  Ag an am céanna ní aontaím leis an Seanadóir Ó Casaide nuair a deireann sé nach fiú airgead a chaitheamh ar rudaí nach bhfuil ach suim ag fíor-bheagán daoine sa tír iontu.  Is iad siúd na rudaí is mó ar chóir tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.  Is cuma muna bhfuil ann ach dó faoin gcéad nó aon faoi gcéad.  Má tá daoine ann is cóir dúinn cabhrú leo mar is saibhreas é.  Is sórt pluralism é a bheith ábalta cabhrú le gach éinne agus tá spéis faoi leith agamsa i ngné den ealaín atá an-imeallach.  Agus tá suil agam go bhfuil suim ag an Seanadóir Labhrás Ó Mhurchú ann.  Sin amhránaíocht ar an sean-nós, an modh ealaíon, b'fhéidir, is seanaoise atá againn.  Téann sé chomh fada siar nach bhfuil fhios againn cad as a tháinig sé.  Is féidir a rá gur as Tuaisceart na hAfraice a tháinig an stíl i dtús báire, na céadta bliana ó shin agus nach bhfuil a leithéad le cloisteáil áit ar bith eile san Eoraip nó ar domhan.  Níl mórán tacaíochta á tabhairt don sean-nós.  Tá sé deacair ceirníní a fháil ach tá an scéal níos fearr anois ná mar a bhí sé agus tá moladh ag dul don Chomhairle Ealaíon agus do RTÉ as an méid tacaíochta atá tugtha acu.  Is é an ceol traidisiúnta agus an amhránaíocht ar an sean-nós an gné ealaíon is mó a bhfuil a fréamhacha sa tír seo amháin.  Seo rud nach dtuigeann gnáth-dhaoine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>B'fhéidir nach bhfuil ach leath d'aon faoin gcéad den phobal ábalta amhránaíocht ar an <Col N="432" /> sean-nós a thuiscint.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil beagáinín níos mó ná sin ábalta taitneamh a bhaint as.  Ach ní hionann sin is a rá nach bhfuil sé thar a bheith tábhachtach nó nach cóir cabhrú le daoine.  Ní bheidh an sean stíl a bhíodh ann le fáil nó ní féidir an caighdeán a bhíodh ann a choimeád mar níl na structúir thraidisiúnta anois ann a bhíodh ann.</P>
    <P>Caithfear cabhrú leis na daoine óga ins na Gaeltachtaí agus taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí. Deir na daoine nach bhfuil an caighdeán i gCorn Uí Riada mar shampla chomh hard is a bhíodh sé.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in am dúinn an duais atá ar fáil do Chorn Uí Riada in Oireachtas na Gaeilge a mhéadú mar ní dóigh liom go bhfuil mórán meas ag a lán daoine anois ar dhuaiseanna agus b'fhéidir go gcosnódh sé níos mó ar dhaoine deireadh seachtaine a chaitheamh i nDún na nGall má tá orthu taisteal ó Chiarraí ná mar is fiú an duais anois.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important not to let this pragmatic, competitive world descend too heavily on us and never to underestimate the role of the arts. They are worthwhile in themselves and are also worthwhile to help people understand what people do when they play, sing, act, dance, paint or even talk -the Irish are probably the people best able to claim to have turned talk into an art form.</P>
    <P>We should never underestimate the significance of the arts, which is why this money is never badly spent.  One can never spend too much on the arts in terms of what they do for &mdash; dare I say this, in our increasingly secularised society &mdash; our spiritual values, in the broadest sense of those words.  I use a small &ldquo;s&rdquo; for spiritual and a small &ldquo;v&rdquo; for values, lest I be accused of something or other.  The arts are essentially spiritual but they have a huge commercial spin-off and create much worthwhile employment.  The arts centre I know best is the Triskel in Cork, where a number of people work for relatively small amounts of money, with enormous imagination and enthusiasm, and are forever looking for new ideas.</P>
    <P>Aontaím leis an rún.  Tá an-moladh tuillte ag an Aire agus an Rialtas ach tá súil agam go leathnófar amach an dearcadh atá ag An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  Tá an cuma air go bhfuil &ldquo;elitism&rdquo; ag dul beagáin leis na healaíona agus ní cóir gur mar sin atá sé.  Mar a dúras níos luaithe, ba mhaith liom go gcabhródh siad leis an amhránaíocht, an tsean-nós atá i mbaol agus a bheidh i mbaol i gcónaí mar gheall ar na hathruithe atá go teacht sa saol.</P>

    <P>I congratulate the Minister on what she set out to do as Opposition spokesperson when she put forward an arts plan.  Those of us who attended her meetings may claim to have made a small <Col N="433" /> contribution to it.  The programme will be completed in 1998 and that is a great achievement. She has the full support of the Taoiseach and the Government for this work.</P>
    <P>Tributes have been paid to many people tonight.  The literary world lost a great master last week in Dr. Bryan MacMahon of Listowel and we appreciate everything he did throughout his life.  He was not just a writer, he was a storyteller, a musician, a dancer &mdash; he could be put in charge of anything.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the great work done by Senator Ó Murchú's organisation.  There are times when he might think that when we receive his monthly magazine, <i>An Treoir,</i> we throw it in the wastebasket but we do not.  It is treasured by all who receive it.  We read its stories, anecdotes, old songs and music because they are &ldquo;part of what we are&rdquo;, in the words of the lovely old gentleman who presented the &ldquo;Waltons&rdquo; radio programme.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of culture and heritage on our island which we could talk about forever.  I was thrilled to accompany the Minister the other day to Muckross House in Killarney.  The money going towards that and other projects is well spent.  However, in places where the tourist population is not as large as in Killarney, some projects run into trouble because the tourism season is much shorter.  Some museums and heritage centres have a season of only two months and the income from that is not enough to keep them going.  These projects should be propped up, if required, until they are on their feet.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister.  Her grandfather, the late Éamon de Valera, started this off and it is nice to see her fulfil that work and do something which he was unable to do in his time.  I hope she will be successful and will continue as she has started.  Tosnú maith é leath na hoibre.</P>

    <P>As regards film development, before Christmas we had an exchange of views on mobile cinema. Would she or her Department be prepared to fund access cinema in rural areas?  I have in mind such a project in County Leitrim which would be a follow up to the successful mobile cinema which operated in the Border counties and was co-funded by the Department.  Cinema is developing and attendances are up but unfortunately many cinemas in small towns and villages have been converted into bingo halls, community centres, <Col N="434" /> etc.  Has the Minister views on this and will there be policy moves in the area?</P>
    <P>The FORTE report was particularly critical of RTE's music policy, specifically in relation to its alleged lack of support for the indigenous music industry.  RTE, which is within the Minister's remit, has decided to create a third channel, which has been loosely called an &ldquo;arts channel&rdquo;. There is a view that this arts channel will cater specifically to classical music.  National airwaves are a scarce resource.  As the Minister has clearly identified, there are eight forms of artistic endeavour, not all of which lend themselves to sound broadcasting.  I ask the Minister to be vigilant in relation to the proposals which will emanate from RTE for this arts channel.</P>
    <P>Traditional Irish music has as strong a justification for being included in an arts channel as classical music.  When a number of people who like classical music &mdash; and I must confess I like the general classics &mdash; write to <i>The Irish Times</i> letters page it immediately triggers a reaction from RTE.  There is a silent majority who would like to hear much more on a national radio channel than classical music.</P>
    <P>VECs need resources to fund particular arts activities in their administrative area.  They traditionally funded them from grants from the Department of Education and Science.  However, over the past 12 or 18 months the Department of Education and Science said this is a function for the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  These projects, which require small contributions in the region of £100 or £300, have now stopped, yet they are an important part of local artistic endeavour.  I ask the Minister to enable vocational education committees to fund local arts projects which the Arts Council does not fund.</P>

      <P>It was evident today that there is unanimity across the House on the attention which Irish art forms deserve at local level.  I was interested to hear the Minister reiterate her support for regionalisation.  I do not see any reason regional arts councils should not be considered.</P>
      <P>We should always bear in mind that art can play a very important role on this island.  Most Members will have experienced cross-Border co-operation in the fields of music, drama and other aspects of art where people never question one's political allegiance or how one adores God.  Art and music give cohesion to the different traditions on this island.</P>
      <P>I praise what the Minister has done in terms of funding and her vision for the arts.  It is appropriate because she is the granddaughter of Eamon de Valera, one of the greatest cultural visionaries of all time.  His vision for Ireland of comely maidens dancing at the crossroads often drew a smile from many but today there are comely maidens and fine figures of manhood dancing at the crossroads of the world.  Irish dancing is now attracting the attention of the arts world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise the concerns of the Dublin Horse Owners' Association and, as they see it, the lack of implementation of the Government's recommendations on local horse projects.  There have been protests outside Leinster House for two consecutive weeks by the Dublin Horse Owners' Association about what they regard as the over-stringent implementation of the Control of Horses Act, 1996, and, more particularly, the lack of progress in terms of support for local horse projects by the Dublin local authorities.</P>
      <P>The association's press statement of 5 February 1998 states:</P>
      <P>The Dublin Horse Owners' Association are marching on the Dáil today to highlight their dissatisfaction with the local authorities failure to implement the Government recommendations which allows for individual horse projects to be set in place.  We are aware that resources have been set aside in the Department of Agriculture Estimates for 1998-9 for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, answered a parliamentary question in this regard on 18 December 1997, which was tabled by Proinsias De Rossa, and pointed out that £2.75 million &mdash; if my memory serves me right &mdash; was provided in the Department's 1998 Estimates for this purpose.  The statement continues:</P>
      <P>But mindless bureaucrats in the local authorities are frustrating both the will of the Government and the horse owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As recent as the last week of January 1998, the Taoiseach said on national television that the Fianna Fáil Party put people before politics. He was taken up on that statement by Dublin horse owners where he was invited to meet with them to discuss the urban horse issue <Col N="436" /> in a more positive way than it has been dealt with to date.  Dublin horse owners are saddened to realise from the Taoiseach that his schedule is too heavy to make time for the Dublin people he claims to represent.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Horse Owners' Association are calling on the Taoiseach to come on board with the Dublin people and work with them in a more positive way.  We are calling on the Taoiseach to press the local authorities to implement the Government's recommendations regarding local/urban horse projects. They include: support the setting up of local horse projects; resources; allow for enjoyment of horse ownership; not to impede the right to own a horse and recognition of Dublin horse owners' personality and culture.</P>
    <P>The statement is signed by Angela Boylan, Vicky McElligott and Bob Draper, who include their telephone numbers.</P>
    <P>Wandering horses have been an intractable problem in the greater Dublin area for some years.  Before anyone can claim the right to own a horse they must also talk about their duty to the welfare of the horse and to the safety of pedestrians and motorists in the immediate area. That proviso underlies all the remarks I will make.  We must get the balance right.</P>
    <P>The question is whether the Control of Horses Act has the balance right.  I pose that as a rhetorical question.  It was enacted in December 1996 by my colleague, the former Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan.  The legislation was introduced to control wandering horses in urban areas.  The Act provided for the designation by the local authority, through by-laws, of control areas in which horses cannot be kept without a licence. Time does not permit me to go into the details but the Minister and I know what the Bill contains in relation to the designation of areas, licensing, microchipping and impounding of horses.</P>
    <P>One must satisfy certain requirements in order to have one's horse released from a pound, and stringent penalties are involved.  We must secure responsible, welfare-friendly maintenance and ownership of horses, and we must respect the urban horse culture.  However, we must respect the rights of those who are not interested in horses not to have their welfare and safety threatened by uncontrolled horses.  It is a difficult balancing act, and I am not sure that the balance is right.  The Minister should ensure that in the implementation of the Control of Horses Act, only uncontrolled horses that are wandering the roads are impounded.  He should allow time for those who love their horses to comply with the Act and the by-laws of local authority areas. There are 3,000 horses &ldquo;wandering&rdquo; Dublin, and 2,000 are in the South Dublin County Council area.</P>
    <P>There is huge interest in setting up various horse projects, but these will take time and organisation. The Minister must ensure that time is given to responsible persons who wish to organise <Col N="437" /> clubs and projects.  Resources must be made available to local authorities to provide land and facilities for those who wish to look after their horses and to organise their interests responsibly.</P>
    <P>Those organisations include the Ballymun Animal Care Association, the Fettercairn Project, the Quarryvale Horse and Pony Club and the proposed Cherry Orchard Equine Centre.  The last named is becoming contentious, and I hope the horse owners and the development committee resolve their differences.  The Cherry Orchard Equine Centre must provide for the interests and needs of local horseowners as well as setting up a training scheme to interest people in the Racing Apprentice Centre.</P>
    <P>I compliment the DSPCA for their wonderful welfare work against the odds and with a limited budget, and I thank the Minister for providing £100,000 in extra funding for it this year.  In 1996 the DSPCA looked after 268 injured, diseased and starving animals in Dublin; an additional 120 animals that could not respond to treatment had to be put down humanely.  The Blue Cross Animal Welfare Society does excellent work with its horse ambulances and mobile clinics, as does the International League for the Protection of Horses.  These organisations are often fighting against the odds to try to resolve difficulties.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of urban horse owners look after their horses reasonably well.  They may not be fenced into a totally controlled area, but the horses are in quite good condition.  They are grazed on vast open spaces so their nutrition is relatively good.  I am concerned by provisions in the Act which require horse owners to have stable facilities of 12 feet by 12 feet.  That could increase horses' suffering.  Coloured horses, by their nature, are hardy.  Horses are a herd animal and like to graze in herds and on the move.  If they are confined to small makeshift stables in back gardens, many will probably not be fed properly and they will be unable to fend for themselves.  They will not be able to exercise and they need a minimum of one hour's exercise per day.  This increases the likelihood of cruelty and welfare problems.</P>
    <P>Where and when will these housed horses be exercised?  On highways and in housing estates? That is not the answer, and it is a problem in the Act that the Minister should look at.  Horses must be controlled in properly fenced areas; I do not argue with that.  There are plenty of temporary areas that could be made available to the horse projects.  However, the crossbred coloured horse should not be housed, unless high quality housing and husbandry are available.  A bad situation will be made worse if we insist on housing.  In the open the horses can be viewed, and obvious cases of cruelty can be spotted, reported and acted upon.  If they are stuck in makeshift stables, in sheds, the likelihood of cruelty is increased.</P>
    <P>Many people are also interested in having proper courses to train group leaders in horsemanship. Those people could go back to their projects and expand others' knowledge.  FÁS could be <Col N="438" /> involved in many training schemes.  Huge job opportunities exist in various areas of horsemanship, and employment agencies cannot fill vacancies with sufficient numbers of trained people. People are being brought from Germany, New Zealand and Sweden to fill vacancies in many Irish yards.</P>
    <P>There is a huge traditional love of the horse among the sons and daughters of the carters of Guinness, B &amp; I and other companies.  Very few of these horses are owned by travellers; this is an urban horse problem, not a traveller horse problem. With goodwill, we can work with these people to resolve this problem.  We need the implementation of the Act and controls, but we must ensure that local authority officials are not threatened as they implement the Act.  We must look at the stabling issue and work with these young people, who are often marginalised.  If their horses are removed abruptly, we will get their backs up and they will work against us.  It would cost far more to resolve the problems that would ensue from that situation.  There is goodwill on this issue that we can work with, and we must ensure the local authorities can do likewise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I noted the welcome of the Cathaoirleach, but I do not intend to stay here longer than it takes to deal with any matter before me.  I will not be getting in the way of any Senator on any panel for some time.</P>
      <P>I thank Senator Doyle for raising this matter. She speaks from a position of knowledge of the horse industry.  I congratulate her on her recent elevation and her contribution to the horse industry. Much of the promotion of the Irish equine industry is being done by voluntary organisations. The Irish horse is a great marketing tool; it is known world wide and rated highly.</P>
      <P>I have taken an interest in urban horses since my appointment.  I was aware that Deputy Deenihan, when Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry had introduced the Control of Horses Act, 1996.  Its primary role is to control wandering horses and to ensure that they do not endanger the public.  Wandering horses have been responsible for some horrific accidents.  The recent accident at Chapelizod that involved a coachload of children was allegedly caused by horses being ridden across a major road.  There was a recent and more tragic accident in Galway, in which a young life was lost because of a horse wandering on the road.  These graphically illustrate the consequences of not tackling this problem speedily and effectively.  No matter what other pressures may be exerted, we must not lose sight of this reality.  I find it exacerbating from time to time when horses wander along the final furlong at Leopardstown and other such places and are unable to get over the line.  Wandering horses are a problem in many areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Act contains a comprehensive range of measures aimed at controlling horses.  These measures will for the most part be operated by <Col N="439" /> local authorities.  They have been given extensive powers under the legislation.  The Department of Agriculture and Food paid out £1 million to local authorities in 1997 to assist them in implementing the Act.  I have made provision for a further £2.75 million for this purpose in the Department's Estimates for 1998.  I am aware that the Act is being actively implemented by three of the four Dublin local authorities.  The fourth has drafted the necessary by-laws for which the necessary approval of local elected representatives will shortly be sought, after which I expect that it too will begin to fully implement the Act.  I am aware that a number of other local authorities which have horse problems have also begun to implement the Act.</P>
    <P>As Senator Avril Doyle said, this is a major problem which is not easy to address.  There are 3,000 wandering horses in Dublin city, most of which are in the south side of the city.  There is considerable relief in areas of Dublin and elsewhere that the problem is being tackled.  Such sentiment, for a variety of reasons, is rarely openly and publicly expressed and consequently is not reflected in the media.  It is nonetheless widespread, as I am sure public representatives from areas which have been particularly badly affected by the problem of loose horses know.  I am also aware that threats have been made by a small number of individuals against local authority officials and those acting on their behalf in implementing the Act.</P>
    <P>I took an interest in this problem as soon as I became Minister.  I met people involved in the Cherry Orchard project.  One of those who put a lot of time into this project was Mr. Eddie Harty who, Members will recall, won the Grand National on Highland Wedding and who was also an accomplished showjumper.  He has tremendous experience of horsemanship.  I put those involved in this project in contact with FÁS, the racing school in Kildare and riding, racing and stud establishments.  We know that if young people who love horses and are able to ride them without winkers, reins or saddles get proper training at an early age, they could develop good opportunities for themselves.  I hope they avail of these contacts as there are opportunities at all levels of the equine industry.</P>
    <P>A substantial amount of land has been acquired at Cherry Orchard and facilities, including stabling facilities, will be provided to exercise the horses.  Substantial resources will be put into that over the next year or two.  Many commercial companies have also contributed to this project.</P>
    <P>Many other projects have also been set up.  If a local authority becomes involved with a local community or organisation and requests grant aid from the Department of Agriculture and Food, it will get it.  There are two aspects to this Act &mdash; to control wandering horses and to assist and encourage people to take care of horses and to get proper training and support.  It will be difficult to do the two things but it can be done.  Local <Col N="440" /> communities seem to have real problems dealing with local authorities.  Perhaps it is personality differences but that should not be the case.  In most situations local authorities are very helpful to local communities and work along with them rather than pulling in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>While the Act has as its primary objective the control of wandering horses, there is nothing in the legislation which need necessarily impede anyone who wishes to put in place arrangements &mdash; based on responsible maintenance and control of horses and accord with by-laws introduced by the appropriate local authorities &mdash; for the enjoyment of horses by young people in urban areas . I am conscious of the fact that a number of urban horse projects are being developed with the objective of equipping young people with an indepth knowledge of horses and their management and of allowing them continue to enjoy horses in a safe, controlled acceptable environment which takes account of the interests and concerns of the Act and those living in the areas in question.  Such projects are a positive development and I welcome them.  I have met with local communities &mdash; and will do so again &mdash; if they wish to discuss this matter with me.  They can contact Jim Beecher and others in the Department of Agriculture and Food who are deeply committed to the horse industry and helping local communities in this area.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister look at stabling requirements in the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  That is one of the key areas of the Act.  As already mentioned, I have provided £2.75 million in the Department's Estimates for 1988 to assist local authorities in the implementation of the Control of Horses Act, 1996.  Of that amount I have earmarked £0.75 million for relevant local authorities to assist urban horse projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To clear up what appears to be a misconception, I should make it clear that no guidelines or instructions have been issued to local authorities in relation to the treatment of urban horse projects. The Department of Agriculture and Food has, however, explained to them that in any instance in which a local authority is supporting and involved in a particular urban horse project within the context of implementing the Control of Horses Act, grant assistance will be available from the Department, through the local authority, to help support the project in question.  In all cases grants will be paid to the local authority rather than to the project.  Grant assistance will not be available to a project which does not have the support and involvement of the local authority within the functional area in which it is located.  In other words, support for urban horse projects is in the first instance something which falls to be considered by each local authority. This is entirely appropriate as local circumstances and factors must be among the primary determinants in assessing the merits of individual projects. <Col N="441" /> Moneys in support of one particular urban horse project were advanced in 1997 by means of this mechanism.  I envisage further assistance being provided this year.  It is open to any local authority implementing the Act to consider availing of such assistance for a project it supports.  I stress, however, that the question of which projects are to be supported is in the first instance a matter which falls to be dealt with by local communities. I will seek to ensure that each local community is pointed in the right direction and given every assistance possible.</P>
    <P>I afforded the Taoiseach the honour and privilege of turning the first soil at the Cherry Orchard Hospital project as it was closer to his bailiwick than mine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for attending tonight to discuss this matter.</P>
      <P>The motion I have tabled relates to the community games movement and reads:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to give urgent and favourable consideration to the provision of substantial financial support to the national Community Games movement.</P>
      <P>Some 30 years ago Mr. Joe Connolly founded the national Community Games movement and neither he nor those around him could have envisaged the enormous development which has taken place in this area since 1967.  It is estimated that 15 million young people between the ages of six and 17 years have been active in the national Community Games movement, a phenomenal number of young people in a country this size. Over a 30 year period 15 million young people have taken part in the games.  Recently, the Cathaoirleach and I met Mr. Joe Connolly at the annual conference in the Hudson Bay Hotel in Athlone.  He is a modest man and history will be kind to him as regards his great foresight and forward thinking in setting up such a wonderful movement.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mens Sana in Corpore Sano,</i> a healthy mind in a healthy body, is the motto of the national Community Games movement.  The pledge given by every participant in the games is as follows:</P>
      <P>We pledge ourselves to the ideals of the Community Games in a spirit of friendly rivalry. We shall strive to participate with honest endeavour.  Our aim shall not be victory at any price but we shall genuinely seek to unite our community in friendly sporting competition.  By competing fairly and honestly, we, the children of this community, shall attempt to make our (village, town, community etc.) a happier place in which to live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could one have finer motto or pledge?  To date the national Community Games movement has <Col N="442" /> not got the recognition from Government to which it is entitled.  I express my thanks to this and previous Ministers who have given funds to the games.  However, those of us who have looked at its organisation and activities will know that it is not getting the type of support it merits and which would be helpful to it in providing a better outlet for sporting activity for our young people.</P>
    <P>Today, approximately 0.5 million young people are involved in the Community Games.  At a time when we hear about drug abuse and peer pressure and issues which are part and parcel of life in the 1990s, it is heartening to find so many people working with young people on a voluntary basis and providing them with the opportunity to compete in healthy rivalry.</P>
    <P>Some 0.5 million young people are involved in the games and the Government gives an annual grant of approximately £124,000.  I suggest with some modesty that £1 per child should be provided which would not be too great a demand on Government.  I appreciate the Minister faces many demands and I know he is a great supporter of the games because I have spoken to him privately on the matter.  He has great enthusiasm for the Community Games and has plans for it. However, the movement will need more funds for it to progress into the second millennium and £1 per child is a target at which we should look.</P>
    <P>The movement is a 32 county organisation, which is not widely known.  Recently, it set up a peace and reconciliation committee in Belfast.  It has also set up a company in Liverpool which is attached to Liverpool University and a steering group is working there.  It also intends to hold winter games so it is progressive in its thinking and is identifying what will be necessary in the future.</P>
    <P>Each year young people are drawn to Mosney where the finals of the Community Games take place.  This is a major national event.  The games fill a great void in Irish life.  I am putting the case for the movement following a successful annual conference in County Roscommon.  I undertook to publicly raise the position of the games and the problems it has with funding and organisation, with which it intends to deal.  It is a voluntary organisation and perhaps it needs to set up more company procedures.  It cannot continue to function on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight a national movement and its belief that it is entitled to more financial support from Government.  The movement has plans for the future which will involve expenditure.  It is in the process of rationalising its administrative structure and it intends to streamline and modernise its procedures.  Every village town and community supports the movement because almost all have a community games committee. It is heartening that Joe Connolly could act on an idea and see it come to such fruition 30 years later.</P>
    <P>The national Community Games movement is entering into a new phase which will involve extra expenditure and new procedures.  I have no doubt <Col N="443" /> the Minister will look favourably at the movement which is not an adversarial or demanding group.  Of all the groups I have met in political life, it is the most modest and appreciative of me and others highlighting its case.  I thank the Minister for coming to the House to listen my submission. I commend the people involved in the Community Games on the wonderful work they are doing and I hope the Minister and this and future Governments will see the merit of their work and provide a little more aid than in the past.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising this matter for discussion.  I would like to be associated with him in commending those who have run the Community Games for the past 30 years on a voluntary basis.  Community Games Ireland is a recognised national governing body of sport which receives annual funding from my Department to assist in meeting the costs of administration, organisation and development of its activities.  I and my Department are fully aware and appreciative of the extent and the quality of work undertaken by community games at national, provincial and county levels as well as in local areas throughout the country.</P>
      <P>In common with the approximately 74 other national bodies of sport, Community Games Ireland provides opportunities for participation in a wide range of sport activities.  The games provide competition for children and young people across a wide variety of sporting disciplines which in turn are administered by a number of other governing bodies also in receipt of financial assistance from my Department.</P>
      <P>Last year the Sports Council and officials of my Department held a series of meetings with the national governing bodies of sport, including Community Games Ireland.  Their purpose was to get the governing bodies to examine and identify the strengths and weaknesses of the respective organisations in terms of structures, management and administration, coaching and competition and participation levels.  Their actual and potential positioning in the areas of strategic planning were also discussed during this process of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arising from subsequent proposals emerging from those meetings, a number of national governing bodies were allocated additional funding in 1997 to assist them in addressing certain of the weaknesses which they had identified in their organisations.  Community games were allocated an additional grant towards the cost of providing <Col N="444" /> IT equipment to help improve their administration systems.</P>
    <P>This year I have introduced a new application form for governing bodies applying for financial assistance from 1998 onwards.  It was issued to all governing bodies earlier this year and puts a strong emphasis on the strategic plans of those bodies as one of the primary criteria for decisions relating to future funding allocations.  It is their future strategic plans which will mean most in this area.  The Sports Council and my Department held an information seminar for the sports organisations on 28 January 1988 to assist them in completing their applications and to outline the strategic background to the process.  Over the next few months another series of meetings will be held with the individual governing bodies to help them explore further the strategic planning and organisational needs for the future.</P>
    <P>The development of strategic planning and performance measurement will be fundamental to the future allocation of funding for the development of Irish sport in general.  It is also important to state that this approach is being developed in an environment of openness and in a spirit of full co-operation with the national governing bodies of sport.  The community games will have the fullest opportunity to participate in this process.  In common with all the other national governing bodies, they have been asked to prepare their plans and to submit their proposals for consideration.</P>
    <P>I concur with Senator Finneran's remarks on Joe Connolly, whom I met when I opened the community games in Mosney last year.  It was a remarkable vision which has become a reality. Many of our high performance athletes started in our community games network.  Making people participate, making children addicted to sport instead of drugs and eventually putting people on the podiums of international sports is something towards which we all strive.  The community games provides a wonderful base from which to achieve this.</P>
    <P>I have put an emphases on the strategic planning that each of the governing bodies have for the future.  This is a wonderful organisation because it is involved in every parish and involves children from every county.  If I receive its strategic plans I will give them favourable consideration, especially as we head towards the millennium.</P>
