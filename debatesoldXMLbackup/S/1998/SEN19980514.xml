      <P>I have notice from Senator Ross that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposed to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make a statement on the delay in issuing visas to 17 Mongolian students who have applied for visas through the Dublin School of English.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 1, 2 and 3.  I propose to take, without debate at the conclusion of business, an Earlier Signature Motion for the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liabilities and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill, 1998.  This will be circulated later in the day.</P>
      <P>Item 1, Report and Final Stages to be taken today and at the conclusion of item 1, item 2, all Stages.  Item 3, Statements on recent developments and future challenges facing banking in Ireland, to be taken from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. with contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators ten minutes. Senators may share time.</P>
      <P>Items 1 and 2, if not previously concluded, to resume after the conclusion of Statements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the Order of Business is agreed.  I ask the Leader about the Statements he promised yesterday on India and on nuclear proliferation there.  I think he confirmed that these will take place tomorrow and I presume, in spite of what he said yesterday, spokespersons on Foreign Affairs and not necessarily the Leaders of the groups may speak.</P>
      <P>I beg the indulgence of the House in raising again the issue of the Shannon River Council Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="754" /> This is of importance to the House for the following reason.  This Bill was passed by this House.  It is now the property of the Seanad.  A great deal of effort, time and thought went into the Bill and it had all-party agreement.  We are being asked, on the written say-so of a Minister, to accept that he has now implemented what was in this Bill.  It is a bad day for this House when we accept the word of any Minister simply as set out in a two-page letter.  It is our job at least to ask questions, to scutinise and to find out.  The Leader of the House has such respect for this institution that he would not want us to be seen to cave into the demand of a Minister.  It is important for the respect of this House and for the Bill that we be given a chance to debate the Bill again and to hear from the Minister why he believes the proposals made by his party colleagues in the last Seanad are no longer relevant.  I ask the Leader to deal with this matter in a way that is in the best interest of the House and of the people who would be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like, very strongly, to support the point made by Senator Manning.  The Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, is the property of this House.  It was passed at Second Stage and, under Standing Orders, it is required to be resubmitted at Committee Stage.  I distinguish between it and the Shannon River Council Bill, 1998, which is on the Order Paper.  The 1997 Bill should now be resubmitted.  It is not good enough to say that the matter has been responded to by a Minister by action in a couple of counties.  The River Shannon has implications for many more counties than those mentioned in the Minister's letter.  I would hope for support from those Senators on the Government side who were so vociferous in our discussion of this Bill in the last Seanad.  The question is raised of the integrity of our beliefs and commitment.  It would be important to return to the Official Report and read the speeches made when this matter was discussed by the last Seanad.  I appeal to the Leader not to be browbeaten by any Minister, to assert himself and to insist that the matter be included in the business of the House as soon a possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We also agree to the Order of Business as announced by the Leader of the House.  I welcome the speedy response by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Mo Mowlam, and the British Government to the report of the Victims of Northern Ireland Commission by appointing a Minister for victims.  It is a welcome focus and emphasis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of item 5 on the Order Paper, I wish to refer to what appears to be a considerable escalation in the Garda dispute, namely, the confrontation between the Garda Commissioner and senior management, the continuing protests outside the House and on the streets and the threat to the Tour de France, with gardaí seeking to get the sympathetic support of the French police during the Irish stage.  The continuing escalation is <Col N="755" /> serious and it appears the Government is doing nothing to resolve the issue.  We want action as it is not good enough that the forces of law and order are protesting on the streets.</P>

      <P>Before calling other Senators, I insist that Members confine themselves to questions to the Leader which directly relate to the Order of Business and the business of the House.  Lengthy contributions are not in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to draw the attention of the Leader to very worrying reports which have come to our notice, namely, the drastic reduction in blood donations.  I understand some non-emergency operations may not go ahead. This is causing a crisis for hospitals.  Will the Leader raise the matter with the Minister for Health and Children as public fears will have to be allayed?  We are currently importing blood from The Netherlands where stocks are also low. The House has a responsibility to play a role in this regard.  Blood donations have decreased by between 25 and 30 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter but under Standing Orders of the House matters such as this may be raised in another manner.  It is not in order to raise such matters on the Order of Business.  I have given quite an amount of latitude to the Senator and I ask him to conclude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what has been said.  The crisis in our hospitals is an urgent matter and I ask the Leader to follow up the points I am making with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at least six months ago regarding the importance of pointing out to immigrants and refugees legislation covering children in particular.  I have also raised the matter in the House when discussing refugee problems.  Will the Leader find out whether agencies dealing with refugees and immigrants are giving information to immigrants as we have a problem regarding a supposed child marriage which recently took place?  I have made representations inside and outside the House on this very important issue and would be glad if the Leader would find out whether anything is happening on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Leader an issue which was raised on the Order of Business yesterday, namely, the problem which has arisen as a result of the rural renewal scheme, particularly as County Donegal has been ignored in this context.  Special incentives have been given to Northern Ireland over the past number of years &mdash; rightly so because of the troubles &mdash; but we are caught between the counties in the South, which are progressing as a <Col N="756" /> result of the economy, and the counties in the North.</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the issue of increased physical attacks on nurses, particularly in emergency rooms at night, a fact which has come to light as a result of recent reports to conferences of nursing organisations.  We live in an age where there are charters for patients' rights, but it appears nurses are expected to work for the benefit of the public and take whatever abuse is given them from members of the public.  Perhaps the Leader will forward our concerns to the Minister for Health and Children in the context of what procedures will be put in place for nurses and people who work in these circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the situation has not previously arisen in Ireland, but I ask the Leader to seek further information on the fact that the child I referred to yesterday on the Order of Business was actually sold into a marriage contract. I appreciate that the Minister has perhaps not previously come across such a situation, but it is very important that we get a factual report on what exactly happened.  It is a most reprehensible thing to happen.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Cathaoirleach did not allow Senator Ó Murchú to raise the issue, but I wish to make a suggestion in view of the shortage of blood, namely, that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas could lead by example.  I am willing to give blood, although I know that only 17 per cent of the population would like to take it. It also begs a question in the context of the Treaty of Amsterdam when we have to import Dutch blood&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the situation in Indonesia and East Timor?  I am sure colleagues on the Independent benches will fully support motion 8, item 11, tabled by myself and Senator Brendan Ryan. Such a discussion would be relevant as a number of us predicted the disintegration of Indonesia from within, leading to a situation where a small nation such as Ireland might have influence in seeking implementation of decent human rights for the unfortunate people of East Timor.  The issue is now more relevant than ever as our predictions come true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the call by Senator Leonard, and by Senator McGowan yesterday, in relation to rural renewal schemes.  I raised this issue during the debate on the Finance Bill and was assured by the Minister that if the pilot scheme is successful it will be extended to other rural areas.  I hope Counties Donegal and Monaghan are included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> Following the decision of the Supreme Court yesterday to reverse an earlier High Court ruling which supported a decision made by an appeals commissioner of the Revenue Commissioners, whereby the children's element of a contributory social welfare payment received by a widow or widower was deemed to be non-taxable, I ask the Leader to bring either the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs or the Minister for Finance to the House for a debate on the matter or to introduce legislation.  Private superannuation schemes allow the income of children to be separated in such a situation.  As the judge and the Revenue Commissioners maintain that very few people are affected, the State should not be significantly affected and I ask that this anomaly be examined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I add my voice to the comments regarding the Shannon River Council Bill and ask the Leader to circulate the letter referred to, which I understand contains the Minister's response.  I have raised this issue from an early stage and am glad to have received the support of colleagues on this side of the House.  However, I have not seen a copy of the letter.  I have corresponded with the Leader much earlier in the life of the current Seanad but have not been informed of progress.  I was not a Member of the previous Seanad, but I think the attitude to this legislation, considering the support given it by Fianna Fáil Members in the last Seanad, is very worrying and a matter of deep concern which adds to public cynicism about how we conduct our business.  I urge the Leader to take on board the comments made on this side of the House in relation to the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Apropos</i> the remarks of Senator O'Meara and the inference that they concern me, I do not know what the problem is.  Governments and Oppositions are equally consistent.  Senator O'Meara was not a Member of this House when I and others witnessed the Government Chief Whip scurrying around in an effort to ensure he had enough votes to vote down that Bill last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney is not in order in pursuing that line on the Order of Business. The Leader of the House will respond to the questions and points raised.  If Senator Mooney has a question to the Leader of the House which is relevant to the Order of Business, I ask him to put it to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of the controversy which seems to have arisen and because I and a number of other Members have taken a personal interest in this issue and supported many elements of the Bill when we spoke on it, I am pleased the Minister has already circulated to those of us who made representations a response which has gone <Col N="758" /> 90 per cent of the way towards addressing most of the issues contained in that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the party line, first, middle and last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the disappointment of Senator O'Meara and other colleagues who do not seem to be privy to that information, although I am not responsible for that.  I have that information because I corresponded with the Minister on this issue over a period of months on behalf of many of the people who work in Lough Derg and Lough Ree.  In order to inform those Senators on the other side of the House who do not seem to be informed, I ask the Leader of the House to consider allocating Government time or Private Members' Time for a debate on this issue so that the Minister can come into the House and clarify his proposals.  On the basis of the information I have and the letter I received, part of which was read into the record by the Leader last week, I assure the House that almost all the issues covered in that Bill have been identified and addressed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Leader propose to take Item 8 on the Order Paper which is a motion relating to the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Act, 1997?</P>
      <P>In light of recent events, perhaps the Leader could arrange a debate on Turkey a country which sees itself as an aspirant member of the EU.  However, in recent months it has dissolved one of the largest political parties in that state and has witnessed the suspicious attempt to assassinate the head of the independent human rights group which is a perpetual focus of state abuse in that country.  It needs to be made extremely clear from within the EU that it is not because of its different religion but because of its apparent unwillingness to operate as a democracy that Turkey has problems with the EU.  This House can serve a useful purpose by debating the issue and making it explicitly clear to Turkey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the previous speaker's call for a debate on the pros and cons of the Turkish establishment and its view on participation in the EU.  It is important that we consider the development of our EU partners in terms of their participation in democracy.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader of the House to make time available for a debate on the important document on rural development.  The contents of that document, which the Government is considering implementing, are fundamental to rural development and the wealth of our nation.  This House should play its part in supporting the Government's development of that programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the bicentenary celebrations of the 1798 rebellion which are taking place in Wexford at present, I ask the Leader to consider how this House could participate in the <Col N="759" /> reconstitution of the Wexford Senate which was the first republican democratic forum to be established in the country.  I have some suggestions as to how that might be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The House could sit in Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Leader could have discussions with Comóradh to see how that could be done.  It would be a positive step, particularly given the present political climate which has its roots in the 1798 rebellion when Catholics, Protestants and Dissenters came together to shake off the yoke of bondage.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the opposition of this House to the nuclear testing in India.  It now seems that such testing will be replicated in Pakistan, which is a retrograde step.  We, as a neutral country, should voice our strong concerns about it.</P>
      <P>I join Senator Ó Murchú in asking the Leader to pursue the issue of restoring confidence in the blood transfusion service.  I also ask him to raise with the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the fact that this may require making those who are culpable for this appalling scandal accountable to the public.  It is abominable that people have not been prosecuted in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the issue raised by Senator Ryan about the possible membership of Turkey of the European Union, it would be appropriate for us to debate European enlargement. We had an opportunity to briefly mention it during the passage of the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1998, but it merits time of its own.  I welcome the extension of the Union and I hope the applications of the central European countries will be processed quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What about democracy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should not get excited as I am coming to that point.  As regards Turkey in particular, there is a clause in the Amsterdam Treaty which is a statement of the fundamental rights of people and an endorsement of democracy and the rule of law.  It would be inconsistent if Turkey became a member under those treaty conditions.  That is something we should look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to provide time for a debate on the distribution of video nasties, particularly as they apply to child pornography. It is important that such a debate takes place in view of the fact that this impacts greatly on the welfare of children.</P>
      <P>I strongly support Senator Ó Murchú's remarks about the blood transfusion service.  As an individual who represents 8 per cent of the population and as a universal donor, I will be glad to offer my services if requested.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that I will circulate the letter from the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on the Shannon River Council Bill to every Member of the House today.  I presume it has not arrived by now because we are changing offices.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, O'Toole, Meara and Mooney expressed concern about the Shannon River Council Bill and suggested that it be resubmitted on the Order Paper.  I know the Minister will have no difficulty coming into the House if so requested.  However, as I pointed out yesterday, 90 per cent of everything in that Bill is included in the pilot scheme.  I will ask the Minister to come into the House to clarify the position if Senators so wish.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning inquired about tomorrow's statements on nuclear testing in India.  I propose that one person from each group makes a statement not exceeding ten minutes.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello said the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was doing nothing about the GRA dispute.  That is not true; any fair minded person knows the Minister has met this organisation on several occasions.  It is an unfair comment. We hope there will be a successful conclusion to this dispute as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senators Labhrás Ó Murchú, Walsh, Ridge and Glynn all expressed concern about the shortage of blood supplies in the blood bank at present. Yesterday I called on all people to respond as generously as they have in the past and to come forward and donate again.  I fully agree with the sentiments expressed this morning that we will lead the way if required.  I would be surprised if people did not come forward over the next few days and give as they have given for decades.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry outlined the serious position regarding child abuse.  A Garda inquiry into this is currently underway.  I would like to wait until there is greater clarity but it is an appalling situation and the allegations being made in the media are a matter which must be addressed urgently. If they are true we will have a debate on them in this House as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Senators Leonard, Bonner and Chambers are concerned about rural renewal schemes and rural development.  I informed the House yesterday that the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern, has agreed to come before the House the week after the referendum.  Senator Leonard also asked me to pass on her concerns to the Minister for Health and Children about the serious risks to nurses, those on night time duty in particular.  I will certainly do this.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris called for a debate on Indonesia and East Timor and I will facilitate his request. Senator Bonner raised the High Court decision taken yesterday.  The only way this can be addressed is through legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators Ryan, Chambers and Dardis are all concerned that there should be a debate on Turkey and its possible entry into the EU.  I will <Col N="761" /> facilitate their requests.  In response to Senator Ryan concerning item 8, I will arrange a debate on this as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator Jim Walsh raised the commemoration of 1798.  I assured the House that there would be a debate on this before the end of May.  I realise there is an important commemorative event taking place in Wexford on May 31.  If the Senator has any further suggestions, I recommend he pass them on to the Cathaoirleach in his capacity of Chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  We can consider them there.  I also note his concerns, which many other Senators expressed yesterday, regarding the nuclear testing in India and have passed them to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The Child Pornography Bill should address Senator Glynn's concerns about video nasties.</P>

      <P>Before we commence I remind Senators that they may speak only once on Report Stage, except the proposer of an amendment who may reply to the discussion on the amendment.  Also, on Report Stage each amendment must be seconded.  Amendment No. 1 is a Government amendment, amendment No. 4 is consequential and they shall be discussed together by agreement.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 33 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Within seven days of the date of publication of the notice under subsection (1) the relevant housing authority shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) send a copy of the notice and the draft of the accommodation programme, or the draft of the amendment to or replacement of it, to the bodies notified under section 8, and</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure a wider display of the newspaper notices announcing either the availability of a draft programme for public inspection or the adoption of a programme.  I am proposing these amendments following further consideration of the points made by Senators Walsh, Ormonde and J. Doyle at Committee Stage.  While the provisions are mandatory, it is a matter for the relevant housing authority to decide to what extent a notice <Col N="762" /> requires to be displayed in its offices to which the public have access.  Such places could include the head offices of the authority, public libraries, motor tax offices and the housing department. The effect of the amendment is to require the authority to consider the question of further public exposure of the notice in allowing the authority maximum flexibility as to how such notices are to be further publicised.</P>

      <P>In this amendment I propose that the manager of the relevant housing authority shall submit the draft accommodation programme not later than three, instead of two, months to the councillors so that members of the relevant housing authority will have a greater opportunity of assessing the plans.  The reason we put three months there is that a plan could be prepared in the summer, but the month of August, when the councillors do not meet, could intervene and time would be short. The amendment states that it is to be submitted not later than three, rather than two, months.  We hope that the Minister will accept this is a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the passing of the Bill. While Senator Costello said it was a pity he did not table more amendments, I think the Minister is aware that some of us on this side of the House would like to have been in a position to table amendments on matters about which we are concerned. I, like many of my colleagues on this side of the House, have strong reservations about sections 22 and, in particular, 31.  On section 22 we were seeking to have the involvement of the settled community in areas where there are travelling facilities, and I would have liked to have seen that in the Bill.  There has been some controversy in the past few days when an intemperate remark, with which obviously none of us would agree, was made by a member of the Western Health Board.  We would strongly disagree with it.  Unfortunately, in the rush to be politically correct sometimes one may loose sight of the causes of such exasperating comments.  It may well be swallowed in a hail of condemnation, but the genuine concerns of people who suffer the difficulties, where either halting sites or housing estates for travellers are not properly and effectively managed, represent a huge opposition to the situation.</P>
      <P>I would like to have seen section 31 made much stronger by being mandatory rather than discretionary. It is a little aspirational.  The local authority may decide to remove or not to remove unauthorised caravans.  We may not see an improvement in that area.  Badly managed facilities, which give rise to huge numbers of complaints, and unauthorised indiscriminately placed camping sites, particularly where adjacent to existing facilities, create widespread public opposition. They are the main difficulties in tackling what the Minister is justifiably trying to do &mdash; to provide accommodation for those in need and those who are obviously living in appalling conditions. This should be and is a priority.</P>
      <P>I hope our concerns and reservations are misplaced and that the Minister and the Department are correct.  If so, I look forward to publicly acknowledging that in the future.  Equally, I would like to think that if it turns out that our reservations have some validity, the Bill might be revisited in the future.</P>

      <P>I welcome the passing of this Bill.  I thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House and ensuring there was consensus on some of the elements where he accepted amendments which had been tabled, albeit in a slightly different form.</P>
      <P>What is important and what comes through in this Bill is that we have a coherent nationwide policy on the housing of travellers which is implemented.  I take the valid points raised by Senator Walsh, but what is important is that there is co-operation on both sides from both the travellers and residents and that there is as much consultation as possible.  At the end of the day members of local authorities must take on board their responsibilities.  Unfortunately, the Bill has had to provide that where local authority members do not do so, the manager must do it for them.  I hope it never comes to that.  I look forward to having the traveller accommodation difficulties settled once and for all under the aegis of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  On Second Stage I said that I was frightened by some research I conducted on the disparity between the health of the settled and travelling communities. Much of this arises from the travelling community's poor accommodation and I hope this Bill will provide necessary accommodation for them.</P>
      <P>I want to make a passing reference to an organisation, a meeting of which I attended last Friday, called Pavee, which trains travellers in health care and accommodation with the Eastern Health Board.  It has been a great success.  I hope that spreads across the country and encourages the travellers to take a greater interest in their affairs.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is to be successful, it will take courageous decisions by the members of local authorities. I hope they will not be found wanting in making these decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and his staff for being so patient with us, and particularly with me.  I had many informal discussions with them leading up to the introduction of the Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>I, too, had reservations and perhaps I am still a little concerned about areas of it.  Senator Walsh referred to them in terms of sections 22 and 31. However, section 22 is where the local consultation aspect was missing, that is from the settled community's point of view.  I see now that in section 8 we may be able to overcome the problem. Each local authority and the local residents' association can enter into dialogue when the plan is being launched.  Perhaps that is a way of overcoming the problem of not having a settled person in the consultation group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is most important that we bring the settled community along with us.  In the past it was not informed, it was always on the outside, told where a site would be located.  There was no consultation process.  If we get a balanced approach <Col N="766" /> from the beginning, it is possible that the Bill will work.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about section 31 on the basis that if there are no sites, the travellers cannot be moved on.  That is the dilemma for the settled community, that the travellers will still be left on the side of the road.  The weakness is there.  I hope that this will fall into line in time and that the Bill will come into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for being so patient with us and I hope we can all work together to improve relations between travellers and the settled community.  This was a worthwhile debate and I appreciate the concerns of the Department's officials.  If I have a problem with South Dublin County Council I will contact the staff again to question every aspect of this legislation and I hope I will get the same attention I received during this debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what has already been said in relation to the vexed issue of traveller accommodation in drawing up and implementing suitable programmes and by providing us with a consultative capacity both on a national basis in terms of the consultative councils, the national traveller consultative accommodations councils and the local traveller accommodation consultative committees.  I hope these joint layers of democracy in terms of decision-making will lead to a more successful drawing up and implementation of programmes.</P>
      <P>In relation to section 20, I thought the national consultative committee would consist of a member of the health board.  I am not sure whether the Minister's nominees would make provision for that because the health board is also an accommodation agency as well as dealing with welfare matters, etc.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I believe the Bill is excellent.  It is now up to us as representatives, and many of us are also local representatives, to make difficult decisions using this framework.  I congratulate the Minister for providing the framework.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Molloy)</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senator Costello's remarks about health boards on Second Stage, we are dealing with accommodation needs of travellers. I have already mentioned that the travelling community has many other needs such as education, health, etc. but we are dealing specifically with accommodation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I undertook to look again at issues raised by Senators.  Other issues were raised and I did not examine them but I gave a satisfactory reason for not doing anything about them.  Among the matters I said I would look at again were: the display of the newspaper notices; the question of putting an upper limit of five years on the duration of subsequent accommodation programmes; the insertion of a provision in relation to back-up and support services, <Col N="767" /> particularly social workers, for implementation of programmes; increase in the period of two months allowed to members to consider the adoption of a programme under section 12, and the question of representation by the settled community on local traveller accommodation consultative committees.</P>
    <P>I have proposed amendments or I have accepted Senators' amendments on three of those five issues.  The following is the position regarding the remaining two that I did not bring forward amendments on in regard to the staff resources and the back-up support for social workers.  There is already in existence a comprehensive legislative code under the Local Government Acts relating to responsibilities and powers of local authorities for the appointment of staff and the allocation of resources for the implementation of functions assigned to them.  Briefly the position is that the allocation of staffing resources is a matter for the manager of the local authority concerned.  There is no need therefore to include separate or additional staffing, or resource provisions in this Bill.  Any such provision would be an unnecessary duplication of existing provisions under the Local Government Acts.  Financial assistance is available from my Department in respect of the employment of social workers at the rate of 90 per cent of the costs recovered and caretakers employed by local authorities at 75 per cent of the costs.  Recoupment of the costs of any additional staff recruited to implement local programmes would have to be considered in the light of the funds available at the time of such application.</P>
    <P>I have looked again at the question of representation by the settled community on local consultative committees which was raised by Senator Costello but I do not propose to make any changes to the composition of such committees as set out in the Bill.  I understand the point that Senators are making &mdash; that there is need for consultation and dialogue with local communities on how an accommodation programme could impact on such communities.  However, the extension of membership of the local committee is not the most appropriate, effective or practical way of doing this.</P>
    <P>The composition of the local committees takes account of several considerations: the particular focus of the committees on improving relations and understanding between local authorities, that is, members and officials and travellers; the fact that much of the work of the committees will involve consideration of detailed or sensitive matters of direct concern to travellers only &mdash; for example, family circumstances and the assessment of their accommodation needs; the design of proposals to meet those needs and the development of partnership arrangements with the housing authority for the management of such accommodation; the need to maintain an appropriate balance between the constituent groups to facilitate active participation by travellers in a <Col N="768" /> forum or in a role with which they may not be very familiar.</P>
    <P>Travellers have on occasion decided not to attend consultative committees which had been established by local authorities on a non-statutory basis because they felt they were being overwhelmed by the number of people with opposing views to themselves and the committee.  Therefore, it is necessary to strike a balance in order for consultation to work between the people represented on the local consultative committee.</P>
    <P>Further considerations are: the role of the committees, which is consultative in nature with decision-making remaining the responsibility of the housing authorities; the need to keep membership to manageable levels; the difficulties inherent in seeking to identify representatives of the settled community, other than the elected representatives which would present major problems; and the provision which has been made for public consultation in relation to the accommodation programme under the Bill and in relation to halting site developments which are now subject to the normal planning requirements which apply to local authority developments in their own functional areas.  I have announced that the exemption that exists under part 10 has been removed.</P>
    <P>It is considered that the members of housing authorities who will form part of the membership of these committees are in the best position to represent the views of the wider community on these committees.  Once membership is opened to local community groups, it will be very difficult to contain the numbers to a manageable level. Any area not represented will feel aggrieved. Even if all resident groups are represented it will be difficult to resist requests for representation by other groups, including charitable and welfare groups and other statutory authorities.  Very quickly the representation becomes unbalanced and unmanageable.  We want to ensure that travellers are happy to participate in these consultative committees.</P>
    <P>Senator Ormonde has pointed out that there is already a provision under section 8 of the Bill for the giving of prior notice of the preparation of a programme to such bodies as the relevant housing authority consider appropriate.  Prior notice could therefore be given to local community or residents groups if the authority wished to involve such groups in the preparation process.  Once notified under section 8, the body must be included at other stages of the process &mdash; for example, under section 9 a copy of the draft programme must be sent to a body notified under section 8; and under section 12 such a body must be given a copy of the draft programme which has been submitted for consideration and adoption by the members of the authority.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities have wide powers to take public consultation and information initiatives which they consider appropriate to their functional area and it is not necessary to provide for this specifically in legislation.  The format of such <Col N="769" /> arrangements is entirely a matter for housing authorities to develop and could range from a series of public local areas meetings, or short-term or <i>ad hoc</i> broad based committees for the specific purpose of conducting consultation with the public on the accommodation issue, or broad based consultative or co-ordinating committees in relation to a range of services, including accommodation, to be provided by the statutory authorities and other bodies in respect of travellers.</P>
    <P>A number of authorities have experience of broadly representative committees in respect of the provision of traveller accommodation with varying degrees of success.  I intend to cover the need for consultation with and the participation of the public generally in the circular letters to be issued to housing authorities regarding implementation of the provisions of the Bill when it is passed by the House.  I will monitor closely the experiences of the authorities which have engaged in such exercises to date and draw on those experiences in framing my advice and guidance.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I stated I would not return with an amendment in respect of the question of distances.  The existing limit of five miles is regarded by the courts as a reasonable provision. I am advised that any extension of this limit must have regard to a test of reasonableness and should be linked to the circumstances set out in paragraph (b) of section 31, having regard to the principles of natural justice.  Due to existing pressures on halting site accommodation, the number of vacancies at any one time is only a fraction of the number of families seeking bays on these sites.  In these circumstances the courts have questioned the rationale of moving travellers when no alternative accommodation is available. The acceleration of the rate at which accommodation is provided &mdash; which is the main purpose of the Bill &mdash; is the key to eliminating unauthorised encampments.  Based on advice from and consultation with the Attorney General, I did not believe it would be wise to accept suggestions in respect of the distances which only relates to specific cases as set out in section 31.</P>
    <P>I am pleased by the reception the Bill received from Senators.  I thank those who participated in the debate for their support for the general approach of this policy initiative which came about as a result of an initiative taken by my predecessor and which has the full support of the Government.  The initiative also has broad cross-party support in both Houses which augurs well for the success of the Bill and that of the Government's plan to implement the main recommendations of the Task Force on the Travelling Community.</P>
    <P>The provision of accommodation is my responsibility.  I hope to take the necessary measures to advance the provision of accommodation for traveller families living at the roadside as quickly as possible because no one wants to see that continuing.  Substantial sums of money have been committed by the Government to <Col N="770" /> implement and accelerate an accommodation programme.  The method of consultation, which will be put in place if the Bill is passed by the other House and enacted, will greatly assist in removing unnecessary fears in the minds of members of the settled community in respect of the location and operation of traveller facilities. Much of the concern relating to this issue arises from the fact that many families remain in unauthorised locations and illegal encampments which do not have proper facilities, look very unattractive and are a danger to the people living in them.  No one wants to tolerate a continuance of that situation.</P>
    <P>I anticipate broad support from local authority members throughout the country for the Government's objective and I know they will utilise the substantial funds being made available to facilitate the construction of facilities.  I hope the traveller community will seek and accept more traditional housing accommodation instead of that provided on halting sites.  I would prefer children to be reared in normal, dry, well built and comfortable houses than in caravans, particularly in light of prevailing weather conditions.  I do not believe caravans are attractive or suitable accommodation for children.  However, some members of the traveller community have a preference for using halting site accommodation which could be described as a staging or halfway house.  I hope those living on halting sites and in tighíns will seek to move into more comfortable sized houses to accommodate what are traditionally much larger families than the norm.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and their amendments.  I look forward to working with all public representatives in the implementation of the legislation and the achievement of the Government's objective to provide proper accommodation for all traveller families.</P>

    <Title>Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997: Second Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997, is to enable the State to adopt the Model Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, which is generally referred to as UNCITRAL, to provide a framework to enable Ireland to market itself as an attractive venue for international commercial arbitrations.  The Model Law has already been enacted into legislation by a substantial number of countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Scotland and by a number of American states.  In adopting this law as part of its domestic legislation, Ireland is following a well recognised international trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> Arbitration is concerned with the resolution of disputes outside the ordinary court system.  This type of resolution mechanism is recognised as being particularly suitable for disputes of a commercial nature which have connections with two or more countries.  This is because the parties to such disputes will frequently be involved in long-term commercial relationships and will wish to seek solutions to their problems which will not jeopardise those relationships.  Properly managed, arbitration can be cheaper and speedier than litigation. It also offers a guarantee of privacy and flexibility of approach in specialised disputes where parties may wish to have the option of appointing as an arbitrator someone who is an expert in the area in question.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that much of arbitration practice is not regulated by statute and that the parties to an arbitration agreement have considerable autonomy in determining how their arbitration should be conducted.  The statutory framework for arbitration which now exists in Ireland is provided primarily by the Arbitration Acts of 1954 and 1980, which will continue to be important for arbitrations which are not covered by the scope of this Bill.  However, for the type of arbitration dealt with by this Bill, the 1954 legislation would seem to be problematic.</P>
    <P>At present, business dealings involving two or more commercial entities based in different geographic locations are commonplace and such entities look to familiar rules to resolve commercial disputes rather than to a regime which is geared to more local concerns.  The Bill, by providing for the adoption of the Model Law, will bring those familiar rules into our legal environment and, in this way, should facilitate the conduct of major international arbitration hearings in this country.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main elements of the Model Law, the text of which is included as a Schedule to the Bill.  The Model Law specifies that the term &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; should be given a wide interpretation to enable it to cover matters arising from all relationships of a commercial nature, whether contractual or otherwise.  Examples of matters which come within the scope of the Model Law include any trade transaction for the supply or exchange of goods or services, various types of financial services, such as investment, financing, banking, and insurance and various forms of industrial or business co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Model Law is divided into a series of chapters dealing with a wide variety of issues which arise in the course of the international arbitration process.  Chapter I deals mainly with the issue of scope.  Chapter II focuses on the form of the arbitration agreement while Chapter III deals with the composition of the arbitral tribunal, for example, the number of arbitrators, how they are to be appointed and how such appointments may be challenged.  Chapter IV deals with certain matters pertinent to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.  Chapter V covers the conduct of the arbitral proceedings including the determination <Col N="772" /> of rules of procedure, the place of arbitration and the right of each party to be given a full opportunity to present his or her case.</P>
    <P>Chapter VI contains rules relating to the making of an award.  It must be in writing and, unless the parties otherwise agree, must state the reasons upon which it is based.  Chapter VII specifies the grounds upon which an award may be set aside.  These include the fact that the award deals with a matter falling outside the scope of the submission to arbitration or that the award is in conflict with public policy.  Chapter VIII deals with the recognition and enforcement of awards and the grounds upon which such recognition and enforcement can be resisted.  Those grounds are substantially the same as those which apply to the setting aside of an award.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the specific provisions of the Bill. Part I contains standard provisions in relation to short title and references.  Because there is no commencement provision in the Bill, the usual practice will apply and the Bill will come into operation immediately it is enacted.  The central elements of the Bill are contained in Part II. Section 3 contains standard interpretation provisions. The key provision in the Bill is section 4 which provides that, subject to Part II of the Bill, the Model Law shall apply in the State.  The &ldquo;subject to&rdquo; provision is included in this section to make it clear that the application of the Model Law in the State, while generally intended to apply in an unrestricted manner to international commercial arbitration proceedings, is made subject to other provisions in Part II of the Bill which, by and large, supplement the Model Law in a variety of ways.  Such supplementary provisions extend to such matters as the scope of court intervention in support of arbitral proceedings; powers of the arbitral tribunal in relation to the examination of witnesses; the award of interest by the arbitral tribunal; the allocation of costs in respect of arbitral proceedings and the liability of arbitrators when undertaking arbitration work.</P>
    <P>Section 5 contains certain clarificatory provisions. In particular, subsection (2) provides that the documents of UNCITRAL and its working group relating to the preparation of the Model Law may be considered in ascertaining the meaning or effect of any provision of that law.</P>
    <P>The High Court is specified as the court for the purposes of Article 6 of the Model Law by virtue of section 6 which also specifies that court as the court for certain other purposes which are provided for in the Model Law.  Article 6 provides for a State, when enacting the Model Law, to specify the court competent to perform certain functions specified in that article.  Those functions deal with the scope of court intervention in the international commercial arbitration process and include, for example, the power of the court under article 11(3) to appoint a third arbitrator for arbitration proceedings where three arbitrators are required and where, <i>inter alia,</i> the other two arbitrators fail to agree on such an <Col N="773" /> appointment and the power to set aside, in accordance with article 34(2), an arbitral award.</P>
    <P>The other relevant purposes are covered by four particular articles.  Article 9 allows a party to an arbitration agreement to request interim measures of protection from a court.  Article 27 allows for court assistance in taking evidence. Article 35 deals with the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards and article 36 sets out the grounds on which a court may refuse recognition and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The question of court involvement in the arbitration process is, perhaps, the most significant example of the way the Model Law differs from our existing legislative régime.  Under the 1954 Act, it is open to an arbitrator to state a consultative case on a question of law arising in the course of a reference and he or she can also be directed to state such a case by the court.  The court may also direct that an award &mdash; essentially the arbitrator's decision &mdash; be stated in the form of a special case for the decision of the court.  Under the Model Law, this kind of court intervention will no longer be possible.</P>
    <P>The powers of the High Court which are exercisable in support of international commercial arbitration proceedings are set out in section 7 and equate with the powers which are available to the court in relation to any other action or matter before it.  The purpose of this section is to set out in clear terms the type of court assistance which is envisaged by articles 9 and 27 of the Model Law.  Examples of such assistance would be measures directed towards the conservation of the subject matter of the arbitral proceedings or towards the production of documents.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) of this section seeks to ensure that parties in the context of international commercial arbitration proceedings are not disadvantaged because they are individuals who are ordinarily resident outside the State or corporations or associations incorporated or formed under a law other than the law of the State or whose central management and control are exercised outside the State.  The rules of the Superior Courts as they stand at present encompass a fairly wide ranging jurisdiction to order security for costs against foreign plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with the powers of an arbitral tribunal in relation to the examination of witnesses. The purpose of this section is to enable an arbitral tribunal to direct that a party to an arbitration agreement or a witness who gives evidence in arbitration proceedings, be examined on oath or affrmation.  It also enables the tribunal to administer such oaths and affirmations.  It is considered that such a provision would be of assistance to an arbitral tribunal and could help it to carry out its functions in a more efficient and effective manner.  It is, however, open to the parties to agree that the tribunal should not have this power.</P>
    <P>Section 9(1) provides for arbitral proceedings to be consolidated with other arbitral proceedings with the agreement of the parties to those proceedings <Col N="774" /> or for the holding of concurrent hearings on such terms as may be agreed.  Section 10 gives the arbitrator wide ranging powers in relation to the granting of interest on an award.  The Model Law does not deal with the question of interest and this provision is intended to introduce clarity into our arbitration code.  In particular, subsections (2) and (3) make it clear that a tribunal may grant interest on any amount awarded by it in respect of the period up to the date of the award. Under existing law, there is some uncertainty as to the ability of an arbitrator to award interest in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The cost provisions of the arbitration are dealt with in section 11.  Under subsections (1), (2) and (3), the parties to an arbitration agreement are free to agree on how the costs of the arbitration, which include the costs as between the parties and the arbitrators' fees and expenses, are to be allocated and on the costs recoverable.  Subsections (4), (5) and (6) deal with the situation where there is no agreement of the parties as to costs and allow the arbitral tribunal, subject to the consent of the parties in the case of the costs as between themselves only, to make a determination and to specify certain matters.  Subsections (7) to (9) are concerned with the role of the High Court in dealing with applications relating to costs and subsection (10) is a general statement of intent about the right of a tribunal to its fees and expenses, including the fees and expenses of any expert it may appoint to report to it on specific issues it may have to determine.  The appointment of such an expert is provided for in Article 26 of the Model Law.</P>
    <P>Section 12 makes clear that an arbitrator will not be liable for anything done or omitted in the discharge or purported discharge of his or her functions as arbitrator, unless the act or omission is shown to have been in bad faith.  These protections are extended to the arbitrator's employee, agent or adviser and to an expert appointed under Article 26 of the Model Law by subsection (2).  Subsections (3) to (5) contain similar provisions in respect of institutions or persons by whom an arbitrator is appointed or nominated. Subsection (6) provides that witnesses who give evidence before an arbitral tribunal shall have the same privileges and immunities as are given to witnesses in proceedings before the High Court, while subsection (7) provides that a barrister, solicitor or person holding equivalent qualifications obtained in another jurisdiction who appears in proceedings before an arbitral tribunal shall have the same privileges and immunities as barristers and solicitors in proceedings before the High Court.  The section recognises that, because the scope of the Bill is concerned with international commercial arbitration, there may be circumstances where lawyers from other countries may wish to act for parties in arbitral proceedings conducted in the State.</P>
    <P>Patent agents and trademark agents, who appear for parties in arbitral proceedings relating to disputes involving patents and trade marks, <Col N="775" /> have also been granted these privileges and immunities.  These agents are a clearly defined professional group for the purpose of the Patent and Trade Marks Acts and practice in the area of intellectual property law.  As such, they may appear for parties in intellectual property disputes which require recourse to arbitration, and it is important they enjoy the same level of protection as will be enjoyed by barristers and solicitors in proceedings involving the use of the Model Law.</P>
    <P>Section 13 contains an exception to Article 34 (3) of the Model Law which specifies a time limit of three months for an application to be made to set aside an arbitral award.  The section provides that this time limit shall not apply to an application to the High Court to have an arbitral award set aside on the grounds that the award is in conflict with the public policy of the State.</P>
    <P>The ability to enforce an award is central to the arbitration process.  Subsection (1) of section 14 provides for an award made by an arbitral tribunal to be enforceable in the State either by action or, by leave of the High Court, in the same manner as a judgment or order of that court.  The section also allows for interim measures of protection made by an arbitral tribunal under Article 17 of the Model Law to be similarly enforced. The recognition and enforcement of international arbitration awards is dealt with in a number of international conventions which have already been given the force of law in the State by the Arbitration Acts of 1954 and 1980.  Section 14(4) of this Bill makes it clear that nothing in section 14 affects the recognition and enforcement of awards under these conventions.  Only if the arbitration award is not already covered by one of these conventions will the recognition and enforcement provisions of the Model Law come into play.  This provision is fully in keeping with the framework envisaged by the Model Law itself.</P>
    <P>New legislation often requires transitional provisions to clarify the circumstances in which it will or will not apply, particularly in the initial stages of its operation.  The arbitration proceedings to which this Bill applies are set out in section 15. In the interests of fairness to those parties who may have commenced arbitration proceedings before the day on which the Bill comes into operation, subsection (1) of that section makes it clear that Part II shall not apply to such proceedings unless the arbitration is concluded after that day and that the parties so agree.  Subsection (2) provides that Part II shall apply to relevant arbitrations commenced on or after the day on which the Bill comes into operation under an arbitration agreement entered into on or after that day. Where the arbitration agreement has been entered into before that day, it is open to the parties to agree that the Bill's provisions shall apply. In addition, subject to the exception provided for in section 14(4) to which I have already referred, section 16 ensures that the Arbitration Acts 1954 <Col N="776" /> and 1980 shall not apply to international commercial arbitrations.</P>
    <P>The main emphasis of the Bill is on international commercial arbitration.  However, the opportunity is also being taken in section 17 to bring the domestic interest provisions contained in section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1954, into line with those contained in section 10 in respect of international arbitrations.  Section 34 of the 1954 Act provides that a sum directed to be paid by an arbitral award shall, unless the award otherwise directs, carry interest as from the date of the award at the same rate as a judgment debt.  The more detailed provisions of subsections (1) to (4) of the new section 34 are in general identical to those of section 10(1) to 10(4) which I described to the House earlier.</P>
    <P>The new section 34 deliberately excludes property arbitrations from its scope.  This is a very specialised category of arbitration and one where there is already a body of detailed legislative provisions. Accordingly, it is provided under subsection (7) that section 34 shall not apply to an arbitration conducted by a property arbitrator appointed under section 2 of the Property Values (Arbitration and Appeals) Act, 1960.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains an amendment to section 5 of the Arbitration Act, 1980, which obliges a court to stay proceedings commenced by any party to an arbitration agreement, or any person claiming through or under that party, in respect of any matter agreed to be referred to arbitration, unless the court is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is, <i>inter alia,</i> null and void.</P>

      <P>Before I left the Chamber I was speaking about section 18 of the Bill.  The purpose of the amendment contained in section 18, which has the support of the Director of Consumer Affairs, is to ensure that the provisions of section 5 of the 1980 Act do not preclude civil proceedings from being brought under the small claims procedure of the District Court, the establishment and operation of which is governed by statutory instrument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The small claims procedure covers consumer claims and disputes in respect of goods or services purchased, in which the amount of the claim does not exceed £600 and, while there is an application fee of £6, legal representation is usually not required.  The purpose of the new provision is to ensure that consumers can, if they wish, utilise the small claims procedure despite the fact that any <Col N="777" /> contract they may have with the service provider contains a term requiring that the dispute be dealt with by arbitration.  Such a term would be common in package holiday booking contracts, for example.</P>
    <P>The Bill which I have outlined follows representations from the International Financial Services Centre, the Law Society, the Bar Council and a number of specialists in the area of arbitration. Against that background, l would like to draw the attention of Senators to the fact that its introduction coincides with the welcome opening by the Bar Council, on 6 February 1998, of a major international arbitration centre in its new Law Library building in Church Street, Dublin. An international arbitration centre must have good quality facilities and logistical support in order to attract international arbitration business.</P>
    <P>The Bar Council's centre provides 10,000 square feet of purpose-built facilities for international arbitration including a total of 20 purpose-built arbitration rooms, translation services, video conferencing and state-of-the-art electronic services.  I understand that the council is marketing the centre abroad and that a large potential market in international commercial arbitration has been identified.</P>
    <P>I wish the Bar Council well in its efforts to attract such business to this country.  I am glad that I am in a position to put the legislation in place which should make that task easier.  The Bill is an example of the way in which the Government and business interests can work together to generate work for specialist services as well as ancillary work for the service industries.</P>
    <P>The Arbitration (International Commercial) Bill, 1997, will help launch the beginning of Ireland's development as a centre of excellence in the business of international commercial arbitration. This Bill is one of many published by my Department since I assumed office as Minister of State for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  In broad terms, the legislation published to date has addressed a wide range of criminal, civil, commercial and social matters.</P>
    <P>Both the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I, look forward to publishing equally wide ranging proposals in future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>This is a welcome and progressive Bill.  It brings Ireland into line with international law on commercial matters.  The Bill has been in preparation for a considerable time.  The <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group of 1993 which carried out research in this area deserves to be commended on its work.  I am pleased the Government has adopted the Model Law which was drafted by the United Nations. The fact that the law was prepared by an international body such as the UN means it is commendable legislation which has received virtually universal international approval.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that it took so long for many countries to adopt the Model Law.  Initially there was a reluctance to do so but in recent years about 25 countries have adopted it.  It is progressive legislation particularly in view of the fact that the world has become smaller from the point of view of commercial activity as a result of modern technology and communications.  It is important that there are common international standards, particularly with regard to multinational companies whose operations span not just countries in the EU but also the US, Australia and New Zealand.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Government on adopting the Model Law and on introducing a number of improvements to it, particularly with regard to arbitration awards and interest.  The original law did not cover those areas.  Concerns were raised about the constitutionality of this legislation.  Any legislation which comes before the Oireachtas is subject to constitutional examination and there is always the possibility that the constitutionality of a Bill will be tested before the courts.  The fact that the 1996 report of the review group on the Constitution did not envisage any constitutional difficulties in adopting the Model Law strengthens the position of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the matter on the record so all Whips can be aware of the problem. The business of the House should not be interrupted.</P>
      <P>The Bill is the result of representations from the International Financial Services Centre, the Law Society, the Bar Council and the international committee of the Chambers of Commerce in Ireland.  The International Financial Services Centre has been remarkably successful and is now one of the most commended and competitive such centres in the world.  However, the necessary legal framework was lacking and this legislation will fill that gap and, indeed, strengthen the position of all international companies in this country.</P>
      <P>The Bar Council is to be commended on being ahead of the posse in a sense by preparing and establishing a state of the art arbitration centre to deal with the arbitration process.  Any process that will avoid the legalities and technicalities entailed in court proceedings is welcome.  There is an arbitration process in place to deal with labour disputes and industrial relations but there was no arbitration facility to deal with commercial disputes between companies, regardless of the type of business activity they pursue.  The fact that such a facility is now in place strengthens Ireland's position to compete for business on the international market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Government has improved the Model Law also strengthens Ireland's ability to seek business abroad.  It is important that there is proper marketing of this facility.  The Bar Council might not be considered an expert group on marketing but the Minister for Enterprise, <Col N="780" /> Trade and Employment and the various State and semi-State agencies for which she is responsible are capable of marketing this facility.  It should be marketed in conjunction with the other services this country provides and I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace, will bring this issue to the attention of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This offers Ireland an opportunity to compete successfully on the international stage.</P>
    <P>England, for example, has not adopted the Model Law in its entirety but has adopted an abridged version.  The fact that Ireland has adopted a common international standard and has improved on it strengthens our ability to market for a substantial share of the global business in this area.</P>
    <P>One element of the legislation concerns me. The legislation is an ideal mechanism for arbitrating on disputes involving companies, multinationals and subsidiaries of multinationals. However, I would like to be assured that there are protections in cases involving disputes between an individual and a company.  How will an individual who has a concern with a company feature in this scenario?  There have been many discussions in relation to travel agencies and the disputes that have arisen over the years between customers and travel agents and the International Travel Agents' Association.  Take the example of a travel agent which has dealt with a parent travel agency as a subsidiary.  Will an individual consumer with a particular complaint have to accept the outcome of arbitration between a subsidiary and a major company as a <i>fait accompli?</i>  I appreciate that recourse to the High Court to facilitate particular issues in regard to the process of arbitration is inherent in this legislation. However, I would hope that any decision made by an arbitrator would not militate against an individual who might subsequently choose to take a private court action.  I hope the Minister will elaborate on that in her reply as I feel it would be necessary for people to have equal bargaining power; there is a danger that the scales could be heavily weighted in favour of multinationals.</P>
    <P>Overall, the Bill is a highly commendable one with which we on this side of the House have no difficulty.  It will strengthen Ireland's position and I believe we will succeed in securing a great deal of international business here as a result of it.  In the future Ireland will be seen as a centre where arbitration can be invoked in regard to international disputes.  It is particularly important that we would be up to speed on international commercial law as Ireland is very dependent on multinational companies, quite a number of which are located here.  The Bill is a step in the right direction; it improves the previous legislation of 1954 and 1980 and will help us as we approach the millennium. I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State for introducing this legislation and assure them of its speedy passage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this enabling legislation in regard to international trade law. Senator Taylor-Quinn raised a very interesting point in regard to Dublin becoming the epicentre of arbitration law in Europe and possibly the world.  I could envisage a scenario where the system initiated by the Bar Council could be used in a major commercial dispute between, for example, an American, New Zealand or east European company and a company from a country which recognises this model system.  We are merely following on the heels of the 25 countries which have already adopted this kind of system.</P>
      <P>The legal system which exists in Ireland and the UK is based to a large extent on the old common law one and differs to the European legal system which primarily follows on the Napoleonic code.  The American legal system seems to be a mixture of both of these systems.  In the area of commercial law it is very important that a recognisable, cohesive system be developed.  I hope that all EU member states, particularly the UK, will agree to this.  It does not make sense for our nearest neighbours to operate a different legal system to us.  For many years the Irish legal system was similar to that which operated in the UK, although deviations existed in Scotland and Wales.  Scotland has now accepted and adopted the model legal system and that is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>The possibility of Dublin becoming an epicentre for international arbitration disputes under this type of Model Law could have huge financial bonuses for Ireland, particularly in view of the forthcoming referendum.  If the referendum is passed, as I hope it will be, Ireland will be viewed as a very stable country in which international arbitration could occur.  That would be hugely beneficial to Dublin and other parts of the country. I welcome the Bar Council's initiative in setting up the international system.</P>
      <P>In regard to court involvement, it should be noted that the Model Law differs from our existing legislative regime.  Some changes will be made to the 1954 Act.  It is important to note also that recourse to the courts will only be utilised in exceptional cases and appeals must be made within three months.  Those are significant steps and should help to speed matters up.  One of the downsides of law, which I regularly encounter as a practitioner, relates to delays.  Delays in civil cases in the High and Supreme Courts can run to four, five and six years.  The fact that arbitration will be available under the Model Law system will doubtless improve our international commercial trading ability significantly as well as taking a workload away from the courts.</P>
      <P>It is also worth noting that interest can be awarded under the new system, similar to the Courts Act, 1981, where the interest rate was set at 8 per cent per annum.  That is a welcome provision which is not provided under existing arbitration law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to small disputes. A consumer now has the option to take <Col N="782" /> claims up to £600 to the Small Claims Court.  If someone books a holiday, for example, and problems arise with the travel agency, the person can make a speedy claim in the Small Claims Courts rather than going down the lengthy route of court litigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill, which has received the significant approval of the Irish Law Society, the Bar Council and others, is to be welcomed.  If we can take advantage of its provisions, it has the potential to bring us huge economic benefits.  I commend the Bill to the House.  All parties seem to be <i>ad idem</i> in their acceptance of it and I feel certain its effects will be very positive.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State and her senior colleague, the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, have introduced a large amount of legislation which is keeping us very busy.  The amount of work they are putting into introducing legislation must be recognised by the House and it is important to praise them.  Ministers are often condemned but I have been kept extremely busy as my party's spokesperson on Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  While the amount of legislation they have introduced might sometimes cause problems for my schedule, I recognise they are working extremely hard.  They have initiated a great deal of legislation in the Seanad, which recognises the importance of this House.  They are working full steam ahead to implement their programme, on which they must be complimented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister of State on the Bill and I note the work done by her predecessor, the former Minister and Deputy, Mervyn Taylor, on this legislation.  In regard to the comments made by Senator O'Donovan on the work rate of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is nice to be in a position to give a warm welcome to a Bill from that Department.</P>
      <P>This welcome Bill should prove to be an asset, particularly in the workings of the Irish Financial Services Centre.  My only concern, which was expressed by Senator Taylor-Quinn, is in regard to the rights of the consumer.  While we would like to believe large business and international companies would protect individual consumers, we have had far too many recent examples of where that has not happened.  It is our duty to ensure consumers, especially vulnerable individuals, are given every protection necessary to ensure their rights are upheld, particularly in their dealings with large international companies.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comments on the small claims procedure, to which other Senators referred.  I hope that provision reflects our desire to protect consumers.  I warmly welcome the Bill.  I have tabled some constructive amendments which I hope will improve the operation of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators Taylor-Quinn, O'Donovan and <Col N="783" /> O'Meara for their contributions to the debate, particularly for their consideration and support for the Bill.  The legislation puts in place an important framework so that the principal actors in relation to its subject matter can proceed to give meaningful effect to its provisions.  In this context, those actors are the practitioners in the field of international commercial arbitration.  I wish them well in their efforts to attract such arbitration business to this country.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, not surprising that this legislation is being debated at a time when Ireland is growing as an economy and where increasing emphasis is being placed on the need to sustain an enterprise environment.  We are a trade dependent country and in many ways international commercial arbitration business is a form of trade related activity.  This Bill, by establishing an arbitration regime which takes account of best modern practice, is playing its part in making Ireland an attractive venue for international commercial arbitration.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan recognised the need for a cohesive and focused approach to arbitration in the commercial field.  He mentioned the possibility of a financial spin off to Ireland.  I hope the Bill will result in significant inflows of capital to the country.  I appreciate Senator O'Meara's comments on the merits of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Taylor-Quinn raised an important question in regard to dealing with individuals as consumers.  I assure her this is outside the scope of the Model Law.  If an individual is dealing as a commercial entity the Model Law may be relevant, but only if the parties have agreed to arbitrate their differences.  Agreement is, after all, central to the arbitration process.</P>
      <P>While on its face the Bill appears somewhat technical in nature, the consensus which exists in the House regarding the merits of the legislation can only serve to give a message to those who might think of arbitrating their disputes in this jurisdiction that Ireland offers the type of supportive framework which can make us a real player in the international arbitration field.  It was heartening to note that those who spoke agreed with the basic thrust of the legislation and made very few critical comments.  As Senator Taylor-Quinn said, it is progressive legislation which deserves support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I referred in my opening contribution to our existing arbitration legislation, namely the Arbitration Acts of 1954 and 1980.  I do not intend to criticise that legislation which on the whole functions efficiently and provides the necessary supportive framework for the different types of arbitration which already take place on a regular basis in the State.  However, the Bill, which incorporates the UNCITRAL Model Law in our arbitration code, addresses the perception among practitioners that existing legislation makes it difficult to attract international commercial arbitration to this country because it is not based on the principle of minimal interference in the arbitration <Col N="784" /> process.  When the Bill is enacted it will counter any adverse perceptions which might exist concerning Ireland's suitability as a venue for international commercial arbitrations.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the debate for their clear appreciation of the fact that a modern arbitration law, for which the Bill provides, has the potential to attract valuable arbitration business to this State.  However, central to a successful arbitration are the skills which the arbitrator brings to bear upon his or her task. Ireland is fortunate that we can offer a very high level of legal professional services to those who wish to hold their arbitration in this country.  We also have a pool of highly experienced international arbitrators who are well placed to take advantage of the supportive framework which this Bill will create.  In addition, education in arbitration matters is a growth area and will ensure that many more individuals are able to develop their careers in this field.</P>
    <P>It is important to stress that international arbitration services are now offered in most major capital cities, as Senator O'Donovan said, as a result of the desire in the international trading community that disputes be resolved quickly, fairly, cheaply and in accordance with commonly agreed rules.  London, Paris, Geneva and Stockholm have capitalised on this growing market. London, a relatively recent entrant to the market, is estimated to generate £100 million annually from this international arbitration business.  As Senator O'Donovan said, we wish well people here who wish to proceed in this area.</P>
    <P>In 1996 over 1,300 requests for arbitration were received by the main international arbitration bodies.  It is noteworthy that many commercial arbitrations in Europe are conducted under the auspices of the international court of arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, which administers over 400 requests for arbitration each year.  In the period 1992-6 over 50 per cent of the parties arbitrating through the international court of arbitration were European. Where the parties agree to abide by ICC rules, which is not uncommon, the ICC court will often be involved in choosing a venue for the arbitration which it would regard as compatible with these rules.  Our new legislation has this compatability and it is my hope that Ireland can build upon those factors which, in combination, should provide an attractive environment for international arbitrations.  This is the point to which Senator Taylor-Quinn alluded when she mentioned the need for common rules in this area.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also, of course, an example of the willingness of Government to respond to the well argued and well founded case for legislative reform.  As Senator Taylor-Quinn said this morning, a number of bodies including the International Financial Services Centre, the Law Society, the Chartered Institute of Arbitrators Irish Branch and the Irish Committee for Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce have advocated the adoption by Ireland of <Col N="785" /> the UNCITRAL Model Law as our international arbitration code and this Bill is the outcome of this advocacy.</P>
    <P>In addition to the legal framework, other factors of an economic nature will also play a part in making Ireland an attractive venue for international commercial arbitrations.  We have a stable macro-economic climate capable of delivering high growth rates and we have a highly skilled, flexible and motivated workforce including, as I have indicated already, the expertise available in the area of arbitral practice.  We have a first class telecommunications and transport infrastructure and we are located on a hub between the US, Europe and the Middle and Far East.  There is also the exceptional value and quality we offer in our travel, accommodation and recreational facilities.  Furthermore the English language is, by and large, the language of international commerce and this is something which I hope we can exploit.  There is now the added element of this legislation which makes our international arbitration régime compatible with that of our trading partners.  All these factors, but most of all the Bill itself &mdash; containing as it does a single piece of legislation dealing comprehensively with international commercial arbitration &mdash; should prove a significant attraction for those wishing to arbitrate their dispute in a neutral venue which has legislation which operates to a familiar and valued set of rules.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their very positive remarks towards the legislation and I send my best wishes to the practitioners in this field in their efforts to attract arbitration business to the country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) Reference to commercial arbitration in the Model Law shall not include a case where a person deals as a consumer in the State.&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment is predicated on the idea that the Model Law has implications for consumer dealings and that such dealings would be within its scope.  This is not actually the case.  The Model Law is limited in its scope of application to international <Col N="786" /> commercial arbitration.  Within the Model Law itself, at Article 1, the term &ldquo;international&rdquo; is given a very wide meaning.  Central to the concept, however, is the idea of a place of business.  From this it can be seen that business dealings of a commercial nature, as distinct from dealings involving consumer interests, are what are at issue here.  It is also clear from the legislative history of the Model Law &mdash; and hence the reference in section 5 of the Bill to the documents of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law and its relevant working group &mdash; that certain relationships are not included in the term &ldquo;commercial&rdquo;.  In particular such relationships are instanced as including labour and employment disputes and ordinary consumer claims.</P>
      <P>I am sure those who will be using the Model Law will be fully conversant with the intricacies of its varied provisions and I am happy that the clarification which the Senators are seeking to introduce by way of this amendment is not one which requires to be stated expressly in the body of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1)(d), line 39, after &ldquo;interim&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or interlocutory&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is self-explanatory.  The insertion of the words &ldquo;or interlocutory&rdquo; extends the power of the High Court in order to grant interlocutory as well as interim injunctions under the Bill.  I expect the Minister to tell me that this is not necessary but it would be useful and would remove any doubt.</P>

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 2, I do not believe there is a need to amend section 7(1)(d) to provide a court with specific powers to grant interlocutory injunctions in support of international arbitration proceedings. That section provides for the court to grant an interim injunction in support of such proceedings. That provision is modelled on section 22 of the Arbitration Act, 1954, and a similar provision in the UK Arbitration Act, 1996.  I am not aware that the omission of a reference to interlocutory injunctions in the 1954 Act has caused any difficulties. I believe that the power to grant an interim injunction is an adequate means of preserving the <i>status quo</i> pending the outcome of an arbitration.  Indeed, there is a possibility that to expand the provision along the lines proposed by <Col N="787" /> the Senator might cast a doubt on orders that had already been made under the 1954 Act.  Accordingly, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 2 and the same logic applies to amendment No. 6.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 5, before section 9, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;9.  &mdash;Any person who, upon any examination upon oath or affirmation pursuant to an order of the High Court under section 7(1)(h), wilfully and corruptly gives false evidence or wilfully and corruptly swears or affirms anything which is false, shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction thereof, shall be liable to the penalties for wilful and corrupt perjury.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment seeks to insert a new section into the Bill which would impose a penalty for perjury before an arbitrator.  It would appear that there is no penalty under the Bill since section 7 of the 1954 Act does not apply.  The result is a serious gap in the legislation and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment which would strengthen it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The new section proposed by the Senator equates with that contained in the Arbitration Act, 1954, section 7, and, in effect, represents a sanction that can be applied if false evidence is given in the course of international commercial arbitration proceedings.  However, we do not propose to accept the amendment, principally on the grounds that we do not believe it appropriate to the legislation we are seeking to enact.  I have genuine misgivings as to whether, in the context of attracting international commercial arbitration business to this country, it is appropriate to introduce an amendment which speaks in terms of offences and penalties.  It will be for the arbitral tribunal to assess the weight of any evidence given in proceedings and to make the necessary determination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where false evidence is found to have been given this is a factor which would, undoubtedly, influence the findings of the arbitral tribunal either in terms of the final award it might make or perhaps in any order for costs which it might consider suitable.  Also, if the fact of giving false evidence were to be discovered subsequent to the making of the award it could be grounds for seeking to have the award set aside on the basis that it conflicts with public policy.  These practical considerations carry more than sufficient force to <Col N="788" /> outweigh the arguments advanced for putting an express penalties provision into the legislation.  I stress that the main purpose of the legislation is to attract international commercial arbitration business to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>It is for exactly that reason it is important to make this amendment to the Bill, otherwise we give the impression that our standards are low.  That is exactly the wrong impression to give to the international community. In her response, the Minister says this amendment might discourage international business. This suggests that we our standards of evidence are loose and I find the Minister's response disappointing.  It is not sufficient to say that a case could be reopened if it were later discovered that false evidence had been given.  We should examine how we are perceived internationally, particularly in the operation of our financial services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>My personal view is that perjury is more applicable to criminal than civil law. Not so long ago members of the Opposition argued the inappropriateness of the provision of perjury in the context of a Bill.  The law concerning perjury is seldom used in my experience and its introduction could do more harm than good. We should leave well enough alone as I am not sure when there was a case concerning perjury, which is very difficult to prove.  There was an attempt to bring perjury charges in 1989 in the context of the Betelgeuse disaster in Bantry bay. Eventually, after years, the proceedings against the three or four people charged with perjury fell flat.  Perjury is very difficult to prove and the penalties under existing legislation are very severe, with provisions for a lengthy term of imprisonment on conviction.  Its introduction might send out the wrong signals in an international context.</P>
      <P>I understand where the Senator is coming from but there are better and stronger arguments in favour of what the Minister is trying to achieve than introducing this penalty in the event of false evidence being given.  There are other provisions as outlined by the Minister and we should proceed with the Bill in its present format.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Evidence on oath is rare in arbitration.  My reluctance to accept the Senator's amendment is based on the pragmatic grounds that I do not think it is appropriate to make specific provisions for penalties in the legislation. Prosecutions for perjury are not numerous and it is our hope, following the passing of the legislation, that international commercial arbitrations carried out here will be numerous.  In such circumstances we do not wish to include provision in the legislation which might be used to our disadvantage.</P>
      <P>In commercial arbitration it is the sanctions with commercial impact that bite best.  In this context I am confident there are sufficient mechanisms available to act as a persuasive deterrent to the swearing of false evidence.</P>

      <P>In page 8, subsection (7)(b), line 16, after &ldquo;arbitral tribunal,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or acts in a professional capacity in connection with those proceedings,&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Section 12(7) of the Bill as drafted provides barristers, solicitors or persons holding an equivalent qualification obtained in another jurisdiction who appear before an arbitral tribunal with the same privileges and immunities as barristers and solicitors have in High Court proceedings.  The amendment would broaden the scope of subsection (7) so as to extend to barristers and solicitors those same privileges and immunities when acting in a professional capacity in connection with arbitral proceedings. Since this amendment was tabled on Committee Stage in the other House, its contents have been the subject of detailed consideration and the advice of the Attorney General in relation to the proposal has also been sought.</P>
      <P>The question of the liability of barristers and solicitors for professional negligence in relation to litigation is complex and was the subject of a report of the committee on court practice and procedure in 1971.  That report stated that the position then appeared to be that a barrister was immune from actions for damages for professional negligence when acting as an advocate in court, but that the position regarding that part of litigation consisting of advisory and preliminary work was in doubt.  Since then the position has, in part, probably been clarified to the extent that it is generally considered that if a barrister or solicitor allowed a claim to become statute barred due to a delay on his or her part there would be liability in negligence.  Nevertheless, the committee's report recommended that it would be preferable to have the general position clarified by court decisions in appropriate cases rather than attempting to define the position by statute. This remains a valid proposition.  It would not be appropriate to deal with this issue solely in the context of arbitration, and statutory intervention in the area of pre-trial work by barristers and solicitors is outside the scope of the Bill.  For this reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment would modify the Arbitration Act, 1954, which, together with the Arbitration Act, 1980, provides the current statutory framework within which arbitrations operate in the State.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with international commercial arbitrations. The intention, subject to the two amendments to the Arbitration Acts, 1954 and 1980, contained in sections 17 and 18 of the Bill, is to interfere as little as possible with the current statutory framework within which arbitrations operate.  On the whole these Acts function efficiently and provide the necessary supportive framework for the different types of arbitration which already take place on a regular basis in the State.</P>
      <P>A single legislative measure, focused on international arbitration and not burdened by too many add-ons related to domestic arbitration, is the best way to proceed at this time.  It is very much in our interests if the legislation can be seen as an instrument which is almost exclusively geared towards international concerns.  I am also reluctant to interfere in a substantial manner with existing legislation without first subjecting our domestic arbitration code to a thorough review to ensure it fully meets the concerns of professional bodies and society at large.  The fact that this process would take some time was another reason for the decision to advance speedily with this Bill in the international context.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be here today to debate this important issue.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the recent developments and future challenges in the banking system.</P>
      <P>At the time of independence in 1922 there already existed a well developed banking system carrying out business throughout the island.  At that time there was also a general agreement on the need for a distinctive currency and for some authority to issue it and be responsible for its integrity.  It was also accepted, however, that the new currency would have to command no less confidence than sterling which had been the currency of Ireland since 1826.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the upheavals of the time, the Government of the day was cautious about any innovations <Col N="792" /> that might run the risk of undermining the country's trade and business stability.  Accordingly, it was not until 1926 that the first moves in this direction occurred with the enactment of the Coinage Act, which authorised the Minister for Finance to issue coins of limited legal tender, and the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry into Banking and the Issue of Notes.</P>
    <P>The commission, in its final report in January 1927, recommended the adoption of fixed parity with sterling for the new Irish currency with the issue of legal tender notes managed and controlled by a currency commission.  The maintenance of the connection with sterling was based mainly on practical considerations, the principal of which was the dominant role the UK played in the new State's external trade, receiving 95 per cent of our exports and providing 80 per cent of our imports.  This link was maintained for almost 50 years until March 1979 when we finally went our separate ways.  The commission also considered whether a central bank should be established but concluded that this course was not recommended as an immediate expedient.  The Currency Act, 1927, gave legislative effect to these proposals and in September of that year the Currency Commission was established.</P>
    <P>In November 1934 the Minister for Finance appointed a Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit.  Four years later that commission recommended that the Currency Commission be replaced by a central bank with enhanced powers and functions.  The Government accepted this recommendation and set about preparing a Central Bank Bill which was eventually enacted in 1942.</P>
    <P>It was not until 1971 that the Central Bank was given responsibilities for the licensing and supervision of banks.  However, in the late 1980s the pace of development of the banking industry in Ireland increased sharply and the State was obliged not only to react to these developments but to provide the environment within which an efficient and effective banking industry could develop and to encourage and foster its growth. The Central Bank Act, 1989, subsequently provided for the extension of the bank's licensing and supervisory powers in respect of banking business, the introduction of a deposit protection scheme and the supervision by the Central Bank of certain institutions in the IFSC, futures and options and exchanges and moneybrokers.</P>
    <P>Subsequent years saw considerable changes in the regulatory environment both in Europe generally and in Ireland.  The remit of the Central Bank's supervisory functions was further extended to building societies, the TSB, unit trusts, ACC and ICC banks, investment intermediaries, stock exchanges, bureaux de change and payment systems.</P>
    <P>Arising from our membership of the European Union, much of our legislation in the field of financial services derives from European Law, and reflects, <i>inter alia,</i> the goal of completing a single, competitive, financial services market within the <Col N="793" /> Union.  As a consequence, significant changes have been made to Irish law in recent years which have had the effect of liberalising the whole area of financial services at both the wholesale and retail ends of the market.  These new laws reflected the changes and developments that were progressively taking place in the range and complexity of the financial products that the banks and indeed other financial institutions were offering to the public.</P>
    <P>We have come from a situation not so long ago where the regulatory environment in the area of financial services was, at best, light to a situation where our system of financial regulation is as comprehensive and efficient as anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Many of the provisions that brought about this change were introduced by way of primary legislation, which provided the opportunity for Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas to debate and discuss the issues to which all of these gave rise.</P>
    <P>In passing, Senators may wish to note that many of the more recent EU initiatives in the area of financial services received significant impetus during the Irish Presidency of the Union in 1996, and it is to the credit of all those involved that such considerable progress was made.  The Cross Border Credit Transfers Directive, which provides for the issue and settlement of cross-border credit transfers from one credit institution to another and includes a number of consumer protection measures, and the Investor Compensation Directive, which provides for investor compensation in respect of investment firms authorised under the Investment Services Directive, were both adopted following conciliation with the European Parliament at which Senator Avril Doyle presided.  Significant progress was achieved on several other dossiers in the financial services field.</P>
    <P>The base directives in relation to EU banking law are the First and Second Banking Directives. The 1992 European Communities (Licensing and Supervision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, the purpose of which was to give effect to the provisions of the Second Banking Directive, heralded the introduction of the &lsquo;EU passport&rsquo; in banking, whereby a credit institution established and licensed in any one member state may supply its services in any other part of the Union without barrier.  This single development has resulted in a degree of competition and liberalisation in banking which would not otherwise have been the case.  However, in Ireland, we have regarded such challenges as being accompanied by opportunities which we have done our best to exploit.  I am glad to say that rather than crumble under the weight of new competition, the Irish financial services sector has reacted in a most positive manner and indeed flourished in the new environment.</P>
    <P>The l990s have seen remarkable changes in the financial sector in Ireland, not least in the area of banking.  While these banks have been around for what appears to be an age, if we look at the manner <Col N="794" /> in which they have grown and expanded in the last ten years, we can see how much has changed in such a short space of time.  At the end of December 1988 there were 37 holders of bank licences in Ireland with total assets of some £25 billion.  At the end of 1997 there were 44 licence holders with total assets of some £125 billion.  The banking sector is one of Ireland's leading employers.  In 1996 total employment in the sector was 23,700 in the Republic, which represented a 20 per cent increase over 1990.  In the same year, banks between them spent more than £1.3 billion in the Irish economy.  Some £715 million of this went in the form of wages and related payments. Banks paid in excess of £530 million to the Exchequer over the same period through PAYE, PRSI, VAT, Corporation Profits Tax, the bank levy, and other taxes.  The combined contribution of banks to the Irish economy accounted for 4 per cent of the country's GNP of £36.98 billion in 1996.  Nowadays it has become commonplace to have Irish credit institutions involved in mergers and take-overs in other jurisdictions, something which would have been unthinkable not so very long ago.</P>
    <P>So much for the past, what of the future?  We are on the threshold of unprecedented change in the financial world, with the recent decision on EMU and the introduction of the euro.  Where do the banks stand in this brave new world?  We have seen over recent years how policies designed for EMU qualification have helped secure our exceptional economic performance.</P>
    <P>The challenge presented to us from 1 January 1999 is to ensure the best return for the economy and for employment from our membership of the euro zone and to deliver on the Government's commitment in its Action Programme for the Millennium to share the benefits of Ireland's EMU participation among all sectors of the work force.</P>
    <P>It will be evident that costs associated with the changeover to the euro, and their timing, will vary from company to company according to various factors, including the nature of the company's business.  The situation in the case of banks will be no different, although because of the nature of their business the effects will be more immediately and directly felt.  It should be borne in mind in this context that EMU should bring significant benefits to the Irish business sector as a whole. Furthermore, such benefits will be ongoing, while of their nature changeover costs will be once off.</P>
    <P>In the case of financial institutions, there will be an ongoing loss of revenues arising from the elimination of currency transaction costs and exchange rate differentials between EMU participants. However, this ongoing loss to the financial institutions will be an ongoing gain to business as well as consumers.  This should help boost business performance and in turn be of long-term benefit to financial institutions.  For that matter, it is a truism to say that in business every threat is an opportunity.  EMU will also bring new opportunities for the financial sector and a larger <Col N="795" /> marketplace in which institutions can do business. The introduction of the euro represents a step forward in terms of new products, customers and potential and should not be viewed as merely a threat to be overcome.</P>
    <P>Another issue facing the banking sector is the future position of the State banks.  As Senators might be aware, the Government has authorised the Minister for Finance to enter into consultations with the boards, management and staff of the State banks with a view to developing detailed proposals on the future structure and ownership of the banks in a way which would recognise the interests of all stakeholders, including the taxpayer.  The Minister is currently engaged in discussions with the various other stakeholders in this regard.  However, at this time no final decision has been made regarding a disposal of the State's interest in the banks.</P>
    <P>Another important issue facing all of industry, including banks, is the so-called millennium bug. I can advise Senators that a recent survey of 11 countries, including Ireland, found that while most believe that their banks will be year 2000 compliant, Ireland is among a small number of countries that actually has a year 2000 working group and that the Irish financial sector is relatively well advanced in its preparations for the new millennium.  I think it is fair to say that we now have in Ireland a mature and sophisticated financial services industry, providing an ever-increasing range of services in both the retail and wholesale markets.  This has been driven, above all, by the often dizzying pace of financial innovation internationally and facilitated by the contribution of the International Financial Services Centre to our financial infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps to state the obvious to say that retail financial services are central to the national economy in the widest sense.  Their role manifests itself in two ways &mdash; in a direct way as firms which are employers of Irish people and purchasers of Irish goods and services, and in their indirect role as the major providers of capital to the business and households, and also as investors in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>It is in the provision of capital for small businesses and consumers that retail financial services hold a unique position and can make a visible contribution to the betterment of our people and of the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years there has been an increasing focus on the area of consumer protection, both at EU and at national level.  While it is my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who has ministerial responsibility in this area, I am sure she will have no objection to my referring to the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which was the most obvious manifestation of this interest in Ireland. Specifically, the Act confers powers and duties on the Director for Consumer Affairs in the area of credit agreements with, among others, banks. Senators will be aware that one of the provisions <Col N="796" /> of the Act was the transfer of responsibility for bank charges from the Central Bank to the Director of Consumer Affairs.  Section 28 of the 1989 Central Bank Act provided a role for the Central Bank in the control of bank charges other than interest.  This section was repealed by the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, which introduced, in section 149, an analogous provision giving the Director of Consumer Affairs this responsibility. Also, section 149 introduced for the first time a fee to be paid by banks when applying for an increase in existing charges or for the imposition of any new charges.  The Central Bank still has a vital role to play, however, from the perspective of its functions as prudential regulator of credit institutions in relation to the protection of depositors' money.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, recent months have seen the emergence of a number of serious issues concerning the retail banking sector which have been a cause of serious concern, not only to the Government and Members of the Oireachtas but to the public at large.  These include reports of a sizable number of bogus non-resident accounts in certain banks in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As far as these are concerned, Senators will appreciate that the pursuit of particular tax cases is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, who must deal with them on a confidential basis.  I can say, however, that on various occasions in the past Revenue has discovered individual cases where false non-residence declarations had been made for the purpose of evading tax on deposit interest.  In all these cases, Revenue took action as regards the taxpayers involved by recovering any underpaid tax and imposing interest and penalties as appropriate.  I understand that Revenue also raised the matter generally with certain institutions concerned in the early 1990s and was given assurances that steps had been taken to ensure compliance with the legislative requirements.</P>
    <P>Before recent media reports of historic non-compliance in this area, Revenue had already commenced a review of the position generally.  Its work includes an examination of ongoing controls, procedures and liabilities and, where considered necessary, involves an examination of liabilities in past years.  The review covers all financial institutions and will take some time to complete.</P>
    <P>Another instance was allegations concerning the role of a bank in facilitating certain offshore investments.  In that case the Minister for Finance wrote to the Governor of the Central Bank drawing his attention to the possibility that these developments could have exchange control implications. This is being investigated by the Central Bank.  In his letter the Minister also requested the Governor to make a separate report on the implications, if any, for all aspects of banking supervision. In this regard, the Governor subsequently confirmed the Central Bank's inspection, which was conducted in its capacity of supervisor, had <Col N="797" /> concluded, but that he was precluded by law from revealing the findings.</P>
    <P>The Governor also reiterated comments made in a previous letter concerning the supervisory issues arising from the McCracken tribunal whereby he advised that the Board of the Central Bank was satisfied with its legal powers which are generally adequate to enable the bank to discharge satisfactorily its statutory functions.  The board keeps supervisory procedures under review and tries to ensure that these are in line with best international practice.  Nothing in the Central Bank's inquiries into this latter matter had led the Governor to change any of the conclusions he reported last November.</P>
    <P>More recently, there have been worrying allegations concerning the alleged application of charges on certain accounts over and above the standard charges which these accounts should have attracted.  The Central Bank is undertaking its own investigation into these new allegations. The Minister has asked the Governor whether, following the result of the Central Bank's current investigations, he would wish to revise any of his opinions regarding the adequacy of the legal framework for supervision set out in his earlier letters on the subject.  The Governor has indicated that when the Central Bank's current investigations are completed, he will write again.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that they predate the enactment of the Consumer Credit Act, 1995, all these allegations have resulted in an understandable public concern about certain of the activities of particular banks and about the banking industry generally.  It is with this concern in mind that the Minister decided to establish a working group of representatives from the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Central Bank, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General, the task of which is to investigate the law and practice governing the provision of financial services in Ireland and the impact this has on consumers.  In this regard, the group is undertaking an assessment of the laws relating both to the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs and to the role of the Central Bank, including the procedures used to give effect to these roles, with a view to identifying the impact of these on consumers and, in particular, to identify if there are gaps in consumer protection which need to be filled.  The group has also been asked to consider what steps may be required to increase the public understanding of the regulatory systems, including the manner of their implementation.  I understand the group hopes to complete its deliberations and draw up its report in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I should also add, on a more general basis, that the terms of reference of the Moriarty tribunal include a remit to make whatever broad recommendations the tribunal considers necessary or expedient for enhancing the role and performance of the Central Bank as regulator of the <Col N="798" /> banks and of the financial services sector generally.</P>
    <P>Irish banking has come a long way since the early days of the State, and especially in the last decade.  The State has always shown itself ready to respond to developments as they occur and to take the lead in circumstances where the need arises.  I can assure Senators that this continues to be the case now and will continue to be the case in the future.  I look forward to hearing the comments and views of the Senators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate on banking.  I suppose it would be impossible to conclude any debate about banking in Ireland at present without a reference to the recent allegations about the activities of one or two banks and the consequent public outcry.  Customers were being systematically overcharged and effectively duped by the bank in relation to their accounts.  We are awaiting the report of an investigation into these matter and any further comment at this stage would serve no purpose.</P>
      <P>The credibility and image of banking in Ireland has suffered as a result of these allegations.  There is now an onus on people who believe in the integrity of the banking system and the banking industry to make a contribution.  It is in all our interests and in the interests of the further economic and social development of this country that there is a healthy, progressive and competitive financial sector which is free from any suspicion of shady practices.  The fact that there has been one or two delinquents in the family is not sufficient reason to denigrate the entire branch of the family tree.</P>
      <P>We, as a nation, have a capacity to generalise about everything.  Let us face it, there are many people with a deep seated antipathy to the banks and many with genuine grievances.  I suppose this is inevitable given the size of the banking sector in Ireland.  At present, seven out of ten Irish adults have a bank account of one type or another.  There are 2.1 million current account holders and 4.4 million deposit accounts are held with the banks in this country.  With such a huge customer base, there will always be an element of disgruntled people and some bad decisions will be made and I am sure many mistakes were made.</P>
      <P>However, in the context of our overall economic development we must recognise the contribution which the banking industry has made to the totality of the commercial life of this nation. The growth in the economy equates fairly evenly with the growth in the banking sector.  If we go back to 1990, we see that the five clearing banks made £174 million after tax on an asset base of £39.1 billion.  In 1996-97 they made £669 million with total assets of £57.3 billion.  Today the media reported that Bank of Ireland's profit has increased to almost £500 billion.  I am open to correction on this figure because I did not here the complete report but I do know that Bank of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Ireland's profits have increased dramatically over the past year.</P>
    <P>Some people say these are exorbitant profits. If that is so, then is the growth in our GNP also exorbitant?  High economic growth rates and unprofitable banking industry are mutually incompatible.  If the five clearing banks continued to make profits of only £174 million on assets of £39.1 billion representing a return of 0.5 per cent in 1990 then we would have no Celtic tiger today.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of shareholders who also need and expect a return on their investments. We should remind ourselves that for each additional £10 added from profits to a bank's capital base it enables it to lend another £100 to customers.  As the Minister has said, this solvency ration is regulated strictly by the Central Bank. At present the Celtic tiger is sustained mainly by the banking industry.  The Celtic tiger has a voracious appetite for cash and, thankfully, there is a lot of it about right now.  The most recent Central Bank figures for Ireland for legal tender notes in circulation placed the amount at £2,100 million.  When one deducts a percentage from this for cash held in bank vaults, there is still over £500 for every man, woman and child on the island.  Unfortunately, every man, woman and child has not got £500 but this issue can be debated on another occasion.  The Government has borrowed in total £3.4 billion.  Lending to farmers, business and personal consumers up to mid-June last year stood at a high of £29.6 billion, an increase of 124 per cent over 1990 figures.  So no matter how much we dislike the idea of banks making huge profits they are an inevitable consequence of an expanding economy.  We should stop worrying about bank profits and concentrate more on the protection of customer interests and how the level of protection can be increased.</P>
    <P>Like every commercial sector there is consumer protection legislation concerning every aspect of lending and consumer credit.  The Consumer Credit Act, 1995, is major legislation and EU measures are also in force since 1995.  An EU directive on deposit guarantee schemes also gives protection to depositors.  While we may never have protection or legislation to deal with every eventuality that may arise due to an individual's decision to flout the law, there is a legal framework in place that demands compliance by financial institutions.  It covers the contents of agreements and the advertising of many types of consumer credit.  It also includes provision for the control of bank charges.  The Central Bank role is a different role and in view of the debacle at NIB many people believe that its powers are inadequate.  Voluntary codes of practice also exist to supplement the legal framework.  The following are examples: the banks' charter for personal customers and the banks' charter for small business customers spell out standards of good practice and service to which bank customers are entitled; the code of conduct for competition practices broadly requires banks to act fairly and <Col N="800" /> properly, to maintain high standards of integrity and professional practice and to be truthful and transparent.  The code of practice on transparency requires banks to have brochures detailing the principal bank charges available in all branches, to have posters containing this information on display and to issue press notices advising of tariff changes.  There is also the European code of best practice on card-based payment systems which limits the liability of a credit or ATM cardholder to a maximum of ECU 150 or approximately £120 punts in the event of loss or theft.  These are real provisions to protect the consumer.</P>
    <P>We must also be aware that there are consumer complaints procedures.  The public, like myself, until I began investigating this issue, were unaware that the consumer complaints procedures are quite extensive.  The banking sector is no different to any other business sector in terms of the errors which are sometimes inadvertently made in dealings with customers.  It is scarcely surprising that mistakes can happen within a system which processes millions of cash and non-cash transactions each year on behalf of its customers, but mistakes are bound to occur.  The overriding considerations are that such mistakes are kept to a minimum and that there are proper procedures in place to redress them as they arise. In reality the frequency of error in relation to the amount of business conducted is very small and all the banks have their internal complaints procedures in place.  If a person is dissatisfied with a bank's service or suspects a banking error has occurred then one should contact the relevant branch management in writing giving an exact and factual account of what happened.  If the response is unacceptable the matter should then be referred to the branch again with a statement to the effect that in the absence of a resolution the matter may be forwarded to the bank's regional or head office.  If there is no satisfactory outcome after communication with the branch a written complaint should be referred, including copies of the previous correspondence, to the customer relations department at the bank's head office.  Each bank has such a complaints department though its title may vary.</P>
    <P>Most complaints are resolved by a bank's internal complaints procedures.  Those which are not can be forwarded free of charge for independent investigation to the Ombudsman for the credit institutions.  His decision is binding on all the 37 or more banks belonging to the scheme, as well as the eight building societies and the other financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Provided a customer has first tried to resolve a problem with the local branch, the regional branch and head office, the Ombudsman for Credit Institutions can investigate that problem if it relates to a dispute arising on or after 1 October 1990 when the scheme commenced or, in the case of a limited company, after 1 October 1994, if it contains a claim for less than £30,000, if it concerns the provision or non-provision of services in the Republic of Ireland, if it comes from an <Col N="801" /> individual consumer or sole trader, a partnership or an unlimited company or if it comes from a limited company with an annual turnover of no more than £250,000.  Members of the public are not always aware that the Ombudsman offers services of that nature.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the net interest margin claimed by the banks.  This represents the difference between the average lending interest rate and the rate which banks pay on deposits and it affects personal borrowers with an A rate.  Competition for customer deposits is so intense and the variation in rates is so great that the effort by the banks to maintain a net margin of between 4 and 5 per cent means that small borrowers are being screwed.  A personal borrower with an overdraft is obliged to pay 12 per cent interest.  It is particularly difficult for young couples who have taken out a large mortgage to try to manage an overdraft at the same time. Families with big mortgages should be on the prime rate or the special charity rate for overdraft accommodation.  At present, the A rate is 6 per cent higher than the one month interbank rate. When we consider that at the end of August 1997 total personal borrowings from credit institutions amounted to £16.3 billion we can see that these borrowings account for a major proportion of the overall figure.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that Ireland's future lies within EMU.  We have negotiated the first two stages and the third stage &mdash; the euro &mdash; comes into effect on 1 January 1999.  The euro will replace our national currency and those of the other EU states which will participate in EMU.  For better or worse, our future lies in Europe.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I requested a debate on the banking system a number of weeks ago and I am glad the Leader provided time for it today.  I agree with the Minister of State that the banking system has served us well since the foundation of the State.  That system developed out of the Coinage Act, 1926, and its latest challenge will be our joining the euro with ten other countries.  It could be stated that the banking system is a success story and we must compliment the individuals and successive Governments responsible for this.</P>
      <P>We have arrived at the stage where we can stand alone.  It is extraordinary that we have decided to remove ourselves, in European terms, from sterling, the currency with which we began trading in 1926, which will stand alone outside the euro.  We have decided to move forward without sterling which is a sign of the strength of the financial institutions, the Government and the various components that comprise financial services in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the public are concerned about a number of important matters.  Since January, consumer confidence in the banking system has been breached.  It was with horror that people discovered &mdash; I compliment the RTÉ journalists who broke the story &mdash; that breaches of trust and illegal acts had occurred in the banking system <Col N="802" /> and that money had been stolen from customers. Had it not been for the efforts of the RTÉ journalists, these matters would not have come to light.</P>
    <P>I questioned the Governor of the Central Bank about this matter at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and I was not impressed with the level of information he made available to the committee.  In fact, he attempted to provide the least possible amount of information and frequently stated he was precluded by law from providing such information. The Central Bank and its Governor are the authorities responsible for licensing the commercial banks.  They have a responsibility to ensure that those to whom licences are given act within the terms of those licences.  When I asked the Governor of the Central Bank to state the circumstances in which someone would have their licence revoked in the event of a breach of the regulations, he failed to do so.  If I obtain a driving licence and I breach the law, I will lose that licence.  Likewise, if I obtain a licence from a local authority to haul certain material and I breach its terms, the licence will be revoked.</P>
    <P>As a public representative, I have been unable to ascertain the exact circumstances in which the Central Bank or its Governor have the power to revoke a commercial banking licence.  There is not enough transparency in that area.  If the Governor of the Central Bank is precluded by law from providing information, that law should be changed.  The Houses of the Oireachtas should be in a position to delve deeply into matters of this nature.  We must be confident that the activities of financial institutions are transparent and that the interests of the public will be protected.  As public representatives, we have a duty to ordinary citizens to ensure that their interests are protected.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the banks can state that they protected the interests of the public in the past, particularly in light of the evidence which has emerged in respect of breaches of trust. Thousands of bogus offshore accounts were put in place by the banks to avoid paying tax to the Government.  If a member of the public set up accounts of that kind they would be brought to court and sanctioned.  I have not seen anyone brought to court or any criminal proceedings brought concerning the matters uncovered by RTÉ journalists.  The public is of the opinion that white collar crime is rife and no one is being prosecuted. Who could blame them for thinking that, given the banks' activities over the years and the events brought into the public domain since last January?  One bank hyped up interest rates on accounts to increase profits in certain branches. Surely this was stealing.  If one steals money from one's neighbour one is likely to be brought to court, prosecuted, convicted and perhaps sent to jail.  I have not heard of anyone being prosecuted or brought to court concerning events in the banking system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="803" /> Not all the activities of banks falls into this category. I agree with Senator Caffrey that banks have served the country well in many instances. However, I disagree with him on one issue, namely, profits.  It is immoral for a bank to make £500 million profit in one year.  It should not happen. There is no need for a bank to make such profits.  Who is the cause of that profit and who is contributing to it?  Personal borrowers and consumers are paying massive interest rates, charges, referral fees and surcharges all of which contribute to the massive profits made by banks.  I am not satisfied that ordinary consumers are getting the deal to which they are entitled.  Banks are giving preferential treatment to certain people. There are different ratings favouring those who pose a lesser risk.  Banks are in business to make money and they will opt for customers who pose less risk.  However, should the majority of people &mdash; consumers with mortgages, overdrafts and term loans &mdash; be carrying the can for everyone else and making massive profits for the banks? That is what is happening.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that legislation has been enacted over the years to protect customers, particularly the Consumer Credit Act, 1995.  That was welcome legislation which offers opportunities for the public to obtain some redress.  I listened with interest to the Director of Consumer Affairs when he came before the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  He seemed to have a genuine interest in protecting customers <i>vis-a-vis</i> the banks.  However, I could not say the same for the Governor of the Central Bank.  He totally ignored the plight of customers and stated that they were not his responsibility.  Surely the Central Bank has some responsibility in this area and I am not happy with the level of secrecy attached to the bank.</P>
    <P>During March and April a decision was taken concerning an inspector.  Would the Minister indicate the current position as regards that inspector? There were calls in both Houses for the appointment of an inspector and the Minister indicated that she might do so in the case of at least one bank.</P>
    <P>I also find it disturbing that the Central Bank has taken so long to complete its investigation and to report.  A few days or a week should be sufficient for such a matter.  It should not take months as has happened.  Is there an intention that if the matter is delayed long enough the public and this House will forget about it and the matter will go away when some other issue hits the headlines so we never get to the bottom of this issue?  I do not want to see that happen.  I want to see this matter teased out to the last.  If blame is to be laid then so be it.  Let us name those who took decisions or ignored practices so that they can answer for the wrongs which have been done.  The public wants to know who did what, who took the decisions and who ignored the practices before its confidence in the banking system is restored.  People are not prepared to see <Col N="804" /> the matter glossed over to the extent that seems to be taking place given the attitude of the Governor of the Central Bank and the Minister of State.  In his statement the Minister of State said that he will write again when the investigation is concluded.  This is the second week of May.  These matters took place in the spring and it is past the time that we had answers.  The Government should state that we are going to get the answers now and the matter will not be put on the long finger.</P>
    <P>Ireland's entry into the single currency presents immense opportunities and challenges for the financial institutions.  We have a sound financial structure and Irish banks will compete successfully with other financial institutions in Europe. Hopefully, the euro will become a hard currency and compete favourably with the yen and the dollar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and I am glad to have this opportunity to speak in this debate.  The Minister of State has given us an interesting history of the banking system which reminds us of how much good has come from that system in the 70 years since independence.</P>
      <P>Senator Caffrey spoke eloquently about the public's concern at some of the events and business methods in the banking world.  Senator Finneran reminded us of some of the challenges facing the banks.  I want to look at some of the challenges facing the banking system and view current events from that perspective.</P>
      <P>From the beginning of next year Irish banks will not be acting in isolation.  They will be part of the euro zone referred to by the Minister of State.  They will share a currency and the same interest rates with ten other countries.  This means that they will be open to competition for deposits and loans from insitutions from most of Europe. This represents a major challenge because up to now Ireland has been under-banked.  That is not a normal word but it fits well.  The European area has been over-banked.  By under-banked I mean that banks may not have had much competition. As a result they have been used to operating on the highest margins available to any banks in the developed world.</P>
      <P>I am a great believer in competition.  I had the opportunity to nominate a topic for debate on Private Members' Time last year and I chose competition.  One of the benefits we will have in the future is more and more competition in every sphere of activity, not just in banking and State companies but in all sectors of the economy.  We will be more successful as a result of more competition and the public and consumers will benefit.  The high margins banks enjoyed were inflated and are now fast becoming a thing of the past.  In that lies the clue to the recent behaviour of many Irish banks, some of which has just come to light.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish banks were able to get their money extremely cheaply because most of their customers <Col N="805" /> were lazy.  The money they deposited with banks earned either tiny amounts of interest or none at all.  Banks lent that cheap money at the highest rate possible.  It is normal business practice to make as much profit as possible.  The difference between the rates at which they received and lent money was such that the lending margin of Irish banks was the envy of their colleagues worldwide.</P>
    <P>That changed in the past decade.  Companies became more sophisticated in how they handled their balances.  More importantly, the mass of ordinary account holders and depositors began to realise the value of the money in the run up to the devaluation of the punt in 1992.  Interest rates at the time increased to 14 per cent and people started to put their money to work, in many cases for the first time.  The high interest rates did not last long but the mindset of the public had been changed.  People no longer automatically left money in the bank, not thinking to make it work for them.  From then on, the days of cheap money for the banks were numbered.  The future held out a constantly dwindling lending margin as Ireland slowly came into line with countries with which we had been out of line previously.  We are about to witness the last phase of this next year with the arrival of the euro.</P>
    <P>The banks' problem has been an opportunity for customers.  Loans have become cheaper and the gap between deposit and lending rates has narrowed, although overall deposit rates have decreased.  However, this reduction in the lending margin has not been completely good news for the customers because it has triggered a massive effort by banks to make money out of their customers by other means.  Banks have created a wide variety of what are called new financial products, all of which have one thing in common &mdash; they are very expensive.  Bank staff are intensively trained in the art of what is called cross selling, which is pushing additional products at existing customers.  Staff are rewarded and promoted on their ability to do this effectively.  This is one of the reasons people's trust in banks has been undermined over the past ten years and even before the recent revelations of overcharging of customers.  Banks are a little like politicians &mdash; no one likes them very much.  In their pursuit of profit to replace the wide lending margins they have lost, banks have undermined their customers' trust by hard sell techniques.</P>
    <P>I first came across this in 1971 when I went to the bank seeking a loan for a new business venture. I was told by the manager that circumstances had changed and that I had to go to a merchant bank.  When I applied to it for a loan, it indulged in hard sell and although it eventually agreed to lend me the money, it would not agree to lend it in overdraft form but rather in three different tranches, one of which would be in return for shares in my company.  I said they did not understand and that I did not want to sell shares in the company, but they said that was the deal.  I was fortunate that there was competition <Col N="806" /> at the time and that I was able to apply to another bank.  This is an example of cross selling, of managing to sell a number of different products to existing customers.</P>
    <P>Fewer customers believe banks are acting in their best interests.  They are slowly becoming aware that banks' priority is to make money out of them.  Customers are becoming increasingly sceptical of the notion that a bank acts in the customer's interest when it gives financial advice. That is a dramatic change from when we implicitly trusted banks.  This trend is disastrous in terms of banks' future.  Nothing can be more costly, foolhardy and dangerous to a business than to throw away customers' trust.  However, this is what the sophisticated marketing techniques of banks have been doing.  They are destroying trust and loyalty and creating huge doubts in customers' minds.  That is dangerous for any business.  However, I welcome this trend in the national interest, not just because customers will get a better deal, important as that is, but because it creates an increasing and welcome scepticism about banks.  This may result in fewer customers being encouraged to borrow recklessly. Banks cannot be relied upon to restrain themselves in this regard and this is a universal phenomenon of banking.</P>
    <P>All banking problems which have occurred around the world in the past 20 years can be traced to reckless lending, which is linked to reckless borrowing.  International banks poured money into South America in the 1970s which created a massive bubble because the lenders had so little interest in the quality of investment they were funding.  The bubble inevitably burst.  The same occurred more than once in Mexico and it also happened in America in the 1980s when savings and loans associations made billions of dollars of reckless loans safe in the knowledge the United States Government would bail them out if things went wrong, which it inevitably did.  This happened more recently in Asia when international banks and other investors were prepared to pour money into situations which any school boy could see were dodgy but which the lenders could not see because they were mesmerised by the myth of what was called the Asian tiger.  History repeatedly tells us that banks will lend as long as there are people to take the money from them.  The ability of the lender to repay or of the investment to become viable are secondary issues when credit is plentiful and competition among banks is intense.</P>
    <P>If one speaks to people about banks, the complaint one often hears is that they will not lend the customer the money they want.  The real danger which the problems I have outlined should teach is that banks lend when they should not.  The message for individuals and the national economy is <i>caveat emptor</i>&mdash; let the buyer beware.  Banks will lend irresponsibly if they get a chance to lend.  They are certainly doing so as regards property and no one can doubt that.  It must be remembered that up to a few years ago <Col N="807" /> banks were not in the house lending business. However, they became involved and are now engaged in a savage war for market share with the building societies.  In this war the customers' interests come last, although most people are happy for the moment with the cheaper and more generous mortgages they can obtain.  However, how many banks are reminding their customers that interest rates can increase as well as decrease and that they should enter into 30 year commitments only on the most careful terms and with their eyes open and their homework done? However, not many banks remind their customers of that because they are afraid of losing the business to a competitor.</P>
    <P>I am an enthusiast for competition and I welcome it, but we must realise that in this case it creates a more dangerous situation for customers who have to look out for themselves.  If it does nothing else, this debate may encourage customers to put manners on the banks by shopping around for financial services and, from next year, by shopping around in a wider and easier way than we have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Customers may stop regarding banks as impartial advisers and instead begin to regard them as hustlers who are out to make as much as they can.  Banks should not be shy about saying that is the business they have been in for many years. For the first time, however, customers are beginning to realise that banks are not impartial advisers, but people who are out to make money. That is what they are there for, of course, and let us not decry that.  Let us recognise it, however, and let us encourage those bank customers to see if they can get a better deal somewhere else.  That is in the interests of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The future will present challenges to the Irish banks and it is by no means certain that all of them can survive in their present form or ownership. The real challenges of the future, however, are for bank customers who will need to be more sophisticated, careful and wary than in the past.</P>
    <P>To the extent that recent events may encourage customers in that direction we may regard them as a favourable development.  We are entering a new world and the banking system will find it difficult to see the final score.  In America they have a saying to remind themselves the game isn't over.  Allow me to quote some more Latin &ldquo;<i>Obesa non iam cantava</i>&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The fat lady hasn't sung yet&rdquo;</P>

      <P>This is a controversial issue at the moment and, given the fact that our confidence <Col N="808" /> has been undermined in the wider domain, it is entirely worthy of a debate to allay the fears in the public arena.  The Minister has outlined the history of the banking system which, I agree, has served the country well.  The regulations in force were acknowledged by the financial institutions over the years but we crossed the threshold of change in the early 1990s.  We are now about to join the EMU and will have a single European currency.  That has led to an increase in the number of banking institutions operating here.</P>
      <P>We are debating this controversial subject because of allegations in the public domain, yet nothing has been proven.  Nevertheless, they will undermine the confidence of consumers, people like us who are dealing with the banking system. Of late, we have heard of huge profits the banks are making at the expense of consumers through interest charges.</P>
      <P>We have also heard about big investors who because they have expertise and knowledge behind them can find ways of avoiding taxes and interest rate charges.  However, PAYE workers have no hope and are dependent on the trust and confidence that did exist in our banking system. I hope it will exist again when the air has been cleared.</P>
      <P>We are in a transition stage, moving into a common European way of thinking.  There is such pace out there that PAYE consumers cannot go to a bank to discuss a small deposit account or overdraft as a previous generation might have done.  Nowadays there are such variations in people's overdrafts, mortgages, investments and deposits that it is mindboggling when one seeks information from a bank.</P>
      <P>When one received one's statement one always trusted that the balance belonged to the customer. That trust meant one did not have to fine-comb the details.  In examining bank statements now, however, customers do not always know what to look for.  It never came out in the open that customers should watch out for bank charges because they did not know what the charges were for and they were never really explained.  People trusted their bank managers and the service the banks provided but suddenly we have become ill at ease with our money.  We have to because we work hard for our money.  We want to get the best return for it so we call on the banks to reassure that confidence, to be transparent and to have standards of procedure so that consumers can understand what bank managers tell us.  Bank officials should use consumer-friendly language and not banking jargon.</P>
      <P>I am able to question that sort of jargon but how many others can?  They may say &ldquo;Yes, sir&rdquo; because they do not have the confidence to talk to a bank manager or his officials.  Bankers and their staff should give clear material instructions or directions to their customers in ordinary simple English.  If I invest £100 I want to know how much I will receive in return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a bank official was explaining a particular unit of investment to me and I told him I <Col N="809" /> did not understand what he was talking about.  I asked him to explain by example but he could not do so and was ill at ease despite having the technical knowledge.  He did not make me feel at ease in his office and I was unable to think of questions that might be important to me.  If I felt uneasy, how many others would feel ill at ease in dealing with banks about interest charges, reading their statements and how to obtain advice?</P>
    <P>The banks have gone through a bad time recently but only one or two banks are giving them all a bad name.  Most banks I know of, and their staff, are excellent.  However, it is the old story; one bad apple has brought about this debate to highlight the matter and to demonstrate that we are concerned about consumers.  We are asking the banks and other financial institutions to reassure their customers concerning investment charges.  If one has money on deposit the banks will suggest how one should invest it but they never talk about the charges for setting up the account.  They do not come clean.</P>
    <P>This is about transparency, standards of service, understanding the system of charges, reassurance and getting the banks to rebuild the confidence this country had in their services for many decades.  The Government is doing its job. It has directed the Director of Consumer Affairs and the tribunal to investigate the allegations. This debate is a welcome opportunity to reassure the public that we are on their side and that we will ensure that the country has a banking system that is second to none, as was the case.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the PAYE worker is not caught and that banks should not make big profits at their expense while large investors are unaffected.  I support the PAYE sector in this regard, the person who wishes to borrow and to have a safe deposit rate and who does not seek to have large scale investments.  They are the people I stand for and they are the people I hope to reassure and whose confidence in the banks I wish to rebuild.  The Government is behind me in this regard and it will see to it that the confidence we always had in our banking system will return.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Ormonde on her speech which was an impassioned and clear plea on behalf of the consumer.  I have rarely heard such a plea put so well or so clearly in such a short time.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to allay the fears of the public about the banks as Senator Ormonde sought to do.  She also intended to allay the fears that the Government is doing nothing about the problem. I prefer to exacerbate the public's fears by pouring a little fuel on the flames.  What has been happening in Irish banks is not, as Senator Ormonde maintained, a case of one bad apple.  One will probably find that all banks have been using these practices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Senator was probably referring to National Irish Bank but Allied Irish Banks and Bank of <Col N="810" /> Ireland have also been exposed as having facilitated tax evasion.  A spokesman from one of those banks was quoted as saying that it was one of the worst kept secrets in Ireland at the time. That is tantamount to saying: &ldquo;we did it, but everybody was at it so it was all right&rdquo;.  The Government has been silent in the face of this provocation, the brazen admission that the law was being broken.  I cannot understand why the major banks, which have admitted to these actions, are not being prosecuted.  Why has action not been taken in that regard?  Of course, action should have been taken against National Irish Bank.  It has, and the bank has made a dog's dinner of its defence by not publishing its report.</P>
    <P>However, the other banks deserve equal investigation. What we are dealing with is, in the words of Lord Denning, &ldquo;an appalling vista&rdquo;.  Every bank in the State's retail banking sector appears, on the evidence available, to have been corrupt to some extent.  That might be unfair to some of the smaller banks.  I withdraw the remark because there is no evidence for it.  I apologise.  However, the larger banks have been carrying out these practices and it is likely that smaller banks are doing it as well.</P>
    <P>Can we, as consumers, trust our banks any longer?  No. Senator Ormonde virtually said as much.  We should realise that every pound we put in the bank is a prisoner of the bank.  The bank regards it as its money to do what it can with it to make money for its shareholders.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The banks do not, and never have pretended to, act on behalf of their consumers.  Consumers, or customers as they call them, are the people they exploit on behalf of their shareholders.  There is nothing wrong with that, it is the pursuit of profit.</P>
    <P>The problem is that the banks have demonstrated they are unfit to carry the trust of their consumers.  They have exploited it to an extent which is unacceptable and we do not have enough safeguards, regulations or regulators on the banks in this sphere.  One need only look at deposit interest rates as against overdraft rates.  If a person goes to the bank with £200 or £300, he or she will get about 0.75 per cent interest per annum. It is laughable.  However, the bank will lend that amount of money at 11 per cent interest.</P>
    <P>Today the Bank of Ireland announced record profits of £530 million for last year.  That is the result of having the highest margins in Europe and they have those margins because we allow it.  I am a free marketeer and believe in private enterprise, profit and shareholder interest. However, there are times when those who exploit their consumers, the small depositors, to such a degree that they must and should be regulated properly.  It is criminal that people with small amounts of money should be so blatantly exploited.  If one has a few thousand pounds the interest rate goes up but the small depositor <Col N="811" /> inevitably suffers at the hands of the banks.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>There is an especially bad situation in Ireland. Our two major banks are far too powerful.  I was disturbed to read on Aertel that the chief executive of the Bank of Ireland said that Bank of Ireland wishes to buy the ICC from the Government when it is put up for sale.  Is the Government willing to sell the ICC to the Bank of Ireland or AIB?  These banks are already too big and powerful.</P>
    <P>Bank of Ireland bought New Ireland Assurance, the second largest insurance company in the country.  It has its own Lifetime Insurance division and it owns the biggest stockbroking company in Ireland.  It also runs the biggest asset management company in Ireland, it has the biggest number of retail branches, the biggest number of corporate accounts and the biggest corporate finance department.  AIB matches Bank of Ireland in many ways by having the same type of powerful and large divisions.  What chance has the ordinary person against such a bank if it is behaving in a disgraceful manner, as we have seen in both cases?  He or she has no chance.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider ensuring that neither of the major banks buys the ICC thereby giving them even further dominance in the market? That is what will happen.  The ICC is a rather meaningless bank in so far as it does not matter much.  However, it has a niche market and if the Bank of Ireland is allowed to buy it, it will then capture that niche market.  One can be certain that, as it becomes more powerful, the people in that niche market will be abused by the Bank of Ireland as it has abused other customers in the past.  That is the real danger we face.</P>
    <P>I wish to dwell a little on some of the issues Senator Quinn raised.  There is a case for the Government carrying out a thorough examination of all lending institutions.  How much of the money loaned by the lending institutions has directly led to the rise in property prices?  I do not know the answer to that and the Bacon report did not come up with an answer to it either.  I suspect that banks are considering the value of properties rather than the incomes of individuals and are lending x per cent of a property's value regardless of the income level involved.  In that way, the bank is protected by the asset but the individual is exploited by having an inadequate income.</P>
    <P>The probable effects of a recession in the property and other markets are obvious; the banks will be protected but individuals will not because the banks will not have loaned too little, as business people sometimes complain they do, but far too much.  Individuals will not be able to pay their mortgages as they will be out of work or interest rates will have increased and the banks will be forced to sell the assets.  The banks will not care as long as they are protected.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> I am a champion of shareholders' involvement in companies but Irish banks have betrayed the trust of the Irish people and the Government. They have been exposed in recent times as being unfit to regulate their own affairs.  I do not believe it is adequate for the Minister to send in an investigator in the case of individual banks such as the NIB when we have evidence that worse offences have occurred in the major banks.  The Government should set up an open public inquiry into what is occurring in the banking system.  Irish banks have proved themselves to be dishonest and untrustworthy.</P>

      <P>The manner in which banking has been conducted in the recent past has not been satisfactory.  However, it would be wrong to assume that this is something new.  There is a certain nostalgia for what tend to be regarded as the superior banking practices of the past when one went into one's local friendly bank manager to look for money and the manager had a great deal of discretion as to the amount of money he could allocate.  Although a close relationship between manager and client may be desirable, it would be naive to say that banks did not operate in an equally commercial manner then to that in which they operate nowadays.</P>
      <P>There appears to be a presumption abroad that banks are philanthropic institutions; they are not and should not be seen to be such.  Banks are hard nosed commercial institutions, a fact which has been responsible for their success and much of the recent success of our economy.  I recall tales being told of farmers' widows with young children approaching banks to seek extra facilities to tide them over after their husbands' deaths and being reduced to tears.  In some instances, nostalgia for the past is badly misplaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The banks should be conscious of the fact that they are major beneficiaries of the changes occurring in regard to corporation tax which is due to decrease from 32 per cent to 12.5 per cent over the next five years.  Banks should behave as good corporate citizens and it is up to the regulators to ensure they do so.  The regulatory mechanisms which exist, or the determination to enforce a particular degree of regulation, are suspect. Those of us who are Members of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service would be confirmed in that view as a result of our discussions with the Governor of the Central Bank, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Bankers' Federation and the Revenue Commissioners.  It seems to be very much a case of passing the parcel, although the Director of Consumer probably <Col N="813" /> plays the greatest role in terms of protecting consumers in regard to the activities of banks.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on the issue of competition and the degree to which it exists within the sector. Unquestionably, until the recent past and prior to the Single Market, little competition existed between the banks.  I had the experience of banking in England at one stage with, I should hasten to add, the consent of the Central Bank under the exchange control regulations.  If one walked down the high street of any English town one could go into each of five or six different banks, present the same proposal to each of them and receive a different deal in each case.  That struck me forcibly. At that time, such a facility did not exist here other than for customers with large amounts on deposit who could dictate their own terms.</P>
    <P>In regard to the success of farming in the 1960s and 1970s, banks loaned money on an asset basis rather than on the basis of profitability projections. Banks and farmers alike got into serious trouble at a certain stage when they recognised it was not quite so easy to realise assets in a Domesday situation.  One of the great achievements of that period was the setting up of the ACC which provided funds to farmers at a time when it was difficult to secure them from the mainstream banking section.</P>
    <P>The issue of the NIB revelations and their effect on the stability of the sector has been raised and the utmost necessity for confidence in the sector has been outlined.  However, it could be inferred that the degree of rigour involved in the pursuit of impropriety should be played down as it could otherwise have a detrimental effect on stability in the sector.  That is totally erroneous; it is akin to saying that the olive oil sector should not be investigated because the Mafia is involved in it and the whole sector could be destabilised. Such an argument is simply not tenable.</P>
    <P>EMU will commence in seven months' time, exchange rates will be locked and Ireland will become a participant in the European system of central banks.  The Governor of the Central Bank will become a director of the European Central Bank.  These events will result in the release of resources in our own Central Bank which will serve to increase and improve the regulatory procedures conducted by it in order that auditing can be more thorough and more resources can be devoted to it.  Our representative on the European Central Bank must have the very best economic, financial and other information available to him, not just in respect of the Irish economy but also the global economy.  The quality of the information available to that individual will determine whether we can make an effective input into the European Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The question of the future of State banks, such as ACC, ICC and TSB, was raised.  I agree with Senator Ross that it would be wrong for one of the major banking groups to acquire them.  I am sure the Competition Authority would look very <Col N="814" /> closely at such a proposal and I hope it would not accept it.  However, disposing of the State banks could release in the order of £800 million which could go towards funding Luas or some other large capital projects in the State.  If money were raised from those quarters it would be used for capital purposes rather than day to day spending. The pressure to use it for day to day spending is not as great as it would have been a few years ago.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is to be commended on the way in which she has investigated several banks using her powers under the Companies Act.  However, it would probably be preferable if those powers rested with the Central Bank, for example.  In other words, it should not be left just to the Tánaiste to intervene under the Companies Act to appoint inspectors and so on.  There might be other ways in which these matters could be initiated and pursued.  At present, she has more than six inquiries in train within the sector.  The question of offshore accounts and the Ansbacher accounts are a matter for the tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is utterly wrong that the banks would connive with clients, not to avoid tax but to evade it. That is a serious matter which is unacceptable. Compliant taxpayers are picking up the bill for wealthy individuals who would be liable to significant levels of tax if they were not shielded by some of these devices.  People with large sums of money will employ the very best technical accountancy and legal information and will use the law to their advantage.  However, it is an entirely different matter to do this illegally, which appears to have been done with the help of certain banks, or at least certain bank officials.  In general, the inquiries would not be needed if the regulator was doing his job properly.  One also looks to the Revenue Commissioners in this area.</P>
    <P>When the Bankers Federation appeared before the Committee on Finance and Public Services it seemed it did not see it as its role to blow the whistle.  This returns to the question of <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>&mdash; who polices the policemen. It appears the Bankers Federation does not see its role as one of a whistle blower within the sector. In those circumstances the State must be vigilant and ensure the proper procedures are in place to deal with these issues.  That is probably best done through proper powers for the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank made the point that the confidentiality aspect was very important, the inference being that if it found tax irregularities it could not refer them to the Revenue Commissioners, which is wrong.  Any irregularities should be reported.  The rules of confidentiality can only go so far because if one pursues that argument to its logical conclusion one finally arrives at the point where the Nazi gold in Swiss banks becomes a routine administrative matter and not one of a broader moral question.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="815" /> I hope the banking sector will make its proper contribution to the welfare of our citizens and to the country's economy and to do so within the law.</P>

      <P>This is a very serious matter.  The unthinkable has happened in our financial services sector with the appalling vista of the banks robbing their customers.  On one hand they are defrauding the public of money handed into their trust and, on the other hand, assisting big time investors to evade and avoid tax.  The banks have been breaking the law for years.  Although the finger has been pointed at one or two banks in particular, we hear this is happening on a wide scale.  This is a disgraceful scandal which no one ever thought could happen.</P>
      <P>People were told over the years they should not keep their money under their mattresses.  When some crimes took place in rural areas there was a huge campaign to ensure elderly people deposited their money in safe and trustworthy places such as banks and building societies.  Little did we think that money was at as much risk in the banks as it was under the mattress.  They also did not earn much interest from the banks.</P>
      <P>We are all shocked this could happen and that banks would put profit before their small investors. Many NIB managers who colluded with the levying of dishonest charges were given bonuses for the extra money they brought into the bank's coffers.  This raises questions about restoring the public's trust in banks in the future.</P>
      <P>The State has in many ways put money back into the hands of the banks by reducing corporation tax, while they have been illegally taking money from many citizens through exorbitant, unjust and illegal charges.  I firmly believe we should have a full scale, broad ranging inquiry into the banks, building societies, credit institutions and financial service providers.  The range of malpractice happening across the board seems to be far wider than we first thought.  The imposition of illegal fees, the banks' collusion in offshore investment and the processing of non resident accounts through our financial services institutions demands that we, as elected representatives and legislators, take whatever action is necessary to ensure trust is restored to the banking and financial services.  We must put structures in place to ensure adequate regulation and supervision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been happy with the response of the Governor of the Central Bank to the McCracken report.  He does not see a need for extra legal regulatory or licensing requirements.  How can he say that when we can see that the Central Bank was not providing adequate regulation and supervision? <Col N="816" /> Because the banking institutions cover a wide range of important functions we must have equally trustworthy regulatory and supervisory mechanisms.  We can no longer have confidence in our banks.</P>
    <P>Thank God, we have not sold the State banks, ACC, ICC and the TSB.  If ownership of these banks is transferred to private banks we will do the people no service.  Such an action would merely strengthen an existing monopoly.  Our first requirement must be to protect the customer and the taxpayer.  We must ensure adequate competition. NIB looked seriously at the possibility of buying a State bank.  Thankfully, that did not happen. We need the State banks as an alternative, competitive element in banking because, unlike the private banking sector, there has been no scandal there.</P>
    <P>Whatever the future holds, there will be difficulties ahead.  The banks no doubt made large profits from currency exchange.  We have all heard that if one travels throughout Europe with £100 in one's pocket and changes currency in each country one will be left with only £50 at the end of the journey.  That will soon end.  I hope the new European Central Bank will exercise wider regulatory powers both in the member states and globally.  That positive result will, I hope, come fro the introduction of the single currency.</P>
    <P>We need to regain trust in the banking system. That system is built on trust and confidence and it has been undermined.  We must also regain trust in the supervisory and regulatory system because that equally has been undermined and we need to look again at the question of licensing financial institutions.  What bodies should be entitled to hold licences?  There are people who should now be in prison because of some banking practices.</P>

      <P>In such circumstances how can it be said that the corporate bodies which supported those practices should still be licensed to operate? Such questions must be raised and the way to raise and answer them is by summoning a full inquiry into the financial services.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Costello for sharing time with me.  The Labour Party Members have little enough time and I appreciate his sharing what little time he has.</P>
      <P>Ordinary people are astonished at the blasé responses of the various State institutions to the appalling behaviour of the banks.  They have been forced by public outrage to begin to take action now, but our banks have suffered from a malaise for a long time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are among the most appalling employers in the State.  At the height of the recession in the 1980s they introduced a new grade of low paid worker in an endeavour to reduce costs.  They thereby created a group of people who were poorly trained, poorly motivated, poorly paid and <Col N="817" /> with understandably poor loyalty to the institution that employed them.  They have put enormous pressures on their middle ranking management. Anyone I know who works in the banking system is looking forward to retiring at the youngest possible age.  These pressures are not the result of an increasingly competitive market but rather of the extraordinary expectations of senior management as to their bank's appropriate level of profitability.</P>
    <P>It requires very little skill to make a lot of money from a monopoly which can write its own costs.  Not to make enormous amounts of money in a non-competitive monopoly would represent an extraordinary level of incompetence.  Banks have never competed on the basis of price and they never will until they are forced to do so.  A classic, although not very significant, example of this non-competitiveness is the interest rate charged on credit card balances.  In real terms this rate is approximately 21 per cent.  A back street money lender would be arrested if he tried to charge such a rate of interest.</P>
    <P>These people award themselves scandalous salaries. A director of any of our major banks regards himself or herself as worthy of an income twice or three times that of the Taoiseach.  Do they hold responsibilities or take risks which justify that level of reward?  We must remember how these salaries are fixed.  They are agreed by the shareholders at annual general meetings.  Any shareholder who objects will be outvoted by the big institutional votes.  This is because the institutional shareholders will be other financial institutions who want to make sure that they, in turn, are entitled to pay themselves the telephone number salaries they believe are consistent with their offices.  These are people who take no risk, do not invest their own personal resources and yet will make enormous sums out of the irresponsible decision of the Minister for Finance to reduce capital gains tax.  This will enable holders of share options, which they do not buy in a competitive market and which involve no risk to themselves, to make enormous further profit.</P>
    <P>All of this is regulated by the Central Bank which lectures everyone else about restraint and responsibility but which sat back and ignored the greed of the banking sector. This whole rotten quasi-monopoly must be investigated from top to bottom with real market economics and competition introduced.  This is what they are afraid of and avoid, something the Central Bank has allowed them do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">

      <P>The most recent development in banking has been the loss of confidence in the system due to the hammering it has taken over the past four months in relation to the activities of one bank in particular.  It would be very easy to speak about the events relating to this bank and indulge in prejudices.  We must concentrate, however, on establishing the facts and await the outcome of the investigations being carried out <Col N="818" /> by the inspector appointed by the High Court, the Fraud Squad, the Director of Consumer Affairs, the Central Bank and the internal NIB report which I understand is available since yesterday and which hopefully will be made available to the public.</P>
      <P>Banks have relied entirely on trust between them and their customers.  We have built up fantastic confidence in our banking system over the years, and this is reflected in the IFSC.  It is vital, therefore, that we know the results of the ongoing investigations as soon as possible so that public confidence in our clearing banks can be restored.</P>
      <P>I compliment the staff of the NIB branches who have been embarrassed and ashamed by what has happened.  From speaking with them I know they have been subjected to jibes from staff of other banks.  Time will tell whether those people will have egg on their faces.</P>
      <P>The misdemeanours in our clearing banks have, in the main, been due to a small number of management employees striving to maximise profits and meet targets set by their superiors. This type of pressure leads to short cuts and involvement in sharp practices.  The credibility of our banking system has been put at risk by the current requirement of individual banks to maximise profits, with or without instructions from head office.  Initially banks operate on the margin between interest on loans and deposit interest paid to customers.  Today's difficulties have arisen due to the introduction of various types of charges under the guise of charging for employees' time.  As Senator Ross said, we have the highest bank charges in Europe, being 25 per cent greater than those prevailing in Britain.</P>
      <P>Will we eventually see retailers of consumer goods, such as Senator Quinn, charging for their time on top of accepted trade margins to enable them increase profits?  Bank charges were first introduced for lodgments, cheques and other transactions.  They were then extended to referral fees, loan commitment and arrangement fees and surcharges on interest for various reasons.  In recent years there has been an increase in interest and charges to customers.</P>
      <P>While the structure of charges in general is legal, their operation can lead to abuse and overcharging. The general public does not have the capacity to check interest, which is calculated on a daily basis, or charges.  Referral charges in particular are implemented by computer.  I cannot understand why banks cannot check this system, at least on a weekly basis, and call on erring customers. Many of these unnecessary charges could be eliminated by small increases in bank overdraft limits.  The large variety of bank and interest charges give room for overcharging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Banks make no effort whatsoever to trace the beneficiaries of dormant accounts.  The non-return of cancelled cheques is also to the detriment of banks which are no longer consumer <Col N="819" /> friendly.  In recent years banks have issued statements on a quarterly basis showing the breakdown of charges.  I cannot understand why a statement cannot be supplied showing the rate of interest and how it has been calculated on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Managers are under pressure from the stream of statistics in relation to fees and costs they must return to head office.  We do not know if NIB is an isolated case, but over the past number of months all banks have had situations arising.  For example, in recent days we learned of a manager instructing staff to overcharge on interest in one of the larger banks in Galway.  Another subsidiary of one of the main banks based on Northern Ireland has not been allowing a sterling surcharge to customers when the punt was stronger than sterling.  However, it implemented a full charge when sterling was stronger.  As many others have stated, we have the problem with bogus accounts in the other two main banks in addition to that of offshore accounts in the NIB.</P>
    <P>There are a number of key areas in which managers are in a position to raise the rate of return at branch level.  They give poor rates on foreign exchange, load interest on certain customers and charge a penalty rate of 6 per cent on overdrafts when customers forget to renew arrangements; I could mention many other areas.  I have even seen cases where banks hold money for customers in current accounts and make no effort to advise them that a rate of deposit interest is available.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate can be extended on another occasion to include all financial services.  The greatest legal blackmail in the State is the operation and charges on credit cards.  Another issue concerns building societies and penalty charges for customers who default on mortgage repayments. Insurance companies, especially towards the end of the tax year, have been involved in a big sales push to put funding into pensions without any knowledge or information being given on how the pensions will operate.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to address the challenges facing banking in the years ahead.  There must be greater transparency and openness to stop the lack of confidence which has begun to develop. The two main banks may be taken over by global multinational banks while some institutions, such as Anglo Irish Bank, will remain special niche banks.  We will be part of EMU and there will be job losses and greater competition for banks. Banks see EMU as a threat rather than an opportunity while customers view it differently.  Retail banks and life assurance companies will be under pressure to make the same level of profits as we have heard today in relation to the Bank of Ireland.  We must introduce electronic banking and smart cards.  The euro is likely to increase the <Col N="820" /> level of electronic banking and our banks are not prepared for such activities.</P>
    <P>The biggest issue facing our banks is the unprecedented challenge to restore public confidence which has been lost through negative media coverage of the events of the past number of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Bonner.  The banks have made a tremendous contribution to economic development, representing a contribution of 4 per cent of GNP or £1.3 billion.  This is an indication of the importance of the banking sector which has grown enormously.  People like Dermot Desmond have done much to bring in winds of change, open the system and provide a breath of fresh air to the financial services industry.  The banks are a very important component of the Celtic tiger. They have a responsibility and duty to their shareholders to generate profits, but any well run business &mdash; the banks are no different &mdash; also has a responsibility to its customers and staff. Regarding customers, it appears there has been some neglect and failing.</P>
      <P>The recent disclosures highlight the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs with regard to policing various regulations and I suggest that staff and other resources should be provided not only to go after banks where there have been specific disclosures, but to police and ensure that best practices are applied by our banks in general.  In this context the Minister should consider an appropriate bank levy to underwrite the cost of introducing that policing service.  The banks cannot be critical of it in view of the circumstances which have given rise to it.  The Minister might also look at punitive damages which are often applied when people abuse others, which they should not do.</P>
      <P>It is important that the commercial sector is a beneficiary of EMU and that the banks are not allowed to compensate for the loss of earnings from currency transactions by introducing other charges or increasing existing ones.  There is a need to generate more competition.  The two main banks should not be allowed to acquire any of the State banks.  The State should hold an equity share on the stock market and form an alliance with a suitable overseas partner which would facilitate the development of the banking sector as a strong commercial entity in its own right.</P>
      <P>The lending philosophy of banks is geared towards property.  Banks must have the skills and staff necessary at local level to ensure that commercial projects are given the same sympathy as property transactions.  That is an underlying failure of the banking sector.  Personal guarantees should be given by the banks.  The winds of competition will provide the best safeguard in the long run for our customers.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matter. - Visa Application Delay.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>This serious matter was brought to my attention by the Dublin School of English.  Its director and staff are concerned about the delay in a visa application which was made on 24 April. They find the reasons for the delay difficult to accept.</P>
      <P>This case concerns 17 Mongolian businessmen who have applied to do a course in the Dublin School of English.  This is a long standing business of great integrity which has put many students from abroad through its doors over many years. It is puzzled by the delay in processing this application. What they find disturbing is that although the Irish Embassy in Beijing was helpful and all the formalities were complied with by those applying, they were asked for additional information at the last minute when they expected it to be finally cleared.  This additional information was not readily at hand, so the application was rejected.</P>
      <P>An appeal was made which is being considered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his Department.  As the tickets are booked for some time between 15 and 17 May, which is tomorrow, an urgent decision is necessary. The tickets and the money are not necessarily refundable or exchangeable and it may be difficult for them to come here for a later course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to speed up this appeal and to make an early decision on applications which I have no reason to believe lack anything but legitimacy.  I understand the difficulties this particular problem poses for the Minister and his Department but it is important that small businesses which operate in a legitimate environment <Col N="822" /> and have a track record which is of benefit to Ireland, the economy and tourism should not be obstructed in any way by red tape.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the visas are issued at the earliest possible date or, if that is not possible, that a reason is given as to why the Irish Embassy in Beijing had to delay it at the last minute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ross for raising this matter thereby enabling me to clarify the position in this case.</P>
      <P>Although visas are issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs, my Department is responsible for determining to whom they should issue.  It is my Department's policy to facilitate in so far as is possible bona fide entrants to travel to Ireland for the purposes of tourism, business work or, in this case, to study.  This latter group has grown dramatically over the years and has now expanded beyond the traditional markets within the European Union with students coming to study in Ireland from as far as Russia, China, South East Asia and South America.  This is an important growth industry for Ireland and the companies involved are to be congratulated for their initiative.</P>
      <P>There are a number of general requirements made of persons applying for a visa to study in Ireland, including evidence of acceptance on an accredited course, payment of fees and so on.  My Department would also assess the risk that, as unfortunately sometimes happens, a person remains in the country without permission after completing the course or is using the course in an effort to enter the country for other purposes.  In common with other countries we have regard to factors such as the person's employment status, their stage in education and so on in making this evaluation.</P>
      <P>The position in this case is that 17 applications were recently received in my Department from Mongolian nationals wishing to study in Ireland with the Dublin School of English.  The visa applications were evaluated but refused in the first instance because they were not accompanied by sufficient supporting documentation to enable us to safely approve visas.</P>
      <P>The Senator may be aware that there is provision for an internal appeal in all visa refusals. My Department has indicated to the Dublin School of English what type of additional documents might be of benefit to the applicants in making this appeal.  Documents from the person's employers, colleges or other references which show they are bona fide applicants and are therefore likely not to abuse the system by overstaying would support their applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this clarifies the position and that the school in question will now be able to make progress in this matter.  Each case will be evaluated on it own merits and I am certainly not able to <Col N="823" /> guarantee that visas will be approved on appeal. I assure the Senator, however, that they will receive fair and prompt attention.  I assure him that what he said about booking the tickets and the possibility that moneys might not be refunded will be taken into account when dealing with this matter as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply. There is a misunderstanding in the Minister's script where it says that no appeal has been made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> My information from the Dublin School of English is that an appeal has been made.  That is something for the Minister to investigate, it is a matter of fact not of contention.  I ask the Minister for an on the record assurance that a decision will be made as soon as possible as that is in everyone's interest.</P>
