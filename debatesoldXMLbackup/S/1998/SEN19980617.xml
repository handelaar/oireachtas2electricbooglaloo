      <P>I have notice from Senator Michael Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide a second teacher at Curraghroe national school, County Roscommon.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the non-implementation by Ireland of a World Health Organisation recommendation to introduce a universal Hepatitis B vaccination programme for all infants.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <P>As the first item on the agenda, I ask the House to take a motion without debate referring the report of the Independent Inquiry into Matters Relating to Child Sexual Abuse in Swimming to the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation, in accordance with paragraph 1 of the orders of reference of that committee.</P>
      <P>We will then take items 1, 2 and item 15, motion 22, on today's Order Paper. Item 1, Committee and remaining Stages to be taken until 12 p.m. Item 2, Second Stage will be taken today with the contributions of the spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. This will be taken between 12 p.m. until 4 p.m.</P>
      <P>In response to the requests made by various Senators last week, we will deal with the Insurance Ombudsman from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. and Private Members' business will be taken from 6 p.m. until 8 p.m.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business.  I wish to inquire about legislation <Col N="3" /> giving effect to the work of the Western Development Commission.  This commission was set up last year by the previous Government and established headquarters in Ballaghadereen, County Roscommon, appointed a chief executive and a number of staff.  However, its activities cannot properly commence without the necessary legislation.  We had hoped that the legislation would be put in place earlier but it is not included in the schedule of proposed legislation up to the end of the session.  Will the Leader raise this matter with the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy Davern?  The legislation is not controversial and should pass with a minimum amount of debate. Many Senators will have something to say on the Bill but that will be of a positive nature.  The legislation should be presented before the end of the session which is three weeks away.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader clarify under which item we are taking it?  I thought he said we were debating the Insurance Ombudsman under item 3 but I do not see that on the Order Paper. I do not agree with the Order of Business, particularly concerning the report of the independent inquiry into matters relating to child sexual abuse in swimming.  The Minister stated that this document has been circulating for two weeks and he saw no reason as to why it should not be leaked in today's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  He spoke about it and disclosed its contents last night on &ldquo;Tonight with Vincent Browne&rdquo; and on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; this morning.  We seem to be the only House which does not have an opportunity to debate the report.  We are going through a charade.  Questions must be asked of the Minister as to how a document which must go to the Oireachtas Joint Committee so that it can be published, has already been leaked and discussed in detail.  However, this House is being asked to agree an order that it will go to the committee so that it can be released to the public. Would the Leader respond to this situation? When this House is treated in this fashion <Col N="4" /> concerning such a matter, the relevant Minister should come into the House and clarify what has happened and why we are being treated in this fashion.  I am not satisfied with the Order of Business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the National Roads Authority?  Some years ago responsibility for national primary and secondary roads was taken from the Department of the Environment and local authorities and given to the NRA.  It seems that the NRA is giving unequal treatment to different local authorities and roads.  Most of the EU funds for national primary roads are being spent in the east.  This is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss this matter now.  The Senator is calling for a debate on the matter and he has made a case for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a debate but the Leader should ensure that it is more than that. We want a response from the NRA either through the Minister or some other system.  There would be no point in debating the matter in a vacuum.  We want the opportunity of sifting through the NRA's expenditure over the past number of years to find out where the money was spent and then give our judgment.  Surely a body such as the NRA must be responsible to someone.  It was established by the Houses of the Oireachtas and it should be responsible to the Houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little confused.  Will the Leader confirm that we are starting with the motion on swimming, then the European Communities Bill and the child trafficking Bill. As I understood the Leader, item 4 relates to the Insurance Ombudsman which we raised. However, the Leader referred to item 15 on the Order Paper which relates to regulations under the Sale of Goods and Services Act.  It seems that item 18 or 20 would deal directly with the Insurance Ombudsman.  The Leader has indicated that he regards the central focus of the debate between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. as being on the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  Will he clarify that point?  The Leader is nodding so there is agreement that we will discuss the Insurance Ombudsman between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose that, as requested by Senator Norris and others, we discuss the Insurance Ombudsman between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. That is a supplementary to the Order Paper. If so, I now so propose.  I also wish to clarify that if item 2 is not concluded, it will be taken after 8 p.m.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>That is clear and I thank the Leader for accommodating us in this important matter.  Would he consider allowing a short period of time to debate the non-controversial item 15, motion 1, on the establishment of an international court?  There will be a meeting of world leaders in July at which this important matter will be discussed and Ireland could play an important role.  There are some difficulties, particularly concerning sovereignty, and we need to obviate a situation where, for example, one had to refer to a dictator like Pol Pot and whether there would be an inquiry into his crimes.  Ireland could play an important role but timing is of the essence as the meeting is in early July.</P>

      <P>In view of the mid-term review of Structural Funds taking place on 20 June, will the Leader call on the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, to publish the report on rail safety?  There are a number of stretches of railway which are not safe and substantial funding of £114 million is available which was released from the Luas project.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to publish the report on rail safety so that, if there are any inadequacies in the rail network, money can be provided for their improvement on 20 June when the mid-term review takes place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the issue of carnage on the roads was raised yesterday on the Order of Business.  In calling for such a debate, perhaps the Department of Education and Science and, possibly, the Department of Health and Children should also be included because of the significance of drink driving and speeding to road accidents.  Regarding education, the topic of civics should be reintroduced to the school curriculum to ensure young people are educated on all aspects of driving, rules of the road, road <Col N="6" /> manners, etc.  When the debate on road safety is held, will the Leader ensure an input from the Department of Education and Science is included because the education of young drivers is the one way this problem can be solved in the long-term?</P>
      <P>I also understand that when I was absent last week people called for a debate on the growing suicide rate.  This is of concern to me because I understand from medical personnel that the rate is growing by one per day.  A debate should be held on this, possibly in the next term.  Will the Leader examine the possibility in the interim of the Department of Health and Children establishing a task force on the issue, as it is a huge and sad problem facing the country to which there seems to be no answers?</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Finneran's request for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  Such a debate is overdue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are many matters of serious import concerning the insurance industry and I appreciate that some of these will be addressed this afternoon.  In that regard, item 15, motions 18 and 20 are relevant but not item 15, motion 15.  Regarding the latter, will the Leader use his good offices to inform Members whether the ministerial order referred to in the motion has been made and, if not, perhaps he could elaborate as to why not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the report of the independent inquiry into child sex abuse in swimming, I appreciate the urgency in referring it to the committee for debate; but it is a sad day when we are asked to refer a report without first seeing it, especially when it is available in a national newspaper.  That is not the way to do business.  I was disappointed to hear the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation say this morning that no one should be surprised the report was leaked because it was doing the rounds for the past two weeks.  Regarding the serious issues raised for swimming and for sport generally, will the Leader request the Minister to attend a debate as soon as possible on the issues raised in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker made the point I was going to raise so I will not labour it. It is important the report on child sex abuse in swimming is made public as quickly as possible. It is right we should not discuss it without having seen it, but I hope both we and the Minister can discuss it in a broader context which would have regard to the impact on all sport.  It is a serious matter for swimming but it is something which impacts on all sports and I hope we will have regard for the thousands of dedicated people in all sports who provide training and coaching. While we must protect children and the good name of sport, we must avoid frightening off people who provide a service to children.  I hope we can have an early debate on the matter. <Col N="7" /></P>

      <P>I support the call from the Acting Leader of the Opposition to expedite the legislation concerning western development.  It deals with the most disadvantaged area of the country and all our futures could be enshrined in this legislation.  I appeal to the Leader to endeavour to have this legislation initiated within this session and not to leave it until autumn.</P>

      <P>Is it possible to have a debate on enlargement of the European Union as more countries apply for membership?  It is important we discuss it because of the effects it will have on farming and other interests.</P>

      <P>Can the time between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., when statements will be taken on the Insurance Ombudsman, be used as a more interactive session as has happened before?  Short opening statements will probably suffice but can time be made for interaction and a question and answer session with the Minister?  It is the only way we can impact on the public concerning the relevance of the House to matters of public interest.  I urge the Leader to accede on this occasion to that the format of a discussion phase. It is something he has done before.</P>
      <P>I support speakers who queried the request to nod through the report of the independent inquiry into matters relating to child sex abuse in swimming to allow it be discussed by the Joint Committee on Tourism, Sport and Recreation. Out of courtesy to Members, copies of the report and of any report on which we are asked to agree to a motion without debate should be provided.  I ask for that to be formatted in future and that we be given copies of the report as a courtesy to Members.  If we allow ourselves to be taken for granted by others and by the structures in the Oireachtas, it will be small wonder that the relevance of the House is questioned.  We know how relevant it is but we are making a poor effort in ensuring the public knows that.  This occasion today is another example of how we allow ourselves be slighted.  We should be provided with a copy of this report and of any report we are asked to nod through without debate.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader make time available before the end of the session for a debate with the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs on the increased costs on private nursing homes which are forcing out elderly people?  The situation is frightening and there should be an immediate debate on the matter and on measures taken to care for senior citizens.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on measures he will shortly introduce to curb the influx of illegal immigrants.  I was amazed to read in a newspaper that a Romanian had lodged £12,000 in a bank with instructions for it to be forwarded to Germany, most likely to finance the transport of further illegal immigrants to Ireland.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs to issue these people with food vouchers or some other kind of vouchers instead of giving them cheques for unemployment assistance?  When they enter banks, they jump queues and push people out of the way because they refuse to queue to cash their cheques.</P>

      <P>Is it possible for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to attend a debate on the recently published IDA Ireland report?  While there were many kudos in the report for IDA Ireland executives for the more than 14,000 jobs created, the north west is the only region which has suffered a net job loss. Over eight months ago in Letterkenny the Minister said the IDA was doing as much as possible to attract industry to the region but no jobs have been announced by the IDA in the interim, although a small number were announced by Forbairt.  Perhaps the Minister would come to the Seanad to debate the matter.</P>

      <P>Item 1 will not be taken before 12 midday.  Item 2, the Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997, will be taken at the conclusion of item 1 but after 12 midday and will conclude at 4 p.m. If Second Stage is not concluded at 4 p.m. the debate will continue from 8 p.m.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor, Senator Avril Doyle and Senator Costello expressed concern at the way the urgent report on child sexual abuse in swimming has been presented to the House.  The same procedure will take place in the Dáil.  This procedure was agreed among the Whips to facilitate the committee meeting at which the Minister will make the report public.  What is reported in the newspapers is not at the discretion of the House.  It is my intention that Senators will have as much time as they require to discuss the report in the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="9" /> Senator Finneran asked for a debate on the National Roads Authority.  There was a useful debate on this subject during Private Members' business in the last session and I will allocate time for a further debate in the next session.  Senator Connor expressed concern about the western development Bill.  I understand the Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and I will report to the Senator on what progress has been made early next week.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke and Senator McDonagh asked that the Minister for Public Enterprise give assurances to the Seanad and the public on rail safety and that she come to the Seanad to discuss the report on rail safety.  I will convey their wishes to the Minister.  Senator O'Donovan asked for a debate on the carnage taking place on our roads. He suggested that the Minister for Education and Science as well as the Minister for the Environment and Local Government participate. Everybody was shocked by the dreadful accident which occurred in County Laois last weekend and the Senator proposed that an education programme for young drivers be introduced as a matter of urgency.  I will convey the Senator's request and I will allocate time for that debate in the next session.</P>
    <P>I will consider Senator Coghlan's request in relation to item 15 and report to the House tomorrow morning.  Senator Gallagher and Senator Hayes were also concerned that the report on child sexual abuse in swimming be discussed in the House.  I will arrange for a debate on the report before the end of this session.</P>
    <P>Senator Lydon asked for a debate on the enlargement of the European Union.  I will allocate time for that debate early in the next session.  Senator Avril Doyle called for statements and a question and answer session on the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland.  If time permits and the Minister agrees, I have no objection to such a proposal.  The format has been used successfully in the past but many Senators are anxious to participate in a debate on this matter so there must be agreement among them on the proposal.</P>
    <P>Senator Dan Kiely spoke about private nursing homes and the high cost of such homes for senior citizens.  I would welcome a debate on this matter. The Minister for Finance addressed the issue in the budget and I hope the private sector will take up the new incentives that were introduced.  As Senator Kiely said, there is an urgent need for nursing homes and it should be the next area of investment by the private sector.</P>
    <P>Senator Bohan highlighted the enormous difficulties being experienced by the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Social, Community and Family Affairs as a result of the influx of illegal refugees.  Many Senators will be anxious to contribute to a debate on this subject and I will endeavour to facilitate them at the earliest opportunity.  Senator Bonner sought a debate on the IDA report and asked that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment <Col N="10" /> come to the Seanad to discuss the fact that the north west has not benefited from the celtic tiger economy.  That is true of many other parts of the island.  I will allocate time for such a debate.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 5 is related to amendment No. 1.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 5 can be discussed together.  Is that agreed? Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;and&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;1.14 to 1.16 (in so far as they relate to any of the treaties governing the European Communities as defined by this subsection) and&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not hear my comments on these matters on Second Stage because he was obliged to fulfil a pre-existing appointment.  However, in his reply to that debate he offered to consider them further on Committee Stage and I am taking him up on that offer.  The points I made last week relate to the difficulty in drafting legislation of this type and putting it to the people in a comprehensive and comprehensible way.  I mentioned then that some brave soul might draw up an instrument to consolidate the various Treaties relating to the European Union.  If Members of the Oireachtas find it difficult to understand these instruments how much more <Col N="11" /> difficult is it for the general public to understand proposals on which they are asked to vote at referendum time?</P>
    <P>The people understand that they have passed the Amsterdam Treaty in a referendum and that it will now become part of Irish law.  I asked the Minister to explain why the whole Treaty is not to be enacted in Irish law.  The people have decided to allow the State to ratify the Amsterdam Treaty and the Bill is designed to give effect to that decision.  However, it does not make the whole Treaty part of Irish law, only part of it.  I understand the excluded part relates to the intergovernmental activities of the European Union rather than the European Communities proper.  The Government has been a little too cautious and has excluded too much of the Amsterdam Treaty from Irish law.  My amendments are designed to seek clarification on that matter.</P>
    <P>Title VII, the last section of the Maastricht Treaty, is headed &ldquo;Final Provisions&rdquo; and deals with matters such as the duration of the Treaty, ratification, authentic languages, amendment and so on.  When the Maastricht Treaty was made part of Irish law in 1992, all provisions of Title VII were made part of the law in so far as they relate to any of the Treaties governing the European Communities as defined by this subsection.  The purpose of amendments Nos. 1 and 5 is to insert the same provision into this Bill.  Since Articles 1.14 to 1.16 amend Title VII of the Maastricht Treaty they should be included in the Bill as this amendment proposes.  For instance, Article 1.16 amends the definition of the authentic languages of the Maastricht Treaty which could be relevant in a legal dispute and should be part of the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews) David Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Andrews)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Senator for moving these amendments.  One of the criticisms of this Bill was that sufficient time was not given for a full debate.  While the amendments may not meet with the approval of the drafters of the Bill they are helpful in opening up a debate.  While on the one hand I welcome the amendments I must take account of the realities of domestic and international law.</P>
      <P>The Table, in the Bill, sets out many references to various Treaties and matters related to them. The Senator makes the very valid point that if it is difficult for Members of the Oireachtas to understand these references it must be even more difficult for the ordinary citizen.  I am not sure if consolidation of these Treaties into one corpus of law would improve the understanding of the ordinary person but it would make for ease of reference.  However, in the mechanism of the <i>acquis communautaire</i>&mdash; regulations, Protocols, annexes and so on related to the law &mdash; it is not possible to give effect to what the Senator, quite properly, would wish for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that this Bill amends the European Communities Act, 1972, as <Col N="12" /> amended.  The Act relates to the Treaties establishing the European Communities &mdash; the European Economic Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.  My statement on Second Stage on 11 June contained a section headed &ldquo;Matters not dealt with by the Bill&rdquo;.  It is to that section that the Senator refers.  It explained that the amendments proposed in the Bill do not include matters relating to, for example, common foreign and security policy. These provisions, as the Senator pointed out, are essentially intergovernmental in nature and do not require to be made part of the domestic law of the State.  This was also the case with the Maastricht Treaty so there is a precedent.  The Government is not attempting to engage in sleight-of-hand, quite the contrary.  I also explained that, subject to one exception in relation to the European Court of Justice, Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters is also not included in the amendments to the Act. This is because Police and Judicial Co-operation are the Third Pillar which is contained in Article 1 of the Treaty of Amsterdam but is dealt with outside the framework of the European Communities Treaties.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's approach of seeking no more authority in legislation than is strictly necessary for the purpose of giving effect in domestic law to the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, no authority is sought to make statutory instruments for issues relating to the Third Pillar which may arise in the future. The Third Pillar is Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters which replaces Justice and Home Affairs.  That is why it has not been necessary to make the main provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty relating to Police and Judicial Co-operation part of the law of the State.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances of what I have said, it is not the intention of the Government to accept these amendments.  They propose to make changes to Articles N, O and S of the Treaty on European Union.  I can relate, if the Senator wishes, to Articles N, O and S of that Treaty, commonly known as the Maastricht Treaty, which is part of the domestic law of the State.  The changes made to these Articles by the Treaty of Amsterdam are not changes of substance as I shall explain.</P>
    <P>Article N of the Treaty on European Union deals with amendments to that Treaty.  The change made to Article N of the Treaty of Amsterdam consists simply of removing the requirement to hold the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  The Treaty of Amsterdam overtakes the Intergovernmental Conference which set up the Treaty of Amsterdam in the first instance. The Intergovernmental Conference was set up by the Government in which the Senator's party was a participant when he was a Member of the other House.  The Government is doing nothing sinister; it is merely fulfilling the requirements of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> The change made to Article O by the Amsterdam Treaty deals with who may apply to become a member of the Union and how this shall occur.  As in previous enlargements, in the event of further states becoming members of the Union an Accession Treaty would be negotiated and in due course ratified by Ireland.  At that stage the European Communities Act, 1972, will be amended again to take account of the changed membership.</P>
    <P>The change to Article S provides that the Finnish and Swedish language versions of the Treaty shall be authentic.  This brings these languages into line with the other Treaty languages of the EU which will now be Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. There is nothing revolutionary about this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Deputy wishes to achieve a more outward attitude in his amendment.  This cannot be provided for in this Bill.  The change to Article S has already been provided for by the European Communities (Amendment) Act, 1994, which dealt with the accession of Finland and Sweden to the EU.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment.  However, his amendments are helpful in the context of a wider debate on Europe.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 18, to delete &ldquo;12&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;15&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, articles 13 to 15 of the Amsterdam Treaty are not made law.  This amendment proposes their inclusion.  Article 13 states that the Treaty is concluded for an unlimited period, article 14 defines when it will come into force and article 15 defines the authentic languages.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be unhelpful to the House, but I am not in a giving mood today as I am required by law not to be.  The Government cannot accept amendments Nos. 2 and 6.  Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty provides that the Treaty is concluded for an unlimited period.</P>
      <P>This provision will take effect in any event and therefore it is unnecessary to include it in the Bill. Repeal of any of the Treaties would require an amendment, and it would be appropriate at that time to amend the European Communities Act to provide for such repeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="14" /> Article 14 of the Amsterdam Treaty deals with the ratification and entry into force of the Treaty. This is a matter of international treaty law and it is not necessary to make it part of domestic law by including it in the Bill.  The Deputy's amendment is dealt with in a generalised and omnibus fashion in the sense that it is included in domestic legislation by association with international law.  I do not wish to mislead the Senator or the House in that regard.  Article 15 lists the authentic treaty languages which is also a matter of international treaty law.  It is unnecessary to include the article in the Bill.  I cannot accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), line 18, after &ldquo;with&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;the Annex to the Treaty referred to in Article 12.1 thereof and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes the Protocols to the Treaty in legislation.  However, it omits the annex, which is not a protocol and which alters and renumbers the Articles of the Treaty of Rome and other Treaties.  This annex should be included as it amends treaties which are part of Irish law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">

      <P>These amendments are unnecessary.  Article 12 of the Amsterdam Treaty deals with the renumbering of the articles, titles and sections of the EU and EC Treaties.  This article is made part of domestic law by the Bill. Article 12.1 which refers to the annex containing the renumbering of articles is already covered and does not need to be dealt with separately. The Deputy's amendments are dealt with in the Treaty and I cannot accept it as to do so would be to open a legislative can of worms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment designed to simplify the Bill.  I am glad that the Minister addressed the desirability of making this legislation as simple as possible.  I accept it may not necessarily make European law more understandable to the gnáthduine.  However, our efforts to simplify this legislation will achieve an important objective &mdash; to remove one of the arguments which opponents of treaties such as the Amsterdam Treaty use in debates, some of which I have attended.  They <Col N="15" /> point to legislation like this and ask people do they understand the ECSC Treaty or the Treaty amending certain budgetary provisions of the Treaties establishing the European Communities. They confuse people and sow the seeds of doubt in their minds by referring to the complexities of law.</P>
    <P>While nothing earth shattering was achieved at the recent meeting of the European Council, I was glad to see that one of the political objectives of the next Presidency will be to bring the Union closer to the citizen.  Will the Minister assure us that it will be a priority of the Government to ensure that the EU, as one of its next phases of development, consolidates this area of law and makes it as simple as possible?  In this way the ammunition which can be given to opponents of treaties such as the Amsterdam Treaty is removed in so far as is practicable.</P>
    <P>Instead of referring to the Protocols in the complex way of paragraphs 1 to 3 etc., this amendment proposes to insert &ldquo;second to thirteenth Protocols&rdquo;, which is how they are referred to in the Constitution, in the new Article 29.4.6 inserted by the amendment agreed to in the referendum on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the points made by Senator Gallagher and the Minister's responses.  I support the Senator's comments regarding the obtuse or so-called treaty language of the Treaty of Amsterdam.  I was on the speakers' panel of the European Movement &mdash; Irish Council and addressed a number of meetings on the Treaty of Amsterdam encouraging people to vote for it.  My problem is the same as that raised by Senator Gallagher, namely, opponents quoting from the Treaty and asking if we understand a particular provision, very often confusing me and the punters who have many doubts in their minds.</P>
      <P>Understanding the language of the Treaty is a major problem and seems to be an Irish phenomenon &mdash; perhaps I am open to correction. I try to keep an eye on the debate throughout member states in relation to membership of the EU as I am interested in scepticism relating to the EU, something about which I worry.  In other member states scepticism in relation to membership and integration is not related to lack of knowledge or understanding of treaties.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;treaty&rdquo; is stronger than &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  A treaty is sworn and lasts for a long time.  I expect treaties are written in a standard language throughout the community, but why is there a great difficulty in Ireland?  The greatest opposition to the Maastricht Treaty and the Single European Act arose from opponents effectively playing on the lack of understanding of the language used and the poor way the provisions were communicated to ordinary citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The final declarations of the Cardiff summit, which was fairly nondescript, speak of working to bring the Union closer to the citizen.  Such platitudes result from almost every meeting of Heads of States at the beginning or end of each Presidency.  The language used in describing treaties and agreements must be simplified.  The Minister has heard this comment made <i>ad nauseam,</i> but it cannot be made often enough. We have been discussing these issues since the 1970s.  In 1986 in the context of the Single European Act there was a major debate on the problem of obtuse, incomprehensible and often repetitive language which opponents use as a stick to beat those of us who fight very hard for the ideal of the Union and of greater integration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not propose to accept the amendments because, as the Senator correctly indicated, they are effectively stylistic in nature.  I understand the intention of the amendments is to give a better verbal picture of what the Treaty of Amsterdam sought to achieve.  In this sense the amendments have merit, but they are stylistic and do not change the substance of the Bill.  They seek to change the manner in which the protocols are referred to in section 1.  However, the Protocols to the Treaty of Amsterdam are not numbered but rather identified in groups by reference to the treaty or treaties to which each protocol is annexed.  The formulation proposed by the parliamentary draftsman in the Bill precisely reflects the way the protocols are identified in the Treaty of Amsterdam.</P>
      <P>I do not disagree with what either Senator has said in relation to the obtuse and arcane language of treaties.  Even the Bill, particularly the table and the references to parts of treaties, gives rise to confusion at the very least.  To add further to the difficulty the Treaty is set out in Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish. The Senators have a very valid point when we take this into account and in the context of the founding treaties of the European Communities, including those of the European Coal and Steel Community and the Euratom Treaty.</P>
      <P>The issue not only concerns the language of the treaties but also relates to the feeling of remoteness of the institutions of the treaties from the daily lives of people.  This relates to the much used and sometimes abandoned principle of subsidiarity, the idea whereby issues can be effectively dealt with by member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context the Cardiff Council was referred to.  I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, who made a number of significant interventions in relation to the original draft conclusions which were amended to take account of the needs and wishes of Ireland, particularly in relation to Agenda 2000 and employment.  I had to return to appear before the Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday evening.  The Taoiseach dealt with a particular <Col N="17" /> reference to Ireland's input to the non-proliferation Treaty.</P>
    <P>To have such an issue enshrined in the conclusions of the Cardiff Council was very significant.  The next logical step is to bring the initiative before the UN General Assembly when it meets next September.  At that time we hope the declaration concerning nuclear proliferation will become a resolution supported by over 180 nations, including, hopefully, nations which are not members of the current Treaty, namely, Pakistan, India and Israel.  While the Cardiff Council may have been low key, there was much work done in the context of preparation for what we will seek in the areas of Structural and Cohesion Funds and the poor deal proposed in the March communications by the Commission in the context of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>The Senators have made valid points.  There is a general feeling among opponents of the Treaty that it is a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation.  This is very understandable as many of the institutions are not intrusive on the daily lives of citizens.  To speak of a citizens' treaty is to speak of a pious hope rather than a reality.  All we can do is seek to bring about a resolution to the remoteness of the European experience from the daily lives of people.  The sense of remoteness exists in the minds of people and it is up to us to address it as a genuine issue.  People voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; not because they did not understand the Treaty but because they felt remote from what they were being asked to approve.  In these circumstances the Senators have a very valid point.  The legislation is not magic and was not proposed by a legislative magician.  It is difficult to comprehend and to refer to.  We have a duty and responsibility to bring reality to the mystery of European legislation.  Europe is viewed as being physically remote from people's lives.</P>
    <P>I am grateful for the Senators' contributions.  I am sorry I cannot accept the proposed amendments, but in the circumstances those would add to the difficulties involved in bringing efficiency and coherence to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the most important functions that we as legislators have is to ensure that our legislation offers children the type of protection to which they are entitled and which will provide them with the opportunity to enjoy a carefree and happy childhood.  The Bill before the House is one that offers further assurance that all that can be done by way of legislation is being done to protect our children from having their childhood blighted by abuse, in particular by sexual abuse.</P>
      <P>The Child Trafficking and Pornography Bill, 1997, is the latest legislation that offers protection against sexual abuse.  There is no need for me to recite a list of such legislation; suffice to say that even in the recent past we have passed the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act, 1995, which arose from a Private Members' Bill which I introduced in the previous Dáil; the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, which I, together with my colleague, Deputy Eoin Ryan, published by way of a Private Members' Bill and the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, with its important stalking provision.  In addition, the Children Bill, 1996, will update the law on the protection of children against abuse, including sexual abuse, in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an important document in the pipeline which I will be publishing shortly, namely, the interim report of the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet.  The working group will report on the very difficult issue of what can be done at a national level to deal with objectionable material such as child pornography being transmitted to this country from all parts of the globe by means of that most personal and modern means of communication, the Internet. One other important document which I published last month is the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  The paper deals with many issues relevant to child sexual abuse, including the age <Col N="19" /> of consent to sexual relations and other matters raised in the report of the Law Reform Commission on child sexual abuse, issues surrounding the establishment of a sex offenders or paedophile register and child prostitution.  The paper has provided the impetus for a public debate and a backdrop to consideration of the need for further changes in the criminal law to combat the problem of sexual exploitation and abuse.</P>
    <P>The manner in which international agencies co-operate and share their expertise in trying to understand the problem of child sexual abuse and the role child pornography plays in that abuse was brought home to me when I had the privilege of opening the first conference on Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe, or COPINE Conference, in Dublin Castle last December.  This project is funded under the EU STOP programme; it is a partnership between the Child Studies Unit in the Department of Applied Psychology at Cork University, the Paedophile Unit of the London Metropolitan Police, An Garda Síochána and the Association for European Law Enforcement Co-operation in Brussels. The conference addressed many issues of importance, including paedophile activity on the Internet, something that can only be realistically combated through international co-operation.  While such international co-operation is critical in tackling the problem of child sexual abuse, we must not lose sight of the need for our own national response.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is an important and integral part of the ongoing programme of legislation aimed at providing comprehensive protection against sexual abuse or exploitation.  Child sexual exploitation can take many forms, ranging from direct physical sexual assaults to the depiction of children in pornographic materials.  The making of child pornography constitutes child sexual abuse and can often involve the most horrendous violation and abuse of children.  With increasing globalisation and greater movement between countries, new forms of child sexual exploitation have begun to emerge.  To deal with the continuing and changing nature of the problem, imaginative and novel responses by both law enforcement agencies and legislators are required.</P>
    <P>The Bill also represents a response to the horrific events surrounding the Belgian paedophile ring which was uncovered in 1996.  The tragic fate of the young Belgian children who fell victim to that paedophile ring galvanised the EU into immediate action.  It was during our Presidency of the EU, when those events came to light, that a joint action on trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children was negotiated. This Bill will give effect to the provisions of that joint action as it applies to children.</P>
    <P>The Bill offers protection to children against exploitation in three main ways.  First, it protects children against being trafficked for the purpose of their sexual exploitation.  Second, it protects <Col N="20" /> children against being used in the making of child pornography, and third, by criminalising the possession of child pornography, it protects children from abuse by persons whose fantasies have been fuelled by watching child pornography.  The first and second of these protections are obvious, the third not so obvious.  Child pornography is one form of temptation for paedophiles and potential child sex abusers.  Possessing and looking at child pornography by paedophiles poses a real threat to children by reinforcing cognitive distortions and fuelling fantasies.  Child pornography can also be used in grooming or conditioning possible child victims into believing that what they are watching constitutes normal behaviour.  There can be no comparison in this context between the possession of child pornography and the possession of other forms of pornography for personal use.  This is why it is necessary to specifically outlaw child pornography in all its manifestations. The making and use of child pornography by paedophiles is frightening.  Most of us will never see it unless we come upon it accidentally, because it tends to circulate among paedophile rings and not otherwise.</P>
    <P>There may still be some people who think of paedophiles as pathetic old men, as much to be pitied as feared.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Paedophiles may appear to be ordinary people who live apparently ordinary lives but they can be highly manipulative and seductive, often charming themselves into people's confidences so that they can insinuate themselves into a position where they have unsupervised access to children.  They are capable of taking the long view, even spending years to get themselves into positions of trust with the parents of their targeted victim.  They will similarly use the devious side of their characters to obtain positions of trust, power and responsibility directly over children. Not all persons who possess child pornography are necessarily paedophiles.  However, all paedophiles will probably possess child pornography; it could almost be described as a necessary accessory to their activities.  It is this connection between paedophilia and child pornography which this Bill targets.</P>
    <P>Since its publication last December, this Bill has received a welcome response both inside and outside the Oireachtas.  Quite a number of amendments were made to it in the other House, with the result that the Bill in its present form represents an effective measure in the fight against child sexual exploitation, a measure which I am sure we are all anxious to see passed into law as speedily as possible.  It is worth bearing in mind when discussing this Bill the comment made by a member of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child when, during the discussion on Ireland's initial report on the convention, he said Ireland was to be commended on its pioneering legislation on the sexual exploitation of children.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the actual provisions in the Bill.  Section 2 deals with interpretation <Col N="21" /> and the most important definition it contains is that of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;.  Defining the expression &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; is something of a departure from the approach heretofore of leaving it to the courts to interpret what is meant by &ldquo;obscene&rdquo; or &ldquo;indecent&rdquo;.  It is important in a Bill such as this to give the prosecuting authorities and the courts a clear indication of what exactly we, as legislators, mean by the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;.  It does not matter how the child pornography is represented or how it is made, it is caught by the definition.  For example, section 2 (2) puts it beyond doubt that any figure resembling a person that has been generated or modified by computer graphics is comprehended by the definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; if it conveys the impression that the figure is that of a child.  This means that any person who would try to circumvent the legislation by means of computer technology would not succeed.  There are exceptions in the definition.  It will not apply to any written material which has been examined by the Censorship of Publications Board and in respect of which a prohibition order under the Censorship of Publications Acts is not in force. Neither will it apply to any film or video work which the official censor has passed for release. These are common sense exclusions which will mean that the present criteria in respect of material in books, periodical publications, films and videos passed by the censors will not be affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>The other important definition in section 2 is that of a &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  There are several different ages for which one could make a case.  The most logical and appropriate age is 17 years since that is the age of consent to sexual relations in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is the first of four sections in which new offences are created.  Section 3(1) makes it an offence to organise or knowingly facilitate the journey into, out of or through the State of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation, or to provide accommodation for a child for such a purpose while in the State.  This section gives effect to one of the most important aspects of the EU Joint Action on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Exploitation of Children.  The seriousness with which this offence is regarded is reflected in the penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The ingredient in this offence which makes it so serious is that it concerns children being taken from their family, community, and indeed their own country, and trafficked across international borders to another country, possibly on the other side of the world, for the purpose of their sexual exploitation.  We are giving a clear message in this provision to any would be traffickers in children that they would use this country for their despicable trade at their peril.  We will not allow children to be brought into or out of this country for the purpose of their sexual exploitation and we will not allow this country to be used as a transit point for such children.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> The term &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; is used to include not just trafficking for the purpose of using children in the production of child pornography, but also trafficking for the purpose of inducing or coercing children into prostitution or other sexual activities.  Section 3(2) creates offences of taking or detaining or otherwise using children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation. To a large extent it reinforces a provision in section 17 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, 1997.  Section 17 deals with the abduction of children by persons other than their parents and has a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of seven years imprisonment. The extra ingredient in this provision is that the taking or detaining of the child is for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation and, because of that extra ingredient, we are providing a higher penalty on conviction than for the offence in the 1997 Act, that is, up to 14 years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill makes it an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child to allow that child to be used for the production of child pornography.  It parallels a provision in the Children Bill, 1996, under which it will be an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child to cause or encourage the commission of unlawful sexual intercourse or buggery with that child or to cause or encourage the seduction or prostitution of, or the commission of a sexual assault upon, the child.  Section 4 and the provision in the Children Bill, 1996, are aimed at persons such as parents or guardians who, for whatever reason but usually monetary gain, allow their children to be so sexually exploited.  Is there a worse breach of trust than parents allowing their children to be sexually exploited by others?  The term &ldquo;custody, charge or care&rdquo; is defined in such a way as to encompass other persons in whose care the child may be and would include, for example, childminders or swimming coaches.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is aimed at persons who would profit from child pornography, although it also catches persons who are involved in the child pornography business for other reasons as the profit motive may not always be a significant factor in the dissemination of child pornography.  Under this section it will be an offence to knowingly produce, distribute, print, publish, import, export, sell or show any child pornography.  While elements of it are required by the EU joint action, it is a comprehensive provision which attempts to deal with any person who is knowingly involved in any way in the child pornography trade.</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is necessary because it is possible for child pornography to be distributed or imported without the knowledge of the distributor or importer.  This arises in particular in the case of those involved in providing Internet services who would not be in a position to police everything that is available on the Internet.  This issue will be dealt with in the Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful Use of the Internet to which I referred.  Therefore, in <Col N="23" /> fairness, the prosecution in any case will have to satisfy the court that the defendant knowingly distributed or imported child pornography.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will make it an offence to knowingly possess child pornography.  This provision is also required by the EU joint action and, from some of the comments I made earlier about the potentially horrific effects of child pornography, I need to say little more to explain or justify it.  The offence of possession will not apply in three circumstances: first, where it is in the possession of a person who is exercising his or her functions under the Censorship Acts or the Video Recording Acts; second, where possession is for the purpose of the prevention, investigation or prosecution of offences under the Bill, and third, where the possession is for the purposes of bona fide research.  Similarly, the offences in section 5 will not apply in the same three circumstances.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that the maximum penalty on conviction for trafficking in children will be life imprisonment.  The maximum penalty on conviction for possession of child pornography will be five years on indictment.  The other offences all carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. These are without doubt severe penalties but they are necessary if we are to offer our children the protection they deserve.  There can be relatively minor manifestations of some of these offences and the fact that provision is made for a summary charge in some cases reflects that.</P>
    <P>The remaining provisions of the Bill are relatively straightforward and routine and I will comment briefly on a number of them.  Section 10 will amend the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, by allowing evidence to be taken from children by television link in cases involving child trafficking and child pornography.  It does this by adding the offences created in sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Bill to the other offences in the 1992 Act for which children can give evidence by television link.</P>
    <P>Section 12 amends the Bail Act, 1997, by adding the offences under two of the sections of this Bill to the list of offences in the Schedule to the 1997 Act for which a court may refuse bail to a person on the ground that such a refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person. The offences that are being added to that Schedule are those for which I consider there would be a likelihood of the person committing a further offence while on bail.</P>
    <P>Section 11 amends the Schedule to the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Act, 1996, by adding to it the section 3 and 4 offences, namely, trafficking and taking or otherwise using a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation and allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography. This means that if those offences are committed outside Ireland by a person ordinarily resident in Ireland, on his or her return to this country he or she will be treated as if the offences <Col N="24" /> took place here and will be prosecuted accordingly.</P>
    <P>This is a critically important Bill.  Some years ago the necessity for such a Bill might not have been clear.  However, in the light of what we now know and the advances of modern technology, this legislation has become essential.  I hope it will have a speedy passage through the House and can become law without delay.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister has had a tiring morning but I hope he will take note of the comments I will make in the interests of children and families.  I agree with the Minister that the Bill, which I welcome, is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Two main aspects are highlighted in it, trafficking and pornography.  I hope the Minister will accept amendments which will seek to deal with those who provide access to pornography involving young children.  I am concerned that this aspect is not specifically covered other than with regard to the Internet.  I also intend to table amendments regarding the trafficking aspects of the Bill.  This area is covered generally but a new practice has developed in Ireland recently.  Unfortunately, the selling of girls, some as young as ten years of age, as brides is common in some ethnic minorities.  There was a recent case in Dublin where an 11 year old girl was sold for £10,000 and then raped by the male relatives of the groom. This is trafficking of a sexual nature for reward. I appreciate it is a new departure in Ireland but it has occurred and, unfortunately, will probably happen again.  A provision to deal with it should be included in the Bill.  No one could disagree that it is child trafficking of a sexual nature and it is opportune that it should be dealt with now. Trafficking is defined in the dictionary as &ldquo;disgraceful trading&rdquo; and many things the Minister has spoken about come under that heading.  The selling of young girls is surely one of them.</P>
      <P>I have other concerns which are not mine alone.  We have all spoken about them in the House and I have received support from colleagues on all sides.  There are real concerns among parents about the ease of access to pornography by children, particularly in Dublin.  It is provided by unscrupulous shopkeepers and by incredibly greedy newspaper groups who carry advertisements which give access to audio and visual pornography.  This ease of access exists because of our ridiculous censorship laws which require three consecutive issues of a magazine or periodical to be deemed lewd or obscene by the Censorship of Publications Board before it can be banned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now that did not matter much, but in the last few years we have had a flood of filth coming into the country.  It is freely available in many shops which are not even newsagents.  These people are getting round the antiquated laws by only having three, four or five non-consecutive issues.  In that way the censorship law does not apply since no one can supply the three consecutive <Col N="25" /> issues necessary for action to be taken against them.  I appreciate that the law was introduced in 1929 when nobody could conceive of visual or other pornographic images such as we now have to deal with.  However, it is surely time to amend the legislation governing the Censorship of Publications Board to allow such matters to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Other European countries are acknowledged as having high shelf areas but, unfortunately, Ireland seems to be becoming a low shelf society. I have seen young people with unlimited and free access to disgusting pornography, both visual and written, contained in magazines of a gross nature. They are freely available in many shops in Dublin on production of the price of the magazine.  They are on ordinary shelves, not high ones.  I cannot describe the content of the magazines.  The ridiculous fact is that if a garda tried to seize such a magazine he could be accused of larceny because we do not have an Obscene Publications Act covering publications that are harmful to children. How can one supply proof if one cannot even obtain three consecutive issues of a publication?</P>
    <P>I will continue to describe it as a flood of filth because that is what it is.  It is increasing daily and is available in shops not too far from this House. If the Minister of State wants to take a walk down Nassau Street I can give him the address.  It is not a closed door, it is open and the material is freely available.  He will find it on the lower shelves.  I suggest that no matter what age the Minister of State is, he would be physically sickened and shocked by the pictures in these magazines.  It is a sad comment on Ireland that we have become not only a country of lap top computer users but also of lap top dancers.  The values in our society are being eroded and, while we all stand back and say it is terrible, we do not seem to be capable of doing anything about it.</P>
    <P>I will table amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage by asking that access to pornography for young people be restricted under the terms of the Bill.  The Minister of State should include a realistic method of dealing with this matter.  I have suggested one way in which it could be done and I am sure the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has enough expertise to be able to devise some method of dealing with it.</P>
    <P>I wish to mention another aspect of the Bill which is referred to in section 2(1) of the explanatory memorandum as follows:</P>
    <P>The definition applies to visual or audio material that advocates, encourages or counsels unlawful sexual activity with children.  The definition applies to child pornography irrespective of how, or the medium through which, it has been produced.</P>
    <P>If such be the case and if I have understood the explanatory memorandum, I am very pleased that pornographic sex chat telephone lines can be dealt with by this Bill.  It is well known that these <Col N="26" />&ldquo;services&rdquo; can be easily accessed by children. Some families have received bills from Telecom Éireann to the tune of £600 per month because of these lines.  I will spare the Minister of State's blushes, and mine, by not playing a tape of the call I made recently from my State phone to one of these lines.  I was told they are controlled by PIN numbers but they are not.  One just rings the number.</P>
    <P>Advertisements for these sex chat lines are published in <i>The Star</i> and <i>Sunday World</i> newspapers. I have always disputed that such advertisements should be carried in newspapers.  I accessed such a line by dialling a number advertised in the <i>Sunday World,</i> which has a wide readership. There is absolutely no control.  All I had to do was dial the number and I was then asked if I wanted the depravity line or the perversion line.  In order to access those I had to obtain a PIN number.  However, I got the PIN number by being instructed to dial another digit.  The sample of the depravity line they supplied, which I got on the basis of the first call, was so aurally shocking that I did not bother going on to listen to the further depravities on offer.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to do something about this for a year.  I genuinely feel that we can use this Bill to deal with this matter.  The Telephone Regulator says he can do nothing.  Telecom Éireann says it is obliged to provide the service even though it is clear that the service is in breach of the Telecommunications Act, 1983.  That Act clearly states that anyone who sends a message by telephone, which is grossly indecent or obscene, shall be guilty of an offence.  The fine is £800 or £50,000 on indictment.</P>
    <P>Article 40 of the Constitution forbids the utterance of indecent matter.  Indecent matter is being uttered all around us and it is more than freely available to any child who can use a telephone. There is no way it can be controlled other than acting to ban the advertising of these &ldquo;services&rdquo;. I hope the Minister of State will take on board the fact that these sex chat lines are demeaning, expensive and a complete con.  They represent a shameful exploitation of young children's curiosity.</P>
    <P>I will be tabling amendments and I hope they will not be blocked by the interpretation in the explanatory memorandum.  I think it is covered but I can only expect a positive response in view of the statements made by the Government parties when I raised these matters before.</P>
    <P>We hear a great deal about improving the quality of life of children.  This Bill goes some way toward achieving that goal.  I am liberal in my opinions but I have found that the demands of others, including paedophiles, to get what they want when they want it, to be drowning out the voices of the majority.  Does the right to certain freedoms supersede the wishes of those of us who do not wish for those freedoms?</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said:</P>
    <P>This is a critically important Bill.  Some years ago the necessity for such a Bill might not have <Col N="27" /> been clear.  However, in the light of what we now know and the advances in modern technology, this legislation has become essential.  I hope it gets a speedy passage through this House and can become law without delay.</P>
    <P>I assure the Minister that I will not block this legislation.  I hope my amendments will be taken on board.  I emphasise that they aim to prevent children having access to pornography.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House with this important piece of legislation.  The legislation does two things &mdash; it prohibits and prevents trafficking in children and it introduces legislation to prevent child pornography, as well as defining pornography.  I compliment Senator Ridge on her sincere contribution to the debate and I concur entirely with everything she said.</P>
      <P>It concerns me as a parent that many newspapers with wide readership take the line that child pornography stems from deprivation.  I do not agree, it would sicken me to think so.  It is a sad reflection on society today that this legislation is necessary in this land of saints and scholars. Minister O'Donoghue mentioned a plethora of other legislation in response to this situation.</P>
      <P>We are all aware of the natural right of a child to a happy childhood.  It should be the happiest time of a person's life.  We know about the scourges of drug abuse, alcohol abuse and broken marriages, traumas which many children have to face.  The lowest of the low, in my opinion as a parent, lawyer and citizen, is child abuse, whether that be trafficking in children or pornography which debases human beings of a very tender age. It sickens me and no words of mine can express sufficiently the abhorrence I feel for what is happening.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the awful situation in Belgium.  Ministers had to resign and the government almost collapsed as a result of that.  It showed how poor the investigation which took place was.  Recently at Leonardo Da Vinci Airport in Rome, Europol and the Italian police intercepted a paedophile ring transporting Asian children to either Britain or America purely for sexual exploitation.  This is appalling.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of a working group on illegal and harmful use of the Internet. The Internet is a wonderful technological development which has great potential but we must ensure that it cannot be used for the promotion of child pornography and the trafficking of children.  Certain controls must be introduced to the Internet for this reason.  The Internet is open to abuse with regard to libel and defamation of character.  Will the working group also examine that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the recent publication of the discussion paper on the law and sexual offences. I compliment the Minister for doing this and the Law Reform Commission for the work it has carried out in producing a report on sexual abuse in <Col N="28" /> this State.  It deals with issues such as the establishment of a register of sex offenders and paedophiles.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago paedophilia was an uncommon word.  Since then it has become more prevalent. It is a sickening disease but in certain instances these people are well organised.  They are often mature people who may be community leaders, people who would charm you if you met them, but behind that facade they have developed a sick mentality and become involved in the abuse of children.  It must be stamped out.</P>
    <P>Anyone involved in child trafficking can now be sent to prison for 21 years.  That is a severe penalty but it is necessary; the punishment must fit the crime.  The Minister expanded on this when he said that this State could be used as a transit point for the taking of children to another jurisdiction to be abused.  That must be stopped and the punishment of 21 years imprisonment is totally justified.  We must send a message from the Houses of the Oireachtas that the legislators in this State take the situation extremely seriously. There are further penalties &mdash; five years for possession of pornographic items and 14 years for the preparation and dissemination of pornographic material.  Again these are severe but necessary penalties.  I note that Senator Ridge broadly accepted the thrust of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I mentioned what occurred in Belgium and in Rome.  There was an appalling occurrence in our own country, albeit in Northern Ireland, where a child of three years was repeatedly raped.  Where is our society headed?  We debate the establishment of tribunals and politicians are scourging each other for past mistakes, but in comparison to the trafficking and abuse of children, the rape of young girls or boys, the other issues pale into insignificance.</P>
    <P>When we imagine paedophiles, we think of dirty old men.  That is rarely the case.  These people take up positions of trust in our society.  The most appalling cases are when natural or adoptive parents or guardians involve children in prostitution, sometimes for financial gain.  That is the lowest of the low and it must be abhorred.  If the legislation has to be amended or strengthened then so be it, we must continue this fight.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals with the interpretation of child pornography.  This is clearly defined and it is important that it covers areas such as computer technology so that no one can evade the legislation by using the Internet or other technologies. Under previous legislation the courts were obliged to interpret what was obscene or indecent. Doctors differ and patients die and in some instances these interpretations fell short of what was required to stamp out dastardly crimes involving pornography, child trafficking and related matters.</P>
    <P>Section 3 creates a new offence of organising or knowingly facilitating the entry into or transit through the State of a child for the purpose of his or her sexual exploitation, or the provision of <Col N="29" /> accommodation for such a child while in the State.  This is in keeping with the EU joint action on trafficking in human beings and the sexual exploitation of children.  This offence carries a sentence of up to life imprisonment and it is most welcome.  Any person directly or indirectly involved in such trafficking, or who knowingly permits or turns a blind eye to such matters, will be punished.  If they carry on such a trade they do so at their peril and the law will be strengthened by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill also strengthens legislation by amending section 17 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act which deals with the abduction of children by persons other than their parents and carries a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of seven years imprisonment.  The new Bill doubles the sentence to 14 years, endorsing the thinking of legislators that we must move quickly to introduce legislation to ensure that children live in a safe environment.</P>
    <P>Had we mentioned this Bill 30 years ago legislators would have asked what we were talking about.  Society has developed in many positive ways since, but it is sad and sickening to most sane people to see what does and can happen to children.  We do not have a major problem in this country but a problem exists which can be stymied and halted.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years there was a huge problem of drugs being imported, particularly in my part of the country.  We were the mules facilitating the passage of drugs into Europe and the UK.  We must ensure that this country will never be used for the trafficking of children of any nationality or the accommodation of children by cowardly, sick or insane people who wish to deal in child pornography or the trafficking of children for the pleasure of adults.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly stated that this legislation is critical and it is of the utmost importance that it is added to the Statute Book as soon as possible.  I concur with Senator Ridge's comments on telephone sex lines.  These are appalling and the Minister might examine measures by which they could be eliminated.  Most of the newspapers mentioned by the Senator are readily available. Children between the ages of ten and 14 are mischievous and it would appalling if my children had access to these lines.</P>
    <P>I also concur with the Senator's comments on child brides.  This is very common in Asia and South America but it must be stamped out here. It is unbelievable that, under our noses, a child of 11 is compelled to marry and is subjected to appalling treatment and sexual abuse.  If this is a new trend coming from Eastern Europe, North Africa or Asia we must send out the message that the Oireachtas will take swift and severe action to deal with it.  I welcome the fact that the Bill gives new powers to the Garda to enter and search premises and confiscate tapes.  This Bill reflects badly on society but I hope it will provide some assurance that children will have a safer place in which to live.</P>
    <Col N="30" />
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill may reflect badly on society.  However, worse still is that it has taken so long to introduce legislation on child pornography, whatever about child trafficking.  We must be one of the last countries in Europe to do so and I compliment the Minister for introducing the Bill.  We should not feel that 30 years ago legislators would have been astonished to be dealing with this matter.  I wish they had dealt with it, particularly in view of the report before the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, outlining child sex abuse in swimming during the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.  Child pornography may have been used to seduce some children into becoming involved in the sexual abuse to which they were subjected.  It is not sad that we are introducing this legislation &mdash; it is timely, as we have had a very serious problem which we have not been prepared to face up to.</P>
      <P>Incest has not been mentioned, yet one only need open a newspaper any day and look at the court cases to see how serious a problem it has been.  One sees women, and some men, in their thirties, forties and fifties accusing their elderly fathers of the most appalling crimes against them when they were young.  I welcome this Bill as another small effort to promote the welfare of children in Ireland and internationally.</P>
      <P>The trafficking of children is probably far more widespread than we realise.  It has been facilitated by the removal of national boundaries and improved methods of transport.  Senator O'Donovan rightly mentioned the serious case discovered in Rome airport in which children were being transported from the Far East to Canada.  This is a good Bill in that it deals with the transport of children through this country as well as into it.</P>
      <P>It is important it is realised that the trafficking in boys can be as serious as that in girls who are more commonly the subject of media stories.  It should not be forgotten that it is, perhaps, easier for men to accompany boys.  This means it is easier for them to take a child out of their environment and away from their family to a country whose language the child does not speak thus making it impossible for them to complain to anyone in a position to help.  I gather there is a serious trade in young boys from eastern Europe. The trade in girls from there to western Europe has been recognised for some time but emphasis should also be placed on the trade in young boys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One is more likely to see young boys begging on the streets claiming they are homeless than young girls who must make themselves less visible. Greater importance should be attached to the issue of young boys on the streets.  It will be found that most come from broken families where there has been a history of abuse and broken relationships.  The child will leave the family home with few places to go except the streets.  We have all seen television documentaries where children seek refuge for the night in Garda stations because no hostel places were available.  They end up leaving the station to the great regret of the gardaí involved, congregating <Col N="31" /> together and sleeping rough.  It is a gift to those who wish to abuse these children to find them in such a vulnerable position.  Imagine how much more serious it is for them if they are from another country.</P>
    <P>When examining the issue of trafficking of children, the role agencies can play should be addressed.  Their activities must be carefully supervised, be they artistic agencies which advertise for children for showbusiness or marriage agencies.  Senator Ridge mentioned the problem of children being bought for marriage.  The problem is serious because most of these organisations are well established internationally.  Great care must also be taken with adoption agencies.  They must be supervised and I am sure the Minister of State will ensure this happens.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to control the movement of children within Europe once they are in the company of an adult.  It must be ensured that those who give information which they believe may protect a child they suspect is the subject of trafficking are adequately protected.  It worries me that sufficient protection may not be given in the Bill.  It must be ensured that there is increased surveillance by immigration authorities.  Facilities will have to be set up to support children in need and to give them protection and assistance.  Once discovered, these young victims cannot be abandoned.</P>
    <P>I am delighted efforts are being made to do something about child pornography; it has been available and legal in Ireland for too long.  It is used by paedophiles to justify their actions and to soften up children and to give them the idea that sexual relations between an adult and child are perfectly normal.  One dreads to think how often this may have been used in Ireland, particularly in cases before the courts.  It is terrifying that it took so long for us to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that pornography is a billion pound industry.  There is big money in it and we are up against the most ruthless people. Most pornography is produced professionally.  It is not now necessary to involve child actors, although they are used in some pornography.  The use of morphing to create computer images has meant the activity can seem so dissociated for those making it that they feel they are doing nothing wrong.  When the means by which morphing takes place is examined and the image of an adult's head transposed to a child's body with adult genitalia attached is seen, it is obvious that it is the most horrific abuse of children.  The sex industry is well organised and has close links with organised crime; that should not be forgotten. The exploitation of children for commercial gain is what motivates pornography.  Pornographic publications could not in any way be considered erotic; they are the most revolting publications.</P>
    <P>I have a few queries about the Bill.  The Minister is correct to insert the age of 17 because it is the age of consent.  However, internationally and <Col N="32" /> in all United Nations declarations, the age to which childhood is considered to extend is 18. While the legislation clearly states that an image created by morphing is the same as an image using a child actor, it seems that, when a person is prosecuted, a child has to be produced in court. The fine of £1,500 for obstructing the Garda is too low; the Minister might consider increasing it.</P>
    <P>The evidence exists that pornography is used to alter the behaviour of people regarding their desire for sexual relations with children.  Not all people are altered by seeing such publications, but from personal testimony and from various research work carried out, it is known that people's attitudes and behaviour do change after viewing pornography.</P>
    <P>One last suggestion is that money laundering should be dealt with as it has to be involved in producing and distributing pornography.  It is all very well to state that money laundering is due to tax evasion but a great deal of it could be money from drugs, pornography or prostitution.  Great efforts are being made nationally in terms of pursuing the holders of offshore accounts but questions should be raised internationally why there should be tax havens and where the money comes from.  It is well known that a great deal of money which goes to tax havens is dirty money from drugs, pornography and prostitution.  A campaign could be started to bring about the closure of such tax havens because it is difficult to see what useful role they have in a civilised society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit.  Ní hí seo an chéad uair dó bheith in ár measc.  Is Bille an-thábhachtach atá ós ár gcomhair agus tá sé riachtanach agus práinneach.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for children and compliment him and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for bringing forward this Bill.  It is urgently required and it is welcome that is brought forward now.  As others stated, it is regrettable it was not brought forward earlier.  That is not a comment on the Minister of State or on the Minister but on the issue of bringing forward Government legislation in recent years.  The problem the Bill seeks to confront and deal with effectively has existed for some time.  The evidence is in the public domain and the courts have been given forceful and unsavoury testimony to the existence of these problems in recent years, and particularly over the last decade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is just one element of a legislative package, some of whose measures were introduced by the current Minister when he was Opposition spokesman on Justice.  The package is an attempt, hopefully a successful one, to protect children from sexual exploitation, the most abhorrent form of exploitation and abuse imaginable. There is an onus on legislators to ensure that the law affords children protection from abuse.  We must do everything possible &mdash; where it is not possible we must make it possible &mdash; to introduce laws to protect the welfare of children. <Col N="33" /> That is of paramount importance not only for legislators but also for the values of our society. It is the consitutional and legislative duty of legislators to create the type of environment which will ensure that children can have a carefree, innocent childhood that is free from threat or fear of abuse, intimidation and exploitation.</P>
    <P>Tragically, it has become clear in recent years that child sexual abuse, child pornography and trafficking in children and other humans for sexual exploitation is widespread.  As Senator Henry said, it is widespread nationally as well as internationally. Unfortunately, for too long this type of exploitation has been shrouded in secrecy and denial.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to evidence that has come before the Irish courts in paedophile cases.  The public is also familiar with the shocking revelations about the tragic fate of the young Belgian children who were victims of a paedophile ring. There was also a shocking incident in Rome.  Such revelations warrant the strongest possible action both nationally and internationally, through bilateral and multilateral arrangements, to confront and defeat these forms of depravity and perversion. Sometimes they are presented attractively in the form of child sex tourism.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Ireland has ratified, imposes general obligations on the parties to the convention to take action at national and international level to protect children, not just child nationals of a state but also children in transit through a state, from all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.  Article 34 of the convention specifically refers to the actions to be taken by states individually and in co-operation with other states.</P>
    <P>The growing and widespread use of information technology facilitates the most modern means of communication via the Internet.  There are many positive aspects to the development and availability of modern technology and the Internet but, sadly, in facilitating sophisticated levels of communication the transmission of the most objectionable, abhorrent and disgusting material such as child pornography is also facilitated.  The extent of the incidence of this activity has provoked a huge response among states and international agencies which are responsible for the care of children.</P>
    <P>Co-operation and the sharing of expertise are vital in endeavouring to understand the problem. It is acknowledged that activity of this sophistication can only be successfully combated through the highest level of international co-operation. The primary objective of this Bill is to target the connection between paedophilia and child pornography.  It utilises a three pronged approach.  First, it provides for protection against trafficking in children for the purpose of sexual exploitation.  Second, it confronts the practice of children being used in making child pornography. Third, it criminalises the possession of child pornography.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="34" /> While all forms of pornography are objectionable, it is important to emphasise that the possession and use of child pornography by paedophiles presents a serious risk of harm to children by feeding and fueling the fantasies of the user. It has also been established by statutory and voluntary agencies seeking to tackle this problem that child pornography is often used to condition children to believe that what they are watching is normal behaviour.  When these factors are taken into account it is obvious that possession as well as the use of child pornography must be outlawed.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill creates the offence of knowingly possessing child pornography.  The EU joint action programme on this problem also requires the inclusion of this provision.  Analysis by caring agencies of the deviousness and manipulative abilities of paedophiles demonstrates that child pornography must be banned in all manifestations.  The Minister emphasised this at length.</P>
    <P>A proper definition of child pornography is crucial to the success of the Bill.  In the absence of a proper and wide definition it would be easy for devious and manipulative people to successfully challenge prosecution.  Section 2 outlines a definition that is sufficiently wide ranging to anticipate devious, sophisticated and subtle attempts by perpetrators of these offences to circumvent the law through the use of modern technology. It attempts to confront and legislate against clever misuse of technology to evade the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving the courts and the prosecuting authorities an unambiguous indication of what is meant by the term &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo;. Specific and detailed references to audio representation, visual representation and photographic representation ensure that no matter how child pornography is manifested or represented, it will be covered by the definition.  Concern was expressed by Senator Ridge and others about the ease with which written pornographic material is available in shops.  I hope the definition of child pornography in the Bill will also encompass that material.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister's decision to define a child as a person under 17 years of age.  It is appropriate and logical since 17 years is the age of consent to a sexual relationship in this country. All persons under the age of 17 years will be regarded, for the purposes of this legislation, as children.  The definition is proper and correct.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is extremely important.  It refers to parents and guardians, the custodians of children. It is unpardonable, abhorrent and unthinkable that custodians of children have not alone sold those children for the purpose of abuse but have often, as has been proven in the courts, themselves abused the children under their care.  The law must deal with such people vigorously, forcefully and with little mercy.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is a comprehensive provision which targets people who profit from child pornography, <Col N="35" /> the producers, distributors, printers, publishers, importers, exporters and sellers.  All are liable for prosecution if it is established that they are knowingly involved.  I strongly welcome this provision.</P>
    <P>Many other sections of the Bill are worthy of comment but my time is limited.  The penalties are severe but they are essential.  If penalties of such severity were absent, the Bill would not send the unambiguous signal it must to target, confront and deal effectively with these manipulative deviants. They must be made aware that if they engage in any activity proscribed by the Bill they will be dealt with severely and without mercy.  If we are to respond to the challenge which confronts us we must send a clear message to all would-be offenders within and outside our national borders that we place the welfare of children at the top of our list of priorities.  To do anything less would be an unpardonable dereliction of our duty as legislators for a society that professes to place the quality of life of our children at the centre of its programmes of care.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this legislation I note that in the Dáil the Minister accepted a number of amendments including some from the Labour Party.  I commend him for that.  I can disagree with very little that has been said on both sides of the House.  In the last number of years we have become sadly aware of the shocking extent of paedophilia in our society and are coming to terms with what we must do to protect our children and other vulnerable members of society.</P>
      <P>For many victims it is already too late.  Many felt they were not allowed to report abuse and some were not responded to.  Many people, in adult life, hear of people they knew when children being apprehended and charged with child sexual abuse.  This is becoming more and more common.  Only this morning we read that the report of the inquiry into child sexual abuse in swimming by Mr. Roderick Murphy SC contains accounts of horrific cases.</P>
      <P>I would like to say a word for victims who, because their lives were ruined, themselves became abusers.  One thinks of a person such as Anthony Cawley who as a child from a vulnerable family was subjected to horrendous abuse while in the care of the State.  His life was ruined and he is now a danger to others as a result.  One's heart goes out to such a person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As other Senators have said, this legislation sends an extremely strong signal of our lack of tolerance of child abuse in all its manifestations, particularly child pornography.  We must not tolerate the obscenity of trafficking in children for the purpose of prostitution.  We must state out total abhorrence of that obscenity and manifest it in our legislation.  It is important that the legislation be strong, effective and impose penalties which reflect the level of our abhorrence.  It is also important that our police force and all professionals <Col N="36" /> engaged in applying the legislation are trained and given the resources to ensure that the full power of the law is applied.</P>
    <P>The legislation refers to computer generated images.  This raises the issue of how children are portrayed visually.  The advertising industry must become more aware of how children, and particularly young girls, are portrayed.  As the mother of a small daughter, I am concerned at the overtly sexual messages young girls are exposed to on television.  I appeal to the advertising and the music industries to be aware of this without being prudish.</P>
    <P>It is our role as legislators, parents and members of society to protect children and childhood in so far as we can.  As part of that protection we must see that children have information. After a long struggle we are recognising that we must give children information in our schools to prepare them for the unfortunate realities of the wider society.  Legislation such as this Bill forms part of that protection.</P>
    <P>Our society is maturing and coming to terms with very difficult issues and the very difficult past, details of which are only now emerging.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is welcomed by all sides of the House, as it should be.  I make that point first so that any other remarks I make will be taken in that context.  I must state, in relation to interests, that I am on the board of Independent Newspapers and from time to time I give advice on matters of an administrative nature to the regulator of premium rate calls.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Donovan has outlined the extent to which this is a broader problem than mere legislation. In a consumer society, when younger and younger people have control over resources or can persuade their parents to spend, the whole entertainment and advertising industries are driven towards heightening sexuality particularly, but not only, in young girls.</P>
      <P>The Bill addresses both symptom and substance. To the extent that pornography is a symptom we should remember that the objects of the paedophile are vulnerable children.  It is important that society reduce the amount of vulnerability in children.  This means more family support, better family and educational services and large investment in social support for vulnerable families and the vulnerable children of those families.  Unless we recognise that, it would be dishonest to think we can deal with this situation simply by legislation to control the paedophile.</P>
      <P>This is hugely important for social policy.  So much child abuse takes place within families that we lose sight of the problem.  We do not think of what is happening in families and how they can be helped to do a better job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My experience of chat lines and advertisement, such as it is, is that it is a race between the regulatory agencies and new technology.  That race is being lost.  I am delighted that a report on the Internet is pending &mdash; it cannot come too soon. The international position is that as soon as the <Col N="37" /> regulatory agencies dam one hole there is a flood, which is particularly geared to new technology and the Internet.</P>
    <P>The regulator has the power to require PIN numbers.  However, as Senator Ridge said, it appears this is nullified by the ease in which one can get a PIN number almost on demand.  The regulator has the power to control the content of advertisements.  Perhaps this power should be increased.  I agree with Senator Ridge that these advertisements should be controlled by legislation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the positive aspects of the legislation.  Like Senator O'Donovan, I commend the fact that children can give evidence by video camera.  It is important to ensure that those dealing with children in the legal process &mdash; gardaí, social workers, judges and magistrates &mdash; receive the necessary training to help children through an extremely difficult period.  It is important that children are not afraid to complain and that they bring their concerns to a responsible adult.  There should be a series of listening posts in society to which children can turn.</P>
    <P>I may be perverse in saying the following, given what I said earlier.  However, I am not sure whether the age of childhood can be defined as 17 years for much longer.  We need to look at what is happening in terms of shortened periods of adolescence and accelerated puberty.  We may not like to deal with these matters and we may wish to protect children for longer.  More study is required in this area.  Society is changing rapidly and we do not help children by treating them as such when they are young adults.</P>
    <P>As regards the imprisonment of paedophiles, long sentences are necessary to show that this is a crime taken seriously by society.  We must also honour our international obligations as these issues transcend national boundaries.  Domestic regulators find it difficult to deal with offences which are committed elsewhere.  This Bill will help to deal with that problem.</P>
    <P>When a paedophile is imprisoned, one should think about what happens when he is released. This is an increasing problem.  In my area quite a number of people who were given substantial sentences in the past seven or eight years are being released.  How does society deal with them? It is not enough to push them on to the next unsuspecting village or to send them to the anonymity of the city where there may be more vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>A study should be conducted of the treatment given to paedophiles in prison.  At the end of their term of imprisonment some assessment should be made of the risk they pose.  Some people may be monitored after they are released.  Some may be incapable of being cured of their drives and there may need to be some provision which protects society and children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sure it will have the support of the House.  I commend the Minister on its introduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to highlight an aspect of child pornography which, while not covered directly by the Bill, is a matter which has concerned me for some time and in relation to which I have had correspondence with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It relates to video games played on computers.  Some of these games, while not directed at children, are questionable in content and are not suitable for them. They are marketed in this country because of a legal anomaly.  Many parents are unwitting allies in procuring these games and are not aware of the content which is pornographic in nature.</P>
      <P>Some months ago I discovered that video games are exempt from classification under the Video Recording Act, 1994.  I became aware of this problem when my seven year old son, Andrew, told me about the &ldquo;scary bits&rdquo; he saw in a Nintendo game called &ldquo;Mortal Kombat&rdquo; which he rented from a local store.  When I checked the game I discovered to my horror that it showed simulated blood gushing from limbs and amputations by the so-called contestants.  The game should have had an adult classification but the label was missing.</P>
      <P>I made further inquiries and discovered that the industry is self-regulatory in Europe but that a number of EU countries have amended their video games legislation &mdash; Ireland has not.  I wish to compare the lack of legislation dealing with this insidious form of pornography &mdash; which many parents are unaware of even though it is happening before their eyes &mdash; with the legal obligation for the submission of other video productions to the film censor for classification.</P>
      <P>At the same time I was made aware of &ldquo;Mortal Kombat&rdquo;, I received an inquiry from a Dublin music distributor who was surprised he had to submit a new comedy video featuring Brendan Grace to the film censor before he could distribute it.  I checked with the film censor's office and discovered that this is true.  A Brendan Grace video must be submitted to the film censor to ensure there are no &ldquo;scary bits&rdquo; in it.  Yet there are computer games operated under a self-regulatory system outside the law which have a pornographic content.</P>
      <P>Ninety-seven per cent of computer games are perfectly in order from the point of view of content, being innocuous, amusing and entertaining. However, 3 per cent are extremely pornographic and highly dangerous.  I accept there is no section in the Bill covering this area.  However, the issue concerns the philosophy and ethos behind the legislation which is attempting to prohibit trafficking in or the use of children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation or the production, dissemination, handling or possession of child pornography and to provide for related matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite the heavy legislative programme of his Department over the past six months, will the Minister seriously consider introducing legislation to amend the Video Recordings Act, 1994, to include video games as played on Nintendo, Sony Play Station, and other types of hardware to <Col N="39" /> ensure some legal checks and balances in the context of outright pornography?  Pornography is not just sexual in nature; it is as much about mindless violence as it is about much of what is contained in the Bill.  At the risk of incurring the wrath of certain people, I would be less concerned if I discovered my underage children observing sexual acts in an artistic and tasteful manner on television as against mindless violence perpetrated in many of these games.  As John Lennon pleaded, let us make love, not war.  This opinion reinforces the argument I am making.  I would like a response from the Minister regarding his attitude to this area of pornography and whether he feels the Bill might accommodate an amendment to address this very serious issue.</P>
    <P>While the industry is self-regulatory, there are examples of labels going missing.  In the case I referred to the shop renting the game genuinely was not aware the label was missing.  The game my seven year old son rented was categorised for over 18s.  The same is happening in the video rental market, with feature films and in other areas of video entertainment.  Labelling and classification is sometimes missing, shop owners are perhaps unaware of the law and parents are unwitting allies and not always aware of what their children are watching.  I would be grateful for a response to these issues from the Minister and to hear whether he thinks there are areas of the law which could be addressed.  We can have all the laws we want, but in the end of the day the important thing is enforcement.  The forces of law and order are stretched and cannot visit every video store or stand outside every cinema to ensure those renting, buying or paying admission to visual entertainment are entitled to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators who have contributed to the debate.  It is clear that all of us attach the utmost importance to putting in place strict tough legislative measures to deal with the problem of child sexual abuse and provide our children with the legal protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senators O'Donovan and Fitzgerald mentioned the discovery of the Belgian paedophile ring.  This and other discoveries of most gruesome crimes committed against children in Europe prompted a harrowing awareness of the problem of child sexual exploitation.  The 1996 Stockholm world congress on commercial sexual exploitation of children provided an important impetus for action in this area.  The success of the congress was evident during a European regional follow-up conference held by the Council of Europe in Strasbourg last month at which the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform was represented. The conference provided an opportunity for stocktaking what had been achieved since the Stockholm congress.  The main message emanating from the conference was that while much has already been done, much more needs <Col N="40" /> to be done and Governments, together with nongovernmental organisations, must continue to take concerted action at local, national and international level and intensify efforts to combat the scourge of child sexual exploitation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is one illustration of the Government's determination to prioritise the issue of child sexual exploitation and ensure incorporation into criminal law of the specific protections which children need.  The recently published discussion paper on the law on sexual offences provides a unique opportunity to further strengthen and update the law on sexual offences in general with particular emphasis on children who, because of their youth and their less developed capacity to assess risk, are far more vulnerable to potential sexual abuse.  I urge the widest possible range of submissions on the discussion paper as it will play an important role in the process of updating and modernising criminal law in this area.</P>
    <P>Another legislative measure which will have a huge impact on how the problem of child sexual exploitation is tackled at European level is the recently enacted Europol Act, 1997.  The Act paved the way for Ireland's ratification of the Europol Convention in March 1998.  When ratified by all member states and on entering into force, hopefully this year, it will identify and establish an EU wide sophisticated structured system of information gathering and analysis of data relating to persons suspected of having committed or considered likely to commit a crime in Europe.</P>
    <P>Crimes within the remit of the convention, including trafficking in human beings with a view to their sexual exploitation, have one common denominator in that they have a transnational or trans-frontier element.  The exchange of information and intelligence under the convention will be a vital first step in combating such crimes via strengthened police co-operation among EU member states.</P>
    <P>Senators O'Donovan and Fitzgerald referred to the increased popularity of the Internet and the possibility of using it to disseminate pornographic material.  This is a problem which cannot be effectively combated by one country acting in isolation. There must be co-ordinated action at international level.  There is only so much we can do &mdash; which we are doing &mdash; at national level. The Bill is framed in such a way as to enable prosecutions in relation to the production or distribution of child pornography on the Internet.  In the other House the Bill was strengthened by way of an amendment on Committee Stage to deal with the practice of exchanging information between paedophiles via the Internet.  The definition of child pornography was extended to include material, written or otherwise, which indicates or implies a child is available to be used for the purpose or production of child pornography or any other form of child sexual exploitation. Furthermore, the working group on the illegal and harmful use of the Internet established by the Government last year is due to report shortly. <Col N="41" /> Sustained action is being taken at EU level to promote the safe use of the Internet through encouragement of self-regulation and the creation of an international network of hotlines dealing with content such as child pornography, application of effective filtering services and compatible rating systems.  User awareness, particularly among parents, teachers and children, will continue to be promoted and the Government will fully support any developments at EU or Council of Europe level in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge mentioned access to child pornography, which is covered by section 5, which makes it an offence to show child pornography. Senator Ridge also referred to the pornography laws generally and while those are outside the scope of the Bill, the subject is addressed in the discussion paper on law and sexual offences published recently.  As I have said, any views on this or any other aspect of the paper will be considered before proposals for new legislation on sexual offences are prepared.  Senator Ridge also referred to sex chat lines.  These are almost impossible to control because of constantly changing numbers and the fact that, like the Internet, the material comes from abroad. However, I was interested in the Senator's comments and I fail to understand why advertisements for these lines are not prohibited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that I will look at this area.  These advertisements do no good, especially when they are in newspapers that come into every home in the country.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Donovan, Henry and Liam Fitzgerald referred to the trafficking discovered at Rome Airport.  That incident illustrates that we must be constantly on our guard to ensure that Ireland is not used as a transit point for this despicable trade.  Section 3 provides a penalty of up to life imprisonment where such activity is identified in this country.</P>
      <P>Senators Ridge and O'Donovan referred to the taking of children for sexual purposes, which is covered by section 3(2).  Senator Henry said that Ireland is probably one of the last countries in Europe to legislate for child pornography.  That is not necessarily the case, but we will have the most comprehensive legislation in Europe when this Bill becomes law.  Senator Henry also referred to child pornography as a multimillion pound industry. While this is the case, much child pornography is made for different reasons which distinguish it from other forms of pornography.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald was concerned that the definition of child pornography covered the written word: I assure him it does.  Senator Maurice Hayes referred to the age of consent for a sexual relationship as 17 years; this issue is addressed in the discussion paper on the law and sexual offences.  Senator Mooney referred to video games and I agree with him that that is a very serious matter but it is outside the scope of <Col N="42" /> this Bill.  Senator Mooney said that violent images are a problem with some video games and if there is a child pornography element in any such game this Bill will cover it.  I will ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look at this matter with a view to introducing proper controls.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their contributions and I thank my officials and those of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the intensive work they have put into this excellent legislation.</P>

      <P>Is onoír dom bheith ar ais arís sa Seanad chun an deis seo a bheith agam eolas cruinn a chur faoi bhráid an tSeanaid.  Tá súil agam tar eis an díospóireacht seo go mbeadh tuiscint ag gach éinne ar an gcás casta ataímid ag plé anseo.</P>
      <P>As the Seanad may be aware, I gave a detailed outline of the position as regards the Insurance Ombudsman during a Seanad Adjournment debate on 23 April 1998.  I also spoke on the matter in the Dáil on 9 June last.  On that occasion I pointed out that as the Insurance Ombudsman service is a private sector scheme, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the resignation of a member of the council or on public statements made by a council member as regards the scheme.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, in the interests of the consumer as policyholder, that the Insurance Ombudsman is enabled to discharge the responsibilities of that office in accordance with agreed terms of reference.  Before the scheme was launched by the insurance industry in 1992, the views and, indeed, endorsement of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce was sought.  As a result of that consultation the terms of reference were expanded to provide a wider ambit of discretion to the Ombudsman in the determination of issues in dispute between policyholders and insurers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a device to ensure the independence of the Ombudsman, the operation of the service is divided into three component parts.  I will for the benefit of Senators explain again the significance of those components.  The first part is a board <Col N="43" /> comprising executives elected from those insurers taking part in the scheme.  The second is a council made up of nominees from within and outside the insurance industry.  The council recruits and appoints the Ombudsman subject to the approval of the board.</P>
    <P>The third component is the office of the Ombudsman where policyholder disputes are referred and resolved.  The member companies of the scheme are bound by the Ombudsman's decisions.  As I said before, the record of the present Insurance Ombudsman has set an exceptionally high standard of performance for the Ombudsman service that will ensure its continuation and development into the future.  Frankly, it has been a matter of some regret and irony that the office of Insurance Ombudsman now appears to be embroiled in a very public dispute concerning the operation of the office and its interface with the board and council of the Ombudsman. It has been universally recognised that the Insurance Ombudsman scheme has been a glowing and outstanding success as a dispute resolution service.  This is a tribute not only to the present incumbent, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn but also to her staff and the operation of the scheme itself, including the co-operation of participating insurers.  It has provided an invaluable service to the consumer and has led to improved sales practices and claims handling by insurance companies participating in the scheme.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the office's success must be rooted in the strict maintenance of its independence. The future direction of the Insurance Ombudsman is largely dependent on the attitude of the insurance industry itself, but not entirely so.  My Department and I have been monitoring unfolding developments in this regard since my appointment last October.  As I indicated previously, I met the Insurance Ombudsman personally in December and, arising from the matters then discussed, I sought a meeting with the council. At that meeting with the chairman and deputy chairman, I conveyed our concern that the council should be seen to act as an effective buffer between the board, representing the participating insurance companies, and the Ombudsman to ensure the Ombudsman had unfettered autonomy in discharging the responsibilities of this very important office in accordance with the agreed terms of reference.  The council representatives assured me they would consider any action required in order to preserve or strengthen this principle and agreed to reflect on particular matters I raised with them.  I intend to have further discussions with the council in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Worldwide and in Ireland itself ombudsman schemes vary from solely private schemes with some form of ministerial approval to full statutory schemes.  The important point is that the operation of the Ombudsman scheme, whether industry or publicly funded, must be free from undue influence from whatever quarter.  Above all, the office of the Insurance Ombudsman must <Col N="44" /> be allowed to continue to grow and evolve as a genuinely independent, fair and accessible alternative dispute resolution mechanism.</P>
    <P>As I have stated previously, I am satisfied that the Ombudsman scheme is operating in a highly effective manner to the benefit of the consumer as policy-holder.  This is due in no small measure to the terms of reference established for the scheme which were strengthened at the behest of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce to enhance the adjudicative discretion of the Ombudsman.  It is abundantly clear from the annual reports of the Ombudsman that the Ombudsman has been enabled to operate effectively and judiciously within these terms of reference and, in this regard, the annual reports bear the authoritative stamp of the Ombudsman throughout.  They are highly informative to both consumer and insurer and are an effective advertisement in their own right of the benefits of the Ombudsman scheme.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion in this House I wished the Ombudsman every success for the future.  On this occasion, I am happy to inform the House that a successor has been selected from the range of candidates who applied for this important position. The successful candidate is Ms Caroline Gill, Chief Executive of the Consumers Association of Ireland.  I look forward to a further successful period of insurance dispute resolution under the new Ombudsman's tenure.  In the interest of insurance policy-holders and claimants, it would be important that the transition to the new office-holder take place in a constructive atmosphere.</P>
    <P>My Department and I will continue to take an active role, in consultation with the insurance industry and the Insurance Council, as and when appropriate, in monitoring the future progress of the scheme.  I congratulate Ms Gill on her appointment and wish her every success in this important office.  She has been the champion of consumers for many years and I am confident she will continue to be so in her new office which she is due to take up in September.</P>
    <P>I want to pay special tribute, as I have on many previous occasions, to the outgoing Ombudsman, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn whose intellectual capacity, boundless energy, commitment and professionalism have ensured the office will be sustained for the future.  It is my duty to insist and ensure the insurance industry gives every co-operation to the new incumbent in the interests of Irish consumers and that there will be a smooth transition from the current office-holder to the new one.  I wish the scheme, its staff and future clients continued success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this important matter of growing public concern.  I have no doubt the Minister's various assurances are well intended but I hope they are also well founded, although the jury may still be out on that.</P>
      <P>The office of the Insurance Ombudsman was established in 1992 with the approval of the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, who doubtless believed it would function well in a proper and independent fashion. That is obviously what the current Minister also desires.  However, I see the seeds of conflict in the Minister's speech in so far as the council recruits and appoints the Ombudsman, subject to the approval of the board.  Therein lies the kernel of the problem.  The Minister rightly lays great stress on the good work being done and the independence of the office.  However, I believe it is flawed for the council to have a say in the appointment of the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>In spite of the overall success of the office and its contribution to making huge savings for the industry annually, it is far from ideal.  The current situation is disgraceful; the core of the problem relates to funding and censorship.  This is such an important matter for society as a whole that the Government cannot stand idly by on the sidelines and allow the independence of the office to be eroded.  The very title &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; implies probity and independence.  We seem to be witnessing a big, bad mannered bully trying to nobble the office.</P>
      <P>Among the eminent Members of this House is the distinguished former Northern Ireland Ombudsman, Senator Maurice Hayes.  I look forward to his contribution.  I would like to paraphrase a passage in his book <i>Minority Verdict</i> in which he refers to another office-holder and attempt to apply it to the case which is causing such a degree of disquiet here.  What does the industry expect from the Ombudsman as watchdog? Does it expect her to roll over on her back and purr like a cat?  What would that do to engender confidence in those needing her protection? It would spell the end of the office.  Thankfully, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn is not a tame, lame pussycat but is someone who understands the role and necessary independence of the office.</P>
      <P>On pages 296-7 of Senator Hayes' book he states:</P>
      <P>I also thought it anomalous that the office should rely for legal advice on the government legal service whose members, though excellent in every way, were nevertheless also the people who advised the departments we were dealing with.  I therefore decided to appoint as my legal advisers . solicitors with an interest in administrative law and a good track record on human rights.  My main concern was to make the office even more accessible and more readily understood.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are very important principles at stake here and this contemplated travesty must be resisted <Col N="46" /> and rejected out of hand.  On resigning, one member of the Insurance Council, Mr. Bill McLoughlin, wrote that Ms Marrinan Quinn had to resist unrelenting bullying from the moment she took office.  The council apparently sought to approve and alter the Ombudsman's annual report and that is absolutely unacceptable.  Here we are, a reliable little democracy adhering to the best ethical standards, but the giants of the insurance industry have tried to perpetuate an appalling conflict of interest.  Who do they think they are and at what do they think they are playing?  This smacks of them wanting a cosy cartel arrangement enshrined in procedure.  This attempt at subversion must be firmly put down.  The entire scheme would be brought into disrepute if that was allowed to continue.  I am delighted the Minister of State met the representatives.  However, he did not outline what he said to them and I ask him to provide more details.  What the Minister of State did not say is perhaps more important than what he told the House.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to comprehend the arrogance of the attempt to censor a quasi-judicial office-holder. Given the problems created over funding, the industry has also impaired the work of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  The fact that the Insurance Ombudsman had to constantly go with a begging bowl must have interfered with the work of the office and distracted from important cases.  I understand the workload is huge and the insurance industry has saved millions of pounds annually as a result of the work of the office.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State must ensure that international best practice standards are adhered to and implemented.  The Insurance Ombudsman said recently in a statement that the interface between the office and its board and council requires urgent examination.  The Minister of State expressed concern about this matter and I ask him to outline more details of the meeting which took place and how matters may develop. It is obvious the Minister of State and his officials are concerned about this issue.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Ombudsman stated that only do the structures not meet international best practice standards but some council interventions amount to censorship of the Insurance Ombudsman's capacity to inform the consumer of their rights and how they may be vindicated.  The Insurance Ombudsman continued that there is a clear dichotomy between the Ombudsman's obligations to use the annual report of the office as a public interest document and a view intimated by the board/council that it is a marketing tool.  If that is true, it is an intolerable position.</P>
    <P>The Insurance Ombudsman continued that to censor the Ombudsman or use the annual report as a marketing tool is not only inappropriate but dangerous and it is calculated to reduce public trust and confidence in the Ombudsman's independence. I subscribe to that view and the Minister of State is aware that there is truth in all the recent revelations regarding the interference on the funding front and, more seriously, the <Col N="47" /> attempts to have an input to and alter or amend the annual report of an independent, quasi-judicial office-holder.</P>
    <P>I did not expect it would be necessary to comment on such appalling practices.  Thankfully, they were resisted, but the Minister of State and the Government have a serious duty.  They are not treating this matter lightly, but we cannot do enough to ensure that best practices operate. Public confidence in all office-holders must be inspired.  Everybody has dealings with insurance companies.  The last thing we want is to be reduced by the people who should be responsible and know better to something akin to banana republic status.  What has happened here is appalling, frightening and shocking.  I wish the Minister of State well but he needs to say much more about this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Leader for arranging this debate at such short notice.  I also thank the Minister of State for making himself available.  He is due in Cork to address a conference on the year 2000 and it is an indication of his commitment that he has gone out of his way to attend this debate.</P>
      <P>I fully support the concept of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  This type of office provides an effective means of redress to aggrieved consumers.  It saves an enormous amount of time and money in settling disputes which arise in everyday business interactions.  The role of the Insurance Ombudsman is part of a private sector scheme.  I read the 1997 report and it appears it has been a reasonably successful scheme.  It has dealt with 15,000 complaints since its inception five years ago.</P>
      <P>The number of complaints shows there is little doubt that a huge amount of money has been saved by the insurance industry, the State and complainants who would otherwise have brought cases.  This is one excellent reason for having the office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  However, there are many other reasons.  People find the office more accessible.  The Insurance Ombudsman stated:</P>
      <P>The ombudsman should endeavour to maintain a personal link with the complainant throughout the investigation of the grievance.</P>
      <P>The Insurance Ombudsman managed to do so. This action makes people believe that they are being taken seriously.  It is most important that this attitude is present when dealing with complainants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Insurance Ombudsman's office has another role in directing the consumer to the correct place when the complaint is not within its remit.  The Insurance Ombudsman did this sign-posting job well.  The relationship between the office of the Insurance Ombudsman and the public is one of trust.  In the case of the insurance industry, ordinary people believe the Ombudsman to be their defence, their shining angel, <Col N="48" /> against the big insurance companies.  The Insurance Ombudsman's office has fulfilled this role excellently.</P>
    <P>In terms of activity, the office handled 15,000 complaints over five years.  In 1997, 810 written disputes were referred to the office; over 70 per cent of these were eligible and 183 cases were issued with written decisions, 61 per cent in favour of companies and 37 per cent in favour of complainants.  In the annual report the Insurance Ombudsman noted that she received 141 telephone complaints but having been redirected to the relevant organisation, only 39 callers came back to her.  She identified that the word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; often can be an effective catalyst in dispute resolution.  The Ombudsman's shadow can often focus the mind of company officials dealing with disputes in changing their attitude and mindset to that of a customer based approach.  It helps them deal with complaints in a fairer way.</P>
    <P>These are laudable reasons for having an Insurance Ombudsman's office.  The insurance industry in particular appears to be bedevilled by problems and allegations.  However, I am delighted that the industry is regulating itself.  In common with Senator Coghlan, I am concerned about the allegations of interference, bullying and lack of funding.  As the scheme is voluntary, it is an issue for the industry itself to address.  It is not satisfactory to have the office act in a manner which allows it to be a public relations exercise. However, on the basis of the 1997 report, it is not possible to state that the office failed in any of its duties.  The current Insurance Ombudsman appears to have been highly successful.  She has set a high standard of operation and ethics.</P>
    <P>While it is appropriate for the Minister of State and the Government to address areas of concern with the industry, it is not appropriate for the Minister of State to interfere in the day to day operation of a private, self-regulatory scheme.  It is not appropriate for the Minister to interfere in the day to day operation of a private, self-regulatory scheme.  I commend the approach of the Minister who has worked effectively to address certain concerns and bring them before the council. The issues of funding, staffing and non-interference must be a priority for the insurance industry. It has an obligation to ensure that if no statutory scheme is in place it must operate its own scheme fairly and equitably.  There is no doubt that there is enormous benefit to be gained by many sides in the continued and effective operation of this scheme.  Both the consumer and the industry benefit and there are great savings in terms of money, time, effort and frustration.</P>
    <P>Insurance matters impinge on everybody and the continued operation of an effective office of the Insurance Ombudsman is essential.  The office of the Insurance Ombudsman has, because of its success, led to improved sales practices and better complaints handling procedures by insurance companies themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> The Insurance Ombudsman has played a pivotal role in the development and effectiveness of the agency.  She is to be admired for her pursuit of justice and equity in the name of the consumer. She has made an outstanding contribution as the first Insurance Ombudsman and, indeed, has set the mark for the future.</P>
    <P>The independence of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman must be upheld and I believe it will be.  The Government intends to monitor the situation.  In his speech, the Minister mentioned that point yet again and said:</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the office's success must be rooted in the strict maintenance of its independence. The future direction of the Insurance Ombudsman is largely dependent on the attitude of the insurance industry itself, but not entirely so.  My Department and I have been monitoring unfolding developments in this regard.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the absolute necessity for the independence of this office and the Government is making sure that actually happens.  The present Insurance Ombudsman, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn, would appear to have done an excellent job.  She has set the standard.  I am slightly concerned, however, that we should be commenting on what is not a debate the Government has any part in, but one between two or three people within a private business scheme.  When people are making comments with regard to the insurance industry they should realise that there are always two sides to every story.  I have no intention of setting myself up as a defender of the industry but it is important to realise that there are two sides and suggestions of a cosy cartel do not do any good.</P>
    <P>In our own business we have a help desk which we use as a marketing tool for our customers.  We do not use the help desk because we have difficulties with what we sell but because we are telling our customers that sometimes we do not get it right.  Through the help desk we endeavour to do our best for customers when they contact us. The office of the Insurance Ombudsman should be, and I hope will be, the help desk for the Insurance Federation and the insurance industry.</P>

      <P>The insurance industry is highly lucrative and viciously competitive.  It has suffered a reputation for bad practice and sharp manoeuvres.  For its own sake it must become more transparent.  Where it has chosen to implement a voluntary self-regulatory Ombudsman's scheme it must ensure that the office can do its job effectively and independently. There is no room for bullying or coercion. Its independence must be unimpeachable and must be seen to be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Insurance Ombudsman has made her mark and set the standard.  From that the office must continue to grow and develop, striving <Col N="50" /> at all times to do its job fairly, correctly and without interference.  That is the challenge for the insurance industry, not for the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Moffatt to the Chamber.  I hope some, at least, of what I say will be passed on to the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy &mdash; not because I undervalue the talents of Deputy Moffatt, but because I know that Deputy Treacy has direct responsibility for the insurance industry as well as having a personal interest in this matter.</P>
      <P>We have arrived at a most serious situation.  I have been looking at the insurance industry for some time and have raised the issue from time to time in the House, on the Order of Business and during debates.  As the Acting Chairman, Senator Henry, will remember, some months ago I expressed my concerns to her and indicated I was intending to raise this matter.  Senator Henry pointed out that she was a friend of the Insurance Ombudsman and, in fact, that she was Senator Henry's political sponsor.  It was appropriate for Senator Henry to raise the matter and I am glad this happened because I have a personal axe to grind.  I intend to put on the record some of my concerns as a consumer of the product of the insurance industry, especially in the area of disability and life insurance.</P>
      <P>I want to turn to the last report published by the Insurance Ombudsman, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn.  I would echo everything that has been said.  We have been exceptionally lucky in the calibre of this woman who has discharged her responsibilities with quite exemplary efficiency and to the highest possible standards.  She said nothing until her position was made absolutely intolerable by the insurance industry.  She remained silent even when one of her senior personnel, Mr. Bill McLoughlin, was forced to resign by the chicanery that was going on in the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>Let us be honest.  The insurance industry has been consistently attempting to interfere in the independence of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman and to vitiate every principle that underlines the office and its function.  Basically, the industry has been caught with its fingers in the jam and it is not enough to give it a slap on the wrist.  Many of us feel it is time for the office of the Insurance Ombudsman be taken away from an insurance industry that has shown itself totally incapable and unworthy of operating a voluntary scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must establish a statutory Insurance Ombudsman.  We can no longer tolerate a situation where there is corrupt interference.  We have seen that and have evidence of it.  Over the past few weeks a distinguished, balanced and responsible person like the Insurance Ombudsman has complained of a whole series of vitiating factors &mdash; interference, attempts to influence the report and the withholding of money.  She was challenged on this and was able to give facts, figures, dates and sums of money.  She was forced into the <Col N="51" /> embarrassing and humiliating situation where she was called in by the bank.  The insurance companies have shown that they are not fit to be trusted with this Office.  They have attempted to influence it and starve it of funds.</P>
    <P>A number of very interesting things are said in the introduction to the Insurance Ombudsman's report.  Ms Marrinan Quinn begins by saying:</P>
    <P>Given that the objective of this Private Sector Ombudsman Scheme is to provide an impartial and fair Adjudication of disputes between policy holders and their insurance companies, it is vital that the operation of the Office is perceived as independent in real terms.</P>
    <P>That situation no longer obtains due to the misdemeanours of the insurance companies and the council.  Ms Marrinan Quinn continues:</P>
    <P>In anticipation of the possible denigration of the term &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo; by the establishment of bogus or sham Ombudsman Schemes, the Association now known as the British and Irish Ombudsman Association (BIOA), with three Irish Ombudsmen as full voting members, set down four fundamental criteria which should be in place before the term &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo; can be validly applied.</P>
    <P>They are:</P>
    <P>1.  Independence from those whom the Ombudsman has the power to investigate</P>
    <P>2.  Effectiveness</P>
    <P>3.  Fairness</P>
    <P>4.  Public accountability.</P>
    <P>The first one does not continue to exist unimpaired. The independence of the office &mdash; I am speaking of the office, not the person &mdash; has been impugned by the actions of the insurance companies.</P>
    <P>While I do not intend to go into the report in any great detail, on page 24, the Insurance Ombudsman raises a question concerning the issue of jurisdiction.  She indicated that a company refused or tried to get out of accepting the operation of her office on the grounds that the insured was insured by a trade union rather than individually.  That is another wonderful example of chicanery.  Ms Marrinan Quinn stated:</P>
    <P>When the case was referred to me, the Company challenged my Jurisdiction and put forward the argument that I could not consider the case because the Complainant was not the policy holder.  The Company had, however, already accepted that she had sufficient interest in the policy to claim benefit personally and it had accepted liability in respect of her claim.</P>
    <P>I exercised my discretion to accept Jurisdiction in relation to the disability issue.  I took the view that the principles of equity ensured that the Complainant should not be deprived of a right of recourse to the Ombudsman in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> Insurance companies will do their damnedest to make sure that a person is deprived of that right and that is why they must be monitored.  One may wonder why I speak with such force on this issue. I speak as a consumer.  I am on a pension from the University of Dublin under a pension scheme and my behaviour is continually monitored by agents of the insurance company.  My right to sit in the Houses of the Oireachtas has been challenged in writing by the insurance company &mdash; how dare I have a pension and still perform my duties as a Member of the Oireachtas?  I wrote back pointing out that there were disabled Members in every Parliament in Europe.  I received letters which began: &ldquo;We have reason to believe that you have recently travelled abroad, can you acquaint us with your health status?&rdquo; I have had repeated examinations by doctors of various kinds, including their own specialist.  Insurance companies want one to die or get better.  They will accept no intermediate state as they have to pay for it.  At the end of the day it is a business and they are only interested in business.</P>
    <P>I am not the slightest bit interested in the pathetic ideas of help desks.  I do not want a help desk, I want fair and decent treatment and an end to threatening letters and blackmail.  One of my colleagues in this scheme was recently placed in a similar position.  I was upset to receive a letter stating that a claims investigator was being appointed and would visit me at my home.  I wrote back immediately stating that I greatly feared that the company had exceeded its powers in inviting someone to my home without making prior arrangements with me.  However, if I was given the appropriate information, i.e., the age, colour, sex, sexual orientation, colour of hair and grandmother's maiden name of the person, I would consider extending the appropriate invitation in due time.  I took it in a certain spirit and sent the company a good smack on the nose.</P>
    <P>I know of another case in which someone who had just completed treatment for a nervous breakdown found one of these letters waiting on the doormat and was promptly sent back into treatment for another breakdown by the threatening tone.  This kind of behaviour should be investigated by the Insurance Ombudsman and I can send the correspondence to the Minister of State if he wishes.</P>
    <P>I have written to the insurance company concerned which I will not name out of decency and fair play.  I stated that if there was any further such correspondence I would report the matter and ask for it to be investigated by the Insurance Ombudsman.  I had confidence in the office of the Insurance Ombudsman but I no longer have such confidence.  As a consumer, I will never have confidence in that office until and unless it is made fully independent and given every investigative power.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="53" /> On the basis of the treatment I have received at the hands of the insurance company, I wonder what kind of little love letter will land on my doormat next week?  I am sure it will not refer directly to what I have said in the House but I defy anyone, just as I defied the company when it raised an impertinent question about whether I was fit to serve in this House, simply because I was in receipt of a pension.</P>
    <P>Let us confront this issue head on.  I raise no imputation against Ms Caroline Gill.  I know of her work in the consumer area and she is an excellent person.  The great benefit of Paulyn Marrinan Quinn was that she had a legal training and could stand up to these boys.  I hope Ms Gill can do the same.  I believe she can and do not impute her reputation.  However, the Minister of State would make her job 100 times easier if she is given the independence she requires.  That independence can only be guaranteed by separating the office from the interference of the insurance industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already been extensively quoted in this debate.  I remember having a hand in crafting the last set of criteria referred to by Senator Norris.  I am here as a shop steward for superannuated ombudsmen and I speak from that point of view.  I am slightly acquainted with Ms Marrinan Quinn.  She has had a distinguished period in office as Insurance Ombudsman and has set high standards.  She is well thought of by her peers in the Ombudsman's Association.</P>
      <P>However, one of the things one learns as an Ombudsman is not to make judgments on issues until one has the facts from both sides.  I do not have those facts so I will refrain from commenting too closely on the case at issue. However, these strains nearly always arise when a new post is being set up.  There are difficulties of relationships.  The first Insurance Ombudsman in the United Kingdom had the same sort of travail. Ms Marrinan Quinn's successor should thank her for bringing up these issues and indicating what is necessary in such a position.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should consider a broader issue linked to the point made by Senator Norris &mdash; whether there should not be statutory protection for the use of the name &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo;. This exists in New Zealand which was the first of the common law jurisdictions to have an Ombudsman.  They protected the name and no one but the state Ombudsman can use the term. I would not go that far but people should know what they are getting when they go to the Ombudsman.  If the Ombudsman is simply a PRO for or a captive of an industry, or is controlled or a part of that industry's marketing strategy, then the public is being duped.  It is being told that there is someone who can protect its interests when that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The essential features of an Ombudsman have already been set out by Senator Norris: first, independence; second, tenure &mdash; they cannot be dismissed at the whim of people who do not like <Col N="54" /> their reports; third, public accountability and, fourth, the ability to make reports and adjudications. There is always a difficulty when a functionary such as this is attached to and controlled by an industry.  There are two forms of control &mdash; appointment and the ability to starve them into submission by withholding resources.</P>
    <P>In an odd way there were complaints about this when the first Ombudsman was set up by this House.  I remember Mr. Mills having such difficulties. Luckily, mechanisms exist in the public service to sort out that sort of problem.  Presumably there needs to be a similar mechanism in the private sector.  However, I recommend to the Minister of State the provision of a statutory definition of the term &ldquo;Ombudsman&rdquo;.  Bodies which do not meet that definition or are not prepared to meet it in ways which are clearly accountable, should not be allowed to use the term.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for regulation of the insurance industry.  It may be that this should be achieved through the appointment of a statutory regulator.  It does not matter whether one calls them a regulator or an Ombudsman provided they are doing the job.  People who are trammelled or prevented from exercising the independence which is the main characteristic of an Ombudsman should not be allowed to call the office that of an Ombudsman.  They should be prevented from doing this by the Consumer Protection Act.  These people are not real Ombudsmen and should not be allowed to call themselves so.</P>
    <P>I have shared some of the experiences of the insurance industry which Senator Norris mentioned. I have an insurance policy which I thought would be worth a great deal but I find it is worth very little.  We need this protection because most of the people dealing with insurance companies are vulnerable to high pressure salesmanship, worried about provision for their old age and they are not well informed on these financial and actuarial matters.  They can be sold duff policies by insurance companies.  More than any other part of the financial services sector, insurance companies need some degree of regulation.</P>
    <P>People who deal with insurance need the reassurance and solace that there is an independent person who will take their case without cost or having to go through the courts, and without the hassle associated with taking on a large corporation. That is what the Ombudsman should do and what he or she should be enabled to do.  The best way of ensuring that is to provide a statutory framework which defines what an Ombudsman does and indicate the conditions which must be met by companies in securing independence, accountability and resources before they can call their adjudicator an Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>This is a broader question than regulating the insurance industry, although it shows up most starkly there.  The concept of ombudsman has become well known.  There have been distinguished Ombudsmen in this State who have set <Col N="55" /> markers of fair play and guidelines for the way Departments and others should operate and they have greatly improved public administration and public confidence in that administration.  It debases the work they have done if other industries are allowed to set up some sham position which does not do what it promises.  We cannot interfere in the private sector but the Government can and should regulate the use of the term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This is the fourth occasion on which these Houses have discussed this problem yet the facts still need to be put on record.  It says something about the Department and the Minister if, on the fourth occasion on which we tried to get the facts onto the record, Members of the Dáil and Seanad have been unable to do so.  I am concerned that we are no nearer getting the full facts onto the record.  The Minister, for all his delicacy in the statements which he has issued on this matter, stands indicted.</P>
      <P>He stated that it has been &ldquo;universally recognised that the Insurance Ombudsman scheme has been an outstanding success for the dispute resolution service&rdquo;.  I do not question that.  He continued, however, that this was not only &ldquo;a tribute to the present incumbent, Ms Paulyn Marrinan Quinn but also to her staff and the operation of the scheme itself, including the co-operation of participating insurers&rdquo;.  I wonder what the Minister takes the Members of this House and the public to be.  He obviously does not accept that Paulyn Marrinan Quinn's statements are true or he could not put that statement on the record. The success to date of the office of the Ombudsman, and Paulyn Marrinan Quinn's personal record in dispute resolution &mdash; 1,500 cases in five years &mdash; is a compliment to the personal ability and integrity of the holder of the office, despite the constant bullying of the insurance industry. The success is not because of the industry, it is despite it.  If the Minister can come into this House today, on the fourth occasion this matter has been put on the record, and still not grasp that fact, there is a major problem with the Department, the Minister and his understanding of what has happened to the office of the Insurance Ombudsman in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem arises with the interface between the Office and the council and board.  We do not know why the industry has to exert such control over the Office, we do not know what the industry is afraid of.  There are excellent members of the insurance industry who should look at who is representing them on the council and the board. Those representing the mainstream industry are doing the industry no favours with their behaviour, their interference, bullying and attempts to control and censor the annual report of the present Ombudsman.  If this Minister really feels this first term of office has been an outstanding success, and I compliment Paulyn Marrinan Quinn for her achievements in spite of what she <Col N="56" /> has had to put up with, it is not because of the support of the industry, it is despite it.  That is the fact we need to place on the record.  I urge Minister of State Moffatt &mdash; and I hope he will be given time to respond to the points made here or else these statements are futile &mdash; to take that point on board and tell us his views and the Department's views on the industry's interference in the integrity and independence of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman.  No one is arguing that they did not interfere, withhold money and censor the annual report.  We know what they did but we do not know the Minister's and the Government's attitude toward their actions.</P>
    <P>I welcome Caroline Gill as the new Insurance Ombudsman.  From personal experience I know her to be an extremely able person who will bring excellent skills to this position.  I hope before she takes office that she will be in a position to clarify and resolve the relationships between the office of the Insurance Ombudsman and the council and the board.  Any continuance of the bullying of and interference with the independence of the office, and of censorship of the work of the office cannot be tolerated.  As Senator Maurice Hayes said in his excellent contribution, speaking from great experience in this area, we need to clearly define what we understand to be an Ombudsman.  We must look toward statutory definition of the concept of Ombudsman but we must not abuse the concept of Ombudsman by letting the insurance industry control him or her and prevent him or her operating in the interests of consumers of insurance products, the reason for the establishment of the office in the first place.  I would like confirmation that there will be a response from the Minister at the end of the debate or there is no point in this.</P>
    <P>Why did the council, having originally agreed to renew Ms Marrinan Quinn's contract for a second time then decide at its meeting on 10 July 1997 not to renew the contract from 31 August?  Why did Mr. McLaughlin, who has since resigned, and two other industry members who were not at the meeting, provide no reason for overturning the original decision despite repeated requests?  What happened coming up to July of last year for the industry members at that particular meeting to refuse to renew Paulyn Marrinan Quinn's contract? We need to know the answers to these questions because, if the industry can control the tenure of an Ombudsman, it can only be assumed that its efforts to hire, fire and control the incumbent has to do with Paulyn Marrinan Quinn's success in looking after consumers of insurance products.  Without any other explanation, that is the only logical conclusion to which people can come.  If that is the reason, then we should be told because there is something wrong with a system which allows that to continue.  If the industry can continue to control the independence, tenure and impartiality of the office of the Insurance Ombudsman, there is something wrong with the <Col N="57" /> system and we ought to go back to the drawing board and re-examine the legislation.</P>
    <P>We need answers to the questions why, at a meeting, the council suddenly changed its mind on renewing Ms Marrinan Quinn's contract and why members of the council absent from the meeting could not obtain an explanation of that change of mind and, to my knowledge, have still not received one.  I would like assurances from the Minister of State that he will give answers to these questions in the interest of ensuring the integrity and impartiality of the office and ensuring consumers of insurance products can continue to have confidence in the office and not feel there will be a repeat of the bullying and the use of control techniques exercised by the industry for the past three or four years.  There is little point in continuing with the charade unless the existing problems are resolved.  To do justice to the excellent work done by Paulyn Marrinan Quinn, despite the council and board of the insurance industry and not because of them as the Minister of State would have us believe, and to ensure the office continues with integrity and impartiality, we need answers to the questions and the problems resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to these statements on the Insurance Ombudsman.  We are all agreed how vital the office is.  It is essential there is an impartial and fair adjudication of disputes between policy-holders and their insurance companies and that their is an office to achieve that.</P>
      <P>It was interesting that, in referring to the establishment of the post of the Insurance Ombudsman, the Minister of State made the point that, as a result of consultation with the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy O'Malley, the terms of reference were expanded to provide a wider ambit of discretion to the Ombudsman in the determination of issues and disputes between policy-holders and insurers.  This leads me to believe that, despite the fact this was a private sector initiative, there was a certain degree of reluctance within the industry.  Perhaps that gives an inkling of the type of mindset within the industry to the position of Ombudsman.  Senator Maurice Hayes's remarks were apt in that regard.  In the establishment of any such position, there are bound to be difficulties and it can be seen that anyone in the position would need to be strong minded to carry out the duties as efficiently as possible.  If the industry thought Paulyn Marrinan Quinn was going to be a pushover, it got it wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Ombudsman states in her fifth annual report, it is vital the operation of the office is seen as independent.  It is interesting that she also anticipates the possible denigration of the term &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo; by the establishment of bogus or sham ombudsman schemes.  That was obviously something which was on her mind from early on. The British and Irish Ombudsman Association set down fundamental criteria which should be met before the term could be validly applied.  We <Col N="58" /> have heard from all sides how successful Paulyn Marrinan Quinn was in office.</P>
    <P>At the end of the fifth annual report, there is what could be termed a eulogy from the chairman and chief executive of insurance brokerage congratulating her on her magnificent achievements and stating that they have undoubtedly raised to new and significant heights the public's general perception of the industry.  He further states that it will be very difficult for the person who follows in her footsteps to achieve the prominence or success which she has brought to the office.  It is very disquieting then to hear of reports of bullying, intimidation and interference and all the more so when we read such accolades.  That is why we must unfortunately take such reports seriously, regardless of whether we have a personal knowledge of the individual concerned.  It all boils down to asking questions about self-regulation. When it is known that this can be interfered with by the withholding of money or by the industry deciding the tenure of office, the independence of the office must be under threat and that is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I found what the Minister of State said to be interesting.  He stated that he sought a meeting with the council having met the Insurance Ombudsman.  He did not state what went on at the meeting other than that he conveyed her concern that the council be seen to act as an effective buffer between the Ombudsman and the board representing the participating insurance companies to ensure the Ombudsman had unfettered autonomy in discharging the responsibilities of her office in accordance with the agreed terms of reference.  He received an assurance from council representatives that they would consider any action which would be required to preserve or strengthen that principle.  We are now in the tenure of a new Ombudsman and I wish Ms Caroline Gill all the best in that office.  I wonder how she feels considering the publicity surrounding her predecessor's term of office.  The situation must at least be monitored by the Minister of State because he has responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>It must be asked whether a statutory scheme which would be independent and which could be funded by a levy on the industry should be initiated.  If it is seen that the industry is not prepared to allow the regulator to be independent, other ways of ensuring the independent operation of the Ombudsman must be examined.  Confidence in the industry must have been rocked by the Insurance Ombudsman's statements.  If she felt there was an attempt to interfere with her work, it calls into question the future role of the office and puts a huge obligation on the incoming Ombudsman to ensure the independence and autonomy of the office are upheld.  However, it is undoubtedly very difficult if the person paying the piper is calling the tune.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that anyone should be able to call the tune as far as the Insurance Ombudsman is concerned.  There is no direct role for the Minister of State in what happened because it is <Col N="59" /> a private sector scheme but it is of such grave importance that, if the Minister of State cannot be satisfied that the independence of the office is upheld, he will have to carefully examine the establishment of a statutory scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute on this important issue of the Insurance Ombudsman.  The office is extremely important and the concept of providing watchdogs for consumers and making a person responsible for examining products and services, providing information and investigating complaints has been late in arriving in our jurisdiction.  Of all the areas in the service industry, the existence of an Ombudsman in the insurance area is probably the most important.  This is a product or service which is open to abuse.  The nature of the insurance industry is sales which often involves high powered salesmanship.  In such circumstances products can easily be sold which do not live up to the projected specifications when they are initially advertised and marketed, often in a propagandist fashion.  From that point of view, this industry, of all the financial service institutions, needs to be examined carefully.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman of the insurance industry is a private sector scheme which operates with the goodwill of the industry.  That is the nub of this issue.  It is a good scheme while it enjoys the goodwill of the industry but if the industry is not prepared to be fair the scheme can easily be undermined.  It is a voluntary scheme and, in a way, an attempt at self-regulation at half an arm's length from the industry.  The industry is responsible for funding, staffing and the goodwill of the scheme.  It will, therefore, be difficult for the scheme to operate if the industry is not in full agreement with the work the Ombudsman is entitled to do.</P>
      <P>That is what happened in the case of the previous incumbent of the office, Paulyn Marrinan Quinn.  The industry refused to co-operate, became obstructive, bullied and censored and did not provide the resources or the staff for the Ombudsman to carry out her work.  That is on record.  If that is the case, we must examine the scheme carefully.  I am not sure that it is good enough for the Minister of State to blithely inform the House that the future direction of the insurance Ombudsman is largely dependent on the attitude of the insurance industry.  It should be dependent on the position taken by legislators who are ultimately responsible for the public and consumer interest.  If we accept the Minister of State's statement, the future direction of the insurance Ombudsman will be no better than it was in the past.  We will again be confronted by crises caused by obstruction, censorship and the other problems that brought about the untimely resignation of Paulyn Marrinan Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State also blithely informed the House that he has made another appointment to the office.  The new Insurance Ombudsman, Ms <Col N="60" /> Caroline Gill, was chief executive of the Consumers' Association of Ireland and has a considerable track record.  However, we cannot simply leave it at that.  It is not good enough just to replace the previous incumbent who was effectively forced out of office with another person and consider the matter concluded.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> rules and terms of reference which were agreed must be changed.  A framework must be put in place whereby the Ombudsman can operate freely, fearlessly and independently.  At this point legislation appears to be the only way of doing this.  I hope the Minister of State will outline what the Government intends to do because his opening speech gave no indication that it would put in place any measure to protect the office in the future.  That is gross negligence. An appalling situation has arisen in which a consumers' watchdog has been directly interfered with by the industry to such an extent that it cannot fulfil its duty.  We have an obligation to ensure that the person who is next appointed to that position is enabled to carry out his or her duties in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>Support mechanisms must be put in place but that cannot happen unless a statutory framework is established.  There is a statutory framework for the Office of the Ombudsman in the public sector; but this voluntary, private sector scheme appears to be flawed with regard to adequate terms of reference.  The Minister of State agreed that the previous insurance Ombudsman was successful in that office.  Nevertheless, she felt obliged to resign because she was unable to carry out the duties for which she was appointed.</P>
    <P>We need a great deal more information about what happened between the board, the council and the Ombudsman.  There should be proper disclosure of the circumstances which brought about the resignation of Ms Marrinan Quinn.  She made some public statements on the matter but she was obliged to be circumspect to a degree.  If legislators are to decide how the Ombudsman will operate in future and whether protective legislative measures are necessary, we must know the facts.  The Minister of State has been shy about giving any indication that there is a problem of major consequence in the insurance industry even though the dogs in the street know there is a massive problem of credibility and independence and with regard to the willingness of the industry to support an Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of legislators to determine the guiding principles under which an ombudsman should operate, regardless of whether that office operates in the public or private sectors.  There should not only be general terms of reference but conditions which must be complied with.  If those conditions are adhered to, the ombudsman will be able to carry out his or her work without fear or favour and we can be assured that there is a strong consumer watchdog in a sector which requires it more than any other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Lest there be misunderstanding of the Minister's role in this matter, Ms Caroline Gill was not appointed by the Minister as Senator Costello asserted.  This is not a matter for the Minister of the day, it is a matter for the industry. The insurance industry established the office of Ombudsman, not the Minister or the Government. However, I agree with the Senator that the Government has a role in attempting to discover exactly what has been going on in the murky world of the insurance industry over the last number of years, particularly with regard to the non-renewal of the previous Ombudsman's contract.</P>
      <P>Six years ago, in response to a growing chorus of consumer complaints, the insurance industry offered to police its members and practices through the appointment of an Ombudsman on a non-statutory basis.  The role of the Ombudsman was severely restricted from the beginning.  For example, she could not investigate or arbitrate on complaints against insurance brokers in relation to the misselling of policies or their values.  I will return to this point later.</P>
      <P>May I read an anecdote quoted in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> of 15 February 1998, which illustrates the male dominated environment in which Paulyn Marrinan Quinn was appointed.  The article refers to the cold February evening in 1992:</P>
      <P>. when Paulyn Marrinan Quinn, the newly appointed insurance Ombudsman was invited to attend a dinner of insurance industry representatives in Cork.  The atmosphere on such evenings is described by one insurance industry source as &ldquo;like a stag party&rdquo;.  Of the more than 500 guests in attendance that night, only about five were women and most of them had been corralled off at a separate table.  Marrinan Quinn can have been left in no doubt that she was entering a predominantly male preserve. Indeed, many of the &ldquo;jokes&rdquo; that were made that night played on the fact that the guest of honour was a woman.  Was she, they rhetorically asked as they were quaffing their champagne, an ombudsman, an ombudswoman or an ombudslady?  Ho, ho, ho.</P>
      <P>That is the environment in which Paulyn Marrinan Quinn took on this important job and perhaps it is worth reflecting on in the light of what happened her five years later.  According to the <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> Paulyn Marrinan Quinn, in the grand tradition of Queen Victoria, was not amused.</P>

      <P>I agree with the view expressed by Senator Costello that self regulation rarely works because no industry will tolerate having its dirty linen washed in public.  I suggest the insurance and pensions industry has a fair bit of dirty linen.  A look at the annual reports of the <Col N="62" /> Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland since 1992 would give that impression.</P>
      <P>Allegations have been made in the House and outside that the insurance industry has ganged up on Ms Marrinan Quinn.  However, I discovered that the proposal not to appoint her was allegedly put by John Colgan, a former chairman of the Consumers' Association of Ireland.  Is it not interesting to see a former chairman of the Consumers' Association of Ireland sitting on the Ombudsman's council which is appointed by the board of the Irish Insurance Federation and which has recently appointed Miss Caroline Gill, at present an employee of the Consumers' Association of Ireland, as Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland?  As they say in the best court cases, I rest my case.  I understand this proposal was minuted at an Irish Ombudsman's Council meeting and documented in an article headed &lsquo;Ombudsman's row worsens&rsquo;, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 14 June 1998, by Liz Allen.  Mr. Colgan would neither confirm nor deny that he had put the proposal or give any indication why he would have done so and merely said that he did not wish to make any comment.</P>
      <P>The roots of the dispute appear to lie in a decision by the council to review the administration of the Ombudsman's office.  The consultants reportedly recommended the appointment of an office administrator and the position was advertised by the council.  It is suggested that Ms Marrinan Quinn saw the appointment of an office administrator as impinging on her own role. Some good grace may be afforded the Irish Insurance Federation in this regard but when one delves further into the way in which Ms Marrinan Quinn was treated during the years of her appointment other questions are raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those years included some good times.  Since establishing the office of the Ombudsman the industry has saved itself £17 million in court costs. The office cost only £1.5 million.  This represents a good return on their investment.  Over the past five years 53 per cent of the cases referred have related to life assurance and 47 per cent to general insurance.  The four main causes of complaint are the repudiation of policy benefits, disputes over surrender values, poor administration of policies and alleged misrepresentation.  Of all complaints 70 per cent emanated from the life assurance and investment side of insurance business. Repudiation &mdash; where the insurance company declines to pay out on a claim &mdash; and surrender values are the most frequent problems.  Ms Marrinan Quinn has commented that &ldquo;surrender values <i>per se</i> are outside my terms of reference&rdquo;. She went on to point out that &ldquo;if the problem is the poor performance of a fund, sue God&rdquo;. Among the major complaints are the poor investment returns and the perception by Irish policy holders that the Irish insurance industry has not been performing well.  It is interesting to note that in quite a few cases the investments of insurance companies which are selling unit linked policies, tracker bonds, or products which are insurance <Col N="63" /> linked have been in the Japanese stock market which we all know has been on a downward spiral for the past two or three years and officially went into recession last week.  Yet, the Irish insurance industry persisted in investing Irish investors' money in that market.  If that is how they handle their investments, I would have little confidence in their ability to deal with their Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I agree with the idea of statutory regulation. The pensions industry in the United Kingdom missold policies and mistreated the public.  We need some form of State regulation, not only in the insurance industry but in the whole area of investment.  I am not a supporter of total State intervention but I agree with Senator Costello and others in this regard.  That may be where the beginning of the solution to this problem lies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I first raised this issue on 23 April last because I had attended a celebration of the first five years of the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland some weeks before.  On that occasion the Ombudsman seemed in very good spirits as were those of the insurance companies whom I knew and all seemed quite satisfactory.  A couple of days later I discovered that Ms Marrinan Quinn had resigned.  Presuming that she was moving to bigger and better things I did not query a reason for her resignation.  However, when some time later Mr. Bill McLaughlin resigned from the council of the Ombudsman's office I was puzzled. I stress that the Insurance Ombudsman of Ireland did not approach me to raise this issue in the House.  I approached her to try to find out what was going on in her office.  I wish to make that quite clear because the day after I raised the matter in the House a member of the council of the Ombudsman's office, Mr. John Colgan, telephoned me to ask if I had been put up to raising the question of the Ombudsman and if I had been duped.  I was not put up to anything and I do not think I am duped that easily.  It annoyed me so much that I wrote to the chairman of the board, Mr. Ernest Margetson, to ask him whether Mr. Colgan telephoned me on his own behalf or on that of the council.  I have not yet received a reply.  I informed the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, of this as I thought he might be interested to know how some people approach elected representatives.</P>
      <P>The situation in the office became intolerable, and money was an important part of this.  As Senator Mooney said, great savings were made in the office.  However, there was constant difficulty in obtaining money to run it.  There is no better way of curtailing the activities of an organisation than by keeping it short of funds.  This shows that he who pays the piper calls the tune.  For an office which was having such difficulty in obtaining funding, it had no trouble advertising for a controller at a salary of £25,000 to £30,000 who would not be under the auspices of the Insurance Ombudsman.  It must appear to the public that a keeper was being installed in that office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> The insurance industry wishes to regulate itself. However, following this grave episode, this must be impossible.  I support the Senators who said the Ombudsman's office will have to put on a statutory basis.  Senator Maurice Hayes spoke about the word &ldquo;ombudsman&rdquo;.  This powerful word is abused by its common application and there is little control over it.  I am delighted that another friend of mine has been appointed as the new Insurance Ombudsman.  If Senator Coghlan thought the first Ombudsman was no pussycat, Ms Gill will be more than able to deal with the board and the council.</P>
    <P>The dispute has attracted undesirable attention to the office and Ms Marrinan Quinn said it has been badly damaged as a result.  The British-Irish Ombudsmans' Association is meeting tomorrow and this matter is on the agenda.  It is being taken seriously at an international level.  All those who serve in offices such as this guard their integrity and independence carefully and they do not like to see one of their number being treated in such a manner.</P>
    <P>I wish the new incumbent well.  Her predecessor was treated extraordinarily shabbily. Senators detailed the difficulties people have experienced with the insurance industry &mdash; Senator Norris spoke about health insurance, Senator Maurice Hayes about how a policy was not what he expected and Senator Mooney listed various complaints.  These are the complaints of ordinary people, not rich corporations.  Taking insurance companies to court is an expensive and difficult process.  I ask the Minister to take seriously Members' requests to put this office on a statutory basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an expert on the insurance industry &mdash; I have had difficulties with it and I have been involved in many different schemes.  However, I have a clear view on self-regulation and how it should work.  I regret that I was not here to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy's contribution.  There was an extraordinary irony in some of his contribution. He used all the language which is important &mdash; he said the Ombudsman should have unfettered autonomy and that the office should be able to operate effectively and judiciously.  He went on to say it should be genuinely independent, fair and accessible.  These are the standard hallmarks of the office.  However, it is unacceptable to even the most casual observer for the Minister to say that the annual reports bear the authoritative stamp of the Ombudsman throughout and to extrapolate from that that the Ombudsman was enabled to operate effectively and judiciously within the terms of reference.  I do not accept that the facts, as given by Ms Marrinan Quinn &mdash; whom I do not know and have never met &mdash; can be reconciled with that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Minister to say that he met with the council last December and that he raised issues on which he asked them to reflect.  He did not mention that they have yet to <Col N="65" /> come back to him.  He said he will talk to them in a few weeks.  That is closing the stable door after the horse has gone.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have to justify the actions of the insurance company.  He has no more and no less a stake in this matter than the rest of us.  If the Ombudsman's office does not function, it is not an attack on the Minister. However, State Departments seem to have an extraordinary urge to defend matters over which they have no control.  If there is a problem, they should say there is a problem.  If the Minister asked the board to reflect on a matter last December he should tell us today that they have not come back to him with the outcome but that he knows what has happened in the meantime.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman retired for reasons which worry me.  She said there was interference in her carrying out her duties, which is in opposition to the idea of unfettered autonomy.  There was an extraordinary and appalling attempt by the council to gain access to the draft report of the Ombudsman before publication so it could modify it.  This is questionable in terms of the independent operation of the council and it also undermines public confidence in the scheme.  The Minister needs to say this to the council.  He should not put himself in the firing line by defending the indefensible.  It is either wrong or right.  There is no need for the Minister to take the flak.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris asked for this matter to be discussed. He did not do this to have a go at the Minister but to hear his view on the matter.  The Ombudsman also retired because of the withholding of funds, which is a serious matter.  She said the bank manager was unwilling to honour cheques drawn on the normal business of the office.  This is a sure method of control.  Of the three issues involved, the interference in the running of the office is the least damaging and the withholding of funds &mdash; which makes the job impossible &mdash; is the worst.  The most unacceptable of all is that the council felt it had the right to modify the report of the Ombudsman.  If there is to be confidence in the system we, as representatives of consumers, must have a clear understanding that this is the unvarnished report of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Those I have heard discussing this issue over the past two months have argued in support of the Ombudsman.  People in bars, sitting rooms and at house parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps &mdash; I am not a frequenter of that establishment.  This is what people are saying when it is mentioned casually and is the residual impression and impact.  If the Ombudsman retired for completely innocent and innocuous reasons which had nothing to do with the matters raised, but the residual view given the consumer was that she was hounded, forced or squeezed out of office, then the long-term impact <Col N="66" /> would be the same.  We have lost the confidence of the consumer in the industry and this must be addressed.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe in self regulation.  It is the best form of regulation and I have argued for it in the House many times.  I have also argued for it in finalising negotiations with the Department of Education and Science on a teaching council, a matter which will come before the House in the form of legislation over the next two years. Teachers will regulate their profession.  The same thing is being discussed with the department of education in Northern Ireland and at Westminster. We have raised one clear issue, namely, that while the majority membership of such a council should be practitioners of the profession, a significant minority should include people outside the profession representing different interests so that they are in a position to point out and raise issues.  A change reflecting this is taking place in the medical board and some of the councils governing the legal profession which are beginning to open up slightly and bring in the odd outsider who is not a practitioner or professional.  Much more of this must be done.  Such self regulation works.  There is a serious attempt by the stock exchange to regulate its own affairs.  It is up against a number of smart operators but I trust what it is trying to do.</P>
      <P>These are examples of where self regulation works.  However, it is patently not working in the insurance industry.  The office of the Ombudsman has now lost credibility.  The new Ombudsman will have to spend more time restoring credibility than doing the job for which an Ombudsman is appointed.  Perhaps this serves the interests of the people who hounded the previous office holder out of office.  The only way to deal with this matter is to establish the office on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Last week in the House the Minister, Deputy Treacy, dealt with legislation relating to protection for investors in various financial services including insurance.  The question of bonding was raised.  The Bill included provision for a new form of protection and insurance and proposed eliminating the existing system of bonding which agents' representatives and others working for insurance companies are required to have.  I made the point that we should not get rid of bonding but allow it continue in parallel with the new form of protection. I argued the toss with the Minister, who informed us that bonding does not work, that we cannot be dependent on it, that it does not cover the level of liability and was not a form of protection. I was appalled to hear this, having being party to the discussion of the legislation when it came before the House in the early 1990s.  The Minister made it clear that sharp operators could get around the issue of bonding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of these facts, what other Senators have said, our experience of dealing with the industry and the way in which the Ombudsman has been treated, I am beginning to think the insurance industry has a huge job in restoring our confidence.  The Government should consider <Col N="67" /> introducing legislation to establish the office of the Ombudsman on a statutory basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann condemns the Government's handling of recent industrial relations issues; further condemns the Government's failure to address the issue of Trade Union recognition; and noting the public warnings from prominent Trade Union Leaders, expresses its concern that dissatisfaction among the national workforce may endanger the continuation of Partnership 2000 and put the negotiation of future national partnerships in jeopardy.</P>
      <P>This is a timely Private Members' motion considering the amount of industrial unrest in the country.  The record of this Government to date in handling industrial relations issues and in bringing forward plans for trade union recognition has been appalling.  The Government has ignored ongoing trade union calls for tax reform and employment legislation.  This is a demonstration of its lack of commitment to enhance social partnership, given the frequent warnings by trade union leaders that social partnership is weakening after 12 years and that the prospect of a new national wage agreement to succeed Partnership 2000 is fading fast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must restore confidence in social partnership by addressing the key points of this motion.  First, the upsurge in industrial action has cast a shadow over the relative lack of unrest in Ireland during the national wage agreements, which have contributed so much to the country's present prosperity.  The biggest dispute involves the Garda, which marks a clear inability on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to act prudently and in a manner which embraces the tradition of partnership and negotiation built up by successive Governments in the past decade.  Despite ongoing promptings by Deputy Upton and calls from the GRA, it has taken the Minister until now to consider the archaic and unfair restrictions on the Garda's ability to negotiate.  The restrictions that govern Garda were imported in the 1920s when the State was emerging from civil war.  Circumstances have changed since then and we now live in a nation which has been deeply enhanced by the ability of workers and employers to negotiate the structure of social partnership.  The last Government extended social partnership status to key voluntary and community organisations representing the poor and marginalised.  These groups enhanced the social partnership process, and including Garda representatives at some level in <Col N="68" /> this process would further develop future national agreements.</P>
    <P>Gardaí should also be allowed to choose to join a trade union and to be represented in negotiations on their pay and conditions.  Most of our EU counterparts have developed mechanisms to allow members of their national police forces to negotiate.  Given our partnerships, there is no reason for Ireland to lag behind in this regard.</P>
    <P>The unrest among local authority craft workers is also of considerable concern, though I do not condone their actions, which did not adhere to proper procedures.  That unrest is an indication of emerging discontent among the general workforce. The fact that the majority of workers have accepted very moderate pay increases to ensure Ireland's economic wellbeing is at the heart of this unrest.  The failure to invest in workers to ensure that their skills are always up to date and marketable in a competitive, market driven economy is linked to this.</P>
    <P>The Ryanair dispute this spring grew from the refusal to allow workers the right to be represented in negotiations by a trade union official. Management in Ryanair undermined the industrial relations machinery which has served us so well in the past.  The Labour Court meant nothing to Ryanair and it took intervention at the highest level before conciliation would be considered.  We do not need another Ryanair dispute; we need legislation which will give workers the right to be represented at negotiations by expertly trained and informed trade union officials.  We must uphold the merits in our trade union machinery.</P>
    <P>This year the Labour Party brought forward a fair and balanced Bill on trade union recognition which was based on the success of social partnership, which in turn was based on the ability of worker and employer representatives to negotiate and compromise.  It was regrettable that the Government did not accept that Bill and it is even more regrettable that no efforts have been made to advance the rights of workers to have representation in negotiations.  Employers can no longer cite the lack of trade union recognition in Britain as a reason for Irish workers not to have representation.  The British system has moved on and a White Paper is now before Parliament which sets out mechanisms for trade union recognition. Irish workers have a constitutional right to join a trade union, and the anti-trade union attitudes of some companies diminishes and devalues that right.  We need legislation to enhance that right.  The Government should move forward on this issue, despite the fact that it stamped on the Labour Party Bill on trade union recognition.</P>
    <P>The December budget was a kick in the teeth for social partnership.  The tax package was bad for the majority of workers and created a disincentive to work.  It was particularly bad for small business.  Trade unions and representatives of the unemployed and those living in poverty had made it clear in advance of the budget, and during the negotiations for Partnership 2000, that tax breaks <Col N="69" /> must be targeted at low and middle income earners. However, the Minister for Finance selected the highest paid workers for tax cuts, and this undermined the important relationships that have emerged between workers and the Government for the last 12 years.</P>
    <P>Over 63 per cent of Irish workers still pay tax at the standard rate.  If the majority of workers are to benefit from tax reform, the emphasis of reform must focus on increasing personal allowances and widening the bands to prevent people from moving into the upper band at an early stage.  Huge cuts in capital gains and acquisition taxes mean nothing to the majority of workers and are of no value to them; but, of course, they benefit the fat cats.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the current situation of tax reform on the incentive to work.  The direction of tax reform is crucial in terms of how a person determines whether it is worth taking up a job.  While the implementation of the minimum wage will increase the incentive to work, tax reform is also essential.  A minimum wage alone will not diminish the disincentive to work nor will it lift low paid workers from poverty traps.  A minimum wage package will only be effective if it is coupled with tax reforms targeted at the low paid.</P>
    <P>The budgetary tax reform measures which became effective in April give in the region of an extra £1 per week only to a single person on an hourly pay rate of £4.40. For a married couple without children where only one spouse works and earns the minimum wage, the tax changes delivered through the December budget result in a weekly income reduction of about £1 per week. That is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>Minimum wage and tax reform packages are inextricably linked, a view vindicated in the OECD submission to the Minimum Wage Commission. Tax reform must centre on substantially increasing personal allowances and widening the bands.  If the Government does not adopt this approach to tax reform in the autumn and gives a repeat performance of the December budget, it will have made a farce of its commitment to a minimum wage.  While improvements in take home pay are essential to improving the spirit and well-being of workers, there is also a considerable need to look at wider issues around profit sharing, better in-work training and the flat rate increase in pay.  The Labour Party is on record as saying it supports better rewards for workers through profit sharing and flat rate increases.  I put it to the Government to come clean with its policy on these issues and to state if it is willing to move on them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of giving some rewards to our workers is through the better in-work conditions. The recent report from the Commission on the Family pointed to the shortfalls in the area of child care and the need to put in place structures which would make child care more accessible and affordable.  The issue of parental leave should be part and parcel of this package, but sadly once <Col N="70" /> again the Government did not listen to the trade unions on this issue when it came to publish its Bill on parental leave last week or to the view expressed in the Seanad yesterday.  As Senator Cox knows, we had a great discussion on the minimalist attitude taken by the Government in introducing the measures.</P>
    <P>I condemn the Government for paring back on the rights afforded by the directive on parental leave.  The EU directive provided that leave could be taken until a child was aged eight years but the Government managed to reduce the age to five years.  It is also disheartening that no provision was made to put in place some form of payment for parents while on leave.  The take up of parental leave by parents on low pay is likely to be badly affected by the lack of support measures.  Given that the majority of people pay tax only at the standard rate and, therefore, are not very well paid, the take up of the parental leave scheme will be low.</P>
    <P>There are many instances where this Government has failed abysmally to build on social partnership. I contend the principles of Partnership 2000, namely, inclusion, employment and competition, are fading fast and, increasingly, more people are feeling excluded and disenchanted with their employment.  This debate is happening at a crucial time when the Government is framing its plans for this year's budget.  If it is clear about wanting to continue our strong economic performance, it must demonstrate a commitment to those who have given us the climate for such performance in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  The current spate of industrial relations disputes and the Government's appalling handling of them has the capacity to destroy Partnership 2000.  I do not make that statement lightly.  Anybody involved in balloting in the trade union movement over the past two to three years on any issue will have sensed a rising tide of dissatisfaction among workers.  Many of these workers are employed in the more exposed sectors of the economy and have little protection from the organised trade union movement.  They see that despite the great improvement in the economy, their position has not changed or, in some cases, has slid backwards through casualisation and other forms of so-called labour market flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the progress made this week to seek a resolution of the Garda dispute.  However, the Government, in particular the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, cannot blame anybody but themselves for this industrial dispute. In the run up to last year's general election the point at issue was the establishment of a special commission on pay for the Garda Síochána. The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, clearly stepped over the mark by indicating that what was sought would be given without a problem.  I recall the cosy pre-election photocalls and television pictures of the Minister and his colleagues outside the House in support of the commission <Col N="71" /> on Garda pay.  It was all smiles last year but, unfortunately, the smile has been wiped from the Minister's face.</P>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's inability to deal with the promises he made, the country was forced to lose the services of the Garda for two days in recent months.  The hollow promises made by the Minister have clearly come back to haunt him in Government, while in the process, he has ensured that the safety and welfare of the citizens have been put in jeopardy in an unprecedented manner.  The Minister clearly failed to make any progress on this issue and lost the confidence of those negotiating on behalf of the Garda some time ago.  Incapable of making any progress, the Minister was taken off the pitch to make way for the Taoiseach to tog out and put his legendary negotiating skills to use to resolve the dispute.</P>
    <P>I welcome the progress made this week but the outcome of this dispute is being watched closely by other sectors of the workforce.  If the pay award is seen to go over the top in terms of the maximum amounts allowed under the national pay agreements, it will do immense damage to Partnership 2000 and will trigger a rash of pay claims from other sectors who will ask why should they accept the moderate pay increases contained in Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>How does this dispute square with the recent comments by the Taoiseach that there were signs the Republic could be moving for a free for all in terms of issues such as wage negotiation?  The Taoiseach issued warnings to trade unions urging pay restraint and it will be a challenge to him to see if he can deliver on the moderate increases contained in that agreement while at the same time cope with increasing pressures from many sectors of the economy.  The Government will soon learn that one cannot have it both ways.  It cannot tell trade unions to ask their members to adhere to the constraints of Partnership 2000 and say there are special exceptions <i>ad infinitum</i> without the problem blowing up in its face.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not the only member of the Government to make false promises to a group of workers.  I regret to say the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Tom Kitt, pledged in Opposition to put the Protection of Shop Workers Bill on the Statute Book.  It was a well drafted Bill accepted on Second Stage by the outgoing Government.  However, seven short months after the Minister made these commitments, he shamefully abandoned his promise.  I do not make that statement lightly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It was accepted on Second Stage.  In a barefaced performance before the Dáil, Minister of State Kitt outlined his reasons for rejecting a Bill he published when in Opposition. <Col N="72" /> My colleagues re-tabled that Bill on the Seanad Order Paper some time ago and would welcome an assurance from the Minister that he will accept it at the earliest opportunity.  He could at least do what his predecessor did, accept the Bill on Second Stage and co-operate with us in improving it.  By rejecting the Bill which the Labour Party reintroduced, the Government has shown it does not care about the rights of workers in the retail sector.  My party sought to reintroduce the Bill to offer a measure of protection to workers who were often forced to work on Sundays. By rejecting it, the Government has damaged its reputation in the eyes of many workers and trade unions and has displayed its cynical and callous attitude to shop workers.  The Government cannot be allowed to play fast and loose with a broad agreement on social partnership such as Partnership 2000.  If that happens, the agreement will become a document which is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
      <P>Trade unions must abide by the spirit and letter of Partnership 2000.  On the issue of trade union recognition, the Government also stands guilty of not making the right to trade union representation enforceable in a feasible way for all workers.  The right enshrined in our Constitution to join a trade union is not underpinned by the necessary legislation.  As witnessed in recent months., employers such as Ryanair were in a position to unilaterally reject its employees' rights to be represented by a trade union of their choice. The Labour Party has proposed a sensible Bill which would not compel an employer to recognise a trade union but would allow for disputes over trade union recognition to be resolved by the recognised industrial relations machinery in this country.</P>
      <P>When the Bill was originally introduced the excuse was made that it would result in a loss of Ireland's competitive advantage because the same provisions would not be put forward in Britain.  The British Government has now introduced new proposals in regard to trade union recognition which should do away with any argument on competitive advantage and allow the Government to consider the Trade Union Recognition Bill at an early stage.  If social partnership means anything, we must ensure partnership exists in the workplace.  Indeed, if the Government is serious about national partnership, it must give workers the right to decide if they wish to be professionally represented by unions in their negotiations with their employers.  Any failure to do this will result in an end to partnership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Costello pointed out, the Government is also endangering Partnership 2000 by reneging on its tax commitments to middle and low income earners.  The first Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats budget delivered pay back for the well heeled and better off while the 60 per cent of people on middle and low incomes lost out.  It was a budget which favoured property over people.  The Government cannot be allowed to welch on the tax reform measures agreed as <Col N="73" /> part of the Partnership 2000 tax and pay deal.  My party will be pushing the Government to implement its promises on increased personal allowances, the expansion of the standard rate tax band and an increase in exemption limits.  With growth in the economy remaining strong, it is imperative that low paid workers are taken out of the tax net altogether by raising the basic exemption level.</P>
    <P>We are now experiencing the tremors before the earthquake.  Anyone with their fingers on the pulse of the workforce will be aware that dissatisfaction levels are growing.  The benefits of partnership are there for all of us to see; but if the Government does not change its tack on this issue, I regret we will face even greater problems than those encountered in the worst days of the 1980s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Seanad Éireann acknowledges the major improvements in the industrial relations climate in this country since the advent of the national economic and social partnership agreements in 1987; recognises the importance to economic and social development of maintaining the good industrial relations record of recent years; calls on all the parties to the current agreement, Partnership 2000, to adhere to its pay terms; and accepts that the addressing of the complex issue of trade union recognition requires the co-operation and agreement of the social partners.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment outlines the fact that major improvements have occurred in the industrial relations climate in Ireland since 1987.  We need only look at our economy to realise we are experiencing better economic performance than ever before.  Indeed, our recent economic performance has been outstanding.  Growth in GNP and productivity levels has been the highest in the OECD countries in the past four years.  We have experienced huge growth in exports and employment and are currently facing real skill shortages. Real income levels, namely, the money which people have in their pockets at the end of the day, are greater than ever before and tourism has reached record levels.  Many factors have contributed to this economic success, among them the economic and social partnerships which have existed since 1987.  A great deal of hard work has been done both by employees and employers in this country and it is time the people who establish and run businesses and work 60, 70, 80 and 90 hours a week receive due recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Employers and employees are in partnership together; the days when employers were in charge and employees did their bidding are long gone.  If they were not, we would not be enjoying our current economic prosperity.  Having too many employees and insufficient employers will not work.  We have previously been at a stage where <Col N="74" /> sufficient jobs were not available for the number of people who wanted them.  When trade unions realise &mdash; as some of them have done &mdash; that it is their responsibility as much as employers' to promote an environment where profit making and sharing is the rule, they will recognise they are working in co-operation and are part of a partnership process.</P>

      <P>The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, stressed that the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> had provided real income gains for Irish taxpayers.  Speaking at a meeting of the foundation members of the Institute of European Affairs, Deputy Quinn said the programme had created more jobs and increased income.  Prior to the PCW, we had the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> and we now have Partnership 2000.  These partnership agreements have allowed us to work in co-operation with each other as social partners in order to grow and develop the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Many years ago I spent a great deal of time in Limerick learning about trade unionism and its history in Ireland.  We have come a long way from the good old days of table bashing and insult swapping.  The Irish trade union system has always been voluntary although many people feel that trade union recognition should be enshrined in legislation.  Mr. Paddy Gunnigle of the University of Limerick has stated that many foreign investors developing green field companies in Ireland come here to establish a non-union working environment.  A study carried out in the university revealed that ownership of the parent company is the most critical factor in determining attitudes towards unions, with US investors likely to be more hostile towards unions than those based in other EU states.  There is no point in having people in need of jobs if we do not have jobs for them.  If we create an environment where union recognition is forced down the throats of people providing the investment necessary to maintain our economy, we have no hope of continuing to grow and develop it.  We must continue to work in a partnership mode.</P>
      <P>Workplace conflict should serve as a trigger for problem solving, not warfare.  In an ideal world working relationships should be built on trust, but a more practical approach would be to find issues of common interest between unions and employers.  This is the way forward.  We must at all times realise that what is good for the employee is good for the employer.  This approach is working well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refute a number of points made by the proposers of the motion.  Regarding the Ryanair dispute, the closure of a national airport was a disgrace.  The dispute which caused that development continued and that should not have been allowed.  There are lessons to be learned from the Ryanair dispute, but they must be viewed in <Col N="75" /> terms of conciliation and voluntarism.  If trade unions are to be recognised the people involved must be comfortable with whatever framework is put in place.  Employers cannot be forced into an environment that is unreceptive and acts as a barrier to continued inward investment.</P>
    <P>The Opposition mentioned the tax package in the last budget and said it was bad.  I refute this suggestion.  The tax package put in place by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was not bad.  It was not geared towards rich people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

      <P>In a climate of continued economic growth there is always a feeling that certain groups are not benefiting to the same extent.  We must keep on top of this matter and I have no doubt the Minister is doing that.  He has made enormous strides in the area of labour affairs.  I have no doubt that the Government will continue to work in co-operation with the social partners and that when the time comes to negotiate a new package, everybody will wish to participate. People will seek the best outcome for their side but ultimately it will be recognised that continued social partnership is good for Ireland.</P>
      <P>The Government is doing a good job.  It has addressed the issue of industrial relations well.  It will address the matter of trade union recognition in a balanced way which will work.  It intends to build on the voluntary system and I have no doubt that it will do its best to ensure that everybody benefits from the current economic climate and strong performance of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion condemns the Government for its handling of recent industrial relations issues.  Everybody is concerned about the lack of surefootedness shown by the Government, <Col N="76" /> particularly regarding the Garda pay dispute. No other servants of the State have been as loyal as the Garda over the years and I do not know how their pay scales were allowed to fall behind.  Many of the current difficulties stem from the fact that promises were made by Members when they were in Opposition.  I do not know the nature of those promises but they led to much difficulty.  In common with other Senators, I welcome the progress made this week.  Perhaps the Minister could enlighten the House further in that regard.  There has been a flurry of activity this week regarding the recent spate of disputes. However, there are indications that more disputes are in the pipeline and this cannot be good for anybody.</P>
      <P>I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on trade union recognition.  Partnership 2000 called for the setting up of a high level group, comprising the social partners, to examine this issue further.  I understand the group submitted an interim report and meets on an ongoing basis to consider the matter.  I understand the report recommended the continuance of voluntarism with regard to trade union recognition.  My party has always supported this concept and continues to believe that it is the best way to maintain the valuable social partnership which has led to industrial peace for over ten years.</P>
      <P>My party recognises that a further mechanism should be put in place to tackle the problem of employers who will not deal with staff who wish to be represented by a trade union.  Obviously, everybody has a right to join a trade union if they wish.  My party welcomes the fact that this issue continues to be on the agenda of the high level group and we await the outcome of its further deliberations.</P>
      <P>The Fine Gael Party also recognises that voluntarism must ultimately remain the guiding principle of industrial relations if tens of thousands of existing and potential jobs are not to be put at risk.  Many thousands of jobs created by inward investment are non-unionised and employers and employees enjoy good industrial relations.  The IDA has been able to sell Ireland as a good location for international companies specifically because the industrial relations code is based on voluntarism.</P>
      <P>We must not forget that, traditionally, the system has been voluntary, largely relying on agreement between parties and backed up by a sophisticated framework of conciliation and arbitration agencies such as the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission to achieve agreement if the parties fail to reach it unaided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion states that dissatisfaction among the national workforce may endanger the continuation of Partnership 2000 and put the negotiation of future national partnerships in jeopardy. This is an important matter.  There are serious concerns about tax reform, inflation and monetary union.  The budget failed to deliver the type of increases in personal allowances and tax bands for lower income groups that were anticipated <Col N="77" /> when Partnership 2000 was agreed. Undoubtedly, further pay demands will be made, particularly if inflation increases because of EMU or the economy overheats.</P>
    <P>Sadly, inflation is at its highest level in three years.  It is now 2.7 per cent, well above the EU average.  Ireland has the third highest rate in the European Union at present.  If prices continue to rise at the current rate, economists reckon inflation will be at least 3 per cent, if not more, by the end of the year and there is a danger that it could reach 5 per cent.  This is a huge worry and there are daily warnings about the economy overheating.</P>
    <P>However, I agree with IBEC's statement recently about Partnership 2000 and the need for continued implementation of the tax reduction commitments made by the Government. However, these reductions must be concentrated on the lower paid.  The economy has done well, in spite of the current dangers, but there is a widespread belief among many people in the workforce that they have fallen behind and failed to benefit in a commensurate way from the gains of the economy overall.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank expects pressure on inflation to ease next year.  I hope that will be the case. However, we must not forget its inability, in terms of the new regime Ireland will enter soon, to raise interest rates or vary the exchange rate as a mechanism that could be employed to deal with that matter.  In the light of what we are entering into with the new regime, we must not forget their inability to raise interest rates or vary the exchange rate as a mechanism which could be employed to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I am very worried about the signs which exist at present regarding the dangers posed to Partnership 2000.  I look forward with interest to hearing the Minister of State.  Confidence has dimmed and it will be a sad day for the country if it continues to diminish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. T. Kitt)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to speak in support of the amendment. I am pleased to be involved in this very important debate.  Hopefully, Senator Costello and others will accept the bona fides of my approach to this issue because we have been dealing with it for several months.</P>
      <P>Senators will acknowledge the very significant progress we have made in the past decade; it has, in fact, been acknowledged by all those who have spoken so far in the debate.  Our recent economic success has been phenomenal and is recognised internationally as such.  The rate of growth in the economy and the numbers at work are unprecedented. A major contributory factor to these achievements has been the national economic and social partnership that began in 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the year I was first elected to Dáil Éireann.  They were tough times for people coming from whatever profession &mdash; in my case it was teaching.  When one put a case to the Minister for <Col N="78" /> Finance the continuous reply was no. There was no money for anything.  While they were tough times, solid discipline was provided by the Government of the day.  It is accepted that 1987 was a very important benchmark.</P>
    <P>I think it would be useful to remind ourselves of just how far we have travelled in the past decade. In 1987 the Government was faced with a number of significant challenges including a very difficult public expenditure situation &mdash; to which Senator Coghlan has referred &mdash; rising unemployment and high emigration, and threats to our standard of living which had improved considerably but was still some way below the European average.  In the face of these challenges and assisted by the long experience of centralised pay bargaining a national consensus was created which produced the first of the present series of national economic and social partnership agreements &mdash; the Programme for National Recovery.</P>
    <P>This process of social partnership, which was initiated in 1987, has resulted in four national programmes agreed between Government and the social partners &mdash; employers, trade unions, farm organisations and, more recently, community organisations, including representatives of the unemployed.  Increasingly, the programmes have become much more than centralised wage bargaining.  They represent a negotiated consensus between the social partners on a wide range of issues, including taxation and the management of public expenditure, employment, competitiveness, education and training and greater social inclusion.</P>
    <P>Our current agreement, Partnership 2000, represents a strategic approach to the sustained development of the economy and progress on social inclusion.  Agreement was achieved because the parties &mdash; the social partners and the Government &mdash; together recognised the challenges which needed to be faced and the advantages which required to be utilised in the future development of the economy to the benefit of society as a whole.</P>
    <P>As with previous programmes, compromise was required by all parties.  That compromise, a problem solving approach which is based on a common understanding of the key mechanisms and relationships in the economy, has served us well.  This approach of working together needs to be continued and evolved if we as a nation are to sustain and build upon the success already achieved.</P>
    <P>I would like to illustrate some of the improvements in the economy since the advent of national partnership in 1987.  They include the highest level of economic growth in the history of the State without significant price inflation, an increase of almost 250,000 in the numbers at work, a drop in unemployment on the basis of the Labour Force Surveys from 232,000 to 179,000, an increase in the number of women in the workforce of 44 per cent or 158,000 and taxation measures which have resulted in continuing increases in take home pay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" /> The impact of the national programmes is, perhaps, most evident in the change in the industrial relations climate.  The best barometer of overall industrial relations is the number of work days lost through industrial disputes.  In the period of decentralised pay bargaining between 1982 and 1987, 355,000 work days were lost in 121 strikes on average each year.  By contrast, during the ten year period from 1988 to 1997, when we have had centralised pay agreements, only 110,000 workdays &mdash; less than one third &mdash; have been lost each year in an average of 41 strikes.</P>
    <P>This sustained improvement was especially marked in 1997 when the number of days lost due to industrial action was reduced to 74,000.  This represents a major improvement in our industrial relations.  It is very important in terms of our image abroad, particularly as regards attracting foreign investment.  It serves to give the lie to the once common view of Ireland as a strike prone country.  It is an achievement that we would not want to jeopardise in any way.</P>
    <P>However, there is no room for complacency.  In an increasingly competitive marketplace we need to ensure that co-operative industrial relations continues to make an important contribution to the competitiveness of Irish enterprise and thus the maintenance of sustainable employment.</P>
    <P>Voluntarism has been the central principle underlying our system of industrial relations for the past 50 years or more.  I recall &mdash; and I address this comment to Senator Costello in particular &mdash; the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was a strong advocate of voluntarism.  It would be no harm if Senator Costello and his colleagues would consult the record on what Deputy Quinn has had to say about this approach in the past.</P>
    <P>This means that the State has intervened to a minimum extent in the employment relationship. It is through the process of collective bargaining between employers and workers and their trade unions that pay and conditions of employment are determined for the majority of workers.  The State's role in industrial relations has been to facilitate the collective bargaining process through providing the dispute settling agencies, namely, the Labour Relations Commission, the Labour Court and the Rights Commissioner Service.</P>
    <P>It is in these agencies that the experience and expertise in industrial conflict resolution lies.  The Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court combined deal with over 2,000 disputes every year which result in voluntary settlements or the issue of non-binding recommendations.  A survey conducted by the Labour Court in 1994 on a sample of recommendations found that 84 per cent were accepted by both parties.  This is also mirrored in the most recent 1996 report of the Labour Relations Commission which indicated that 81 per cent of disputes referred to the commission that year were settled at the conciliation stage.  These results clearly demonstrate that the <Col N="80" /> voluntarist approach to industrial relations and conflict resolution works.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that there have been some high profile disputes in the recent past.  In most of these instances the difficulties have been resolved with the assistance of the Labour Relations Commission and/or the Labour Court. In one particular dispute, Ryanair, which has been referred to by some Senators, the Government decided, in consultation with ICTU and IBEC, to initiate an inquiry under section 38(2) of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990.  The report of the inquiry team is expected within the next few weeks and may well provide much food for thought by the parties to the dispute and to others concerned.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise strongly enough that the primary responsibility for the resolution of any industrial dispute rests with the parties directly involved in the first instance.  Where a dispute cannot be resolved locally, the parties have the option of referring it to the agencies for conciliation and/or adjudication.</P>
    <P>I would like now to refer to the public sector disputes which are currently in progress, namely, those involving the Garda Síochána and the local authority and health board craft workers.  I will deal with the origin and issues involved in some detail.  This will, I think, demonstrate that the Government's handling of these disputes is entirely correct.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors concluded an agreement under the local bargaining clause of PESP/PCW pay agreements which they accepted at the time as being in full and final settlement of the PESP agreement.</P>
    <P>In September 1996 the GRA lodged a pay claim at the Garda Conciliation Council and in November of that year the association sought the establishment of a commission to examine the issue of Garda pay.  The demand for a special commission on Garda pay was not accepted by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>Following intensive discussions which the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials had with the Garda associations last year, a mechanism was identified whereby Garda pay issues could be discussed. The mechanism was related to the Government decision last November to set up a steering group to implement what is known as the Garda SMI report.</P>
    <P>Discussions commenced under the chairmanship of Mr. Declan Brennan, former member of the Labour Court, just before Christmas.  Following a number of meetings, the official side made an offer of a 5.5 per cent pay increase to the GRA and AGSI.  This is accepted as the standard PESP/PCW settlement.  Any increase above this level would have to include consequential productivity and savings.  However, neither association was satisfied with the offer and withdrew from the pay talks.  The independent chairman of the pay talks subsequently invited the GRA and <Col N="81" /> AGSI to separate meetings to discuss developments. Arising from these contacts, the chairman made a recommendation that the offer be increased by a further 1.5 per cent based on anticipated productivity and savings.  The recommendation was accepted by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and was conveyed to the general secretaries of both associations.  The AGSI returned to the negotiating table and discussions on its pay claim resumed.  However, the GRA did not return but embarked on a campaign of protest actions.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform met with the officers of the association on several occasions and also met the full central executive committee on two occasions and urged them, without success, to return to the negotiations. The GRA engaged in a day of protest on Friday, 1 May 1998.  The Minister addressed the association's annual delegate conference on 12 May 1998 and urged delegates to desist from their protest action and to return to the pay discussions.</P>
    <P>Informal contacts have been continuing since the conference to try to agree a formula which would allow the association to call off its protest action and return to the pay discussions.  Unfortunately, these contacts have not been successful so far and the association embarked on a further day of protest on Saturday, 13 June 1998.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated on several occasions that the door to advance the pay negotiations remains open and he has indicated also that access to national pay talks was among the issues which could be discussed.  Only this week the Taoiseach confirmed that he was prepared to constructively address the exclusion of the Garda Síochána from national pay talks.  He indicated that urgent consultations had been arranged with ICTU and IBEC and that officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform would be available to resume discussions immediately with the Garda associations.</P>
    <P>As Senators will be aware, IBEC and ICTU did provide a positive response and indicated that they are prepared to facilitate consultations on the development of arrangements which will provide the Garda associations with a meaningful input into national pay talks.  On 15 June, AGSI announced that it was suspending its involvement in the pay talks to fully explore the implications of the new initiative involving IBEC and ICTU.</P>
    <P>In the light of the joint statement issued by the Government, IBEC and ICTU on Monday regarding the development of arrangements which will provide the Garda associations with a meaningful input into the national pay talks and the issue of Garda pay, senior officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform held meetings with the officer board of the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sargeants and Inspectors.  Officials of the Department clarified the statement to the <Col N="82" /> association's representatives and undertook to forward to them a document setting out the official position.  A further meeting to clarify the document was held this morning with the GRA. It is understood the GRA central executive committee will discuss the document at its meeting today and that the AGSI national executive will consider the document over the next two days. The GRA announced this afternoon that its industrial action has been suspended.</P>
    <P>Over the past six months there has also been industrial unrest in the health and local government sectors involving craft workers.  The Government was disappointed at the narrow rejection by the craft unions last week of the proposed deal.  This latest package was considered to be an attractive one at the outer limits of public service pay parameters in the current climate.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that following rejection of the latest clarification by the Labour Court, notice of strike action by craft workers was reactivated to take effect on Monday, 22 June. The effect of this will be exacerbated by supportive action by general operative and non-nursing grades.  The unions requested a meeting with the management team yesterday to outline what they have identified as the outstanding issues.  As these efforts to avert the dispute are still ongoing, I do not want to say too much at this stage.</P>
    <P>However, I would comment that my colleagues, the Minister for Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Health and Children, have been very concerned about the recent unofficial wild cat stoppages and their impact on a very vulnerable group &mdash; those who are ill and in hospital, or awaiting surgery.  I would stress that at this stage the Government has adhered to the normal industrial relations procedures and has used the machinery to the fullest extent, including referral to the Labour Court which has already intervened twice in this dispute.</P>
    <P>The Government approach to these disputes has been entirely dictated by the terms of Partnership 2000 and the earlier pay agreements.  The Government in its capacity as an employer is a party to these agreements and cannot therefore concede claims that would breach the terms of Partnership 2000 or the other agreements.  I call on the public sector groups &mdash; indeed on all workers &mdash; not to make claims that cannot be accommodated within the pay terms of Partnership 2000.  We have achieved too much under these programmes to jeopardise them at this stage.  The key to maintaining national partnership is the spirit of compromise and mutual understanding which characterised the negotiations for Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>Trade union recognition is clearly an issue of great importance to trade unions in the context of national partnership.  It must, however, be recognised that it is a complex and difficult issue which needs to be addressed with the co-operation and agreement of the social partners.  This was the approach adopted in the High Level</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="83" /> Group on Trade Union Recognition, set up last year on foot of a commitment in Partnership 2000.  The group, which was representative of ICTU and IBEC, as well as various Government Departments and agencies, was established to consider proposals by ICTU in relation to trade union recognition and IBEC's response to those proposals.  The group reported to the Tánaiste on the matter last year as it was required to do under Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>The social partners have not reached agreement on a follow up to the report of the group. When completed, the report of the current inquiry into the dispute in Ryanair may provide a basis for further consideration of the union recognition issue.  I would not want to pre-empt consideration of this report, nor indeed of the full outcome of the recent Supreme Court judgment in the Nolan Transport case.  I am also aware of developments in the neighbouring jurisdiction where proposals on trade union recognition have been published in a White Paper entitled &ldquo;Fairness at Work&rdquo;.  Consideration of the trade union recognition question will continue in the light of these developments.  Perhaps we need to modernise voluntarism in a way which reflects the concerns of the trade union movement and addresses the need to avoid damage to investment in enterprise and jobs.</P>
    <P>I would, however, like to point out to the House that there has not been an increase in the past few years in the number of union recognition cases being dealt with by the Labour Court.  Furthermore, the union recognition issue must be seen in the context of the high level of union density in Ireland.  With over 50 per cent of employees in unions, we have one of the highest density rates in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the voluntarist approach to industrial relations has served this State well in terms of national and social partnership, industrial relations at workplace level and investment in enterprise and jobs.  We must, therefore, where necessary and possible, encourage the social partners to continue the development of co-operative industrial relations by dialogue and by the pursuit of a problem solving approach where this is appropriate.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara is aware of the situation relating to shopworkers in the retail sector.  The Senator advised the then Minister, Eithne Fitzgerald, on the issue when I raised this matter when in Opposition.  I can report to the House that there has been progress on a voluntary way of dealing with this since I took over the Ministry, under the umbrella of social partnership in relation to the rights of Sunday retail workers.  I will report on that when the Senators have contributed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will only have one chance to make a contribution. <Col N="84" /></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In that I case I will report now. The Senator was right that I introduced a Bill on Private Members' business on the rights of workers to opt out of Sunday work in the retail sector.  As I have explained, when in Opposition one's legal advice is not as comprehensive as it is for Government.  The Senator will learn this.  It is important, however, that Members of both Houses introduce Bills on Private Members' business to highlight important issues.  I felt that it was an important issue and I still think so.  On the basis that the Organisation of Working Time Act had dealt with some aspects of Sunday working, my advice was similar to that given to former Minister Fitzgerald.  She was advised by Senator O'Meara to pursue the partnership approach and to go the legislative route.  The then Minister accepted my motion on Second Stage but it was before an election.</P>
      <P>We should not play games with this issue as it is too serious.  Since becoming Minister of State for Labour Affairs, I have been advised against going down the route I advocated in Opposition.  I decided to ask an expert in industrial relations, Mr. Sean Healy, to chair a working group comprising ICTU, including MANDATE, and IBEC.  For some months the group has been trying to get an agreement on the rights of Sunday workers and has come forward with proposals for a code of practice.  It has not gone through the full process as it will have to go to the Labour Relations Commission which will take another month or two. However, under the able chairmanship of Sean Healy the partners have come up with an agreement. If we can reach agreement on this important issue, even though a code of practice is not as binding as legislation, then it is every bit as strong as going down the legislative route.  I can report reasonable progress on this issue.  We are not there yet, but I have stood by my commitment to the workers in these situations and I look forward to a final resolution.</P>
      <P>This is only one aspect of this issue.  Senator Mooney and others have raised the broader issue of Sunday trading with me.  One will find many different views in both Houses but the broader issue needs to be addressed.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is looking at the size of some of the new retail outlets.  My responsibility is to the workers and I have honoured my commitments. I have tried a different route and I can report some progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State and wish him well in dealing with these disputes. It is not possible to deal with all the issues in the time available.  However, the questions of union recognition, a minimum wage and the budget taxation measures are causing problems for the trade union movement.  If these issues are not resolved satisfactorily there will be no new agreement when this agreement runs out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="85" /> The issue of union recognition must be dealt with.  The minimum wage is hugely important but the Government is taking its eye off the ball.  A minimum wage must be delivered in the course of this programme.  If anyone thinks they can use it as a lever into the next programme we will not even get to the stage of a ballot.</P>
    <P>It is true for the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to say that he delivered on the amount of money agreed under the programme. However, the expectation of workers was that there would be a different method of paying that tax.  I sat at the table in Government Buildings for three months negotiating this agreement and I can confirm this to be the case.  The proposal put to members to ballot on had a tendency towards the lower paid and there will be problems if the Government does not correct this in the next budget.</P>
    <P>An ongoing problem is emerging in dealing with the partnership programme.  We now have to negotiate three times to get things done.  Negotiations take place on the national programme which deals with the macro issues and things are agreed.  We then go to the relevant Department, in my case the Department of Education and Science, and we agree again.  The Department then goes back to the Department of Finance which was part of the original negotiations and the fighting starts all over again.  This procedure makes a joke of the strategic managment initiative because we are going around in circles to get the same result.</P>
    <P>Primary education is at the beginning of a major dispute which will continue for the next 18 months concerning teacher shortages &mdash; lack of remedial teachers, teachers being withdrawn from schools with special needs, schools serving disadvantaged areas and &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo;. A shortage of teachers is part of the problem. Teachers cannot be produced tomorrow morning, so there is only one way to deal with this problem. The dispute could continue to fester and get worse so that people take inflexible positions over the next 18 months.  Ministers will get representations from both Houses and forests will die with the amount of paper being used.  There will be demonstrations, meetings, strikes and industrial action.  However, it could be solved if we agreed to tackle the problem over a three or four year agreement.  This sounds simple and one would imagine it would be in line with the SMI's and the Department of Finance's multi-annual budgeting approach.  However, that is not what is meant.  The Department of Finance will not allow Departments to negotiate over a period of years &mdash; every year must be agreed separately.  There will be no resolution of this dispute until the Department of Finance concedes on this principle.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that we could sit around a table and sort this out.  The Minister and myself would have few differences.  I know what his difficulties are.  The only way the problem can be dealt with is on a multi-annual basis but he is not <Col N="86" /> allowed to deal with it in that way.  This is madness.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's intervention in the Garda dispute on Sunday was unwise, badly advised, badly timed and made no sense.  The Minister spoke of creating an opportunity of getting the gardaí involved in national negotiations and that he would ask IBEC and ICTU.  I am one of the people asked on the ICTU side.  I am well enough acquainted with PR to know that this was a poison chalice.  There was no chance of either IBEC or ICTU saying no to that proposal.  However, I wish to spell out the situation in more detail.</P>
    <P>There is no moral or legal reason to deny gardaí full representation and participation in national negotiations.  Like all other workers, gardaí should be entitled to exercise their constitutional right to associate.  The current industrial unrest is rooted in many things, among them the fact that gardaí do not have a voice and an opportunity to put their case forward nationally.  They are excluded from the normal processes.  ICTU's final position will be that the only way gardaí can become involved is by becoming a fully fledged trade union, applying for affiliation to ICTU and taking their place at the table like every other group of workers.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not have to talk to IBEC or ICTU as no one will object.  The executive council of ICTU will approve the affiliation when it is applied for.  The only people stopping this development is the Government.  There is a series of legislation preventing this move.  It is not the trade union movement, IBEC or ICTU which is stopping the participation of gardaí in national negotiations.  They should be as entitled as any other group of workers to join ICTU and they should be allowed to do so as soon as possible. That is in the gift of Government and it would be supported by all workers.  Whatever constitutional, legal or regulatory impediments exist should be repealed immediately by Government. That is the answer to their participation.  The Government can do this without talking to anyone. It should change whatever law, regulation or rule is required.</P>
    <P>What I find unacceptable about the intervention on Sunday is that, on the one hand, the Government is calling for the involvement of gardaí in national negotiations while, on the other, ensuring that this is blocked by legal or other impediments.  Many of Europe's police forces are members of trade unions affiliated to trade union movements.  I regularly deal with European trade unionists who are police; that is not unusual.  Being members of a trade union does not diminish their effectiveness or their professionalism. Gardaí should be entitled to do the same.</P>
    <P>Irish industrial relations are on the brink of chaos and Partnership 2000 is being undermined daily.  It is not just about amounts of money but about how matters will progress.  Gardaí are not covered by industrial relations legislation.  Consequently, legal imperatives concerning balloting <Col N="87" /> and minimum notice on industrial action do not appear to apply to them and neither do the requirements that there be cover for essential services. That is a strange irony.  If any other group of workers had done what gardaí have done over the past three to four weeks, they would be in breach of the law and would find themselves in the High Court as happened in the Nolan Transport case which brought SIPTU to the High Court.  There is no practical reason for excluding gardaí from industrial relations.  They have shown they can take industrial action and that they can operate like a trade union, so we should face the facts, accept the reality and support them.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the one group not allowed to form a trade union is the one group not affected by the restraints of industrial relations legislation introduced by the then Minister for Labour and now Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  We discussed the matter many times, especially the three issues of balloting, minimum notice and essential services, so he knows this area better than anyone.  No one gains from excluding gardaí from normal industrial relations practice.  Including them is the way forward and it can and should be done.  In the cleaned up words of a famous American President, it is better to have people on the inside spitting out than on the outside spitting in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Labour Party for tabling this motion.  It is timely given the pending industrial dispute of craftworkers which I hope will be resolved, and the ongoing dispute with the Garda.  It is also timely as we are midway through the lifetime of Partnership 2000.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole sits in this House as an elected Member yet he has greater power as a member of the executive committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions dealing with industrial relations, pay bargaining and everything else relating to the social and economic life of this country.  It angers me that people elected to both Houses do not have the same power and influence. I sometimes wonder what brings Senator O'Toole in here because real power seems to lie in all the areas upon which he has been expounding for the past 15 minutes.  That is not a criticism of him or of what he has said, much of which I agree with.  I cite the example of his unique position in the political life of the House because he is the only Member who is directly involved in dealing with the Government on pay bargaining, collective bargaining and other aspects of Partnership 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives, regardless of political affiliation, must defer to their party in Government when it is in negotiations with the social partners.  Such negotiations happen behind closed doors with whispers and leaks from RTÉ journalists who doorstep trade Unionists and representatives of IBEC who become leaders of the country and very important people for a few weeks.  We, the directly elected representatives of the people, <Col N="88" /> must sit and wait on the sidelines and pick up the pieces afterwards to hear what was debated, discussed and eventually agreed.  None of this detracts from the phenomenal success which social partnership has been in Ireland since 1987 and this has been described in great detail by the Minister of State and by Members.</P>
    <P>However, this debate affords me an opportunity to raise an issue.  Senator Costello and I have served on the National Economic and Social Forum and I have raised the issue time and again at meetings.  It is an inherent flaw and a democratic deficit in the concept of social partnership in Ireland that directly elected politicians must wait until the job is done and the &ldquo;ts&rdquo; crossed and the &ldquo;is&rdquo; dotted before they have an input into the debate on the future of the country.  I emphasise this for a reason.  I have listened to criticisms of budgetary proposals and not for the first time because it is raised regularly.  I think the trade union movement and IBEC occasionally take their eye off the ball when it comes to these matters. If there was an input of <i>realpolitik</i> from public representatives who must deal daily with the reality and consequences of social bargaining and who know at first hand what is happening when there is a change in the economy, some of the changes and improvements called for in the motion might occur.</P>
    <P>That said, this motion must be examined globally. There is no disputing the facts and statistics outlined by the Minister.  There has been a significant reduction in days lost since 1987 and such a significant improvement in gross national product that another lobby in the west and north-west is campaigning to retain Objective One status for the regions because it believes those regions have neither reached 75 per cent of GNP nor become part of the Celtic tiger.  Going on the evidence of the country's economic performance from 1987 to 1998, one must have great admiration for IBEC, the other social partners and all Governments involved because they have managed to create and achieve something which is unique in Europe.  Chancellor Kohl in Cardiff dismissed Ireland's claim for special status by stating that Ireland had 5 per cent growth as if this was unique, which it is if other European economies are examined.  Let us clap ourselves on the back for a change.  We have made achievements through worker participation and social partnership and, irrespective of what one might think about aspects of its implementation, it is working well.</P>
    <P>Regarding the budget proposals, I remind my colleagues in the Labour Party what the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, said &mdash; the party seems to be hidebound by ideological baggage discarded by the Labour Party in the UK.  If the Irish Labour Party is right and we are wrong, why do we have more seats in both Houses after last June and it has fewer?  Someone is right and someone is wrong.  Perhaps, in the context of the motion, Labour Party Members should look into their hearts and reassess their policies.  At the end <Col N="89" /> of the day, it is the people who speak and decide and they voted last June for a change of earth shattering proportions, as evidenced by the litany of political casualties on the left.  Someone somewhere got their figures mixed up.</P>
    <P>If people wish to criticise the Government's budgetary proposals and state that it was wrong or was not acting in the best interests of the greater number of people, I repeat and endorse what my colleague, Senator Cox, said: this is a five year Government and its programme, agreed by the partners in Government, will be implemented over five years.  I accept that the first budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, could have placed emphasis on other areas.  We are all, without exception, in favour of social justice and more socially inclusive budgetary and economic policies.  I can say without fear or favour that the Government will not be found wanting over the next four budgets when it comes to ensuring the disadvantaged not only discover the Celtic tiger but get on its back and ride it, shouting at the top of their voices that they have at last entered the promised land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>When Senator Mooney referred to a five year Government he must have meant a five year partnership because this Government will not last five years.  I must quote Shakespeare's famous words &ldquo;bubble, bubble, toil and trouble&rdquo; to the Minister of State, the words used by <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday in its commentaries on the latest inflation figures.  Those figures are extremely worrying and point to an overheated economy with serious problems that have been caused purely by economic mismanagement.</P>
      <P>When the new Government took office a year ago it inherited what was probably the best managed economy in Europe.  It was an economy enjoying great prosperity, growing employment, low inflation and a solid social partnership.  The outgoing Government was one of a number of Governments which followed the example set by a former Fianna Fáil Party Leader, Charles Haughey, who is credited with instituting social partnership in its original form in 1987 under the Programme for National Recovery.  The potential success of the social partnership approach was not foreseen by anybody in 1987, including economic commentators who claim to be able to see into the future.  The combination of social partnership, major investment by our European partners and other factors have contributed to creating economic prosperity of unforeseen proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that economic prosperity is now in grave jeopardy due to what will be seen in the future as economic mismanagement.  The only budget introduced by this Government has laid the foundations for the serious undermining of our economic prosperity.  Unless there is a major change and a re-establishment of balance, proportion and restraint in the Government's economic policy, it will be accused in the future of negligence of the highest order.  The current economic prosperity could be thrown away simply on <Col N="90" /> the basis of a spending policy based on the principle of &ldquo;payback time&rdquo;.  The ominous sound on the horizon is the sound of chickens coming home to roost, chickens that were first seen when the last budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>Running an economy is an onerous responsibility. A Government is given responsibility to run an economy not on its own behalf but on behalf of the country.  A number of speakers have referred to the phenomenal success of the social partnership, a success not initially predicted by its creators or by those who participated in it.  That partnership is based, as is any relationship, on a balance of compromise, justice, fairness and equity. Any group buying into a partnership is asked for restraint in return for a benefit that will accrue from that restraint.  The benefit is not confined to the wider economic context but also applies in a personal context.  That has been seen in low interest rates, lower mortgage repayments and greater investment.</P>
    <P>However, we had also hoped and expected to see that benefit in relation to tackling poverty. This is the area where the last budget was extremely negligent.  There is great unease, which for some reason is not reflected in media commentary, among average workers and particularly trade union members about the fact that fairness has effectively been abandoned.  Who is riding on the back of the Celtic tiger?  If this is one of the most prosperous economies in Europe why is there still so much poverty?  Why are there so many poor people in this country?  Our prosperity is not being distributed equally.  Those who have get more, those who have not get nothing or very little.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State will quote employment figures and the huge increase in the number of people at work.  I am aware that people who have not worked for many years are now working and that there is a reduction in long-term unemployment. However, there are still many areas where massive poverty is all the indigenous communities know.  They see no sign of the Celtic tiger and there is no indication that they will.  If resources are to be directed into those communities, political decisions must be made to redirect resources from other areas.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of major concern to me and my colleagues that resources are being taken from the disadvantaged schools programme which was specifically designed to target resources at poor areas.  It is a disgrace that this programme is being undermined.  We now have a unique opportunity, based on the success of the social partnership model, to create a society where resources are adequately distributed and are used as an investment for the future, particularly in areas which are suffering from poverty.  If that opportunity is lost, it will be gone forever.  It is not necessary to enumerate the social consequences because the Minister of State is a public representative and is aware of them.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to compromise and voluntarism in the context of our approach to trade <Col N="91" /> union recognition.  Members should read the Labour Party's trade union recognition Bill.  It was drafted in consultation with our trade union partners and is based on the framework of social partnership and voluntarism.  It provides for the utilisation of the existing and successful mechanisms of the Labour Court and the Labour Relations Commission within that legislative framework.</P>
    <P>It is true I had the privilege of working as an adviser to the Minister of State's predecessor, the former Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, and that I was aware at the time of the difficulties involved in legislating on Sunday working and, in particular, Sunday trading.  It was not my advice but that of the former Attorney General which had to form the basis of our approach.  However, I commend the Minister of State on his approach and I look forward to his report.  If his proposals are reasonable, they will receive our support.</P>

Similar alarmist words have been used in the House this evening. Senators have spoken of well heeled fat cats and the tremor of the earthquake of unrest.

      <P>Such disparaging expressions should not be used to refer to anyone in our society.  There are no fat cats, merely people who invest in the economy and provide employment.</P>
      <P>Criticism of the Government and particularly of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is unjust.  It was claimed that the Minister, when in opposition, mentioned that he would give the Garda Síochána the pay increase they demand.  That is totally untrue.  Every word the Minister said since he was elected to the Dáil has been examined and no one has found any mention of a promise of a huge pay increase.  The Minister has admitted that the gardaí have a legitimate claim for a wage increase and has explained why that legitimate claim should be met.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has stated quite honestly that he introduced a Private Members' Bill while in Opposition only to find, when in Government and in possession of legal advice, that it was not possible to implement his proposals.  Senator O'Meara also spoke of the difficulties she encountered when working as an adviser to a former Minister.  Why then do Senators criticise Ministers unfairly?</P>
      <P>The economy is more buoyant now than it has ever been.  How can one criticise a Government that has reduced unemployment?  I give credit to previous Governments which have contributed to economic and social progress.  Senator Mooney was correct when he said that the greatest tremor in the country was the shock the Labour Party felt when they lost seats in the last general election. If my party had suffered so badly I would hurry to the Taoiseach and other leading members of the party to impress on them that we must be doing something wrong.  My party, to the amazement of the pundits, was returned to Government.  The Labour Party did not merely lose a few seats &mdash; I have lost a seat myself &mdash; they were almost wiped out.  I admire Senator Costello and his two colleagues.  I cannot understand why he used scaremongering language about unrest in the country, chickens coming home to roost and imminent disasters.</P>
      <P>Education was hardly mentioned.  A few months ago the Minister for Education and Science announced the investment of an additional £250 million in education.  It must be emphasised that this money was in addition to the Government's normal spending on education.</P>
      <P>I totally reject what Senator O'Meara says about poverty.  I wish she would take me to see the poverty she speaks of.</P>

      <P>Senator Fitzgerald referred to the investment of £250 million in education.  How can the Minister, on the one hand, invest this money in education and, on the other, cut teacher numbers in schools in the &ldquo;Breaking the Cycle&rdquo; programme? This programme involved 25 schools in urban and 25 in rural areas.  A special pupil/teacher ratio of 15:1 was applied to these schools because Combat Poverty recommended this as the best way to deal with problems in such schools.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Education and Science came into office too late to cut teacher numbers in these schools last year.  However, this year he is taking away at least one teacher from those schools and in most of the schools in my constituency he is removing two.  The Minister is undermining this project which was established for a five year period and was geared towards young people dropping out of schools in disadvantaged areas.  I assure Senator Tom Fitzgerald that I will take him on a tour of my constituency after Senator O'Meara has finished giving him a tour of hers and I will show him plenty of disadvantaged and impoverished areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="94" /> The purpose of this motion must be seen in the context of a partnership arrangement since 1987 to which both the present Government and the Opposition parties substantially contributed.  It has brought prosperity to Ireland for the first time in its history.  Having established that partnership arrangement, our concern is to ensure it is maintained.  We wish to highlight where the Government are negligent in ensuring the maintenance of the trust and credibility in that partnership among all the social partners.  The motion is specifically concerned with the trade union movement, workers, those in dispute and those who feel they have not been getting their fair share of the national cake, despite the fact that Partnership 2000 was a commitment to that.</P>
    <P>When the trade union movement ensured that the agreement provided the return of £900 million in taxes to the workers, it thought this would be done at the lower end of the scale.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, gave it back at the upper end of the scale in the last budget. He gave £400 million to £500 million and said that this is the majority of the Partnership 2000 provision. It was given to the wrong people.</P>
    <P>This is one of the reasons for dissatisfaction among workers.  Craftworkers and health workers in local authorities are due to have an official strike on Monday.  However, the number of wild-cat strikes indicates the many other workers who are dissatisfied.  Gardaí have picketed this House for the past few weeks.  This is an indication that Partnership 2000 has not delivered.  Gardaí were not there when it was agreed and the Government is not prepared to give them a say in the future.  It is essential that gardaí have a place at the negotiating table in future partnership agreements if they are to be satisfied with any deal which is negotiated on their behalf.  Gardaí should be given full trade union recognition and negotiating powers.</P>
    <P>The present Government has not kept its eye on the ball in relation to existing disputes, the origin of such problems, trade union recognition and the minimum wage.  The minimum wage must be introduced before we negotiate another deal. The Government has indicated that it will be included in the next partnership agreement, which is not part of the arrangement.  Many areas must be addressed and I am sure we will return to this subject.  There were fruitful contributions from both sides of the House.  I hope the Government side has benefited from the debate and that the Minister has taken our views on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking for a second teacher to be provided for Curraghroe national school, County Roscommon.  This school is in a rural part of north-eastern Roscommon and has 13 pupils at present.  Parents, pupils and the teacher at this school fear it will close and they are conscious of Fianna Fáil's election manifesto promise to upgrade one teacher schools to two teacher school status.  I am not sure if the cut off point will be lower than the number of pupils in Curraghroe national school.  I know the Minister is dealing with demands relating to this matter as well as demands for remedial and resource teachers, and I appreciate his difficulties.</P>
      <P>Curraghroe has lost its only shop and its post office in recent years and there are now fears for the national school because a new school with four teachers is to be completed soon some miles away in Clontuskert.  Parents may feel facilities are better there and send their children to that school.</P>
      <P>If possible, Curraghroe national school should be included in the list of one teacher schools to be provided with a second teacher in 1998-9.  If the school does not achieve the magic number of pupils entitling it to a second teacher, the Minister should consider providing remedial teaching services for the area.  I understand it is possible that a remedial teacher will be provided in the general area, including Clontuskert and other schools.  It has been suggested that the remedial teacher be located at Curraghroe national school. That would indicate to residents in the area that the Department has faith in Curraghroe national school and does not wish it to close.  In the next round of teacher allocations, the cut off number of pupils might be lowered, which would allow the school to survive.</P>
      <P>That is consequential on the assignment of a remedial teacher to the area, but there are five schools in the region without a remedial teacher and it may be an area the Department is looking at.  The Minister should examine the possibility of providing a second teacher in 1998-9 to Curraghroe national school under the proposals to upgrade one teacher schools to two teacher status.  If that is impossible, he should in some way indicate the Department's support for Curraghroe national school and the location of a remedial teacher in the school is a way that might be done.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Finneran for affording me the opportunity to speak on the staffing position in Curraghroe national school, County Roscommon.  The Senator will be aware that An Action Programme for the Millennium contains a commitment to give primary education a clear priority in allocating resources, and specifically states that one teacher schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
      <P>I note that the enrolment for Curraghroe national school has decreased from 14 pupils in September 1996 to 13 pupils in September 1997. Under normal agreed staffing arrangements for primary schools, such enrolment figures would warrant a staffing of a principal teacher only.  I am very conscious of the particular difficulties experienced by teachers in one teacher schools and I assure the Senator that I and the Minister for Education and Science are fully committed to achieving the target outlined in An Action Programme for the Millennium whereby all schools with ten or more pupils will receive a second teacher.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of options are currently being examined with a view to identifying the most appropriate <Col N="97" /> way to fulfil the commitment to one teacher schools as outlined in that programme.  As soon as the most appropriate course of action has been identified the officials of my Department will be requested to examine the situation in Curraghroe national school and to advise the school authorities of the outcome.</P>

    <Title>Hepatitis B Vaccination Programme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter because it was recently brought to my attention that we have not implemented a World Health Organisation recommendation to introduce a universal hepatitis B vaccination programme for infants. Currently, we have a policy of selective vaccination but most countries recognise that this policy has little effect in containing the spread of infection.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I should put hepatitis B in perspective by giving a few facts that I have uncovered in relation to the virus.  First, the WHO estimates that hepatitis B is responsible for more than one million deaths per year worldwide.  Second, the best informed estimates say that hepatitis B is one hundred times more contagious than HIV.  Third, between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of adults infected with hepatitis B will become carriers of infection without knowing it.  Carriers show no symptoms of the disease and can pass it on to many other more vulnerable individuals who could show symptoms and contract the disease. Fourth, a carrier could be someone who could carry the disease in their blood for many years, not feel any adverse effects and yet infect those in contact with him or her.  They can also go on to develop serious liver disease in later life and many may die.</P>
      <P>I accept Ireland is considered low risk because we have a relatively low incidence of hepatitis B, or at least as far as we know.  This may have made us complacent about the disease.  There were 663 new cases of hepatitis B between 1988 and 1993. The cause of transmission in 34 per cent of the cases was unknown.  In 8 per cent of cases it was caused by drug addiction and activities such as needle sharing.  In 15 per cent of cases it was sexually transmitted and in 5 per cent it was passed from mothers to new born babies.</P>
      <P>There has also been a huge increase in the number of Irish people working and travelling abroad.  People working abroad now have easier and cheaper access to commute home more regularly. Generally, these situations abroad are not covered by any vaccination programme, yet many people are entering high risk areas, such as the southern and eastern Mediterranean.  As I understand it, a selection vaccination programme means that health care workers receive 85 per cent of the vaccine, and I understand the need to vaccinate health care workers.  However, they only account for 5 per cent of hepatitis B infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the United States health professionals believe the true incidence of hepatitis B infections <Col N="98" /> is dramatically underestimated and I worry about possible underestimation in this country as well.  They believe it is underestimated because the disease is under-reported, especially among ethnic groups, and many infants can have the disease in early stages but not yet show any serious symptoms.  In Ireland health professionals believe that we, too, underestimate the true incidence of the virus and the carrier pool because we only screen high risk groups, which misses infections and carriers in low risk groups, and individuals in high risk groups can often be missed as they are less likely to be aware of the risks and may not present for testing.  It is also worth noting that research in America has shown that infants infected with hepatitis B are at a disproportionate risk of developing major complications, including chronic hepatitis with sclerosis and liver failure.</P>
    <P>To reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis B there appears to be two choices.  First, we can try to avoid close contact with high risk groups or with people in close contact with these groups, but given the silent nature of this disease we cannot recommend this choice with any confidence. Secondly &mdash; this is the point of my case tonight &mdash; we could eliminate the risks as much as possible by introducing a hepatitis B vaccine into the existing vaccination system.  This would seem to be the most cost-effective method.  The alternative, to ignore the situation or let continue the present situation with the gross underestimation I believe exists, is frightening.  An already strained health system would have to cope with a huge increase in the cost of treatments.</P>
    <P>To get some idea of the cost we could face if we ignore this problem, we only have to look and extrapolate from the costs incurred to date in the relatively small number, but very serious, hepatitis C cases.  We must not forget that hepatitis B is extremely debilitating and removes victims from the workplace for a considerable length of time.  There is an inherent cost in that through lost work and lost days on the job as it were, apart from the medical cost of treatment.</P>
    <P>We could face a situation far more serious than the hepatitis C crises because hepatitis B is far more contagious.  In addition to the huge strain put on the health care system we could have a severe litigation problem because, first, the treatment costs are enormous; second, we are currently ignoring the World Health Organisation's recommendation on hepatitis C vaccination; third, the disease is potentially fatal; fourth, although this highly infectious disease is classified as low risk in Ireland, this still implies some risk and perhaps with underestimation of the incidence, it might be a higher risk than we realise; and, finally, the hepatitis B vaccination could be introducd at negligible cost into our existing vaccination programme.  Anybody can be infected with the virus but nobody needs be.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do all he can in view of the facts on this issue.  While not directly linked to hepatitis C, the hepatitis B issue has many parallels. Hepatitis B has the potential to be far more <Col N="99" /> damaging to the medical, social and economic health of our country than even the tragedies linked to hepatitis C.  I will be extremely interested to know the Minister's intentions on implementing the WHO recommendation on hepatitis B.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to set out the position on this matter.  The incidence and prevalence rates of hepatitis B in Ireland are among the lowest in the world.  While the WHO has recommended the introduction of hepatitis B vaccination, several low incidence countries, including Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands and the Nordic countries, have instead initiated a selective approach which targets high risk groups. It has been considered that this represents a more effective approach in situations where the incidence of the disease is low and where cases occur in identifiable population groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department's policy on this issue is guided by the advice of the immunisation advisory committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, whose guidelines recommend immunisation for individuals who are at increased risk of hepatitis B because of their occupation, lifestyle or other factors such as close contact with a case or carrier.  It is important to say the committee is <Col N="100" /> currently reviewing its existing guidelines on immunisation, and future vaccination strategy for hepatitis B is among the issues which my Department's chief medical officer, Mr. Kiely, has asked the committee to consider in the course of its review.</P>
    <P>In relation to workers within the health service, my Department wrote to all health boards and voluntary agencies in June 1997 stressing the importance of vaccination for at risk health care staff and clients.  This was a reiteration of earlier advice.  Since 1 January 1997 all new health service employees who will be involved in exposure prone procedures are routinely screened for hepatitis B. No applicant will be allowed to commence employment until these procedures are followed.  All new employees in the category concerned must provide documentary evidence that they are not infectious carriers of the hepatitis B virus.  To answer the Senator's query on this matter, I await the outcome of the review of the immunisation advisory committee, which has been asked to review whether we should move from a selective to a national immunisation scheme.  On the basis of the WHO recommendation and despite our low incidence of this disease, it may be an issue which will be addressed by it and may meet the requirement of the Senator's contribution.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 18 June 1998.</P>
