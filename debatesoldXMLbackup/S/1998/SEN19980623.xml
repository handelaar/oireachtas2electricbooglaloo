      <P>I have to announce that the following Member has been elected to fill the casual vacancy in the membership of the Seanad to which the Resolution of Seanad Éireann on 28 April 1998 has reference &mdash; Labour Panel, Nominating Bodies Sub-Panel: John Cregan.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Senator John Cregan was introduced to the Cathaoirleach and then took his seat.</i>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasant duty as Leader of the House and Leader of the Fianna Fáil Group to welcome our newest Member, Councillor John Cregan from Dromcolliher, County Limerick.  He was educated at St. Joseph's national school and St. Mary's secondary school in Dromcolliher.  He was employed with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and subsequently with Telecom Éireann.  He has also been an active member of the Communication of Workers' Union for many years.  He was first elected to Limerick County Council in 1991 following the retirement of his late father Tom.</P>
      <P>Many of us who have been in politics and public life for a long time knew his deceased father very well.  Tom Cregan had many friends and some of those are Members of the current Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  He was a man of great integrity.  He was someone we all looked up to and respected.  Through his membership of a local authority he made a massive lifelong contribution to his area and his county of Limerick.  I know Senator John Cregan is very proud of his father. I am sure he is looking down on him proud that John has chosen to follow in his footsteps. Senator Cregan was elected to Limerick County Council on the retirement of his late father in 1991.  He has since become a member of the Mid-Western Health Board and is an executive member of the Association of Health Boards of Ireland.  Other distinguished Members of the Seanad who were represented on that body have made their mark in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="154" /> Senator John Cregan is a young, hard working, dedicated public representative from Limerick West.  We in Fianna Fáil look forward to the day when John will take his seat in the Dáil.  As Leader of the House, I must add the victory was a massive one &mdash; 120 to 97 votes.  It presents a great opportunity for the country to take note of the unity that exists between the Government partners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a distortion of the truth between the Opposition and the media in general about the life time of this Government.  I assure Senator John Cregan he will be here for four years which, I hope, will be happy ones.</P>
      <P>I, too, commiserate with former Senator Sam McAughtry who is also a hard working and dedicated man.  It is a numbers game and on this occasion I am very pleased to say the numbers are on the Government side.  I would like to know the names of the seven Opposition members who did not bother to vote today.  As Leader of the House it was a proud moment for me to witness the unity that exists among the Government parties. I take this opportunity to thank those people on the Independent benches who voted for Senator Cregan.</P>
      <P>I wish John the very best of luck and look forward to his membership of the Seanad for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As Acting Leader I am delighted to support the sentiments of Senator Cassidy and welcome Senator John Cregan to the Seanad.  I wish him every success and salute him on his long record in public service.  Everyone here and those who have served in other fora like local authorities and perhaps the Dáil understand what public service is about.  We have our policy differences; if we did not, we would all be on the one side and there would be no need for elections. I respect party members such as Senator Cregan who have worked hard in the public interest.</P>
      <P>My colleagues from Limerick West in the Lower House and in the Seanad wish him a long and very successful tenure in the Upper House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of those on the Independent benches I welcome Senator Cregan and wish him a very satisfying career.  I congratulate him on taking up the office of public representation. As a public servant and active trade Unionist, it will be nothing new to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind Senator Cregan that we expect great things from him.  The Leader of the House has reinforced the point that he has done what the Cabinet and most of the commentators have <Col N="155" /> failed to do &mdash; he has provided the glue between the Government parties.  What we thought was just a temporary little arrangement has become something that will last to infinity.  Well done, Senator.</P>
    <P>All politics are local and the Leader will, I am sure, thank me for reminding the House and the new Senator that he comes from the estuary of the River Shannon.  We will expect him to look at the needs of the harbour masters in Foynes, the harbour authority in Limerick and the Shannon Development Board, and to be supportive within his parliamentary party of the Shannon Estuary Bill, about which his Leader apparently has grave reservations.</P>
    <P>I wish him well in his career.  He comes from Dromcolliher, which the INTO considers to be the cradle of teachers in west Limerick as it has produced so many of them.  Mindful also of his Kerry ancestry, I wish him luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the remarks of the Leader of the House and others in congratulating our new colleague, Senator John Cregan, and welcoming him to the House.  I wish to sympathise with our candidate, former Senator Sam McAughtry, who lost the by-election. I suppose it was too much for the Labour Party to expect three successful by-elections in a row.  It was inevitable that a stop would be put to our gallop and I am glad Senator John Cregan was the one who did so.  I wish him a long and successful tenure in this House and I am sure he will serve the people of Limerick very well, many of whom are in the Visitors' Gallery today. I wish him all the best on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I am very pleased to welcome Senator John Cregan to the House.  Like the Leader, I anticipate many happy years for the Senator in the Upper House.  I am very glad we could give him our support.  At a time when public servants, particularly politicians, are pilloried, it gives us hope for the future to hear about a young man who has already given good public service &mdash; the type of service we all try to give &mdash; and who will continue to do so in the Upper House.</P>
      <P>I commiserate with former Senator Sam McAughtry, who is a very fine person.  However, we have made a very good choice in Senator John Cregan and I know he will serve the House very well.  I wish him well.</P>

I also thank the other party and group leaders who <Col N="156" /> complimented me.  I commiserate with my opponent, former Senator Sam McAughtry.  He is fighting another election at the moment and I wish him well.</P>

      <P>I was very privileged to be nominated by the ICPSA and I acknowledge the presence of its president, Brian O'Keeffe, in the Visitors' Gallery.  I thank my parliamentary party. As Senator Cassidy said, my party and our partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, delivered me 113 out of 113 votes, which does not signify disunity in any shape or fashion.  I also received the support of a very loyal group of Independent Deputies and Senators, led by that colourful Kerryman, Deputy Healy-Rae, who I also thank.  I have many friends, supporters and family members from Dromcolliher with me, including my wife, Patsy, my sister, Marie, and her husband.</P>
      <P>It is great privilege to be elected to Seanad Éireann.  As was stated, I have been a member of Fianna Fáil all my life.  I joined Limerick County Council in 1991 and I have worked hard and honestly since then.  I was asked a couple of times this morning what my priorities are.  I simply said my priorities are to continue working hard and honestly for the people who elected me.  It will give me great pleasure to work with my colleague and very close personal friend, Senator Rory Kiely, in this House and my other Oireachtas colleague, Deputy Michael Collins, to serve the people of west Limerick.</P>
      <P>My late father's name was mentioned and he is foremost in my mind today.  He introduced me to politics and kept me on the right road.  Although he is now up above, I believe he had an influence on this election.  I think of him today and my mother who cannot be with me because she is in Lourdes.  I did not send her there to pray for me.</P>
      <P>I thank Deirdre Lane and her staff for the efficient way in which they carried out their duties this morning.  I look forward to working with all the Members of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with the Order of Business.  Will the Leader agree to a reasoned and informed debate on Sellafield and the British nuclear industry within the next couple of weeks?  I and several Senators requested this recently.  While I believe the Leader is well disposed to a debate, I am not sure what pressure <Col N="157" /> he is under regarding business in the last couple of weeks before the summer recess.  However, now is an opportune time to hold an informed debate.  If it is in the format of statements, will the Leader consider an interactive discussion?  I increasingly find the format of statements without any response from the Minister to questions posed by Senators to be a waste of time and energy.  We should have in interactive discussion or debate on this most important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader gave a commitment in the last two weeks about the possibility of a debate on education before the end of the session and he undertook to consult with the Minister for Education and Science.  Last week we managed to get a number of issues dealt with expeditiously, including statements on the Insurance Ombudsman and a debate on industrial relations, thanks to the motion by the Labour Party.  We need to address a number of other issues, including education. It is one in which most Members will have an interest, both at national and constituency level.  There is a problem at school level which the Minister could outline and which needs to be addressed.</P>
      <P>Dear as education is to my heart, I would be prepared to give way to a debate on Northern Ireland.  It was proper not to have a lengthy debate in the course of developments in the North over the past two months.  However, given that elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly are to be held on Thursday, it is very important that Members offer their views and to consider how issues such as Strand Two might be developed.  That can encompass a number of issues.  An tseachtain seo caite bhí cúpla focal le rá ag an Seanadóir Ó Murchú mar gheall ar ghearradh siar ar Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Ba mhaith an rud go dtuigeadh daoine go bhfuil sé sin go mór i Strand Two den Agreement.</P>
      <P>Strand Two will allow many issues to be discussed in what is a wide area.  It would also be the first time a debate on Northern Ireland could develop into social areas, such as An Gaeilge and education.  It is hugely important that the House offers its views on this matter.  Everybody else is discussing it.  People in Northern Ireland who hold differing views should at least know our thinking in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Avril Doyle's request for a debate on Sellafield, especially in view of the new research that shows Sellafield to be now more dangerous than Chernobyl was.  It is a very important matter and it deserves an early debate.  The Minister should come before the House to discuss what action will be taken in relation to his British counterpart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole is right to call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  This is an opportunity for us to tease out the implications of the British-Irish Agreement before the recess as they pertain to us.  There is a great deal of cross-Border activity <Col N="158" /> on a ministerial level which has implications for us.</P>
    <P>This weekend marked to the passing of the 200 figure for road deaths.  Already the carnage on the roads is ahead of previous years.  This issue has been raised again and again in this House but there does not appear to be a planned campaign to reduce the level of people killed on our roads. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke of zero tolerance yet the vast majority of deaths are due to drunken driving. Action is vital; there is no sense discussing this issue unless there is a response.</P>
    <P>I asked last week for an update on prisoner release legislation.  The Taoiseach promised it would be introduced into the Dáil and Seanad but I cannot see how the process can begin if the legislation is not introduced before the recess. Does the Leader have any information about what is happening?  Will we be brought back for this or will it be dealt with next week before the recess?</P>
    <P>Motion 22 in the name of the Labour Senators calls for a discussion of the report of the Murphy inquiry into child abuse in swimming.  Last week I bemoaned the fact that we had to refer the matter to the joint committee so the report could be published.  We have not yet seen the report.  The report has still not been put into our pigeon-holes; it must be specifically requested.  Each Member should automatically get a copy of a report of this nature.  The issue has been debated in every forum except this House.  The Minister has been advised to do many things in relation to the IASA but we have had no opportunity to offer him our advice.</P>

      <P>A large number of Senators wish to contribute on the Order of Business so I remind Senators that their contributions should be brief and relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the call for a debate on the nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield.  I draw the Leader's attention to the fact that a group of British and Irish local authorities have called for the suspension of the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield.  This follows the publication of a report in London this morning which states that tanks holding high levels of liquid waste at Sellafield may leak.  If this happened there could be an accident which would be ten to 100 times more serious than that which occurred at Chernobyl.  It is urgent that the Minister come into the House to address this report and that the matter is debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise an issue of great concern to many Senators &mdash; the plight of the deprived in our society and in the Third World. As a result of a European Court of Justice decision on 10 June, social aid programmes worth £260 million have been blocked.  Not one penny will come out of the European Social Fund to help the deprived.  I ask the Leader to take the <Col N="159" /> following programmes into account: co-financing of NGO projects in developing countries; decentralised co-operation; general development co-operation; combating racism and xenophobia; poverty programmes for Northern Ireland; integration of disabled and older people; combating child pornography; rehabilitation of land mine victims; fight against drug abuse; European voluntary service; human rights and democracy.  This is the disgraceful result of a search the British carried out for possible savings.  In making these savings they hit the most deprived people across the world.  Commissioner Pádraig Flynn referred to this as a moral challenge to the human face of Europe and the most important work done by the Union.  Commissioner Bonino told colleagues yesterday that she might have to close down the entire food health inspection service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader for a debate on this issue.  We must try to do something to rectify what the Commission has done at the behest of Britain, which started this action in 1995 and which is supported by Germany and Denmark.  It is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Lanigan.  I was present in the Institute of European Affairs in North Great George's Street when Commissioner Flynn made this strong point.  However, I also got the feeling he was able to handle the situation and that by implementing this ruling in a challenging way, many of the Union's institutions would find themselves in crisis and it would be resolved in that manner.</P>
      <P>I wanted to welcome Senator John Cregan but I understand only one person from each group was allowed to speak.  I say that as a preface because I want to raise a serious procedural point with you, a Chathaoirligh, on this matter, although I hope you do not think I am slighting your authority. I welcome Senator John Cregan to the House, particularly because he comes from Dromcolliher about which a famous poem was written by Percy French which indicates that if one has not been to Dromcolliher, one has not been to anywhere worth going to.  Since the Leader raised the matter in a partisan way, which is inevitable, it is appropriate that this House should consider reports which appeared in the newspapers at the weekend that members of parties, particularly the Leader's party, were supervised in their voting. That is not appropriate.  I ask that this matter be referred to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because this is an abuse of a free vote.</P>

      <P>I ask the Leader to request the appropriate Minister to engage in some form of mediation with a view to resolving the planning impasse which involves Mr. Kevin Boland, who is a former Oireachtas Member and a Minister who gave great service to this country.  It is reported that he has been on hunger strike for 14 days.  It should be possible to have measured, compassionate and sensitive diplomacy which would bring about results in this case.</P>

      <P>I join in the call to the Leader to have a debate on Sellafield, particularly in view of today's report and the recent decision by the British Government to decommission the plant at Dounreay in Scotland.  There may be a change of opinion in the British Government about the nuclear industry.  The sooner that debate takes place the better.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello that there is an appalling number of deaths on our roads.  We must look at all aspects of new legislation, including, if necessary, random breath testing for motorists.  We must have a new radical approach to traffic management.  In particular, there is the question of drug abuse and driving.  There are some serious questions.  I hate to read the newspaper every weekend with the increasing number of young people who are dying on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to draw attention to the largest university in the country, University College Dublin, which still operates an all male interview board in the selection of non-statutory academic staff.  There is huge concern among the academic public about the low ratio of females who have been appointed to professorships by the current academic boards.  I ask the Leader to write to the Higher Education Authority for an explanation.  After all, it houses the largest centre of equality studies in the country, yet it is appointing a very low ratio of female academics. Furthermore, when their CVs were examined and <Col N="161" /> compared with those of the successful candidates, the females were found to be way ahead.  Something is not right here and, as I have an educational role, I ask the Leader to write to the Higher Education Authority to seek an explanation.</P>

      <P>I join the two previous speakers in calling for a debate on education in this House. It is more appropriate that such a debate should be held at the end of an academic year rather than at the beginning.  It appears to me that it will be into the academic year before such a debate takes place.  I urge the Leader to consider deeply the issues which have arisen in education and demand that we face them immediately.</P>
      <P>With regard to the nuclear waste hazard, I call the attention of the House to the fact that the presentation of that report to the Houses of Parliament was made this morning jointly by the nuclear free local authority members in Great Britain and some Irish local authority members. The report was paid for jointly by a number of Irish local authorities and the nuclear free local authorities in England.  The editor of the report will present it to Members of the Dáil tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the interview room.  I invite anybody who would like to attend to see the frightening results of the report and the investigation.  I think they will be startled by it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on education. I ask the Leader to bring the Minister for Education and Science into the House for two reasons.  First, the House may not sit again before September and there is a critical situation whereby schools which have one less child enrolled may lose a teacher.  That is an important matter.</P>
      <P>No less important is another aspect of education, the fact that it is difficult to get insurance for school playgrounds.  The Minister may be able to legislate so that it is easier for schools to get insurance cover for pupils in schools and recreational areas.  Those are the two areas which I want addressed before September.  If possible, I ask the Leader for a debate on the matter before the end of this session.</P>

      <P>I hope that the rest of the Members of this House would agree that we should send our sympathy and condolences to the family of the young prostitute who was murdered. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, despite the law, few men seem to be charged while women are charged all the time, and I seek a debate on the matter.  Perhaps it is time the <Col N="162" /> Leader asked the Minister to review prostitution in this country.</P>

      <P>Senators Doyle, Coogan, Costello and O'Dowd called for a debate on Sellafield.  I will discuss this with the Whips after the Order of Business to see if the requests can be facilitated but it will be difficult, given the short time remaining for the present session.</P>
      <P>Senators O'Toole, Coogan, McGowan and Costello called for an urgent debate on education. I will also discuss this request with the Whips.</P>
      <P>A debate on Northern Ireland would be timely and I hope we can agree to have this subject debated before the end of the session.  The Minister has agreed to this.</P>
      <P>Senators Costello, O'Dowd and many others over the last number of weeks have expressed their horror at the number of road deaths.  It is dreadful to read in every weekend's newspapers of the number of deaths on our roads.  I will extend an invitation to the Minister to come to the House for a debate on this matter and I will express these serious concerns of Senators which confront us as legislators.  The problem cannot be allowed continue; it must be addressed.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello requested information on the prisoner release programme.  I will be bringing legislation before the House next week to enable this to proceed over the summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello that each Member of the House should have been supplied with a copy of the Murphy report.  Any Senator who does not have a copy should contact my office or the Chief Whip's office today.  I will have the <Col N="163" /> report discussed in the House at the earliest opportunity in the next session.</P>
    <P>Senators Lanigan and Norris expressed their outrage at the cuts in EU social aid programmes. This is a retrograde step and something which the House cannot condone.  I agree with the Senators and will try to facilitate the requests to have the matter debated before the end of the session.</P>
    <P>I note the sentiments of Senators Ó Murchú, Ormonde and Ridge.  I fully agree with Senator Ridge's sentiments.  The violent death suffered by the young lady two nights ago was horrific and I hope the person responsible will be brought to justice as soon as possible.  It is horrific that such a killing can happen in our community which prides itself on looking after the socially deprived.</P>
    <P>I learned of the circumstances of the plight of the person involved from this morning's news reports.  The House dealt with related legislation in recent years and we are only now seeing the fall out of parts of that legislation.  It may be time to revisit the issue to address the problems of those who find they must engage in such activity.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke has sought a debate on the ICC, ACC and TSB on many occasions.  I have promised to organise a debate on the issues involved. If the Fine Gael Senators agree, I will offer Fianna Fáil Private Members' time in the next session and we could have a four hour debate on the proposed sale, which Senator Burke and Senator Finneran have raised on many occasions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, subsection (2), between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;or</P>
      <P>(d) sells for monetary or other gain a child under the age of 16 years into a marriage contract,&ldquo;</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the marriage of minors is already outlawed, but I propose this amendment with regard to the trafficking provisions of the Bill.  There was an instance in which a young person was traded by a minority community resident in the country.  The social practices of the community does not forbid the sale of young girls as brides.  This will become more of a problem because the numbers in this community are increasing and I cannot see it doing away with traditions which are not outlawed in its native country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The culture of some of the ethnic groups allows for the sale for money of girl brides who may be <Col N="164" /> as young as ten or 11 years of age.  When these children are sold the effective result is statutory rape.  If possible the Bill should make provision to deal with this trafficking.  This practice goes beyond our marriage laws and, I believe, falls within a definition of trafficking or sale for money or gain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  We must look at this problem in the financial context of the major worldwide market in brides, particularly those from the Far East.  The former President, Mary Robinson, recently spoke in Geneva about the major industry in the trafficking of women.  It is worthwhile remembering that many of these young girls come from areas where there may be difficulties in obtaining a birth certificate, so it is hard to know the girl's actual age &mdash; she may say she is over 16 years but may be under 16 years.  The Minister knows of the &ldquo;green harvest&rdquo; in Vietnam and Thailand where the daughters of farmers who cannot pay their debts are sold into marriage or to brothels &mdash; depending on their good or ill fortune.</P>
      <P>The selling of women into marriage is a big financial business.  We have little knowledge as to the age of these women.  They are sold and brought to Western Europe and America.  The acceptance of this amendment will be worthwhile in specifically stating our concern about girls who may be sold into marriage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of Senator Ridge's amendment is laudable and I support the arguments made by her and Senator Henry. However, the provision is incorporated in the Children Bill, 1996, a broad and important Bill which has not yet been enacted.  While I support Senator Ridge and accept the sincerity of her contribution, the Children Bill deals more effectively with her proposed amendment.  The Bill incorporates a great deal of new legislation covering the abuse of children under 16 years.  I urge the Minister to bring the Bill before the House as early as possible in the next session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to make it an offence for a person to sell a child under the age of 16 years into a so-called marriage contract.  I appreciate the thought behind the amendment and I share the sentiments of Senator Ridge, Senator Henry and Senator O'Donovan on the despicable practice of selling young girls as brides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this practice, as already indicated by Senator O'Donovan, is catered for and criminalised under existing law &mdash; in this Bill and the Children Bill, 1996, which is awaiting Committee Stage in the other House.  It is clear that the type of marriage contract we are discussing is not a valid marriage in law.  The Family Law Act, 1995, provides that a marriage between persons, either of whom is under the age of 18 years, is not valid <Col N="165" /> in law unless the consent of the President of the High Court has been obtained.</P>
    <P>The position of children who come here from abroad is not different to that of Irish children since the 1995 Bill applies to marriages taking place here, irrespective of where the parties to the marriage are ordinarily resident.  In the absence of a valid marriage, sexual activity with an underage girl constitutes an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge.  Section 2(2) of the Bill creates a number of offences of taking, detaining or otherwise using children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation as well as organising or facilitating such taking, detaining or use.  The term &ldquo;sexual exploitation&rdquo; is comprehensively defined in subsection (3) to encompass, among other things, the commission of any sexual offence against the child which is an offence under any enactment.  Clearly, this will include the offence of unlawful knowledge which, as I have said, is committed in the event of a marriage to a child not being valid.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the Children Bill, 1996, contains a provision which will punish any person who causes or encourages a sexual act with a child under 17 years of age.  This will update a provision in the Children Act, 1908, under which the penalty on conviction is a maximum of two years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>The penalty proposed in the 1996 Bill is five years imprisonment on conviction on indictment. I believe that to be unacceptably low and I am proposing to increase it to 14 years in line with the penalty structure provided for in the Bill before us.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I should like to mention a provision in the Non Fatal Offences Against the Person Act, 1997, which would also be of relevance in the context of selling children as brides.  Section 15 of that Act extends the common law offence of false imprisonment to cover cases where the false imprisonment is brought about by deception causing the victim to believe that she is under legal compulsion to consent.  A person commits the offence if he or she takes, detains or causes to be taken or detained, or otherwise restricts the personal liberty of another person.  That offence carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment on conviction on indictment.</P>
    <P>I hope from what I have said that Senator Ridge is as satisfied as I am that what she is seeking to do is already covered in our criminal law as well as in this Bill.  If her amendment were to be accepted it would be open to the interpretation that such was not the case.  In the circumstances I trust that she will understand why I am not in a position to accept her amendment.</P>

That is why I would ask that specific reference to this aspect of it should be referred to again when the Children's Bill is being discussed.  I would be pleased if that could be arranged.

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1)(a), line 20, after &ldquo;publishes&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or allows access by children to&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that, as the explanatory memorandum states, the Bill deals specifically with child trafficking and pornography.  I am concerned, however, about the ease of access by children to pornography.  I have stated my concerns about this on several occasions in the House.  The amendment seeks to insert the words &ldquo;or allows access by children to&rdquo; because I think we are all missing the boat with regard to this matter.  The availability of hard core pornography, including imports from Holland, France and Germany, is advertised in newspapers.  These advertisements are published in supposedly reputable newspapers and I can produce them if the Minister wishes.  However, I do not want to be considered a crank who collects copies of such advertisements and the Minister need only buy a newspaper to see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="167" /> One particular shop on a Dublin street has a sign in the window with large writing for everyone to see, including small children, which proclaims &ldquo;Hard core videos for sale or rent&rdquo;.  I understand that some of the specially imported videos advertised in the press contain child pornography. I hope this amendment will not be struck down, because it is an established fact that under-the-counter child pornography specially imported from the continent can be obtained from sources advertised in newspapers and magazines. I cannot see how the amendment does not comply with the spirit and meaning of Bill and it should not be struck down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ridge's amendment. The quality of many of the child pornography videos, etc., is poor and I am heartened by the fact that it is virtually unknown for the people who purchase such material to appeal to the Consumers' Association for recompense from those responsible for producing it.  However, as stated on Second Stage, this material is used to &ldquo;soften up&rdquo; children to facilitate their involvement in sexual abuse.  It is important that those who provide children to it should be prosecuted.</P>
      <P>I may have been as sanguine as other Members in respect of gaining access to pornography on the Internet because it is not as difficult to do so as I had believed.  For example, innocuous names such as &ldquo;House of Lords&rdquo; can, when entered into one's computer, provide access to a number of Internet sites.  If one does not notice that some of these sites are geared towards men who like men, the first site one will visit is pornographic in nature. To gain further access to this site, one must use a PIN number, provide money, etc.  My point is that innocuous names are often used by the owners of pornographic Internet sites to attract unwitting people and it is easier than I had believed to gain access to such sites.  Senator Ridge is right to ask that those who provide children with access to pornographic material should be held guilty of committing a crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Senator Ridge stated, these amendments aim to prevent children having access to pornography.  Clearly the Bill is only concerned with child pornography.  What might be termed &ldquo;adult&rdquo; pornography is a separate issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as child pornography is concerned, I am satisfied that what the amendments seek to achieve is already provided for in the Bill.  The relevant provisions are contained in section 5 which makes it an offence to distribute, sell or show child pornography or to advertise the distribution, <Col N="168" /> selling or showing of such pornography. Section (5)(2) provides that the term &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; in this context includes parting with possession of something or exposing or offering it for acquisition by another person.  The section is targeted primarily towards large scale producers and distributors who trade in child pornography for profit.  However, it is also designed to deal with persons who trade in child pornography without profit.  It is clear that shopkeepers who carry and expose child pornography for sale and newspaper groups which carry advertisements concerning the availability of child pornography may be dealt with under section 5.  In the circumstances I fail to see the need for the amendments.</P>
    <P>Adult pornography or any pornography other than that relating to children is outside the scope of the Bill.  However, it is among the issues addressed in the discussion paper on the law and sexual offences which I published last month.  The discussion paper sets out the existing laws in respect of the exhibiting of indecent or obscene material in shop windows and the affixing of such material in any public place.  Given that these laws date back to the last century, the paper rightly points out that they would benefit from updating.  It also asks that they be strengthened to include all advertising and displaying of pornography by whatever manner or means.</P>
    <P>The point which Senator Ridge is seeking to address, in so far as it relates to adult pornography &mdash; although not appropriate to this Bill &mdash; will certainly be examined in the context of the formulation of legislative proposals ensuing from the discussion paper.  In those circumstances I hope the Senator will withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to withdraw the amendment.  I accept the Minister's statement that the forthcoming sexual offences legislation will deal with this matter.  However, legislation can be slow to take effect.  Like many parents and adults, I am concerned by the fact that children have free access to print and media pornography. If the Bill is to be comprehensive it should include an acknowledgement of that reality.  For that reason I am pressing the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) including material sent by &lsquo;Hot Line&rsquo; for the purpose of reporting an offence.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment concerns the Internet.  The main objectives of a hot line or a focal point are to monitor child pornography and paedophile activities on the Internet.  They can also stimulate and educate non-governmental organisations about the fact that the Internet represents a powerful medium for the distribution of child pornography. The most important hot line was set up by the Norwegian ombudsman.  I had the privilege of attending the first world congress on child sexual abuse in Stockholm a number of years ago.  At the conference the Norwegian ombudsman volunteered to set up a hot line which could serve Europe so that people could report child pornography on the Internet.  This is funded by the European Union.  Not only is the hot line used for reporting pornography at various sites, it is also used to educate non-governmental organisations involved with children on how to deal with child pornography in their respective countries.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this legislation because one of the most important objectives of the conference was that we would try to bring forward as rapidly as possible comprehensive legislation on child pornography and it is good to see this Bill, albeit later than other countries.  The focal point or the hot line receives tips about the location of sites containing child pornography on a daily basis.  These sites are usually linked to paedophile activities, and strategy proposals can be brought forward on how to combat these distribution sites and prevent the activities involved.</P>
      <P>When I started to investigate child pornography on the Internet everyone told me it would be impossible to bring in legislation to cover it. However, I went to Helsinki because the Finnish police managed to prosecute a server that was receiving pornography from America and then retransmitting it.  They managed to close the server on foot of a Bill introduced in Finland following a successful prosecution by the Church of Scientology after the server used some of its material without permission.  This was craftily used by the Finns to say servers would have to show they received permission from the source of the pornography before they could distribute it on the Internet.</P>
      <P>To run centres which will police cyberspace on behalf of children, one must account for the possibility of information being given to the source.  Have we allowed for information to be distributed on the Internet via a hot line or a focus point so that users will clean up their sites? Do we need to specifically mention that such people should not be prosecuted?</P>
      <P>It is important we ensure people are encouraged to send in information about sites on the Internet where child pornography can be found. This is a big business.  The focal point in Norway was set up 18 months ago and it has received 3,000 reports, which is a considerable number. Reputable web users are closing them down and there is another hot line in Rädda Barnen, Sweden.  I do not wish that people who report to such cyberspace vetting stations be liable to prosecution. Does the Bill cover this?</P>

      <P>I support Senator Henry's remarks in principle as they are valid.  However, on Second Stage the Minister outlined that a working group was set up by the previous Government to report on Internet abuse and it will shortly publish a report on these matters.  It would be more appropriate to wait for the outcome of this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="171" /> I referred on Second Stage to this very important area.  It is of grave concern that the Internet can be used to facilitate child pornography in a very technically advanced fashion.  It is amazing that children of six or seven years of age are better able to use computers and access the Internet than many people in my age group.  This area must be looked at.  I fully concur with the Senator's remarks.  The whole question of abuse of the Internet, not just the dissemination of information about child pornography, must be looked at.</P>
    <P>I urge my colleague to wait until we see what light the report will throw on this area.  I have no doubt we will return to these matters in the not too distant future after the report is published. We must deal with the abuse of information acquired over the Internet soon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some concern in regard to the drafting of Senator Henry's amendment. The subsection she is trying to amend reads: &ldquo;Section 5(1) and subsection (1) shall not apply to a person who possesses child pornography. .&rdquo; to which she wishes to add &ldquo;including material sent by &lsquo;Hot Line&rsquo; for the purpose of reporting an offence&rdquo;.  That causes drafting problems and distorts the meaning of what she is trying to achieve.  For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>However, the interim report of the working group on the Internet, which has been referred to, will address the question of these hot lines.  As Senator O'Donovan said, the Minister stated he will be in a position to publish the report shortly and he expects to do so in the next week or two. I hope something will come from that in terms of what Senator Henry is trying to achieve, which accepting this amendment would not do.</P>

      <P>Senator Ridge is waiting for a Bill and I am waiting for a report &mdash; I will have to wait even longer.  I know the amendment is clumsily drafted but it is very important for the Bill to cover these people in some way.  There have already been 3,000 reports in 18 months, which represents a very small number of the available sites.  I will not repeat in the Seanad the innocuous sounding names of the Internet sites I have been given which, to my amazement, contain child pornography, although I will tell the Minister's officials privately.</P>
      <P>The Norwegian ombudsman, to whom I referred, is being financed by the European Union to police this situation.  Some service providers close down these sites.  I gather one of the service providers here closed down all binary images for about two weeks when it got worried about something pretty innocuous.  The providers are prepared to play their part in policing themselves but someone must point out the providers who are pushing this material on the web.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> It will be unfortunate if the people who find it &mdash; which will not be the Minister or I because I do not see us spending our evenings surfing the web &mdash; cannot be sure they will not be prosecuted if they report it.  We might have to wait quite some time, during which a great deal of child pornography might be left unreported on the Internet. What guarantee does anyone have that they will not be prosecuted if they report it?  As far as I can see, they could be.  I will be delighted if the Minister's officials can say that will not be so. However, we all know it will take at least five years to produce a report and an Act.</P>

Sites involving pornography, including child pornography, are among the most visited sites on the web.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 7, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;It shall be an offence for any newspaper, magazine or periodical on circulation in the State to publish any advertisement for sex chat lines or any chat line which is pornographic in content.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have received many representations from parents whose children ran up telephone bills, sometimes in excess of £500, and the unanimous support of members of my local authority on this matter, all of whom received similar representations. From the work I have done on this issue I have found that greed is the great motivator, specifically the greed of Sunday and daily newspapers in accepting sexually explicit and visually offensive advertisements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not necessarily advising the Minister of State to access these lines, although I hope her officials have done so and have received the quite shocking aural service I received when I accessed <Col N="173" /> it.  I feel very strongly about this.  Anyone who can use a digital telephone can access these lines by dialling a PIN number.  As I said on Second Stage, the depravity and perversion lines are freely available through explicit advertisements in newspapers and magazines.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry is talking about the Internet and I am talking about telephone lines.  The Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, amended section 13(1) of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, to read:</P>
    <P>A person who&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) sends, by means of the telecommunications systems operated by Bord Telecom Éireann, any message or other matter which is grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene or menacing character . shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>Such a person is liable on conviction by a jury to a fine of £50,000.  We could make a great deal of money for the State by enforcing this, apart from anything else.</P>
    <P>My simple, honest request, based on my duty as a public representative and on the representations I have received, as have other elected representatives who have raised this issue, is to ask why we are not acknowledging that seven year old children know how to use telephones.  We are contributing to a massive con in regard to the cost, which can be £1.94 a minute.  We are allowing some children to be prematurely introduced to unnatural sexual practices.  It is all carried in explicit advertising in newspapers, magazines and periodicals.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, agreed with my views on the advertisement of sex chat lines.  I trust the Minister of State will, therefore, accept the amendment, especially when the Leader of the House assured me the matter would be covered by this Bill and that I would be supported by the other side of the House.  Why would the Bill allow the commission of what is an offence under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act?  It would appear advertisers and telecommunications services who allow these calls are guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator O'Donovan and the officials accompanying the Minister of State, who, if I recall correctly, also accompanied the Minister of State at the Department of Children and Health, Deputy Fahey, on Second Stage, recall his agreement with my views on the banning of telephone sex chat lines, which can be and are easily accessed by children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ridge has given another example of how this Bill is about money from the sale of children and their images for sexual exploitation.  These sex chat lines are not free. This is all about money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as sex chat lines have a child pornography content, what Senator <Col N="174" /> Ridge is seeking to achieve is already catered for by this Bill.  The definition of &ldquo;child pornography&rdquo; includes &ldquo;. audio representation that advocates, encourages or counsels unlawful sexual activity with children,&rdquo;.  In addition, section 5(1)(c) makes it an offence for any person to knowingly publish or distribute&mdash;</P>
      <P>. any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the advertiser or any other person produces, distributes, prints, publishes, imports, exports, sells or shows any child pornography,</P>
      <P>We agree that encouraging the use of sex chat lines is a distasteful form of advertising.  From the telecommunications viewpoint, the Department of Public Enterprise would have a role to play in any legislative proposals and in the implementation of the law in this area.  Section 96 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act may prohibit the transmission of objectionable messages.</P>
      <P>I am sure all in this House object to adult pornography. Perhaps sex chat lines could be discussed in the context of a discussion paper on the law on sexual offences.  The Senator may have discussed this earlier with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The amendment refers to the need to distinguish between child pornography on the one hand and pornography generally on the other. However, in its proposal to deal with chat lines which are pornographic in nature it fails to make this distinction.  Nevertheless, sex chat lines which have a child pornography content are covered by the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State and I rarely disagree but on this issue we have different interpretations of a definition.  If the Bill covers unlawful sexual activity with children, is an adult who engages in obscene and unnatural descriptions of sexual practices with a minor on a telephone line not engaging in such unlawful activity?  Why is this not viewed as child pornography?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three relevant aspects to this question.  With regard to telephone numbers, the information can range from the use of weather forecasts to horoscopes to explicit sexual content, which is what we are concerned with. Even the latter category can be subdivided into educational material &mdash; for example, advice for worried teenagers &mdash; to the pornographic.  Any legislation would have to isolate this pornographic category by defining the word &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. This would not be easy and would require much work.  For example, it might be necessary to distinguish between &ldquo;erotic&rdquo; and &ldquo;pornographic&rdquo;. It may also be necessary to make a link between violence and pornography.  It was hoped that what we were trying to cover has been included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the views expressed by the Minister of State.  It is ludicrous if we must <Col N="175" /> start to define again the meaning of &ldquo;pornography&rdquo;. The dictionary contains a simple definition of the word.  Unfortunately, this was compiled before the Internet or the odious sex chat lines.  I almost take exception to the reference to the weather forecast.  It has nothing to do with this ongoing unlawful sexual activity, which is most expensive, is a massive con and an abuse of children. It is concerned with the sexualising of young children on a provided system of telecommunications for which nobody is prepared to take the flak.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I am not skilled enough in the wording of amendments.  However, the Leader of the House knows my concerns and told me they would be covered in the Bill.  Where is the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Fahey, who agreed with me on Second Stage?  It is disgusting that anti-family and anti-women advertisements are carried in newspapers where any child can read them.  It is not good enough and I will be pressing this amendment. I know the Minister would not want to encourage the continuance of this.  It comes within the scope of the Bill &mdash; it is an unlawful sexual activity.  The parents who approach me are not concerned about their children making calls to the weather forecast.  I rang one of the numbers myself and what I was offered was mind boggling; it would be charitable to call it unlawful sexual activity.  Any ten year old child could ring that number.</P>
      <P>Are we protecting children in this Bill or trying to demonstrate how good we are at defining words in the dictionary?  Due to the verbal support I received from the Government benches, which has fallen strangely silent today, I withdrew one of my amendments.  What is the purpose of my being here when I was told categorically that I would have the support of the entire House?</P>

      <P>I hope we are not returning to the argument about the difference between eroticism and pornography.  That has been discussed for <Col N="176" /> generations and I would hate to think we would go down that road at this late stage.</P>
      <P>What is the situation if an adult dials a sex chat line and then hands the phone to a child?  Is the child then being abused?  I ask this because I have seen too many instances where pornographic videos were used to soften children up so that they felt some totally unsuitable activity was normal. This is one of the main problems with incest, children think that this is what happens in every household.  That is often why they take so long to report abuse.  If an adult rings a sex chat line and hands the phone to the child he is trying to abuse, is this form of abuse covered by this Bill?</P>

      <P>Within the definition, which I tried to explain during the debate, our advice is clear that this is the definition of child pornography. General pornography to which children have access is a different issue which is outside the scope of this Bill.  The Bill deals strictly with child pornography as defined on pages 3 and 4.  The difference between child pornography and general pornography to which children have access was dealt with by Minister O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>The effect of these amendments would be to take the offences in section 7(4) out of the category of summary offences to be dealt with by the District Court and to make them indictable offences, by which I mean offences triable in the Circuit Court.  This is because the penalty which may be imposed on summary conviction for an offence does not normally exceed a fine of £1,500 or imprisonment for a term of up to 12 months.  It is only in very particular circumstances that the District Court can sentence a person to more than 12 months imprisonment and even then the sentence may not exceed two years.  with the advice she received but I am sure she</P>
      <P>The offences in section 7 are standard offences created in just about every entry and search provision in every enactment.  If I were to agree to this amendment, then clearly the consistency which exists between the many analogous offences under other enactments would be broken.  Certainly, the offences under this Bill may be regarded as more serious than certain other criminal offences.  However, for the purpose of the offence created under section 7(4), what is at issue is not what the Garda are attempting to seize from the search but rather the fact that the person, whose premises are being searched, is not co-operating with the Garda.  It is this lack of co-operation which warrants punishment rather than the nature of the goods seizable under the warrant.  Accordingly, while I appreciate the thinking which influenced Senator Henry to table these amendments, I regret we are unable to accept them.</P>

To answer Senator Ridge's question, the discussion paper on the law on sexual offences was published approximately two weeks ago by the Department.

      <P>This Bill relates to two main changes in legislation. First, it creates new offences of trafficking children for the purpose of their sexual exploitation with penalties of up to life imprisonment; second, it outlaws all forms of child pornography with penalties of up to 14 years imprisonment.  In doing so, it takes account of the EU joint action against trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation of children, and the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  I hope people will consider that this is another step in the right direction with regard to the many important issues we discussed today.</P>

      <P>I am glad to return to the House to speak on the Second Stage of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Customs governing the conduct of war have existed from ancient times.  The Laws of Manu, the greatest of the ancient Hindu codes, prohibited Hindus from using arrows and the Greeks and Romans customarily observed a prohibition against poison or poisoned weapons &mdash; I thought this would be the tone expected of me by the Seanad.  Senators always appreciate useful information. During the middle ages the Lateran Council of 1132 declared that the crossbow and <Col N="180" /> arbalest were unchristian weapons.  As far back as the late middle ages, customs governing the conduct of war were clearly documented in the works of the famous commentator on international law, Hugo Grotius.  These customs began to be transformed into treaties in the 19th century. One of the early steps in this development of international law was the Paris Declaration respecting maritime law in 1856.  The conclusion of the first Geneva Convention in 1864 for the amelioration of the condition of wounded in armies in the field was another important milestone in the development of humanitarian law. This was followed by the conclusion of the St. Petersburg Declaration renouncing the use in time of war of explosive projectiles under 400 grammes weight in 1868 and by the conclusion of the Hague Conventions of 1899 concerning the laws and customs of war on land and of 1907 concerning the opening of hostilities and the laws and customs of warfare on land.  Further development of this process to reduce the suffering of individuals in time of war occurred with the adoption of the Geneva Conventions in 1906 on the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armies in the field, and in 1929 on the amelioration of the condition of wounded in armed forces in the field and on the treatment of prisoners of war.</P>
    <P>However, the atrocities which took place during World War II prompted the conclusion of the Genocide Convention in 1948 and the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, first, on the amelioration of the condition of the wounded and sick in armed forces in the field, second, on the amelioration of the condition of wounded, sick and shipwrecked members of armed forces at sea, third, on the treatment of prisoners of war and fourth, on the protection of civilian persons in enemy and occupied territory in time of war. These four Geneva Conventions have undoubtedly been the most significant in updating international humanitarian law.  Ireland is a party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.  They are part of Irish law by virtue of the Red Cross Act, 1954, the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956, and the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.  International humanitarian law is the term which is currently used to describe that branch of law that was formerly known as the laws of war. In the United States it is often called operational law as it affects military operations.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable effect to be given to the Protocols additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 done at Geneva on 8 June 1977 and for that purpose to amend the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962, section 6(1) of the Red Cross Act, 1938 and section 1 of the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956 and to provide for connected matters.  Additional Protocol I and Protocol II are the most recent efforts at a multilateral level to augment and reinforce the Geneva Conventions of 1949.  They cover aspects of human suffering in armed conflict not included in the Geneva Conventions of 1949.  Additional Protocol l relates to international armed conflicts <Col N="181" /> while Additional Protocol II is confined to non-international armed conflicts &mdash; of which we have been witnessing many recently.</P>
    <P>I want to begin with the substance of the two Additional Protocols whose texts are set out in the Schedule to this Bill as the Fifth and Sixth Schedules to the Principal Act.</P>
    <P>Protocol l, Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, is concerned with the protection of victims of international armed conflicts. It contains 102 articles and attempts to deal with a wide range of issues including the protection of medical units, the methods and means of warfare, the status of combatants and prisoners of war and the protection of the civilian population against the effects of hostilities, among others.  I do not intend to discuss the merits of each part of the Protocolumn However, it is important to note that the Protocol facilitates several advancements in the whole area of international humanitarian law.  A significant development is contained in article 90.  This provision acknowledges the fundamental importance of the International Humanitarian Fact Finding Commission, a permanent body available to the international community which I am happy to say has been operational since 1992.  This is a new concept which is expressly designed to promote the application of international humanitarian law.  For the first time in the law of armed conflict this article institutes a permanent, non-political and impartial international commission of inquiry to which the parties to the conflict can resort at any time.  The commission comprises 15 members of high moral standing and acknowledged impartiality and has its seat in Berne, Switzerland.  In its operations the commission must remain true to certain basic characteristics expressed or implied in article 90. Accordingly, it must carry out its functions in an independent and impartial way, in conformity with the international law requirements of fair procedure and, in general, on the basis of the consent of the parties.  The setting up of this independent fact-finding commission is a welcome development which will assist in respect and compliance for international humanitarian law.</P>
    <P>The broad purpose of the commission is to protect the victims of armed conflict by encouraging and securing the observation of the principles and rules of international law applicable in armed conflict.  To this end the commission is competent, first, to inquire into any facts alleged to be a grave breach as defined in the conventions and the protocols or other serious violations of the conventions or the protocols and, second, to facilitate through its good offices the restoration of an attitude of respect for the conventions and the protocols. In addition, the commission is also empowered to institute inquiries in other situations at the request of a party to the conflict, but only if the other party or parties concerned consent. Significantly, the commission has expressed its willingness to inquire into alleged violations of humanitarian law, including those arising in non-international armed conflicts provided all parties concerned have consented.  It is a useful tool <Col N="182" /> which has the potential to serve the international community better than any other fact-finding body.</P>
    <P>Protocol I also makes provision for the enhancement of the protection to be afforded to the civilian population including a prohibition on reprisals, starvation, the destruction of food and the destruction of farming areas.  It also contains rules for the protection of works and installations containing dangerous forces and a prohibition on acts which damage the natural environment in articles 52 to 56.  In article 79 journalists engaged in professional missions in areas of armed conflict are given protection as civilians and are entitled to special identity cards.</P>
    <P>Protocol II constitutes the first real legal instrument for the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts.  It is shorter than Protocol I containing only 28 articles.  In Part II it deals with areas of humane treatment; in Part III with wounded, sick and shipwrecked and in Part IV with the civilian population.  It establishes fundamental guarantees for all persons who do not take a direct part in hostilities, bans attacks on the civilian population and forbids the forced displacement of civilians.</P>
    <P>Protocols I and II address the plight of children affected by armed conflict and it is in this context that I wish to draw attention to the horrendous plight of children affected by armed conflict.  As the most innocent and powerless victims children require special protection.  At this moment, in approximately 50 countries around the world, children are suffering from the effects of conflict and its aftermath.  Not only are millions of children still the victims of war, but far too often they are its principal targets and even its instruments.</P>
    <P>For all the children deliberately massacred, caught in cross fire or maimed by anti-personnel land mines, many more have been deprived of their physical, mental and emotional needs in the context of societies long at war.  In Vietnam, Cambodia and Bosnia many people now go about their daily lives without one or more limbs.  Some have been permanently traumatised by the events they have witnessed and experienced.  In today's conflicts children are specifically targeted in strategies to eliminate the next generation of potential adversaries.  Buildings and sites that have a presence of children, such as schools, playgrounds, kindergartens and hospitals, have been targeted for attack and destruction.  To the same end children have been made the targets of rape, sexual abuse and gender based violence on a large scale.</P>
    <P>Moreover, there has been an alarming trend in recent years of enlisting children into armed forces and groups to participate in armed conflicts. Most cynically, children have been compelled to become instruments of war, recruited or kidnapped to become child soldiers and forced to give expression to the hatreds of adults.  Instances in which children have been coerced into joining government forces, for example in Guatemala and El Salvador, or opposition movements, as in Mozambique and Angola, are obvious examples <Col N="183" /> of victimisation.  There is little doubt that children have become victims in the current conflict and ethnic cleansing in the troubled area of Kosovo. Photographs in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 June 1998 of an armed child near the Albanian border and of a displaced child in Ethiopia fully illustrate this.</P>
    <P>The Additional Protocols contain a number of significant measures which govern the protection of children in armed conflicts.  There are 25 articles in total which specifically pertain to children. In particular, article 77 of Protocol I, entitled &ldquo;Protection of Children&rdquo;, stipulates that children shall be the objects of special respect and shall be protected against any form of assault during conflict.  Article 77, paragraph 2(c), requires parties to conflicts to &ldquo;take all feasible measures&rdquo; to ensure that children who have not attained the age of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities. Article 77, paragraph 4, provides that&mdash;</P>
    <P>. if arrested, detained or interned for reasons related to the armed conflict, children shall be held in quarters separate from the quarters of adults, except where families are accommodated as family units as provided in Article 75 paragraph 5.</P>
    <P>These guarantees are further supplemented by article 4, paragraph 3, of Protocol II which is devoted exclusively to children and requires that they &ldquo;should be provided with the care and aid they require&rdquo;, referring expressly to education, family reunion and temporary evacuation.  The standards and commitments for the protection of children in armed conflict created by the Additional Protocols are of particular relevance and importance today.  Children represent the future of human civilisation and the future of every society.  To permit them to be used as pawns in warfare, whether as targets or perpetrators, is to cast a shadow on the future.</P>
    <P>One of the truly innovative features of Protocol I is the inclusion for the first time of a chapter dealing with civil defence.  Civil defence is defined at article 61 of Protocol I as the performance of some or all of a variety of humanitarian tasks to protect the civil population against the dangers, and to help it recover from the immediate effects, of hostilities or disasters and also to provide the conditions necessary for its survival.  The main tasks of civil defence include warning, evacuation, management of shelters and blackout measures, rescue, medical services, including first aid and religious assistance, fire fighting, detection and marking of danger areas, decontamination and similar protective measures, provision of emergency accommodation and supplies, emergency assistance in the restoration and maintenance of order in distressed areas, emergency repair of indispensable public utilities, emergency disposal of the dead and assistance in the preservation of objects essential for survival.</P>
    <P>Article 62 provides that civil defence organisations and personnel shall be respected and protected in order that they can perform their tasks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="184" /> In order to be protected they must be identified and the protocol introduces the international distinctive sign of civil defence which is an equilateral blue triangle on an orange background.  It also provides for an identity card which incorporates the international distinctive sign.</P>
    <P>In Ireland, Civil Defence operates under the Air Raid Precaution Acts, 1939 and 1946, and the Local Government Acts, 1941, 1955, 1960, 1963 and 1976.  The Minister of State at the Department of Defence has responsibility for the co-ordination of policy, planning and organisation for civil defence.  The main elements of the organisation are the civil defence branch of the Department of Defence, which includes the Civil Defence School and 32 local authority units under the control of the relevant county or city manager.  The day to day operation of the Civil Defence at local level is carried out by the Civil Defence officer.  The control, administration and direction of the organisation is operated through the civil defence branch of the Department of Defence whose functions include control of expenditure and the provision of civil defence equipment for use by local authorities.  The Civil Defence School provides technical advice on civil defence and provides training and qualification of instructors.</P>
    <P>The Civil Defence organisation was established initially to protect the civilian population from the hazards of war, in particular atomic or nuclear war, but it is now involved principally in a community support role.  It is organised on a county basis with volunteers recruited locally for the following services &mdash; warden, rescue, casualty, welfare and auxiliary fire service.  The tendency nowadays is for a multi-disciplined service.  There are approximately 6,000 male and female active volunteers in the organisation with a further 3,000 trained persons not active but available in a major emergency.  The Department of Defence staff involved with Civil Defence matters number 25 personnel, both administrative and technical.  The current annual budget is £3.5 million approximately.</P>
    <P>I need hardly say that human rights and international humanitarian law are closely linked.  On 10 December 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  This year has been designated United Nations Human Rights Year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the signing of the declaration.  The celebrations will culminate with the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 10 December 1998.</P>
    <P>The human rights unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs is co-ordinating, in conjunction with the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Human Rights and the Joint Department of Foreign Affairs and Non-Governmental Organisations Standing Committee on Human Rights, a number of events to commemorate the anniversary. On 7 March of this year a Non-Governmental Organisation Forum on Human Rights was organised at national level and a commemorative postage stamp is being issued.  In addition, <Col N="185" /> the European Council in Luxembourg issued a statement reaffirming the commitment of the Union to the principles enshrined in the universal declaration.  The declaration itself contains 30 articles which recognise the inherent dignity and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.</P>
    <P>I have detailed for the benefit of the House some aspects of the substance of and the background to the Bill.  I propose now to refer to the various sections of the Bill.  Section 1 defines the Principal Act as the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.  The State is already party to the four Geneva Conventions of 1949.  Effect was given to the aforesaid conventions in Irish law with the enactment of the Red Cross Act, 1954, the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956, and the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.</P>
    <P>Section 2 replaces section 2 of the Principal Act, 1962, with an entirely new section in regard to the interpretation of the phrases &ldquo;court&rdquo;, &ldquo;International Fact-Finding Commission&rdquo;, &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;protected internee&rdquo;, &ldquo;protected prisoner of war&rdquo;, &ldquo;the protecting power&rdquo;, &ldquo;Protocol I&rdquo;, &ldquo;Protocol II&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the Scheduled Conventions&rdquo; as used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3, amending section 3 of the Principal Act, extends the category of &ldquo;grave breach&rdquo; under the Principal Act to include &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; as defined in paragraph 4 of article 11 of Protocol I and paragraphs 2, 3, or 4 of article 85 of Protocol I and sets out maximum sentences applicable in respect of &ldquo;grave breaches&rdquo; which involve wilful killing and other grave breaches.  In the former the sentence is to be life imprisonment or any less term and for the latter the term of punishment shall not exceed 14 years.  In addition to wilful killing, any act or omission which seriously endangers the physical or mental health or integrity of any person who is in the power of a party is a grave breach.</P>
    <P>Section 4 relates to minor breaches of the conventions and Protocols I and II by adding references to the appropriate protocol or to both protocols where reference is made in the Principal Act to &ldquo;the Scheduled Conventions&rdquo;, i.e. the four Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and by updating the level of certain fines provided for in the Principal Act from £50 to £1,500 on conviction in the District Court and from £300 to £15,000 on conviction following trial on indictment. A minor breach is any act or omission which is not a grave breach.  Ireland's 1962 Geneva Conventions Act differs in a positive way from other common law legislation in that it expressly provides, in section 4, for the punishment of non-grave offences of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 when committed in Ireland or by an Irish national.</P>
    <P>It is entirely consistent with this approach to extend the scope of section 4 to cover not only non-grave breaches of Additional Protocol I of 1977, as is done in section 4 of the Bill, but also to cover violations of Additional Protocol II. Although legislation extending jurisdiction over <Col N="186" /> violations of humanitarian law committed in non-international armed conflicts is not obligatory, nevertheless it is in the best interests of war victims to provide for this jurisdiction in our legislation. The Bill thus provides for jurisdiction over violations of humanitarian law occurring during high intensity non-international armed conflicts, i.e., those covered by Additional Protocol II of 1977 on the basis of territory and nationality.</P>
    <P>Section 5 facilitates the proof of application of any of the conventions or Protocol I in court proceedings by way of a certificate from the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Section 6 is a very important one which enables judicial notice to be taken of a report from the International Fact-Finding Commission.  Section 7 provides for the insertion of the two additional Protocols into the Principal Act as the Fifth and Sixth Schedules.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables the Minister for Foreign Affairs to publish in a statutory instrument any reservation or declaration made by the State in relation to either of the Additional Protocols. Section 9 regulates the use of certain signs, symbols and signals for the purposes of identification by the civil defence services and medical units and transports and also makes their use subject to the consent of the Minister for Defence. Section 10 makes provision for the making of regulations by the Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>Section 11 increases the fine for offences committed under the Red Cross Act, 1938, from £10 to £1,500.  Section 12 extends the scope of section 1 of the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956, which provides the definition of persons as prisoners of war and enemy aliens.  Section 13 restricts the application of section 12 of the Extradition Act, 1965, by specifying that it does not apply in the case of an offence involving a grave or minor breach of any of the Scheduled Conventions or of Protocols I or II.</P>
    <P>Section 14 enables Ireland to make an annual contribution towards the administrative expenses of the International Fact-Finding Commission.  At the present time, the annual budget of the commission is in the region of £65,000.  While it would be inappropriate and premature to speculate whether or not the Government will make a declaration pursuant to paragraph 2 of article 90 of Additional Protocol I in relation to the International Fact-Finding Commission and thereby obliging the State to make an annual contribution towards the expenses of the commission in accordance with paragraph 7 of the said article, nevertheless I should inform the House that, on the basis of information available to the Minister, the current likely annual contribution for Ireland should be less than £1,000.</P>
    <P>Section 15 is a general expense provision. Section 16 provides for the short title, collective citation, construction and commencement of the Bill.  It also enables the Minister for Foreign Affairs to make an order to bring this Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>This legislation is of fundamental importance. While, at present, we are living in a time of relative peace in the world, it is nonetheless imperative <Col N="187" /> that the utmost respect be accorded to international humanitarian law.  It is highly desirable that Ireland should be seen by other states to be adding to the momentum required for the universal respect of the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions by ratifying these Protocols.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the Bill.  However, the Minister avoided answers to questions which are begging to be asked.  What have we been doing for the past 21 years?  There have been Governments of every political hue and combination in those 21 years.  I do not understand how it can take 21 years to introduce legislation ratifying these Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention. I have yet to receive an explanation.  Is it a subliminal statement by successive Governments that, as we are a &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; state, these matters did not trouble us too much and that other states could get on with ratifying them as they might be more immediately involved in armed conflict in Europe and internationally?  What is the reason for the 21 year delay?  To do justice to such important legislation the Minister of State owes the House an explanation on that point at the very outset.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State brought us through the history of organising codes of behaviour in time of war and armed conflict generally. He pointed out that the original Geneva Convention was signed in 1864 and was amended in 1906 and 1929.  In 1949 the four Geneva Red Cross Conventions were ratified to protect victims of international armed conflict.</P>
      <P>I take issue with the Minister of State in that no explanatory memorandum was published with the original Bill before it went to the Dáil.  Maybe we could have an explanation as to why that was so, given the technical nature of the legislation, including various protocols, articles and the number of changes that have taken place over the years.  It would have been a courtesy to Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas if an explanatory memorandum had been made available.  I know it is not normal procedure to issue an explanatory memorandum for the Seanad or for a Bill that is coming from the Dáil to the Seanad, but I understood it was normal to have an explanatory memorandum with a Bill before it went to the Dáil or when it is initially published, whether it originated in the Seanad or the Dáil. I cannot understand why an initial explanatory memorandum was omitted on this occasion.</P>
      <P>In replying to Second Stage, the Minister of State should indicate how many other international conventions, or amendments to such conventions, are awaiting ratification by this House through amending legislation of one kind or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>

      <P>If anyone is troubled enough in the future to check the Official Report, these facts should be on the record.  If these important amendments to the Geneva Convention, and the addition of the two protocols, can take 21 years to go through the Houses of the Oireachtas, what others are in the wings, of import or otherwise, that we have yet to get around to dealing with?  I think we should know.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State outlined in some detail the extension of the scope of the original conventions and exactly what these amendments seek to do.  The Bill changes the law to enable us to ratify both protocols.  This brings us to a very relevant point, particularly in the Irish context, which is the debate over whether we should extend our military role to peacemaking as distinct from peacekeeping alone.  I would like to see a far more open debate in this regard.  There is a role for extending the excellent reputation of our Defence Forces and the Garda Síochána who have done this nation proud in their peacekeeping roles abroad and on the one occasion when they were put into a peacemaking role, in Somalia.</P>
      <P>Even as a neutral nation, there is room for a far greater investigation into the possibility of using our armed forces and gardaí as peacemakers. Particularly as a neutral nation, we have a very important role as peacemakers as well as peacekeepers.  As peacemakers our neutral stance over the years should increase our bona fides in many difficult and tense political situations that have resulted in armed conflict.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State should consider a more open debate on the possibility of extending the role of our armed forces generally in this regard. It may well be that the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have to partake in such a debate as much as, or instead of, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, such as it may be, it is very relevant to the legislation before the House.</P>
      <P>The point of extending our peacekeeping role to that of peacemaking is extremely important now that we have ratified the Amsterdam Treaty by referendum.  In the Amsterdam Treaty provisions are made for transferring certain areas &mdash; such as humanitarian aid, search and rescue, environmental protection, peacekeeping and peace enforcing &mdash; from the Western European Union to the European Union.  We are now in a position to have an informed and enlightened debate as to whether we should extend the boundaries of our security forces' involvement in peacemaking and not just restrict it to peacekeeping &mdash; an area in which the individuals involved have done great credit to their country for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State pointed out some interesting facts in his address.  I had no knowledge of Hugo Grotius or the customs of the middle ages and the Laterine Council.  He certainly added some historic interest to the topic before us.  We are basically talking about the evolution of customs of war to treaties, and the <Col N="189" /> Minister of State pointed that out quite graphically. At a specially convened diplomatic conference in 1977, the two protocols now before the House were adopted.  These concern the conduct of combatants and the protection of the civilian population from the effects of hostilities.</P>
    <P>Drawing on the experiences of World War II and technological developments over the years, this diplomatic conference was convened.  Twenty one years later we are about to transpose that into effect by amending our law.</P>
    <P>Protocol I concerns the protection of victims of international armed conflict, while Protocol II concerns the protection of victims of non-international conflict and includes provisions relating to the protection of civilians &mdash; a most important move.</P>
    <P>I want to make particular reference to article 51 of Protocol I, which confirms that innocent civilians must be kept outside hostilities as far as possible and must enjoy general protection from hostilities.  I quote that legal reference which came my way from the Minister of State's own Department.</P>
    <P>Violation is qualified as a grave breach of the protocol.  The question of violations of the Geneva Convention and breaches of the law brings me to what powers of enforcement actually exist and how realistic is our ability to enforce.  I would like the Minister to develop his thinking, as well as European and international thinking, in this area.  Are we in a position to enforce humanitarian issues on the fringes of national and international warfare as regard breaches of protocol? What actual powers exist among the different states in the international fora for enforcing such breaches?</P>
    <P>Are the increased fines in the penalties section of the Bill realistic?  Sums of £50 to £1,500 are stated.  Yes, £50 is laughable, but is £1,500 a meaningful figure in a modern context?  Who pays these fines if we catch up with the individual breaching the code of conduct in warfare?  Who will pay for them?  Is it not the individual states or armed forces?  Will individuals pay the fines out of their own pockets?  I think not.  In the main, if there are breaches of the protocols in these conventions, individual states will pay.  A £1,500 or £5,000 fine for a state does little to dissuade those from the error of their ways.  Laudable as all the sentiments in the legislation and in the conventions are &mdash; and we do support them &mdash; how do we enforce penalties that are not realistic, if we ever catch up with those who breach the law?</P>
    <P>I understand that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court is being considered. What are the plans for such a body and what will be its structures?  What role will Ireland play in the context of an international criminal court?  Will neutral states have a particular role in such a court or will they have no role whatsoever? We could argue both sides of that issue. Will the Minister of State inform the House of his views on that proposal and will he state the current position in respect of it?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="190" /> Under Protocol I article 90 institutes the establishment of the international humanitarian fact-finding commission which will be a permanent, non-political body designed to promote the application of international humanitarian law.  This is an extremely important development.  I understand the commission was constituted in 1991 or 1992 and is up and running.  Will the Minister provide information with regard to the effectiveness of this body and its role in regulating, from a humanitarian point of view, the code of international warfare?</P>
    <P>Where stands atomic warfare in the context of the Bill?  I am open to correction but I do not believe the legislation makes specific reference to such warfare.  Surely the concept of an atomic war makes international codes of behaviour, the Geneva Conventions and other conventions and the role of the Red Cross and individual states totally superfluous or irrelevant.  Will the Minister of State comment on the rules relating to the horrific concept of atomic warfare <i>vis-à-vis</i> this legislation?</P>
    <P>I will conclude with a slightly irreverent story &mdash; I hope it will not detract from the seriousness of the legislation &mdash; which pertains to reference to the Geneva Convention and the Minister of State's constituency, Waterford.  The story was imparted to me by Senator Tom Hayes, who will not be in a position to contribute to the debate. However, he gave me permission to place it on record.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, when Clover Meats initially began to supply meat to the armed forces in Germany, a mess sergeant was dispatched to check the sourcing of the meat, the killing line, etc., and to ensure that everything was in order.  The mess sergeant stayed in Dooley's Hotel, a well known hostelry in County Waterford, which was run by a strict and formidable maître d' called Ms Dooley. With his business for the day complete, the mess sergeant decided to retire to his room but, contrary to the regulations of the house, he was not alone.  Having been chided by Ms Dooley to remove his lady friend from the bedroom, the mess sergeant told the proprietor where to go.  Ms Dooley called the local garda who arrested the mess sergeant and brought him before the court in Waterford on the following day.  When asked by the judge to explain his behaviour and offer a defence, he stated he was improperly arrested and that as a serving member of the armed forces he had not been cautioned under the relevant section of the Geneva Convention or asked his rank and serial number.  Therefore, the mess sergeant got off by citing the Geneva Convention, and this is one of the earliest records of its use in Ireland.  I thought the Minister of State would enjoy this story as it pertains to his constituency.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely important.  Will the Minister of State respond to the points I made?  One matter I did not raise involves the use of sexual abuse as a weapon in modern warfare.  Is sexual abuse covered fully and adequately under the 1977 to the original Geneva Conventions?  If only <Col N="191" /> for the record, the Minister of State should comment on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>As other Members stated, this legislation is long overdue.  I am not sure why it was not placed on the Statute Book before now. However, following its enactment, we must ensure that, as part of international law and international protocols, it is complied with by the signatories to the Geneva Conventions.</P>
      <P>Whether referring to 1864, 1907, 1949 or 1977, we must accept that those involved in developing the principles behind the Geneva Conventions had the right idea.  However, little has happened as a result of their efforts.  The Geneva Conventions attempt to establish acceptable governance of the rules and customs of war, armed conflict and international humanitarian law.  Have they been successful in that regard?  The answer is no. The aims of the Geneva Conventions are extremely humane because if they were not in place the barbarism connected with warfare might be worse than it is at present.  How can war be regarded as anything less than barbaric?  Brutality is a part of any armed conflict and unmitigated brutality is being visited on people across the globe at present.</P>
      <P>The Bill includes provisions on ameliorating ongoing problems in respect of the wounded, the sick, children, etc., in warfare.  The Minister of State indicated that the Lateran Council of 1132 declared that the crossbow and arbalest were unchristian weapons.  That council or any other council established by the Catholic Church did not object to the activities of the Spanish Inquisition, which decided to kill anyone who was not a member of the Church or who did not abide by its laws.</P>
      <P>In the historical context, it is interesting to consider the conclusion of the St. Petersburg Declaration in 1868 renouncing the use in time of war of explosive projectiles under 400 grammes weight.  If one takes account of the use of landmines throughout the world, 400 grammes might be deemed a reasonable average in terms of a landmine's weight.  Unfortunately, however, these weapons are very small and they are hard to remove because plastic is used in their construction. The Minister of State referred to international human rights and, at a time when the European Commission has reneged on its obligations in terms of international human rights and the amelioration of problems attached to civilian populations which have been harmed, hurt or mutilated by wars during the past five to six years, we must take action to remove landmines, improve international human rights and rehabilitate the men, women and children who have been mutilated in recent wars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following a judgment handed down by the International Court of Law, the European Commission has decided that because NGOs are not established on a statutory basis they will no longer receive funding.  As a result, these organisations which help sick and wounded victims of <Col N="192" /> war will lose funding amounting to £264 million. That happened on 10 June as a result of a court case brought in 1995 by Britain, supported by Denmark and Sweden.  The reason the British gave for bringing the case was that they wanted to cut EU spending but they have done away with aid projects for bodies like Concern, Trócaire and GOAL.  It is suggested that Trócaire will lose about £2.4 million in funding for its South American operations alone &mdash; Trócaire itself provided £1 million in funding for those operations &mdash; and 75,000 people in the continent will suffer as a result.</P>
    <P>The International Fact-Finding Commission was set up in 1992 and is currently operational but what benefit has it been to people in areas of conflict?  We have set up international commissions to deal with what happened in Rwanda, Burundi and elsewhere but it has been virtually impossible to do anything in these areas.  The commission was established in hope but, although it comprises 15 members of high moral standing and acknowledged impartiality, it has not done anything to stop violations of humanitarian law, including those arising from non-international arms conflicts.  The Minister said it was a useful tool but how is it to be put to work?</P>
    <P>I am delighted he has included a provision on the use of children in areas of armed conflict because there can be no doubt that they have suffered in certain areas of the world.  In minor conflicts, civil wars and international conflicts the rights of children have been ignored.  The Geneva Convention states that children should be removed from areas of conflict but there is no point pretending this has happened &mdash; in many cases, they have been drawn into areas of conflict so that they can be used as shields to protect protagonists or to take part in the war.  The Minister said children have been coerced into joining Government forces in Guatemala and El Salvador and opposition movements in Mozambique or Angola, and that these are obvious examples of victimisation.  Having observed the position in both Mozambique and Angola, I know that both Government and opposition sides have victimised children.  When one sees children in conflict areas who have been mutilated or lost limbs, etc., one can have no doubt that the people behind these wars have no humanity.  It is not only in African or Third World countries where this has happened; throughout the ages children have been used in the progression of conflict and this will continue.</P>
    <P>If children are arrested, detained or interned for reasons related to the armed conflict they should be kept in quarters separate from adults except where families are accommodated as units, as provided in Article 75(5) of the convention. However, that provision is completely ignored in Rwanda.  Children are being born and are living in detention camps with their parents who were involved in the conflict, and children who were involved in the atrocities have not been separated from adults. <Col N="193" /> The Minister made the first significant mention of Civil Defence which I have heard for many years.  Although its members do not play a major part in the day to day provision of aid to the civilian community, they are well trained and have been used in floods, fires and threats of explosions.  It is good to hear them mentioned and to have acknowledged that they are able to provide humanitarian aid.  Civil Defence is designed to provide aid to the civilian and military authorities and is well prepared for whatever hazards may arise.</P>
    <P>In protecting people affected by war, we must go to the basic issue &mdash; that is, who supplies the arms?  The Geneva Convention has been signed by the US, Britain and France but those countries are the biggest arms suppliers in the world.  Some people argue that British Conservative Governments spend a larger percentage of their budgets on armaments than British Labour Governments, but down the years Labour Governments have spent much more.  The arms trade has no morality and the armaments firms of the US, Britain and France could not care less where their products end up.  Tomorrow we will be discussing East Timor; the current British Minister for Defence is in the process of selling more planes to Indonesia and these could only be used for suppressing the local population.</P>
    <P>In the year marking the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is a disgrace that the European Commission should override the wishes of the European Parliament &mdash; albeit as a result of a court judgment &mdash; and cut £260 million in aid and £7 million which was to be used for the elimination of landmines.  This money would have gone to organisations like Oxfam, GOAL and Trócaire and it is horrific to think it is happening at this time.  Europe should feel ashamed of this, and we should be ashamed of ourselves if we allow it to continue.</P>
    <P>This legislation is of fundamental importance. While we live in a time of relative peace around the world, it is nevertheless imperative that the utmost respect be accorded to international humanitarian law.  Within a three or four hour airplane journey of Ireland, massacres are taking place and the war in Kosovo is a major conflict. The problems associated with the possible spread of conflict in the Balkans cannot be ignored.</P>
    <P>There is conflict in the Middle East between the Palestinians and the Israelis.  We have close connections to this area in terms of trade, tourism and religion.  There are ongoing wars in South America, many of which are not linked to cocaine.  There is no doubt recent events in Pakistan and India must be taken into account as a major source of possible world conflagration because they are playing against each other, but they will be supported by outsiders and their weapons of mass destruction do not bear thinking about.</P>
    <P>One can buy whatever one wants in terms of armaments at any roundabout in Beirut.  I do see what the fuss is about when people talk about decommissioning in the North because they could <Col N="194" /> get rid of everything they have and then purchase more weapons.  As a result of the break up of the USSR one can buy arms for very little in countries in the former Russian Federation and the Middle East.</P>
    <P>The Bill has great meaning and gives one hope that a great deal more will be done to help those trapped by conflict and punish those responsible for it but, unfortunately, unless countries tackle the problems rather than just tabling more amendments to conventions, we will not get very far.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have been a little involved in the Bill's passing through the Oireachtas.  On the Adjournment on 4 November 1993 I asked that these Additional Protocols be ratified.  I explained them to the former Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald and she stated that:</P>
      <P>The first step, therefore, will be for a detailed examination of the Protocols to be undertaken with a view to determining the nature of any legislation which may be required. .Following any recommendation in that regard and with a view to their ratification in due course, I will be submitting the matter to Government so that a decision can be taken on how best to proceed to enable Ireland to comply with obligations which the Protocols impose.</P>
      <P>Legislation was ready last May; it took at least four years to get this far.  However, I am sure when people got around to looking at it they drafted it quickly.  It is unfortunate that we signed the conventions almost 20 years ago and yet it took this long to ratify the Additional Protocols. It makes us appear half hearted.  We must be seen to care about this issue, because it deals with the humanitarian concerns at the heart of international law and morality.</P>
      <P>We in Ireland like to think we have an important place in these debates.  We are in a good position to speak on international humanitarian law because, while Ireland is not a big, powerful country, we have a great deal of influence internationally because of our history.  We have a policy of neutrality and a very good record in peacekeeping and humanitarian relief activities. While Ireland was important in the promotion of international disarmament in the 1950s and 1960s, it would be appropriate if we tried to have a more active role in this field.  The very least we should do is not lag behind in terms of international progress.</P>
      <P>While a significant number of states still have not ratified these protocols, it is good that Ireland is doing so now.  The Principal Act is of great importance and the legislation has to do with the principle of universal jurisdiction and humanitarian legislation.  As we speak a meeting is taking place in Rome on the concept of setting up an international criminal court, which I hope happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to international law a state has a right to punish the crime of genocide and crimes <Col N="195" /> against humanity in violation of the Hague Conventions of their own nationals and aliens.  Under section 3 we will establish the right to prosecute such people.  Should we have gone further to say we have a duty to prosecute them?  This would mean we would rise above the minimum obligation on us under international law.  It would have been a statement that this State could in no circumstances be seen as a haven for war criminals. Should a war crimes Bill be passed if it is needed, similar to that in the UK and Belgium so that we would have a duty and not just a right to prosecute people involved in war crimes?</P>
    <P>We could promote the seizure of assets belonging to warlords in Ireland.  There has been a major problem with those who waged wars around the world putting their assets in other areas, frequently Europe or the United States, because they feel they are safe.  It could be a large deterrent to these criminals if they knew their assets would be seized in Ireland.  They frequently wage wars in their native countries while their families and money are abroad.  They are at risk of being shot in their countries and, therefore, the thought of a prison sentence is not much of a deterrent, but the fact that their millions or billions could be seized might make them think more carefully about what they are doing.</P>
    <P>We could also look at their exports which are obtained in the most appalling manner in their own countries.  For example, the diamond trade is very important in Sierra Leone.  Diamonds are exported to Amsterdam and Antwerp and the means by which they are obtained are unsavoury. I do not know if they are sent to Shannon, but if they were, it would be good if we were in a position to do something about it.</P>
    <P>One frequently sees newspaper reports of dictators in Third World countries, who thrive on dealing with the poorest people, whose families live in Switzerland or the US.  They attend college, have large villas and a satisfactory lifestyle. Would it not be good if we led the way so that if one of them bought a magnificent villa in Dalkey, we could ask how this money had been obtained? That might be a deterrent to their activities in their native countries.  We have a responsibility in the West to make sure we do not harbour money belonging to those who have obtained it through appalling means from their own population.  If newspaper reports are to be believed, there are too many of these people around.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 9 which deals with the protection of insignia.  The protection provided for Civil Defence insignia is very good and appears to be better than that provided for the Red Cross.  I must confess an interest in this regard as I am a member of the Red Cross and was on its council and overseas committee for many years.  The section states the Minister may make regulations in this regard.  Such regulations are needed at once because the Red Cross insignia is among the most abused in the world.  I have seen it used in incredible situations, as the Minister of State probably also has.  Protection is <Col N="196" /> needed so that the insignia cannot be abused abroad or in domestic situations.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we are ratifying the first protocol. The section dealing with medical personnel is very dear to my heart.  It is incredible that attacks on medical personnel, whether they are from the country concerned or have come from abroad to help in a disaster, have not been considered war crimes until now.  When medical personnel go to work in foreign countries they are seeking help and justice for the afflicted civilian population and those who are <i>hors de combat</i> but they must also be protected.  The increased protection under this protocol is greatly welcome.</P>
    <P>I am also very glad that extra protection is being provided for journalists because we would not know what was happening in these areas if it were not reported by war correspondents, some of whom have been killed.  Their reporting, particularly in areas of internal conflict, has been of the greatest importance and I welcome the increased protection for them.</P>
    <P>We must always remember that medical personnel and journalists are the most vulnerable people in such situations.  When we read the graphic details of what has happened to journalists in countries such as Algeria, we must realise our main focus must be to protect personnel from the countries concerned.  Foreign journalists and medical personnel can be brought home but it is very difficult for those trying to honestly report conflict, such as that in Algeria, to obtain any protection.</P>
    <P>Article 90, which relates to the International Fact-Finding Commission, is very important and I was delighted to hear the Minister of State's support for it.  This has been needed for a long time and it is good to see it being brought forth. This commission can go to areas where we have relief agencies and can find out what is happening. It must also be considered a crime to attack such agencies.</P>
    <P>It is most important that internal strife is at last being covered because, regrettably, some of the most serious conflicts in recent years have been non international ones.  Almost all the current conflicts, with the exception of Eritrea, are non international.  A staggering amount of people are lost in non international conflicts.  There have been huge losses in the Balkans, Africa and the Far East in recent years.  We do not know how many people died or disappeared in Rwanda.  The Red Cross lost more personnel in Rwanda than it had in the entire history of the society.  We do not know whether many of them are dead or had to flee as refugees to other countries.</P>
    <P>I am also very glad the Minister of State stressed the prohibition in the protocol on using the civilian population as a method of waging war, either by moving sections of the population or by starving them by destroying food and agriculture, which is widely used in non international conflicts.</P>
    <P>The situation of children in armed conflict was also addressed.  Children are frequently recruited into armies, which is quite appalling.  It should be <Col N="197" /> considered a war crime to recruit children under the age of 15 years into an army.  Children cannot be regarded as responsible for their crimes, yet they are incorporated into armies, often after being kidnapped.  It is vital that this practice be banned.  The evacuation of children is also very important.</P>
    <P>The role of our peace keepers must be emphasised and they must be kept in a constant state of advanced training.  They must frequently deal with very difficult situations when they go abroad.</P>
    <P>If people found out how our Refugee Act is being applied not many of them would flee here. I was delighted that the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donnell, gave publicity to the refugee agency report yesterday which showed no Bosnians have been given citizenship since the Government came into office.  That is extremely bad, given that the Bosnians were invited here.  The situation here is very bad and refugees are advised not to go out at night for their own safety.  The changes in how the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is implementing the criteria for manifestly unfounded claims for asylum seeking means that hardly anyone will be left here &mdash; as far as I can see, torture victims could be expelled. I ask the Minister of State to ask the Department to look at this matter urgently.</P>
    <P>Tenders have been sent out for the provision of legal services.  However, these services will be assessed on a year by year basis, which does not make them seem very independent.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that all paramilitaries in Northern Ireland are observing a ceasefire, it should be pointed out to them that we have ratified these protocols so that they would know that the mutilation of civilians by kneecapping, beating with baseball bats or any other form of torture is totally against anything that might be countenanced on this island.  That might make them finally put an end to these appalling practices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend this important Bill to the House.  I cannot understand why it has taken so long to get here.  The Bill's provisions in regard to the conduct of warfare are very important. However, talking about it here is rather like talking about nuclear disarmament at a county council meeting.  It is very laudable but nothing will happen &mdash; as long as the main world powers do not obey these conventions no one else will do so.</P>
      <P>One need only think about the United State's actions in Chile, its attack on the civilian population in Iraq, and the use of civilians in Nicaragua as an exercise for a think tank in California. The Minister of State referred to starvation.  What about the blockade of Cuba?  He referred to the provision that farming areas should not be attacked.  What about the use of Agent Orange in Vietnam?  The US used LSD on its own soldiers and released radioactive material in some US states.  If it does that to its own civilians, what does it do to its enemies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> The United Kingdom breaks these rules and regulations all the time.  There was continual harassment of the population in the Six Counties and torture, including white noise, went on there for many years.  Britain was brought before the European Court of Human Rights more than any other nation and convicted on many occasions.</P>
    <P>Other examples include the sale by the French of Exocet missiles to Argentina at the time of the Malvinas War during which the British killed 320 young soldiers on an out of date ship steaming in the wrong direction outside the war zone.  The Israelis have grouped Palestinians into camps, taken their land and destroyed all their human rights.  They do not obey any of these rules.  Nor do the Palestinians when they plant car or suicide bombs in the middle of Jerusalem.  Senator Henry referred to the IRA and the harassment of the civilian population, including shooting and knee capping.</P>
    <P>I agree all this should be stopped and that these rules should be in place.  However, I do not believe they are obeyed.  I would like to think they were more than aspirational but I cannot believe they are.  The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission will find facts on people like Slobodan Milosevic, but I doubt if it would ever find fact on somebody like Churchill who condoned the bombing of Coventry and the killing of his people because he did not want a code to be found out.  Nor would it condemn the horrific bombing of Dresden in the last World War.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Bill and the conventions, which must be in place.  However, unless we get a consensus among the major western powers that they will abide by them they are hardly worth the paper on which they are written.  We repeatedly see gross violations of human rights by all the major western powers, and not only by Britain in this country, in which it has been engaged for hundreds of years and continues to be, despite all kinds of agreements.  The US, France and all of the peace loving nations are also involved.  For example, Sweden sells arms all over the world &mdash; Olaf Palme was apparently involved in that &mdash; as do the Dutch.  Portugal, a county I am fond of and whose people I love, was involved in Angola up to the 1950s and breached all human rights, including those on slavery.  I could go on.  The Minister knows the position as well as I do.</P>
    <P>It is hypocritical in one way to proceed with this legislation because it is useless to devise rules for people who will not obey them.  While international opinion condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait nothing was said later about the gross abuse by many of the allied forces there, including the rolling over and crushing of people in bunkers and the killing of children who had been put on the front line by Saddam Hussein.  While they did not do much to his national guard, they killed others, including those who did not even have shoes.  They were shot and mowed down in the face, yet there was not word about it.</P>
    <P>It is good that this legislation has been introduced and I laud those who try to make the world <Col N="199" /> a more peaceful place.  However, unless there is commitment from the larger powers, such as the US, the UK, France and Germany, to try and realise these aspirations and rules in a meaningful way it is little more than window dressing.  I hope this does not sound too pessimistic&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing for this debate and researching the material the thoughts which Senator Lydon enunciated came to my mind. When we look at Kosovo and the possibility of the Bosnian situation re-emerging in another fashion there and the danger of the re-emergence of ethnic strife in Rwanda and other places it is easy to curse the darkness.  However, we must try and light the light.</P>
      <P>The problem I and other Senators have is not with the proposals, conventions or legislation, but with the fact that the means of enforcement, including implementation bodies, are deliberately weak and ineffective and that it is very difficult at international fora to get the support of the so-called great powers to agree to any effectual measures because many of their actions would be the first to be scrutinised by such inquiries.</P>
      <P>I draw the attention of the House to Item 15, motion 1 on the Order Paper which states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann urges the Government in the current negotiations to create an International Criminal Court to support a fully independent court able to prosecute any individual for genocide, aggression, war crimes and other crimes against humanity, without any veto by national governments and to support the granting to individuals and citizen groups, as well as national governments and the Court's prosecutor, the right to bring cases before the Court.</P>
      <P>While I do not wish to debate this motion, I agree with its sentiments.  It should be an objective of the Government and the country to ensure that the efforts, however, painstaking, to establish an international criminal court would be proceeded with and that we would give them our wholehearted support and seek support at EU level.  As there is no point in threatening a child for bad behaviour if a sanction is not imposed, there is no point in threatening people who engage in behaviour which is contrary to these kinds of conventions if they know they will never be called to account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are our obligations on the international war crimes tribunals that are meeting in the Hague in respect of the former Yugoslavia and in Arusha, Tanzania, in respect of the Rwandan conflict?  I have been informed that Ireland has <Col N="200" /> yet to give effect in law to the UN Security Council resolutions establishing these tribunals.  I would be very disappointed to learn that such legislation, if it is necessary, has not been proceeded with.  We have supported the establishment of such tribunals at the UN and have said, as country which is especially concerned with human rights and development issues, that there must be no impunity regarding these actions and that people must be called to the bar of justice. However, there is an obligation on us to rectify without delay any tardiness in ratifying necessary legislation to support these tribunals.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State took Committee and Remaining Stages of the Bill through the Dáil, while the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Keeffe, took Second Stage.  At the time, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, was closely involved in the culmination of the Northern Ireland negotiations.  I had hoped, given that she is the first Minister of State to have special responsibility for human rights, to tease out some of the issues involved with her this evening, especially given this is the first Bill in the area of humanitarian law and human rights to come before the House.  In the meantime, I understand the Minister of State will do his best to answer my queries.</P>
    <P>Years ago there was a song in which the chorus finished &ldquo;but 21 years is a mighty long time&rdquo;.  It is in placing this legislation before us. Deputy Spring initiated it when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs but, despite now having a Minister of State with specific responsibility for human rights, no humanitarian legislation has been initiated by this Government in its first year of office.  That is unfortunate because having a Minister of State for this area gives an opportunity to raise the profile at Government level of issues which have not been addressed sufficiently in the past.  It is unfair for the Government to claim credit for giving the Minister responsibility for human rights if the legislation to tidy up our minimal international obligations is not being introduced.</P>
    <P>On RTÉ radio two weeks ago, Rodney Rice interviewed Minister of State O'Donnell.  She stated that the Progressive Democrats Party brought a different perspective in Government to human rights issues to that of Fianna Fáil.  She did not enunciate that difference and I know that many Members of the Fianna Fáil Party in both Houses have a strong interest in human rights issues.  She said the Progressive Democrats Party believed in a true republic and her party's view on human rights was informed by that whereas Fianna Fáil's view was informed by something else.  I am mystified to know what that means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Minister of State Cullen might be able to shed some light on that for us.  It is a <Col N="201" /> shame that a State with such an interest in human rights issues has been so slow in bringing before us even the small number of conventions which we have signed but not yet ratified or brought into our own law.  I appeal to the Minister to get the Government to make a special effort in this area.</P>
      <P>There is a motion on the Dáil Order Paper in the name of Deputy Spring which starts off in a similar fashion to a motion tabled by Minister of State O'Donnell, noting the fact that this is the UN Human Rights Year and the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Universal Declaration on Human Rights.  Deputy Spring's motion goes on to ask the Dáil to approve a number of further protocols and instruments: the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1965; the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment adopted by the General Assembly in 1984; and Protocol No. 7 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, done at Strasbourg in 1984.  Those are three important international instruments in relation to racial discrimination, torture and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. I appeal to the Minister to give us a commitment that the Government will move quickly to implement those instruments and others which have long been ratified but not yet brought into law.</P>
      <P>The Republic of Ireland is seeking election to the UN Security Council, our former President is the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and we play an active role in the UN Human Rights Commission; but our credibility does not stand up to international scrutiny if we do not introduce into our own law those instruments going back many years.  These will not impose a burden on this State but we should be seen to be fully committed to them before we preach to anyone else.</P>
      <P>In the radio interview which I mentioned, Deputy O'Donnell was concerned about the manner in which the Government is handling the issue of asylum seekers and applicants for refugee status.  I echo those concerns.  Last week I took part in a local radio debate on this issue with a representative of the Immigration Control Platform and other organisations.  It would be an understatement to say the debate was ill informed.  The Government has deliberately assisted in the fostering of misinformation and the lack of public understanding by not implementing the Refugee Act, by not seeking an early High Court hearing of the action taken by a former Minister challenging that Act and by putting in place arrangements which do not stand up to any examination of whether due process is being applied.  Is there another agenda within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department has never distinguished itself under any administration by the openness with <Col N="202" /> which it conducts its affairs, and with regard to asylum seekers, applicants for refugee status and immigrants in particular.  I would like to see that area handed over to a separate immigration and naturalisation service.  Many of the functions of the Department relating to courts and prisons are being transferred elsewhere.  I would like to see the immigration area established on a statutory footing with a proper avenue of appeal.  The public should be assured that the procedures to deal with applications for asylum, refugee status and other types of immigration are being implemented as quickly as possible.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has connived at the lack of information which is leading to the growth of prejudice alluded to by Senator Henry.</P>
    <P>We should not congratulate ourselves as it is a shame it has taken so long to introduce this legislation. The Government has been tardy and shown no initiative in introducing human rights legislation in its first year of office, in the area of asylum seekers and refugees in particular.  The Government has a duty to help applicants and citizens of the State by implementing the Refugee Act as it was passed and by establishing a separate immigration and naturalisation service to deal with this matter in an above board manner.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I approached the Department of Justice to seek an extension of the visa of a student from the developing world.  The student had gone to the Aliens Office in Harcourt Square &mdash; an office which should be renamed, these people are not from Mars &mdash; where he was not dealt with in a caring manner.  When I eventually reached an official in the Department, he told me that if I got a letter from a priest everything could be sorted out.  That is not openness and transparency, that is not acting in accordance with the principles of natural justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this initiative by the Government, although to a large extent I agree with Senator Gallagher's sentiments asking why it has taken so long.  I am not sure if the Minister has addressed the reasons for the delay in his contribution on Second Stage.  I applaud Senator Gallagher's long standing interest in human rights.  It is obvious from the tenor and content of his contribution that he has not lost his appetite in this area.</P>
      <P>In the context of suggestions that this Government has been tardy in introducing legislation on human rights, I feel that the ethos of this Government is to ensure that all legislation which comes before the Houses is influenced by a strong human rights philosophy.  Of the legislation which has been introduced in the Houses in the last six months, some 50 per cent has emanated from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, much of which is imbued with the human rights philosophy.  That is a cornerstone of both parties in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest in this Bill is as much of a historical nature as it is contemporary.  I was interested to note that the 1949 Geneva Convention, which is <Col N="203" /> the bedrock of this legislation and to which the two protocols are attached, came about primarily as a result of the outrageous and scandalous manner in which the combatants, particularly the Nazis, in the Second World War totally discarded the contents of the 1929 Geneva Convention as it referred to the treatment of prisoners.  Those of us who followed the war movies during our youth will remember the stiff upper lipped British officer who, when captured, always referred to the Geneva Convention in terms of his imprisonment. This was always met by complete resistance by the Nazis who did not seem to have any regard for human or prisoners rights.  Following the Second World War, various countries came together to form the bedrock of attitudes in war for combatant and neutral countries.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge the outstanding work of agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the Red Crescent and the Red Lion.  I was not aware that any other international organisation did similar work to the International Committee of the Red Cross until I was well into my teenage years.  Perhaps that was as a result of the cultural or Christian environment in which I grew up.  We sometimes think the International Committee of the Red Cross is the only organisation working in this field.</P>
    <P>While we rightly applaud the humanitarian efforts and work of these relief organisations, they have also come under the microscope for the position they have taken which has not always been in the best interests of the victims.  A recent documentary on BBC highlighted the contradictions within the International Committee of the Red Cross during the war in its attitude to the Jewish pogroms, particularly when it became apparent from 1942 onwards that there were concentration and extermination camps.  The International Committee of the Red Cross went into these camps and was aware of what was happening, yet it still found it impossible to issue public statements in case its impartiality and credibility with the international community, particularly with the Nazi regime, was compromised.</P>
    <P>As regards the most recent war in Europe following the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991 to 1993, the protocols and Acts governing the Geneva Convention did not live up to the aspirations of the participating countries which framed them.  One can only reflect on why more action was not taken against Slobodan Milosevic and his Serbian Government when it became known that they were re-enacting that which took place in the concentration camps of the Second World War.  We all saw the images of people on our television screens and it was like a rerun of Auschwitz and Bergen Belsen.</P>
    <P>Although the obligations of commanders in a war situation are outlined in legislation, one cannot help but reflect on the butcher of the Serbian army who stood up to the Dutch UN forces in one of the more outrageous atrocities which took place during the Serbian Bosnian conflict.  He <Col N="204" /> stated in front of television cameras that the segregation of male prisoners from their wives and families was only an operational matter and that they would not come to any harm.  He threatened violence on the UN force which had to stand by helplessly as male prisoners were led away to almost immediate death, as we later found out.</P>
    <P>While international communities correctly put down benchmarks for humanitarian concerns and civilised behaviour in the atrocity of war, governments should not hide behind bland public pronouncements or allow the interests of certain countries to supersede the humanitarian concerns they have subscribed to in articles such as the Geneva Convention.  That is why I am cynical at times.  This legislation is filled with the best intentions, yet we and the dogs in the street know that when reality sets in, as happened in the Serbian Bosnian conflict, humanitarian interests go out the window.  The international community, particularly the European community, stood idly by and allowed men, women and children to be led to their deaths.  The greatest scandal was to witness the Jewish residents of Bosnia Herzegovina who had been forcibly removed from their homes during the Second World War and who had survived and returned to pick up the shattered remnants of their lives being bussed away from their homes 40 years later by an odious regime.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects and dimensions to the issue of how we treat non-combatants and civilians in a war situation.  Although obligations are imposed on the combatants and their commanding officers and the treatment which should be given to civilians is outlined, we will not be able to change human nature, particularly in view of the old saying: power corrupts and all power corrupts absolutely.  I wish we could change such human weakness.</P>
    <P>It is because legislation such as this is enacted in civilised societies that there is hope for the future and that we can hand it on to our children as a legacy of this generation's concern.  While we have learned to some degree from the mistakes of the past and while we cannot eliminate war in its entirety, we can do our best to minimise the shock, trauma and horror of war by introducing humanitarian methods such as those encompassed in the protocols and the Geneva Convention. I commend this legislation to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for introducing this legislation.  I have called for it many times during my 11 years in this House.  I will not get involved in Senator Gallagher's party political jousts because these delays are not the fault of any particular Government.  We have a poor record when it comes to legislating for UN international agreements.  This is a cultural issue within Departments rather than Governments, but it does not look well for us.  We should show more commitment to the work of the UN while seeking to be represented at its highest levels. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, signed the convention on children's rights in 1990, but some aspects of it have still not been <Col N="205" /> implemented.  We have also been slow to deal with many other aspects of international agreements.</P>
      <P>I support this legislation which required a tremendous amount of work.  I know it is a matter of putting together articles, etc.  I compliment the draftspersons on a difficult job well done.  We are very reliant on them.  It is a complete vote of trust and confidence in the draftspersons.  We hope they have bridged all the gaps, made all the links and got every part right.</P>
      <P>The Bill is here at last.  The reason it is so important to enact such legislation early rather than late is Ireland's proclaimed neutral status.  I have said many times that it is impossible to get us to understand the meaning of neutrality.  I do not quite know what it means.  It means certain things to me but it is an evolving philosophy for me and most thinking people.</P>
      <P>I did not disagree with much of what the previous speaker said but he said it was appalling that the world stood idly by while what happened in Auschwitz and other places took place and we also must remember &mdash; I only say it because there are no members of the other parties here to capitalise on something which I recognise happened 50 years ago &mdash; that the Taoiseach of the day went down to the German Embassy and signed the book of condolences on the death of Hitler. That is why Ireland's neutrality is always questionable. It is hugely important that we enact these Bills which show us to be neutral, active and prepared to move on and support these matters.</P>
      <P>I was in Dingle on Sunday afternoon and I met some visitors who asked me to recommend walks. I recommended a particular walk, up the hill behind the hospital.  They asked me about a field they could see in the distance and I told them it was the paupers' graveyard, where people who died in the workhouses from the time of the Famine were buried in unnamed graves.  As I was talking to them, I suddenly remembered there was another grave in the middle of the graveyard for German airmen who died when their aeroplanes hit the Kerry mountains during the war.  They were buried there because we were not prepared to give them the kind of burial which is sought in this Bill and is welcome.  I do not wish to be critical of the people at the time because they did what they thought was right, but it is good that we are now more compassionate.  For instance, the word &ldquo;humane&rdquo; is evident throughout the Minister's speech and the Bill.  That is important.</P>
      <P>However, it is also important that we recognise what we mean by neutrality.  The Bill states that nothing in the Bill can be used to promote violence or war except within the UN Conventions, but I do not know if we are allowed to do that because I am not sure how the Constitution affects such declarations of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to involuntary transplants from prisoners of war which are extraordinarily redolent of the experiments which were carried out on prisoners in Nazi concentration camps.  There was significant evidence in recent times of prisoners in corrupt states being put under anaesthetic and not realising they had a kidney removed and sold in the developed world. <Col N="206" /> That practice has been stopped, and not before time.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to relate this Bill to the policy of neutrality.  I ask him to address his comments to the contributions of some of the Senators who spoke about how Europe stood idly by; to put it softly, Europe stood idly by because countries like Ireland are neutral, which means we stand aside with the I'm all right Jack attitude and allow other groups to kill each other.  We also stood idly by because there is no common European foreign policy.  Therefore, the Germans took one line in a conflict and the French took another.  Consequently, there was never a European line.</P>
    <P>I say that as somebody who speaks in favour of neutrality and Ireland's tradition of neutrality. However, I never believed that neutrality was a passive role; I always believed it to be active.  I ask the Minister to move the debate forward from our extraordinarily influential role as peacekeepers to perhaps peacemakers.  I understand the implications of that and I am not saying I know the answers.  It could well be that the day a Minister puts forward that viewpoint I will be the first to contradict him and argue, but all that will prove is that for Ireland to play a full international role will involve a painful debate.</P>
    <P>I am not certain about what is neutrality and I have thought long and hard about it, but it is not about being passive.  It is not &mdash; I do not think anybody believes it is &mdash; about sitting around while Pol Pot or Hitler killed millions and it is not about Ireland becoming a member of NATO either, but there are intermediate positions.  The position to which I refer is rooted in the United Nations.  In a world which approached the benign ambience which is outlined in the introduction to the Geneva Convention, we will need a world police force or army under the UN.  It may well be that countries which want to be neutral or non-aligned will eventually get rid of their armies and put the same investment into a UN army, which would have a proper structure within the UN.  It would not be run by the current UN Security Council, of which the Secretary General of the UN is not a member, which is really run by a number of large nations.  Ireland's future neutrality could lie in the context of the UN.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome what the Minister said about the protection of children.  This has been brought to my attention, not only by <i>The Irish Times</i> to which the Minister referred, but also by teachers from Kosovo to whom I have spoken. The INTO has sent people out there and so have some of the European committees, of which I am a member.  I also met some teachers from Kosovo.  It has been disheartening and discouraging. We have seen in the occupied territories of Middle East and in Jerusalem, for instance, that they close universities and schools and use students as shields of war.  People have been raped and sexually abused.  Napalm, Agent Orange, dumdum bullets, mustard gas and biological weapons have been used; there is the proliferation of nuclear arms.  The issues go on and on.  Senator Lanigan referred to landmines on the Order of Business and we have spoken about that <Col N="207" /> issue here from time and again.  Landmines are legacies of man's inhumanity to man.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill and hope it is passed without amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senators who contributed to the Bill.  I will do my best to deal with the points raised.  Most Senators asked why has it taken us so long to introduce this Bill.  I accept that various Government waited a lengthy period between the adoption of the two protocols, their subsequent signature on behalf of the State and the introduction of this legislation.</P>
      <P>This Bill is important and very technical.  I do not suggest that we needed 21 years to get it right but the fact that we are only now introducing this legislation should not be seen as indicating that the Irish people do not support it in spirit.  We are very supportive of the conventions and protocols. We are now giving substance to that support and in some instances this legislation goes beyond the requirements of the protocols.  I am sure the Seanad welcomes that approach.</P>
      <P>Senator Avril Doyle, Senator O'Toole and others referred to the peacemaking and peacekeeping roles and our policy of neutrality.  I do not wish to encroach on the responsibilities of the Minsters for Foreign Affairs and Defence but I can say that the Irish people must face the challenge of the debate on the issue of neutrality in the context of our involvement in Europe and a changing world.  The difference between peacekeeping and peacemaking has implications for our policy on neutrality and we must come to terms with this issue.  I am sure it will be debated in the near future.</P>
      <P>Some Senators referred to powers of enforcement. The Bill attempts to establish the basic rules of international humanitarian law.  The Haig tribunal is at present dealing with alleged violations of that law.  Senators spoke in a questioning and even cynical tone but to do nothing is to despair.  We must move forward in the area of international humanitarian law.</P>
      <P>Atomic warfare was mentioned by Senators Lanigan and Doyle.  The International Court of Justice at the Hague has stated that the conventions and protocols do not apply to atomic warfare.</P>

      <P>The conventions and protocols are structured so that they do not apply to atomic warfare.  We may return to this issue and I will get more information on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To Senator Lanigan's question, a land mine is not a projectile.  The International Humanitarian Fact-Finding Commission can only operate where the parties consent and its reports are confidential. Senator Henry spoke about journalists.  I will <Col N="208" /> be tabling an amendment to provide further protection for journalists.</P>
    <P>The sign of the Red Cross is protected under the Red Cross Acts and under the Geneva Conventions. All Senators referred to the fundamental issue of children's rights.  It is forbidden, under article 7, paragraph 2 of Protocol I, to recruit children under 15 years of age.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised the question of war tribunals and whether legislation is necessary. The enactment of such legislation would be a matter for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and I will convey the Senator's remarks to him.  I do not agree with Senator Gallagher that the Government is not making progress in this area.  As much progress is being made by this Government as by the previous one and we now have a substantial body of legislation.  The Senator's party is not long out of office.  The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, is very committed to progressing in this area despite her heavy responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole has left the Chamber but he would not wish to see an inaccuracy placed on the record of the House.  Mr. de Valera did not go to the German embassy in 1945 but to the residence of the ambassador.</P>
    <P>The practice of removing organs from prisoners of war without their permission or knowledge has become a feature of warfare in the very recent past.  I do not know if this practice is covered by the Geneva Conventions.  I shall get clarification on that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome Senators' comments on children. Their treatment by states is often unacceptable and sometimes outrageous.  The question has been raised of Ireland's body of legislation in the area of international humanitarian law.  When I concluded my speech on this matter in the Dáil I read a long and detailed list of conventions, protocols and so on dealing with this area which are part of Irish law.  I would like to place that list on the record of the House.  Can you advise me, a Chathaoirligh, on how that can be done?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister can provide the list to the Seanad Office it can be circulated to Members and it would then be included in the record of the House.  We can take a decision now that the list will be included in the record of the House.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to do that and I am sure Members will find it beneficial.  Senator O'Toole would be incorrect in his assessment that we are slow to ratify international conventions on humanitarian law.  There are outstanding matters which remain to be dealt with but we have ratified a substantial body of law and great credit is due to officials in many Departments for that.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators who spoke on this important Bill.  The contributions were well presented and important and I look forward to teasing out some specific points on Committee Stage.  I thank the officials for their assistance.</P>
