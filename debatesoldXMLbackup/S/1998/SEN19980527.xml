      <P>I have notice from Senator Finneran that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to provide the necessary lottery funds to the convent secondary school, Roscommon town, for the refurbishment of their multi-purpose hall which is community based.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Burke of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to provide funding for the construction and development of Turlough Park House, Castlebar, County Mayo.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement on the implications of the exclusion of VTOS courses from the newly launched back to education scheme.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation to ensure that the funding for recreational sport, special projects and ordinary grants are paid to vocational education committees on time.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Glynn of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to provide funding for the provision of a pedestrian underpass at Moran's Bridge over the Royal Canal, Mullingar, County Westmeath.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to carry out, as a matter of <Col N="866" /> urgency, a further study and analysis on the effects on inland waterways, and specifically on the eco-system of Lough Derg, of the growth of the zebra mussel population.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator McGowan of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to raise with Telecom Éireann the matter of having calls charged at the same rate nationally.</P>
    <P>I have selected Senators Finneran's and Burke's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senators Doyle, Costello, Glynn and O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.  I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matter raised by Senator McGowan on the grounds of lack of ministerial responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome back Senator Quill after her illness.  It is nice to see her in the House. Today's Order of Business is item 1 and item 10, motion 19.  Second Stage of item 1 is to be taken today, with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes, those of all other Senators, 12 minutes, and Senators may share time.  If not previously concluded, the proceedings will resume at 8 p.m. Item 10, motion 19, is to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. Spokespersons have 12 minutes and other Senators eight minutes.  Senator Manning has agreed that this item will resume in Private Members' time next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Leader in welcoming back Senator Quill.  We are pleased to see her looking so fit and well.  On an aesthetic note, I draw the attention of the House to the new windows, not that Members could have failed to notice them.  They seriously detract from the beauty of the finest room in Leinster House.  This is a public institution but that does not mean it has to look like one.  I ask that the matter be re-examined.</P>
      <P>Everyone welcomes the enthusiastic and enormous acceptance of the Belfast Agreement and the Leader might think it worthwhile to have a debate on Northern Ireland in the near future &mdash; or perhaps he thinks we could best help the Northern process by keeping our mouths shut for the moment.  I leave that to his wisdom.  On the Amsterdam Treaty, there is clearly a problem about the way the Houses of the Oireachtas conduct European business.  I do not say this affected the outcome one way or another but we should look at it in the near future to see whether we could better serve the public by analysing and spending more time debating European legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning.  I am appalled at what was done to those windows. It is as if the place was turned into a toilet.  It reminds me of the 1940s and 1950s&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator will recall this matter was raised recently on the Order of Business and there was a request that this be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges is meeting in the afternoon and the matter will be considered.  It is obvious this experiment was carried out in order to give the Members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges an idea of what a permanent arrangement would look like.  I assure the Senator the matter will be considered by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and he should not consider this arrangement permanent by any stretch of the imagination.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As they say in the best quiz shows &ldquo;well anticipated&rdquo;.  This is an item on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges agenda this afternoon and, while I always welcome people moving quickly, this was done without agreement from any group or person.  I would have preferred if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided it wished to experiment.  It is as if we are in the valley of the squinting windows where we are afraid people might look in. Until now, I had the choice of looking into Deputy Gregory's office to see what he was doing or looking out at the broad blue sky.  It is hugely important that Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas should be not disconnected from the real world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer in an oblique way to the Shannon River Council Bill because the influence of zebra mussels on the water and environment of the Shannon would be the first item on the agenda of a Shannon River Council. It is a classic example of something which cannot be dealt with by just ham fisted experiments which have been carried out in a number of counties. This river is being destroyed by zebra mussels&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but I wish to raise with the Leader the need for a Shannon River <Col N="868" /> Council.  The Bill should be reintroduced and the letter he sent to us as a sop in áit na scuaibe an tseachtain seo caite; níl go leor ansan and we need to go much further because this matter will not go away.  There is a great need for a Shannon River council.  The Leader has not adequately explained the situation and we want to know why the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Parties, which were so supportive of this during the term of the previous Government are not supportive now.</P>
      <P>I welcome my education colleague, Senator Quill, back to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome Senator Quill back and I am glad to see her in the best of health again.  My immediate response to the interesting experiment with the windows is we must see through a glass darkly.  It does not augur well for the deliberations of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are usually kept in the dark anyway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We are kept in the dark and are not going for the utmost in transparency.  I echo Senator Manning's remarks on the recent referenda. I particularly welcomed the referendum on Northern Ireland.  It was an astounding and tremendous result for the peace campaign on the entire island reflected by the number who voted in Northern Ireland and the 95 per cent &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the Republic.  We should wish the next obstacle &mdash; the Assembly elections &mdash; well.  I hope any difficulties which arise will be overcome and that we can proceed into the fullness of dialogue towards a resolution of the conflict.</P>
      <P>Night after night I watched equal weight being given to the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no&rdquo; campaigns in regard to peace in Northern Ireland and 95 per cent of the people voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; thankfully.  However, that raises questions about how we present matters in a referendum.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss the matter now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of debating the outcome, but in the context of discussing the referenda on the Amsterdam Treaty and the Northern Ireland Agreement, we should also examine how information is disseminated in terms of the use of taxpayers' money and the representation of parliamentary parties in the dissemination of that information.</P>
      <P>We welcome the Order of Business.  We are glad the debate in Private Members' time on item 10, motion 19, will be resumed next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essential the House records its approval of the vote on the Northern Ireland Agreement.  Given that it was of such historic importance, it would be wrong if the Official <Col N="869" /> Report made no reference to it.  I am pleased the leaders of the other groups have referred to it. We all took immense satisfaction from it and hope it will lead to an enduring peace.  There are other hurdles to be surmounted, not least the Assembly elections and the formation of an Executive.  In that context, we must reiterate the need for a rejection of violence by all concerned which is one of the conditions for people to join the Executive.  We hope the arms will be taken out of commission in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>In reference to what Senator Costello said, it is a constitutional imperative on the basis of the Supreme Court judgment that the arguments for and against a proposal be made in equal proportions. However, where 94 per cent of the people have voiced their approval, there are grounds for examining that and it would be up to the people to decide whether they wanted to change it.  I welcome back to the House my party colleague, Senator Quill.</P>
      <P>In respect of zebra mussels to which Senator O'Toole referred, this a serious problem which is not just confined to the Shannon.  It is a national problem which should be dealt with in a national context because it is a threat to all the game fisheries in Ireland and not just to those on the River Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Senator Quill back to the House.  She attended a council meeting in City Hall last week.  She has been through a tough time in the past ten weeks but she is looking well now and I congratulate her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the variation in the price of drink between the country and Dublin, the Competition <Col N="870" /> Authority has brought both associations representing publicans to the courts.  Is it possible for some Minister to explain why these problems are always brought to the courts and why the authority cannot meet these associations to discuss problems?  It is only when matters cannot be resolved that they should be brought to the courts.  I cannot understand why such matters always end up in the Four Courts.  Will some Minister explain it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other Senators in welcoming the enormous vote in favour of the Northern Ireland Agreement.  It is also good that almost 40 per cent of the people voted against the Amsterdam Treaty.  That might teach a few people the odd lesson about democracy.  We in this House are mistaken if we castigate ourselves because we had an exceedingly good debate on the Amsterdam Treaty.  It was inadequately covered but we are not responsible for that.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to make a statement about reports in today's papers, particularly <i>The Examiner,</i> concerning proposed legislation imposing jail sentences and fines of £1,000 on leaving certificate pupils found to be cheating?  I do not wish to encourage cheating but this sort of idiotic, draconian measure will only add to the appalling pressures already imposed on young people.  They may get the matter completely out of proportion and, under the stress of examinations, think that looking sideways across a desk might land them in jail.  We ought to take this seriously in the light of the number of suicides by young people because of exam pressure.  The Minister for Education and Science ought to be asked to make a statement on this matter and to reassure young people at this time of year.</P>
      <P>Ryanair, having attempted to fire many of their own employees, are trying in some of the European courts today to force the national airline to fire theirs as well, attempting thereby to sink a great national carrier.  Would the Leader agree that no decent patriotic Irish person should travel by Ryanair again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of recent attacks on the elderly and particularly the deaths of a shopkeeper in Mayo and a farmer in Roscommon could the Leader invite the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House to debate this unacceptable criminal activity?  I have no doubt that Members have views on this matter which may be of some assistance to the Minister and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust, a Chathaoirligh, that your judgment and good taste will be sufficient to resolve the window issue with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon.  You will have the support of all sides of the House and I know you realise how strongly we feel about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted with the results of both referendums. This House could do a great service by <Col N="871" /> having a debriefing session with the chairman of the Referendum Commission to see what lessons can be learned by democratically elected public representatives in selling messages to the electorate. Following the Coughlan and McKenna judgments it is important to analyse the system and see if we need to revisit legislation or even the Constitution.  Will the Leader arrange such a session?</P>
    <P>It is time we had another discussion on Sellafield and BNFL.  Every couple of weeks brings another headline about emissions from Sellafield. A balanced discussion in this House would be extremely important.  It would ensure that Members on all sides have up to date knowledge of the Government's involvement both with BNFL and with their counterparts across the water.  Given the particularly good relations between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister the British Government might be prepared to sit down and seriously listen to the concerns of this nation, particularly those living on the east coast, in relation to Sellafield and all BNFL activities on the west coast of Great Britain.  I request such a discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader impress on the Ministers for Education and Science and Social, Community and Family Affairs the matter which Senator Avril Doyle proposes to raise on the Adjournment?  I hope her motion will be taken this week.  I refer to the decision to exclude VTOS students from the newly launched back to education allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator, you have made your point in support of Senator Doyle's matter for the Adjournment and you should not anticipate the points which Senator Doyle may make in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Senator Doyle.  our party and I are in complete agreement on this issue.  I have been asked to raise this matter by my association, The Adult Education Organisers Association of Ireland.  Unless a level playing field is created urgently the VTOS progammes as we know them will die.  They are the only programmes geared specifically to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed.  I raise the matter now because it is urgent.  On 1 June the various adult education organisers &mdash; of which I am one &mdash; will start recruitment for the new programmes and unless the Ministers in question decide to rescind their decision this week there will be no students on the programmes in September, which would be a great pity.  I await the Leader's response and I hope Senator Avril Doyle's motion will be taken this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Cathaoirleach's ruling on the matter I wished to raise on the Adjournment.  Will the Leader provide time to debate the matter?  At this time there are many <Col N="872" /> interests seeking a stake in the Irish telecommunications market, particularly for mobile telephony. If we miss the opportunity it will be unfair to rural communities.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to do so. I work hard to represent a disadvantaged area and I hope the Cathaoirleach understands that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader agree, particularly in light of the referendum votes last Friday, that it is ludicrous that British citizens in Ireland are not allowed to vote in referenda or presidential elections?  Will he ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to consider putting forward legislation to correct this matter? There are about 5,000 British citizens in the country, many of whom have been here for many years, and they were disenfranchised last Friday.</P>
      <P>I am delighted to find there is such widespread concern about the growth of the zebra mussel and I sure it will be reflected by the Cathaoirleach allowing me to raise the issue on the Adjournment tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming Senator Quill on her return.  She has had a tough time but the old adage &ldquo;when the going gets tough the tough get going&rdquo; applies to her.  With regard to the requests for a debate on Northern Ireland, while I would contribute to such a debate this is not the right time for it.  We should let matters settle down. Will the Leader arrange a debate on litter?  The best efforts of the present and past Ministers and of local authorities do not seem to have had an impact.  We should debate this issue because litter is a blight on the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, the need to implement the commitment in the Fianna Fáil manifesto to fund the STAD case against BNFL?  He states in today's <i>Evening Herald</i> that it is the Government's intention to have Sellafield closed but after almost a year in office there is no evidence of the Government proceeding to support the STAD case.  Alternatively, the Government could take a case against BNFL.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the result of the two referenda.  Despite the high percentages who voted in favour, it would be worth considering why only 50 per cent of the eligible population decided to vote.  There is compulsory voting in other countries; we should examine that option. <Col N="873" /> People do not appreciate the right to vote and treat it in a cavalier fashion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great discrimination and disparity regarding the 4,700 square miles of Kerry and Cork.  That is the area of the Southern Health Board which is seriously underfunded and which has fallen behind other health boards.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children if he will redress the imbalance and ensure parity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the remarks of Senators Manning, Dardis and Costello on the results of the referenda last Friday, particularly that on Northern Ireland.  However, this is still a very sensitive area, and commentators should be very careful.  I listened to a radio interview conducted yesterday by Pat Kenny with Seán O'Callaghan and it was very disappointing.  It was irresponsible, provocative and could lead to incitement. Broadcasting the interview should be condemned.</P>

      <P>I welcome the suggested debate on the popular perception of Europe as I come from the constituency which had the highest &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in the Amsterdam Treaty referendum. There is a gap between the people and Europe, and we should address it.  I am astonished that one part of the House wants to abolish the McKenna judgment, which means there would be no debate, while another part wants to make voting compulsory.  Compulsory voting with no debate sounds like the old days of Eastern Europe.</P>

    <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Dardis, Norris, Avril Doyle, O'Meara, Jackman, Rory Kiely and O'Toole all welcomed the result of last Friday's referendum.  I wish to be associated with those remarks.  Last Friday was a historic day and, I hope, the start of a new beginning.  It was beyond our wildest dreams.  I have been involved in politics for 30 years and I welcome the decision wholeheartedly.  I congratulate all who made it <Col N="874" /> possible.  The eyes of the world were upon us and the media came from the G8 Summit last Wednesday.  It was wonderful to receive the bouquets and praise for Ireland as a place for business and tourism.  I hope this is the start of a new beginning for generations to come.</P>
    <P>I will discuss the possibility of giving a new focus to European matters with party leaders.  We will see if the Seanad can help to relay European information to our constituents and to other interested parties.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Meara mentioned her concern about the 5,000 British passport holders who could not vote last week.  I will look at that problem to see how we can enhance the discussion.  In the referenda, the South voted within 5 per cent of the turnout for the general election last summer.  The people are to be congratulated for this.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised his concern about the Competition Authority.  I will discuss this with the Senator after the Order of Business to see how I can help.  I will relay Senator Norris's call for the Minister for Education and Science to clarify the report in <i>The Examiner</i> today.  I will also convey the Senator's views on Ryanair to the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>I will facilitate Senator Finneran's request for a debate on attacks on the elderly.  Senator Avril Doyle called for the chairman of the Referendum Commission to come to the House for a questions and answers session.  I will discuss this with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and you, a Chathaoirligh, later today.  Senator Doyle and Senator McDonagh called for a debate on Sellafield which I will arrange at the earliest possible opportunity.  Senator McDonagh was also concerned about the VTOS programme.  I will convey his views to the Minister and find out what is the position.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan called for a further debate on the safety implications of telephone masts and mobile phones.  Such a debate was held in the House within the last month and the issue was given a good airing.  I will get back to the Senator to see how we can progress on this.  Senator Glynn and Senator Burke called for a debate on litter; I will allow time at the earliest opportunity. Senator O'Dowd raised his concern about BNFL and the funding of the STAD campaign.  I will convey his views to the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan called for a debate on health funding; I am sure all Members agree with him.  I will make time available for this later in the session. Senator Burke called for a debate on tourism; we already had one with the Minister present.  If the House wants a further debate we can facilitate that in the early autumn.</P>
    <P>The following Bills will be initiated in the Seanad in the present session &mdash; the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, the Investor Compensation Bill, the Industrial Development (Amendment) Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill and the Parental Leave Bill &mdash; and will hopefully be passed before the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey) Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time within a short period we have spoken on local government matters.  I hope it is a sign of the importance the House attaches to local government and its development.  As most people will know, it is a high priority of mine as Minister for the Environment and Local Government.</P>
      <P>This Government is less than a year in office and has already made significant progress in delivering on the commitments made in An Action Programme for the Millennium.  The economy continues to grow at an unprecedented rate and unemployment is still falling.  We have achieved our objective in relation to economic and monetary union and have been accepted for membership of the euro currency.  We have started to deliver on the promised tax cuts.  There is no one area of policy that has been left untouched.  On all fronts, this Government is delivering on its promises.  We are in the unique position, unthinkable in previous years, of contending with the problems of managing this phenomenal growth and success rather than struggling to achieve economic expansion, which was the major problem in the past.  In a sense, the problems of success are new territory for each of us.</P>
      <P>One specific area where investment has lagged behind, particularly over the past two decades, is local government.  We have had massive capital investment projects, managed very successfully by local authorities, to build new roads, houses and that most essential service &mdash; delivering clean water.  In the midst of all this investment, local authorities have not been able to maintain their ongoing services to a satisfactory level, a matter agreed by all Members of the House.  Even more constrained has been their ability to get involved in developing their local communities and improving the quality of their customer care. Lack of resources has been a stranglehold around the neck of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill will enable me to deliver on the promises I made in relation to local government funding. Local government and the services it provides are an essential feature of our lives. <Col N="876" /> However, local government should mean much more, and I am determined to see this happen.</P>
    <P>The culmination of my abiding interest in sorting out the non-capital funding of local government is in the Bill under discussion today.  When I announced my plans last January, I called it &ldquo;A New Deal for Local Government&rdquo;.  This is indeed a good and a new deal and I would like to briefly go through the major points.</P>
    <P>The main feature of this Bill is the establishment of a local government fund.  This fund will be set up from 1 January 1999 and will have nearly £600 million to be allocated to local authorities in its first year.  The fund will comprise the proceeds of motor tax which will be used primarily to fund the non-national roads programme and an Exchequer contribution to fund the day to day expenditure of local authorities.  In 1999, the Exchequer contribution will be £270 million which, when taken with an estimated £323 million in motor tax revenue, will see a fund of some £593 million being made available to local authorities. That is £128 million more than the corresponding funding available to them in 1997.  In the event that I might be accused of misleading the Lower House where I referred to a figure of £125 million being available in this regard, the additional £3 million arose because of recently revised estimates of motor tax levels for 1998.  These now amount to £323 million which illustrates one of my prime motivations for using motor taxation for this purpose, namely, the provision of a buoyant source of funding to local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the ring-fencing of the local government fund for the sole use of local authorities.  The fund will be buoyant not only due to the growth in the number of vehicles but also because I am providing for the Exchequer contribution to the fund to be index linked.  In addition to increasing with inflation, the fund will also be modified to take account of changes to the functions of local authorities or changes in their cost base.  This has been an anomaly for many years because local authorities have been expected to take on additional functions and responsibilities without any additional funding. How can we expect local authorities to implement change in areas such as environmental protection or litter control without additional money?  Under the provisions of this Bill that will end.  By way of practical illustration of this principle, the £270 million set aside from 1 January 1999 will increase by £300,000 because of the additional duties and functions which will be imposed on local authorities on foot of our recent announcement in respect of the protection of architectural heritage.</P>
    <P>The money we spend in any sector of the public service must be spent wisely.  After all, this money is not the property of local authorities or the Government because it is gathered by way of taxes from the public.  Wherever the priorities of the day lie, we must maximise the return on the investment made.  I have stated on previous occasions that there was total support from all <Col N="877" /> sides of this House on the need for better value for money in all local government activities.  I accept that we must be committed to quality but we must also ensure that the price we pay is reasonable and fair.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion about my commitment to value for money.  This point was raised in previous debates and it was stated that I had abandoned it.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have addressed local authorities in every corner of the country in the past year and this is one of the major issues I have highlighted on many occasions.  Local authorities are fully aware of my commitment to this principle.  I will now deal with a number of the other features of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Motor tax income will continue to be set aside for local government.  However, in contrast with the present system of funding, it is wrong in principle to ask any sector of the public to finance the provision of general local government services for the entire community.  I am, of course, referring to the Irish motorist.  The Bill will now right that wrong and the proceeds of motor tax will be used primarily for the funding of the non-national road network.  Motorists will see for themselves where the motor tax is being spent.  I believe it is most important, in the interest of accountability and transparency, that motor tax income collected should be ploughed back into the road network thus establishing a clear link between the services received and the payment made by the customer.</P>
    <P>Last week in the Dáil I acknowledged the previous Government's recognition of the importance of those roads and its commitment to restoring them through the roads restoration programme.  The Government is totally committed to the success of the non-national roads programme and has already increased the investment from the Exchequer this year, working to ensure that the target date of 2005 will be achieved and that all non-national roads will be up to a suitable standard by that date.</P>
    <P>Part of the package of measures to address local government funding contained in the Bill is the increase in motor tax rates.  The rate increases of 3 per cent this year and a further 3 per cent from 1 January 1999 are minimal when it is considered that these are the first increases since 1992.  For a car under 1,000 cc, the increase will be £3 this year on the annual rate or £6 when the rate increases for next year also come into effect. These changes are hardly significant when one considers the full cost of motoring.</P>
    <P>However, as I said before, this is more than a series of rate changes to fund non-national roads. It is also a reform measure and a major shift in motor tax policy.  Not all the rate changes proposed are increases, and the Bill recognises the importance of adequate public transport facilities to society by cutting the motor tax rates for buses drastically.  The greening of taxation is happening in many countries in Europe and will continue to evolve in Ireland.  This reduction in public service vehicle motor tax rates is a move in that direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="878" /> Another myth that has appeared recently, and one that was articulated by Senators the last time this issue was discussed, is that if I abolish the local government equalisation fund I am forgetting about equalisation.  That is without foundation. The principle of equalisation will be a core feature of the local government fund.  It is most important that any additional funds that become available are distributed equitably.  However, to do that we must know the needs of local authorities, the resources they have to cater for them and consequently the resources they would need from other sources.</P>
    <P>Most Senators are aware of the dissatisfaction in local authorities about the way in which the old rate support grant system worked.  It was not fine tuned to respond to a changing society.  The services being provided may have changed but the funding did not.  The additional funding is substantial and for that reason equalisation has become much more important.</P>
    <P>That is why I am funding a pilot study by Galway County Council on its needs and resources, and those of the other local authorities in Galway, with a view to developing a model that can be applied to any local authority.  The study got under way in March and I hope to see the results emerging later this year.  We must achieve a model where various criteria are identified which contribute to higher or lower costs and where the capacity of a local authority to raise funds locally is factored into the equation.  The intention is to find a level of funding appropriate for each local authority and then to allow that local authority the maximum independence possible in delivering its services, whether they are discretionary or statutory services.</P>
    <P>There is a number of other aspects to the Bill which are not related to funding.  The first provides for the postponement of local elections from June of this year to June 1999.  I wish to reiterate my statement in the other House that the decision to postpone them was not taken lightly by the Government.  Local elections are the principal means by which the political will of the local community is expressed.  It is now almost four years since the people spoke at town elections and almost seven in the case of city and county authorities.  Ordinarily, therefore, the case for local elections in June of this year would be very strong.  However, these are not ordinary times for local government; there are substantial and unique arguments why the elections should be postponed for another 12 months.</P>
    <P>The first of these is that a major programme of local government renewal spanning a number of years is now underway.  I know this has been used in the past to postpone local elections without being followed through.  However, I am absolutely committed to delivering a new local government system and it is important that the general outline of that new system should be known before the electorate casts its vote next year and selects who is best suited to represent it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="879" /> Few would deny that local government needs to be made more attractive to a wider range of people, particularly women and the young.  The prospect of a vibrant and reinvigorated local government system should help to provide broader participation.</P>
    <P>A review of the electoral areas, taking account of the 1996 census results, is needed due to population changes since the last review 13 years ago in 1985.  I have established committees to review local electoral areas and to report by 1 July next. It is important that whatever revisions are needed should be known by the electorate and potential candidates before the election takes place.</P>
    <P>The recent establishment of the strategic policy committees system, which will strengthen and widen local democracy, is now well underway, representing the most radical development in local government for decades.  It is important that that system is given the chance to settle in before elections are held.</P>
    <P>The reasons for this short postponement are, therefore, very strong.  It will allow the building blocks of the local government renewal programme to be put in place or, at least, be known before the electorate decides who should represent it at this crucial time of change.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of the Bill, which is unrelated to funding, concerns local authority recruitment procedures.  There is currently a statutory requirement that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The inflexible nature of this requirement has prevented a solution being found for the plight of professionals in general, and engineers in particular, who are being retained in temporary employment on a long term basis by local authorities.  Such is the length of service of many of these people at this stage that they should in equity be made permanent. That has not been possible up to now, but this amendment to the 1926 Act will remove the statutory barrier and provide the flexibility to allow the position of these people to be regularised.</P>
    <P>No decisions have yet been made on precisely which posts will in future be designated for filling through the LAC.  However, the intention is that the resources of the LAC will in future be devoted more to the selection and recruitment of the senior tiers of local authority posts.  The more junior professional posts will be filled by way of local competition, as is the case with the clerical and administrative grades.</P>
    <P>Due to concerns expressed by Deputies on this issue in the other House, I gave a commitment to keep the Oireachtas informed by ensuring that decisions are made by order of the Minister and that such orders will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas within 21 days of being made.  I also gave commitments in the other House in relation to the levels and grades above which the <Col N="880" /> Local Appointments Commission will continue to make appointments.</P>
    <P>A section of the Bill provides for the making of a scheme to enable the payment of a gratuity on a once off basis to councillors who retire before the next local elections.  I signalled my intention to introduce such an amendment to the Bill when local government was discussed in the House recently.  The purpose of the gratuity is twofold.  First, it seeks to recognise in a positive way the generous service that has been given by councillors over the years.  Second, assuming a proportion of councillors take up the offer of a gratuity, it will create openings in the local government system for newcomers.</P>
    <P>I hope the political parties will seek out and encourage potential candidates from a broad range of society, particularly women and young people.  However, in case I am misunderstood, I do not wish local government to lose all its elder statesmen with all their experience and knowledge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am seeking the restoration within the local government system of the balance of representation of the various strands of our society and local communities.</P>
      <P>Under the scheme it will be open to councillors to apply to their local authority for a gratuity within a specified time.  At present I expect the timeframe to run from June to September of this year.  The decision to grant a gratuity will be automatically revoked if the circumstances specified in the scheme occur, for example, if a retired councillor once again becomes a member of a local authority in the future.  Another example would be where a councillor, having claimed a gratuity, subsequently stood for election.  If a councillor applied for a gratuity this year and decided to stand for election next year or in five years, the gratuity will be repayable.</P>
      <P>The establishment of the local government fund is the main feature of the Bill.  This is covered by section 3.  This buoyant fund is the centrepiece of the package and it will be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Payments into the fund are dealt with in sections 4 and 5.  The baseline provision of £270 million will be paid into the fund in January 1999.  This will come from the Department's Vote and will be mainly allocated to local authorities for general purposes expenditure.  I earlier explained the inbuilt mechanism to protect its value for future years and to alter it if circumstances change.</P>
      <P>Section 5 provides for the payment into the fund of the full proceeds of motor taxation.  This will also include driver licence duties and other miscellaneous fees and duties collected by licensing authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the purposes for which moneys may be paid out of the local government fund.  These will include contributions towards the expenditure of local authorities on non-national <Col N="881" /> roads and general purposes expenditure. It may also include payments to local authorities in respect of expenses incurred in promoting the delivery of quality and efficient local authority services and in respect of expenses incurred by the Minister in collecting motor taxation.  The section also provides for the establishment of a committee to advise the Minister on allocations to local authorities from the fund.</P>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the issue of the expenses involved in collecting motor taxation and allows local authorities to take these expenses into account before they pay the balance remaining into the local government fund.  A similar provision is contained in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997.</P>
    <P>The adjustments of the motor taxation rates are provided for in section 8.  These involve an increase of 3 per cent from a date to be appointed by order following the enactment of the legislation and a further 3 per cent from 1 January 1999.  The section also covers reductions for public transport vehicles such as buses and taxis.  The provision also covers minibuses because the reduction is designed to facilitate voluntary and community organisations which own minibuses and other transport vehicles.  I draw Senators' attention to an additional element in the section which was introduced by amendment on Committee Stage in the other House regarding the removal of the need for temporary discs on commercial vehicles requiring certificates of road worthiness.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide for the postponement of local elections until June 1999. These elections will now coincide with the European elections in 1999 and will be held every fifth year thereafter.  I intend to introduce legislation next year which will include a constitutional guarantee for local government and also stipulate that local elections must be held every fifth year.</P>
    <P>Section 11 removes the statutory requirement in the Local Authorities (Officers and Employees) Act, 1926, that every permanent local authority office for which a professional qualification is required must be filled by the Local Appointments Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the making of a scheme by the Minister to pay a gratuity to councillors who decide to retire from service on local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 13 repeals various sections of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1997, which are necessary to enable the new funding system to be introduced.  Some provisions of the Act will remain in place, including those abolishing domestic water and sewerage charges and establishing on a legal basis the local government (value for money) unit and value for money auditing.</P>
    <P>The funding system for which the Bill provides will be buoyant and satisfy the funding needs of local government for the future.  It is fairer and more substantial that that proposed by the previous Government.  Without adequate funding, <Col N="882" /> local authorities cannot be as responsive as we would wish.  I assure the House all efforts will be made to ensure that all the moneys made available to local authorities will be used wisely and that the performance of local authorities will become more transparent in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to introduce this important legislation. It is the first Local Government Bill I have brought forward and it is the first of a series of reforms that will be introduced by the Government over the coming years.  On that basis, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  He has kept the House busy with environmental legislation in recent months.  While the details of the Bill were not previously discussed in the House, its broad principles were debated in the recent motion on local government funding.</P>
      <P>The Local Government Bill, 1998, was initiated by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on 25 March last.  The Bill puts into effect the main proposals announced by the Minister in January 1998.  It generally applies from 1 January 1998, with the exception of the 3 per cent motor taxation rate increase which will apply from the passing of the Bill in 1998.  This will be followed by a further 3 per cent increase on 1 January 1999 as outlined in section 9.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the Bill will allow for the establishment of a Local Government Fund and the payment of £270 million in 1999 as outlined in section 4.  In addition, the proceeds of motor taxation, which are calculated to amount to £320 million, will also be paid into a fund as outlined in section 5.  The total fund will amount to £590 million from 1999.  This represents an increase of £128 million in total local government funding in 1997.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides for the purposes for which money may be paid out of the fund.  This is probably the most important section of the Bill and the one about which local authorities have most concern.  Although it is evident that additional funding will be made available generally to local authorities, the exact mechanism for distributing the new funding is not clear.  Under the present relatively new legislation Dublin local authorities would retain as of right 85 per cent of private motor vehicle taxes.  This meant that approximately £50 million was retained by the four Dublin local authorities and not paid over to the Exchequer.  The new legislation provides that all motor tax receipts, less motor tax expenses, will be paid into a fund and local authorities are therefore dependent on section 6 of the Bill for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1978 the rate support grant was based on the loss of domestic rates to each local authority. From 1983 onwards, payments of rate support gradually declined and with other changes in legislation the current equivalent rate support grant equates to about 25 per cent of the 1978 level.  In addition, local authorities receive road grants and other miscellaneous grants from the <Col N="883" /> Department of the Environment and Local Government.  Since all these grants are being replaced by the new local government fund there will be no separate grants other than those payable out of the fund.  From the perspective of Dublin city it is important that the future funding of Dublin Corporation, my local authority, fully acknowledges Dublin's role as a capital city with specific financing needs, including the regeneration of urban areas, community development and social exclusion.</P>
    <P>The criteria for the distribution from the local government fund, as set out in section 6, are to be determined solely by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  Previously, as I mentioned, the determination for rate support grant was based on specific loss of domestic rates, and even when this grant was declining it was generally applied in an equal manner over all local authorities.  It would be preferable if an agreed criteria were applied in the distribution of money out of the local government fund to ensure that the base line of funding for each local authority was secure.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated in his contribution to the Seanad motion on local government funding that the fund would be distributed on the basis of needs and resources.  He informed the House that Galway borough, county and urban councils, with assistance from the Department, are endeavouring to create a framework by which the fund will be distributed.  The model being worked out appears to be based on equalisation, taking into account the individual circumstances of each local authority.  I would be happier speaking to a Bill on local government funding if I knew exactly how this fund was to be divided among local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated on that occasion it was important that a local authority system gives value for money and he was putting audits in place to ensure this happens.  Dublin Corporation has had audits in place for many years to ensure that the taxpayer, who funds the local authority, would receive value for money.  Corporation management gives excellent value for money and I hope it will be favourably looked upon for a block grant so that members can decide how to spend this money.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest weaknesses in local government is the lack of funding.  I serve on the estimates committee of Dublin City Council.  After we provide for salaries and wages out of the budget of £270 million, only 20 per cent is left for spending on other important issues.  The general thrust of the Bill, with the additional increase of £125 million in funding for local government, must be welcomed as a serious attempt to ring fence local government funding as a separate entity from general Exchequer funding.  The increase in funding is guaranteed under the Bill to be not less than consumer price index increases.  It is the distribution of local government funding under section 6 which should be of <Col N="884" /> most interest to local authorities and I hope the Minister will devise a fair system for the allocation of funds.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 provide that elections to all local authorities will be held in 1999 instead of 1998 and in every fifth year thereafter.  There is justification for postponing local elections this year.  The previous and present Governments proposed changes to the local government system, some of which &mdash; such as the strategic policy committees &mdash; are now getting under way.  I welcome these measures.  As I said on the local government motion, the current system is tiring and needs reinvigoration.  The new committees and systems will help local government.</P>
    <P>Another reason for postponing local elections is that the present electoral areas were drawn up in 1985.  There have been two censuses since then and there are huge proportional disparities in the local authority electoral areas, especially the disparity in the ratio of councillors to population. My electoral area to Dublin City Council, Pembroke, is now 19 per cent above the tolerance level of other areas in Dublin.  The Minister has established a working party to report to him by 1 July on the reorganisation of electoral areas.</P>
    <P>I have always favoured a single seat system at local government level and cannot understand why we have never tried it because it would have special advantages for urban areas like Dublin. For instance, the electoral area of Drumshanbo, County Leitrim, has a ratio of 960 people per councillor, which is real local democracy, while the ratio in Pembroke is 10,000 people per councillor. The population of that area is 40,000.  If the single seat system operated in Dublin it would reduce my representation in Pembroke to 10,000 people.  That would provide real local democracy and do away with the duplication of representation to the three councillors who share the local authority area with me.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in the other House and again today, the Minister mentioned he intended to provide constitutional safeguards by proposing an amendment to the Constitution to give specific recognition to local authorities and to fix the interval at which local elections can take place by putting them on the same footing as Dáil elections. Perhaps he could be more explicit about that in his reply.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced a new section 12 on Committee Stage in the other House which enables him to grant a gratuity to a person in respect of his or her service as a local authority member if that person intends to retire prior to the next local election.  I welcome this section because it is only right that retiring local authority members should get some financial benefit for the service they have given to the State, in some cases for many years.  In this State, members of local authorities give a service to the community which is second to none.  When travelling around the country on Seanad election campaigns I only have to mention the name of the local councillor I wish to meet to be given directions to his or her <Col N="885" /> house.  It appears that everyone in a community knows their local councillor and where he or she lives.  County councillors, urban councillors and town commissioners have given an unstinting service to their community and made a vast contribution to local democracy.  It is only right that those who wish to retire from the system should receive a gratuity for the service they have given.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was only prepared to give this gratuity to members who retire prior to the next election but a justified case has been made that members who have given many years' service and fail to be returned at the next election should also get a reward for this service.  The Minister requires the consent of the Minister for Finance to set up such a scheme.  When the Minister for Finance spoke on the Bill relating to Members' allowances he was pressed by Senators in regard to local authority members and he stated it was a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I only hope the Minister will be as generous as the Minister for Finance was to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas because local authority members deserve the same respect.  If this is to be a once off payment, the gratuity should be a reasonable amount and I want the Minister to be generous.  The General Council of County Councils gave him guidelines on a figure it feels appropriate.  If he is not prepared to give a reasonable gratuity to retiring members who have given long and loyal service to local democracy, offering a derisory sum would insult them and it would be better not to go ahead with it.</P>
    <P>I welcome extra funding for local authorities because insufficient funding is one of their weaknesses. However, we can never have sufficient funding to meet all the needs of the local system. Nevertheless, it is difficult to support the Bill because section 6 involves the drawing up of a scheme for the allocation of funding about which we do not know the details and the Minister said he will not have the report on it for some time while section 12 is designed to establish a scheme of gratuities for members and we are still in the dark about the amounts of money that will be available to retiring members.  These are weaknesses in the Bill and, but for them, I would support it fully.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad agus é a mholadh freisin as ucht an iarracht, suim, agus an obair dian díreach atá á dhéanamh aige chun rialtas áitiúl a chur chun cinn.  Gan amhras, beidh sé ar ais arís go minic chun rialtas áitiúl a chur i bhfeabhas. Everyone welcomes the opportunity to see local government put on a sound footing.  It is big business with the Minister in charge of probably one of the biggest spending Departments in the State, where over 30,000 people are employed, and controlling expenditure in the order of £2 billion per year.  It is important it is underwritten in a way that enables it to make the contribution to society that he and every Senator wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="886" /> Since his appointment the Minister has shown that he is committed to meaningful renewal and reform of local government and has made many statements regarding the efforts he will make to remove the democratic deficit and institute a system whereby we will have full time elected chairmen of county councils and the role of the councillor will be recognised in a tangible way.  People are looking forward in anticipation to that.  As we enter a new millennium it is important the professionalism required and the time and dedication demanded of councillors are recognised in a way that enables them to function in a satisfactory and fulfilling manner.</P>
    <P>We will also, hopefully, see the integration of development agencies and local government. They have played a constructive role and combining them with the local government system will have a symbiotic effect in that the combination of both will be greater than the sum of their contributions individually.  I hope we will see that develop over the next 12 months as we approach the elections.</P>
    <P>It is important the value for money ethos is maintained as a target and that the body to be established by the Minister which will monitor its success is effective.  In general, the more transparent and accountable administration of local government is more cost efficient than spending money centrally which has been the tendency.  A report in 1995 showed we had the most centralised system of government bar China and the Minister's commitment will give rise to an undermining of this status.</P>

Likewise, the integration of development agencies strives for value for money because the duplication of administration, which is costly, can be avoided and the accountability factor will make them much more dynamic.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill despite a few reservations. However, for the first time it puts the funding of local government on a statutory basis.  Over the past 20 years domestic rates were removed and this undermined local government to an extent. The guarantee of the rate support grant introduced at that time, subsequently removed in 1983 by Deputy Spring, then Minister for the Environment, also weakened the funding base of local government.</P>

      <P>At the risk of arousing Senator Doyle, another retrograde step was the removal of domestic water charges by Deputy Howlin when in office last year in an effort to try to support candidates in certain constituencies where there might have been a certain degree of sensitivity to water charges and, unfortunately, that undermined the local government system.</P>
      <P>The Bill restores confidence and fairness to the funding system for local government.  Those of us who over a long period have been campaigning for increased resources to enable local government to function effectively will have to welcome an increase of 27 per cent in funding on the 1997 figure.  That is a significant increase and all practitioners of local government, officials and elected representatives, will very much welcome that.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge the Minister's commitment to ensuring there are adequate finances because it is not alone to be seen in revenue but also in capital.  Funding for non-national roads and the housing programme increased by 22 per cent while expenditure on water services increased by £24 million. Those are significant funds and it is right they be given now when the economy is doing well.  It is important this funding for local government is spent in providing infrastructure and better facilities for local communities so that everyone has the capacity to share in the benefits of the economic boom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 removes the power to make certain appointments from the Local Appointments Commission and transfers it to local authority management.  While the record of the LAC is reasonably satisfactory, all involved in local government can point to various appointments which have been less than inspired.  Unfortunately, because of the nature of the public service, where such appointments turn out to be a mistake it is difficult to correct them.  I have often seen situations where managers were influential in the selection process, both those made using the LAC and those made directly, although perhaps they are not as influential as they once were. People of good calibre who had an excellent contribution to make were often left behind and that is an anomaly.  A county council is often compared to a board of directors.  I know of no board <Col N="888" /> of directors of any company which would sit on the sidelines when a critical and important appointment was being made, especially if the position had responsibility for a function which could dictate the success or failure of the enterprise.  Councillors or the chairman should have some input into the selection of staff, particularly at a senior level.  Perhaps that might be examined as it would enhance and improve the system.  An example is the vocational education committees which have operated effectively for a long period and whose selection process is very good.</P>
    <P>The authority of which I am a member, New Ross Urban District Council, had a temporary town clerk appointed a year and a half ago.  All the councillors believed the appointment would not succeed and it is only now that the manager accepts the failure of appointing someone on a part-time basis to a full-time position.  Anyone could have predicted the consequences of that but it was allowed proceed until the staff requested that the matter be rectified.  Other than going on a deputation to the manager to make known their point of view, councillors were powerless.  Their views were ignored for months until it became clear to everyone that the matter could no longer be tolerated.  Such a situation should be avoided in future if at all possible and the structures should be put in place to avoid it.</P>
    <P>I welcome with reservations the introduction of a retirement gratuity.  The Minister is the first to introduce it, and in doing so he has fully recognised the role played and contribution made by councillors over the years.  It is an important first step.  However, I believe it should apply not only to those who retire but also to those who lose their seats and it should be available on an ongoing basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all involved in local government and most in the Oireachtas would acknowledge that much of the work they do is related to local government and to the operations of their local authority in their constituency.  It is an anomaly that, as Members of the Oireachtas, we will qualify for such a gratuity after three years' service, regardless of whether we lose our seats. When it comes to examining the overall package for local government, I hope there will be some payment included on an annual basis for local councillors.  The formula which applies in the Oireachtas is one the Minister might examine at the time for application to local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important the amount of the gratuity is of a magnitude which recognises the contribution made.  The Local Authority Members' Association, of which I am chairman, made a submission that the amount be £570 per year of service.  I do <Col N="889" /> not know whether the Minister will accept that figure, but whatever figure he does arrive at, it is important it recognises the contribution which has been made.  Given the effort and courage of many politicians in achieving an agreement in Northern Ireland, politicians are now held in higher esteem than before.  As national politicians, it is important that in dealing with local government we do not unwittingly denigrate or downgrade the contribution made at that level.  If we avoid doing that, we will enhance the profession of politics.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in funding.  It is a significant one at a time of low inflation.  I also welcome the value for money parameters the Minister will introduce.  Local government has always been accountable and the increased discretion which will be part and parcel of the new system is also important.  I hope those councils which are efficient and cost effective will be rewarded and that where councillors and councils display efficiency and innovation, the Department does not end up enjoying the benefit of it, something which has often happened in the past.  If the benefit is left with the council which introduces and achieves these efficiencies, it will encourage others to follow suit.  That should be the challenge to us all.  The Bill is another step and milestone in the Minister's plans for local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I agree with some of the changes he is introducing in the Bill.  He has a large brief; environment and local government is one of the largest.  There is no doubt that he is making changes to local government and I compliment him on that because it is not before time.  Reform was needed and I welcome many of the changes he proposes.  We have a centralised system of local government and, in fairness to the Minister, he is attempting to devolve some powers.  We probably have the most centralised system in Europe, so any break-through and devolution of powers from central Government to local authorities will be welcomed by the public and local authority members.</P>
      <P>I welcome the value for money parameters which the Minister has put in place.  I join with Senator Walsh in asking the Minister to reward effcient local authorities.  I recently read of a local authority in England which devised such an efficient system that business managers from all over the United Kingdom came to study it.  I would welcome a system of rewarding local authorities who put efficient systems in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome also the Minister's proposal to fund non-national roads from the motor taxation fund. The public will be able to see how their motor tax is being spent.  The total amount being spent on national secondary routes is approximately £18 million.  This is a very small sum of money.  In County Mayo, although we have a large number of national secondary routes, we received no funding in the last number of years.  A system must be devised to spend some of the motor taxation fund on national secondary roads.  The <Col N="890" /> Minister has said that the volume of traffic will increase so more money must be spent on secondary routes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's provision of extra funding to deal with the litter problem.  The beauty of our countryside is being destroyed by litter.  Any measure to deal with this problem is welcome.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will encourage local authorities to devise a more efficient method of collecting motor tax.  I would like to see a system of easy payments which would allow motorists to pay the tax by credit card or on a monthly instalment basis.  We will see a significant 6 per cent increase in motor tax over the next two years.  Tax on a two-litre car will amount to between £400 and £500.  This amounts to £10 per week and many households require two cars.  A system of instalment payments or of credit card payments is needed.  The practice of paying the total amount of the tax in one instalment is outdated.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the proposed changes in the functions of local authority members.  The Minister has spoken about transparency.  He spoke at a recent conference in County Wexford about these proposed changes but nothing significant has been announced about the Minister's intentions since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his intention to give a gratuity to long serving members of local authorities. He gives no indication of the amount of the gratuity or the conditions attached to it; nor does he state his reasons for granting this gratuity. I presume it is granted in recognition of service but I do not understand the manner of its introduction.  Most councillors with whom I have spoken are insulted by the manner in which this measure is being implemented.  Many councillors wonder if the Minister is attempting to encourage councillors to retire from local authorities because he thinks they are too old or have served too long.  The Minister should grant a gratuity to every local authority member and thereby recognise the contribution made to the local authority system by councillors.</P>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of strategic policy committees.  I suggest that elections to local authorities be held every six years.  The Minister has indicated that the term of SPCs should be two years.  A local authority with a term of five years would in that case not be practicable.</P>
    <P>Urban district councils have been poorly treated in the proposed changes in local government. Little or no power is devolved to them.  I hope the Minister will take another look at the make-up of urban district councils.  Bringing them into SPCs was a last minute thought.  It is not clear if the Minister proposes setting up an SPC in every urban district council area.  Will there be a population baseline for the establishment of SPCs and will some urban district council areas have more than one SPC or as many as they like?</P>
    <P>The Minister has not referred to Oireachtas Members who are also members of local authorities. I would like the Minister to comment on <Col N="891" /> speculation that measures may be taken which would affect public representatives who hold this dual mandate.  I ask the Minister to re-examine the gratuity scheme for councillors and to consider the introduction of a pension for them. Councillors should be rewarded with a pension.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  He has brought in much legislation for the betterment of local authorities and I compliment him for his work.  He has met with the local authorities and explained to them his intentions for reform.  His experience as a local authority member is coming to the fore.  He is well aware that local authorities have been starved of funds and he is putting funding mechanisms in place.</P>
      <P>Local authorities were concerned about the capital programmes.  Although they welcomed the programmes and the various grants they received, they were concerned about the running costs of providing water, refuse and other services. Although their cost was eating into local authority revenue, they had to be funded because they are essential services.  However, the county roads suffered.  I compliment the Minister for putting in place the measure to use money from car tax to fund the roads.  It is difficult to sell a 3 per cent increase in road tax to the public.</P>
      <P>I compliment my local authority for the work it has done since the beginning of this year on the county roads in many places.  I am a little concerned that many areas may have to wait until 2005 before their roads are improved.  An approach might be adopted whereby at least the worst stretches of every road might be started and then completed at a later date.  I am delighted that funds will be made available.</P>
      <P>The measures to ring-fence funds are important.  I would like more clarification from the Minister on the changes that may have to be made.  I have spoken many times on the need to get value for money from local authorities.  I felt that works may have dragged on for too long and were carried out inefficiently.  What has the Minister in mind in this regard?  Will local authorities have to contract out road and footpath works, for example?  Many people criticise local authorities for the slowness of the works they carry out. However, whatever work they have done has been excellent and I compliment them for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am interested in the pilot study undertaken in Galway County Council.  The results of the study in terms of discretionary or statutory services will be interesting.  It is a brave undertaking and will be essential for the future if extra funding is needed for local authorities.  In the near future new European regulations on refuse services and a recycling programme will be put in place necessitating extra funds for local authorities.  The smaller dumps in use at present are being filled and closed and the dumping of refuse is being centralised in large dumps.  Nobody wants a dump in their area but we need to dispose of refuse nonetheless and this service must be funded in <Col N="892" /> the future.  The amounts being collected by local authorities for their refuse services will be totally inadequate to fund capital programmes.  New systems will have to be introduced in the near future.</P>
    <P>The retirement gratuity is a welcome measure. The Minister is the first to recognise the contribution of county councillors.  Many people receive a gold watch or other reward when they retire in recognition of their services.  Councillors give good service to the local authorities and the people who elect them and they are put to the pin of their collars to break even given their expenses for carrying out their duties.  People are demanding and they expect their problems to be addressed with haste.  Each telephone call to a Department in Dublin may cost a councillor £5 or £6.  The public does not realise how expensive it is for councillors to do their duty.  Perhaps the Minister would consider a system whereby councillors could telephone Departments at local rates.</P>
    <P>I am glad provision is being made for those who wish to retire from local authorities.  I did not like the unfair remarks about the Minister seeking to remove the senior councillors to make way for younger candidates.  When I was chairman of the General Council of County Councils in the mid-1980s I sought to put forward proposals for a retirement scheme for councillors and I have pursued that issue since.  I am glad the Minister decided to do something to recognise the service given by councillors to their counties. I am also glad that councillors are to be rewarded satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>If a councillor has given perhaps 20 years service, having been elected at a young age, before losing his or her seat, some system should be put in place to reward that person.  The mid-40s is a young age to retire from public life.  Senator Walsh proposed a system similar to that in operation for Oireachtas Members.</P>
    <P>Efficiency in county councils is mentioned in the Bill, and this was a feature of past Governments' dealings with county councils.  I was on deputations to other Ministers for the Environment who said that if a council was well run, it would be rewarded.  I have not yet seen that happen, but I have seen the opposite.  Councils have been badly managed, borrowed money and did not collect water or service charges, yet those have been treated the same way as those which were efficiently managed.  Kerry County Council was the first to introduce refuse and sewerage charges because we needed revenue to maintain our treatment plants.  However, we were not rewarded for introducing these measures.  The Minister should examine this matter.  Councils that are well run should be rewarded from the motor tax fund.  Approximately £50,000 to £100,000 could be allocated to such councils at the end of the year, and those sums could do extra work for the roads.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill.  It is a great day's work.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister, though I may not be able to give the Bill as enthusiastic a welcome.  This is an appropriate year for reform of local government, as 1998 is the centenary of its establishment.  The Minister mentioned that this was one of his reasons for proposing the postponement of local elections until 1999 in order to bring in reforms.  There could then be a statutory and constitutional basis for the local elections to be held on a five-yearly basis, coinciding with the European elections.  I agree with those sentiments.</P>
      <P>This Bill has four main concerns: funding, the postponement of local elections, changes to local authority recruitment and the proposed retirement gratuity for sitting councillors who will not be standing in the next election.  Funding is the most important issue.  Any member of a local authority, or any ordinary citizen, will know that funding of local authority services is a matter of considerable concern and has been for the last two decades.  The Minister will know that the problem, in its present drastic state, arose when his party abolished domestic rates in 1977.  It has been impossible to find an adequate alternative since then, which is what this Bill seeks to do.  The effect of that abolition was to emasculate local authorities in relation to their activities, resources and funding.  In order to do something about the situation they had to impose service charges, which were imposed on a relatively <i>ad hoc</i> basis. Some local authorities imposed charges and others did not, and there was also disparity in the amounts collected.  Dublin did not impose charges at all and was seen as being out of line with other local authorities which envied Dublin's situation.</P>
      <P>The fallout led to political bitterness about the situation.  The ordinary taxpayer felt double taxation was being imposed while services were declining.  There was a parallel source of funding for community-based programmes such as the Leader programme and the partnerships, which were seen as more participative and democratic than locally elected representation.  An artificial dichotomy developed whereby representative politicians were seen as the problem.  Those who had not been elected were seen participating in community politics and were having money channelled to them, and they were seen as the &ldquo;good guys&rdquo; and as getting the job done.  This has been going on insidiously for over two decades, largely because local authorities have been largely dependent on central Government, the rate support grant and the commercial rate, which varies from area to area.  It was never sufficient, because the central support grant was not enough to make up the gap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Howlin, did a fundamental review of local government which dealt with the operation of local authorities, <Col N="894" /> the difficulties in putting policies together that could be delivered on and funding.  He came up with motor taxation as a method of ringfencing a certain fund.  The Department of the Environment agreed to putting that fund aside exclusively to fund local authorities.</P>
    <P>This idea was different from the present Minister's approach.  Deputy Howlin proposed that 80 per cent of the funds would go directly to the local authority areas in which they were gathered. There would then be an equalisation fund of 20 per cent.  The effectiveness of the proposal was based on local authorities collecting and retaining money to be spread evenly by the equalisation fund across other local authorities who might not gather as much motor tax.  While the Minister includes direct funding from the Exchequer and motor taxation, his proposal falls down fundamentally because it hands over to the Minister the exclusive right of distribution of money to each local authority.  He has identified the same source of money as the former Minister, Deputy Howlin, but instead of ringfencing it and leaving it with local authorities for distribution, he has decided to distribute it.  Responsibility is returned to the Minister and central Government and we are back to square one where every local authority will have to wait to find out how much money it will get before it plans its spending.</P>
    <P>Section 3 is extremely blunt about this and states &ldquo;The Minister shall manage and control the Fund&rdquo;.  This is outrageous.  If we are to have local government, the local authority must be able to manage the fund.  What is the sense in ringfencing local authority funding if the management of that funding is taken away from it?  Section 3 states &ldquo;The Fund shall consist of such accounts as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  All the good work the Minister has done in terms of identifying the fund and putting money into it is taken away by reverting to central Government.  That is my primary complaint about this legislation.  Otherwise, I support it.  However, we are falling back to where we were.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the General Council of County Councils recently and there is concern about the precondition imposed whereby somebody must indicate they are going to jump off a cliff before they are entitled to a gratuity.  In other words, someone who stands and fails to win a seat in a local election will not be entitled to a gratuity. This precondition is unnecessary and the gratuity should be given on the basis of services rendered.  People should not be prevented from standing nor should they be penalised if they are brave enough to put themselves before the electorate and fail to be elected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Costello for sharing his time.  I will be brief because the Minister was in the House the week before last to address a motion I tabled on this issue.  He described it as a back door method of introducing the Bill.  It may have been as it was the only opportunity we had to speak on this issue prior to the introduction <Col N="895" /> of the Bill.  I tabled that motion to give the Minister an opportunity to think about some of the issues we intended to raise before the Bill was introduced and before the concrete set.  To a great degree, I am afraid this has already happened.</P>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I question the manner in which the Minister has introduced funding. The previous Government introduced an adequate method of funding which was acceptable to everybody because it decentralised funding and allowed local authorities decide how much they would get.  This Bill ringfences funding but also restrains it because the Minister has the last word on how it is distributed.  We do not believe that is the way to do it.</P>
      <P>The Minister, when in Opposition, was against the method of funding we introduced as he said he did not want to see local authorities hitched onto the back of the family car.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>He has come a long way from that to introducing legislation which is an unnecessary modification of the original Bill introduced by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises the contribution, often unrewarded, made over the years by local authority members and they have only recently been given a certain amount of allowance.  While I accept the Minister is a former member of a local authority and is committed to local government and democracy, in this Bill he has asked us to vote blindly because we do not know what he will do next.  We do not know the sums involved or what will happen.</P>
      <P>One of the Members of this House would describe himself as a very young man.  He has 20 years local authority service, yet he could be tempted to leave.  Other Members may not describe themselves as so young but they have experience and a contribution to make.  However, this Bill is tempting them with a carrot and a stick.  The carrot is the gratuity and the stick is that if someone decides to run for election he or she will not get it.  This is wrong and unjust.  Anybody who has given service to local government deserves whatever gratuity is there to be paid.  If a person decides he or she will not accept the gratuity, runs for election and fails to be elected, he or she will not get that gratuity.  This is also wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone gives service and retires during the term of office of the present local government, will they get that gratuity?  By retiring they are not running and are doing what the Minister wants them to.  Members who have died in service should also be recognised and their families rewarded.  If someone runs and is elected, how is a gratuity continued?  Does it start afresh or is the 20 years previous service taken into account?  Will the Minister introduce a system whereby local authority members will receive a payment?  If he <Col N="896" /> does that &mdash; and I am not averse to the idea &mdash; the person will pay taxation and will be entitled to contribute towards a pension fund, which is right.</P>
    <P>The Minister must inform us of the sums involved.  He will have to be fair and ensure that those who run for election and are not elected and those who have retired will receive a gratuity. These issues must be addressed and clarified.  If they are not, we will not know what we are voting on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I welcome this Bill.  We have been looking for local government reform for a long time and this Bill is a major step in that direction. For many years local government has not functioned properly.  The main reason for this is lack of funding.  The provision of funding as outlined in this Bill is welcome and I compliment the Minister on it.</P>
      <P>The 25 per cent increase in funding for the financial year of 1998, compared with 1997, is a big one and is the type of injection of funding which local government has needed for many years.  I take Senator Costello's point that for many years funding has been the main problem.  However, this is a major step to redress that.  I look forward to the time when local authorities will be able to provide a service to the public.</P>
      <P>A fund of £600 million in any given year is an extremely large one and will do much good in providing the service people require.  The fact this fund is ring-fenced is to be loudly applauded.  I do not share the concerns expressed by Senator Coogan.  Ring-fencing the fund means the money will be there for local government so it may plan ahead.  One of the difficulties local government has had over the years is that it was not in a position to plan.  Given the greater and growing requirements on local authorities to provide more expensive and better facilities to tackle pollution, waste control and environmental controls generally, the requirement of raising the fund in line with the consumer price index may not be sufficient to provide these services on an ongoing basis.  I would like the Minister to address that point.</P>
      <P>The fact the Minister seeks to introduce a system of greater efficiency in local authorities is welcome.  Auditing systems always help and local authorities which do their job well should be rewarded.  We do not want a situation where councils work on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis getting a few pounds to construct a roundabout only to find two or three years later that it is located in the wrong place and must be moved five meters. With the auditing systems, we are less likely to have those problems in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> The provision of finance for non-national roads is welcome.  Non-national roads, particularly in rural constituencies, are in a bad state.  While certain improvements have been made in recent years, we look forward to greater improvements in the years ahead.  We will also have a system where road users will pay for these improvements. That is a better system in that those who get a service should be prepared to pay for it and not those who do not use it.</P>
    <P>As regards minor roads and laneways in rural areas, some local authorities have worked a scheme where those living along laneways located in high altitude areas, the maintenance of the surface of which is difficult because of water flowing down them, have been forced to provide money, materials or work to have the road upgraded. Will this unfair system continue?  These people are already paying road tax which should be sufficient. They should not be deprived of a proper road system because they live in particularly remote areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome the equalisation of the fund because we, in Carlow, have suffered badly from the system in place in the past.  I have spoken about this matter here on a number of occasions.  Carlow town has suffered enormously compared to towns of similar size and did not get the funding other towns received.  With the commitment to equalisation I hope Carlow and other places will do considerably better and that the local authority will do a better job in the future.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of postponing local elections and the commitment to hold elections every five years is a good move.  I accept it must be done on this occasion because I am a strong supporter of the strategic policy committees.  These committees will provide local authorities with the opportunity to call in expertise in given areas from outside the council to make decisions.  It will also give them the opportunity to bring in interested bodies, such as people with disabilities. I have seen footpaths constructed with signposts located in the centre of them and people could not manoeuvre their wheelchairs around them. Such daftness will stop when somebody in a wheelchair is at a meeting and points out the problem.  People who make and implement these decisions have not had to use a wheelchair and therefore do not think in that way.  These committees are a positive move.</P>
    <P>As regards section 7 &mdash; this might not concern the Minister directly &mdash; it is fair that local authorities will be allowed to deduct expenses incurred collecting taxes.  However, businesses and employers deduct PAYE, PRSI and VAT. They do the work of the State but do not get any recompense for so doing.  Perhaps the Minister will raise this point with the Minister for Finance to see if the trend being introduced here could be introduced across the board.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the retirement of councillors from local authorities and the gratuity the Minister proposes to pay those who opt to retire. What will happen if somebody opts to retire but <Col N="898" /> is then appointed to a strategic policy committee? Will they lose the gratuity?  I compliment the Minister on a good job.  This move will enhance local government in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on the Bill.  Local government is the one facet of government which touches every citizen, be it the condition of the roads, the quality and quantity of our water supplies, the availability of moderate sewage treatment works, the provision of quality housing, car parking, play and amenity facilities, libraries, fire stations, fire services, etc. It is important, therefore, that local government provides these services to a high standard at an affordable price.  This Bill will achieve that balance and I congratulate the Minister in this regard.</P>
      <P>We must endeavour to maintain a balance in terms of population between urban and rural areas.  It is vital that progress is planned to benefit urban and rural communities equally.  Dublin must not become a sprawling and cluttered city while the country is denuded of population.  With improved roads and facilities it should be possible to reside and work in rural areas or to commute to Dublin in comfort.  This is the way of the future.  Local government officials must work with Telecom Éireann, ESB, Bord Gáis and so on.  It should be possible to provide services at the same time and avoid disruption and waste as a result of numerous road openings.</P>
      <P>The decision to hold local elections in 1999 is welcome.  Having obtained the funding and support envisaged in the Bill, I am sure local authorities and vocational education committees will face the new millennium with confidence.</P>
      <P>The Bill is worthwhile and it looks towards the future.  I am privileged to speak on it because next year I will have served on Monaghan County Council for 20 years.</P>

      <P>I will have something to say about that later.  The system of funding provided for local authorities in the Bill is satisfactory.  Without adequate funding, local authorities cannot function properly.  The role of local government and that of its elected representatives must be acknowledged by everyone.  I welcome the provision of retirement assistance to councillors who retire after a period of dedicated service. However, I urge the Minister to consider offering this provision to councillors who run for election and are defeated at the polls in June of next year. Those who show continued dedication to serve on local authorities but are defeated at the elections must not be discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Gibbons referred to county roads and lanes.  It is important that people who are disadvantaged by virtue of the fact that they live a long distance from main roads should be catered for <Col N="899" /> in the same way as those who live near regional and major roads.  I again congratulate the Minister on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing this new deal for local government before the House.  I have great confidence in his approach to local democracy because he rose through the ranks and there is no better way to learn the nature of local democracy and politics. I am not enamoured of those who manage to rise to power through a system which does not provide education in respect of the various elements of political life.  With that in mind, I feel confident in speaking on the Bill.</P>
      <P>We are discussing a new system of funding for local democracy.  I was elected to Dublin County Council in 1985 and I am still fighting to obtain additional funding for my area to have roads and paths completed, open spaces cleared, new lights provided and problems with planning resolved. On each occasion I table a motion I am informed that due to lack of resources or manpower the local authority is not in a position to carry out the work required.  I attended a deputations meeting earlier today which dealt with three projects &mdash; clearing up an estate and open space and carrying out repairs to lighting &mdash; I have had on the agenda since 1994.  I was again informed that due to lack of resources and manpower the work cannot be carried out.</P>
      <P>I hope the Bill will place local democracy on a strong footing and enable us to reflect the views of those we are elected to represent.  Under its provisions, funding for local authorities will come from two sources, namely, motor taxation and the Exchequer.  This will ring-fence local government finances and, as the Minister stated, ensure value for money.  A great deal of wastage occurs in respect of certain projects, which is not one's fault, but we must ensure that money is not squandered.</P>
      <P>Councillors will have a new role to play and their power will be enhanced in respect of the new system.  This will strengthen their position and make their job more attractive, which in turn will encourage an influx of new blood into local government.  Many members of the community are educated and they understand the problems we face.  In fact, they can get on well without councillors.  They often bypass us and contact county managers or roads managers directly to have problems resolved.  It is important to ensure that councillors will not be bypassed in the future and also that they should be in a position to reflect the modern nature of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An integrated approach is needed.  Too often, agencies have been established in the CODAN areas.  I am not familiar with activities of such agencies because they fall outside my area of interest.  As a result, despite my membership of <Col N="900" /> South Dublin County Council, I only know what is going on in my local area.  However, I might be asked to vote on an issue into which I had no input because it was dealt with by an outside agencies involving officials and people from my area but not county councillors.  I am glad that an integrated approach will be taken in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that we will be more customer-friendly and that there will be greater transparency.  We will be able to bring officials out into the community and bring members of the public into the council.  Very often these groups were placed on two platforms and were never allowed to meet for fear that the council might have to adopt a defensive stance in respect of a particular issue.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that elections will be held every five years which means that councillors will not be subjected to the whim of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour Ministers in the future. Many people have informed me they are pleased that elections will be held next year because they believe certain councillors have been representing their areas for too long.  The holding of elections is important because there have been many co-options into the system as councillors have moved on, resigned or gained better employment.  However, those who are co-opted do not hold a mandate and they are not known to the public because they were selected and elected through the party system.  I am not convinced this is a good way to do business.  It is not democracy because the public did not have the opportunity to elect these people.  For that reason, I welcome the fact that elections will be held every five years.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the retirement gratuity, about which I am concerned.  The Bill appears to state that if a person has spent 20 to 25 years as a member of the local government system they should consider retiring to allow an influx of young blood.  That is acceptable on one level but I am not sure we should become obsessed with youth to that extent.  Sometimes experience is terribly important.  For example, experienced councillors will often be better able to deal with a county manager than their youthful counterparts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  New blood, both men and women, will provide a good mix in the next local authority.  While there is a once off offer of a gratuity for those who wish to retire, perhaps something similar could be offered to those who failed to get elected but had given 20 to 25 years service.</P>

      <P>I did my best to get the Minister to nod his head.  However, this is separate to the <Col N="901" /> Minister's introduction of a new package.  Perhaps it may include something for such people which is not covered by this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a pilot scheme in Galway which he may use as a model for the implementation of this legislation.  Dublin County Council was split three ways over the last four years.  South Dublin County Council has been stretched in what is the fastest developing county. In consequence, it is very short of staff and very badly resourced.  Will the model in Galway be used as the criterion for assessing what is good in that situation?</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this legislation. I am confident that whatever will be passed will be implemented and that we will have sound local government in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotFitzpatrickFF" hpid="Dr. Fitzpatrick Dr. Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the way the Minister is conducting his Department he will be returning again and again to this House.  For the first time in generations he has decided to undertake a root and branch reform of local government.  The times demand such reform and this will be one of many Bills.</P>
      <P>The Minister has served and suffered in local government.  He knows the pitfalls and frustrations. A recent meeting of my own local authority discussed cleansing and weed killing.  We are all aware of weeds growing on the sides of the roads.  I said that I had seen the parks section pouring weed killer around trees in my local area while ignoring the weeds growing from the gutters and channels.  Another example of similar practices is the cutting of grass on road verges by the roads and traffic department of Dublin Corporation while it will not cut grass in parks.  It is impossible to initiate change in this area &mdash; it is a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object.  It is frustrating to see one's area deteriorate when all that is required is not extra money but a reallocation or managerial review of resources.</P>
      <P>Given this context, I welcome the proposed establishment of area committees.  They will work very well in Dublin city and in other local authorities. Local authorities will be able to identify action to be taken on problems that are specific to their areas.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of my doubts on the way the special policy committees are envisaged.  I had envisaged them as being similar to those in America. They would be committees with power to call witnesses and interested parties to discuss policy matters and make submissions.</P>
      <P>The fund, which will initially have £270 million, is not insubstantial, although it only amounts to what Dublin Corporation would spend in a year. Will the expenses for managing it be allocated from the Department's budget or from the fund itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities will have to be customer focused in ways they have not been since the foundation of the State.  Indeed, like my authority, they tend to be policy focused and, once <Col N="902" /> initiated, tend to be cast in stone making it very difficult for councillors to amend it.  This legislation will allow for more debate in this area.</P>
    <P>The operation of the planning legislation sometimes ensures that common sense decisions are not taken because councillors can be locked into accepting the view taken by a planning officer.  I do not refer here to major planning applications involving millions of pounds but to small matters such as extensions to houses.  The person making the planning application or the councillor has no comeback against a decision made by a planning officer and it is impossible for a councillor to act on behalf of a constituent and put a common sense case.  The Minister will address this issue in subsequent legislation and I wish him well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties faced by the Minister in introducing new legislation regarding local authorities and local administration. This Bill covers much ground and is essentially concerned with tidying up aspects of local government.</P>
      <P>Community groups have been welcomed to the decision making process at European, local authority and Government level.  However, members of local authorities, including myself, are rightly concerned about the diminishment of their input in the many bodies which have community involvement, including county enterprise boards, strategy committees and other committees.  It was never intended, for example, that the membership of some of these bodies would include 16 community people and officials and only four elected members.</P>
      <P>I sit on a county enterprise board with 16 members and four council members and chaired by a county manager.  It is hard to accept that local authority representatives, who have been elected by the people, are precluded from chairing the board.  The person who implemented that legislation did not have his or her feet on the ground.  That is a slur on and an insult to any elected member of any authority.</P>
      <P>Members know what it is like to stand for election and fight their corner with all the different interests.  There are people on my county enterprise board who are only there to make up the gender balance.  Such people would qualify to be the vice chairman if the county manager did not turn up but the four elected members could not be considered for the position.  The Minister will have to face the fact that that is unacceptable. I do not wish to go over ground which has already been covered but I would like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
      <P>An article in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> dated 2 May, headlined &ldquo;More power for county councillors &mdash; a step backwards&rdquo;, states:</P>
      <P>Giving local authorities responsibility for some of the rural development incentives would be a big mistake, warned Anthony Leddy, chairman of the umbrella Leader group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="903" /> That is an awful statement by a person who was not elected but was selected by a political party, in other words, he got in by the back door.  He has no responsibility and can criticise the Government and the Minister of the day.  He is answerable to no one as he does not have to seek election. If it is within his power to do so, the Minister should rectify that situation.  We are not far from anarchy or dictatorship.  Things are not very good in some countries which have dictators.</P>
    <P>I have travelled around and I have listened to the commissioner for regional development commending the community groups, which I also commend.  Many community groups in my county and around the country have received no gratitude for giving the best years of their lives, and I am not implying they have not done very useful work.</P>
    <P>The Minister will diminish the role of elected representatives if he does not clarify the situation and he has only one opportunity to put this right. He is energetic and I have total confidence in him to make the right decisions.  We probably could have no one better to tackle this major problem. I have had opportunities to say this at my parliamentary party meetings and other places but I must also say it in this Chamber.  There is concern about this among those I represent.  Will the Minister, if it is in his power to do so, allay the fears of those who have given the best years of their lives to membership of local authorities?</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I remember when we received 20 franked envelopes a week.  People are talking now about the pay we receive but we worked for nothing for the best years of our lives.  Local authority members are in the same position today.  If someone wants to get their mother into a Dublin hospital, a local authority member, by virtue of their nature, will telephone the hospital and the person's doctor at a cost of perhaps £5.  That is the procedure followed in rural areas where local authority members do not offer to write a letter but respond immediately and try to give satisfaction. That is the nature of the job of a local authority member.</P>
    <P>The Minister has long experience in this area and knows what I am talking about.  I do not need to give him a lecture; I am just outlining the position as I see it.  It is important for the Minister to clarify the position beyond a shadow of a doubt. He must give recognition to those who have given everything for nothing.  It is a thankless job which involves putting up posters, collecting money and getting abuse.  Politicians are lambasted by those in the media who would like to be in politics. RTÉ never misses an opportunity to criticise and downgrade everyone in public life.  However, a good handful of people in RTÉ over the years, whom I will not name, tried to get into politics but did not set the grass alight.</P>
    <P>This is fundamental to the structures of democracy on the ground.  The democracy which we cherish so much is at stake.  I am sure this has all <Col N="904" /> been said before but I wish to put on record my strong feelings about this.  I have been a local authority member for 40 years and I should have learned something in that time.  Local authority members have been badly treated.  They received a paltry recognition a couple of years ago but most of them were out of pocket for postage and telephone bills.  I have total confidence the Minister will recognise there is a big problem here and will not miss this opportunity to help grassroots public representatives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Acting Chairman Acting Chairman">

      <P>It is not easy to speak after someone as experienced as Senator McGowan.  I join in congratulating him on his long period in public service.  There are a number of people around the country who have given long and good service to the public and their respective parties.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  I am particularly pleased by what he said this afternoon.  Nevertheless, I wish to refer to a couple of aspects, one of which is the role of the local government member, to which I am sure many Members have referred.  The role of elected local government members deserves to be recognised.  As I noted previously, the Minister served for a considerable period on a local authority.  He is aware of the ins and outs of the system and also, as Senator McGowan mentioned, the amount of criticism levelled at local authority members.  However, this is a test of a person and if he or she stands the test, it proves they are good people.  Local authority members will be criticised but that does not matter.  It does not make much difference. Members continue to do their jobs as well and as honestly as possible.</P>
      <P>A number of multinationals want to set up superstores in various parts of the country.  Will the Minister take on board the urgency of the situation? Such superstores have been found to be undesirable developments in England and other parts of Europe.  They have laid waste to town and city centres and I appeal to the Minister to take action on this matter.  I reflect the views of many elected members of local authorities throughout the country on this issue.  The Minister should introduce legislation to control the development of superstores.  Successive Governments have implemented urban renewal schemes. The aim of these schemes conflicts with the development of superstores in green field areas. They will undermine progress and I urge the Minister to take action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned funding.  As a county councillor I am concerned about the waste management strategies that must be adopted by county councils; they will be expensive.  In my area charges have been increased from £60 to £100 in the last 12 months.  It appears they will increase to £350 or £400 in the next three or four <Col N="905" /> years to ensure the scheme is self-financing.  If that is the case, as a result of the need for waste management strategies, householders will be forced to bear a huge cost.  Somebody must pay for the strategy and I ask the Minister to address this area in his reply.</P>
    <P>Regarding the management of waste water treatment plants, the Department is required to ensure that EU regulations are implemented. However, from where will the additional funding come to run the plants?  Has sufficient funding been earmarked in the Minister's proposals to achieve the desired objective?</P>
    <P>A number of additional responsibilities have been placed on local authorities over the years. However, funding was not provided for them.  It is important services are provided at local authority level.  The authorities are at the coal-face in terms of providing local government to the people.  If work cannot be done because of the absence of funding or because other areas have been prioritised at local authority level, problems arise.</P>
    <P>In common with most local authority members, I welcome the ring-fencing of the funds.  I also welcome the redirecting of the motor vehicle taxation funds to county roads.  This is long overdue and I thank the Minister for this move with which most local authority members agree.  I support Senator McGowan's point about the enterprise boards and the regional authorities.  It is the conviction of many local authority members that they should be brought back under the umbrella of local authorities.  Administrative staff and existing structures are available and local authorities are capable of the work.  I urge the Minister to consider the merit of these views on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Sadly, I have never served on a local authority and, therefore, I will not receive a gratuity.  However, I take cognisance of Senator Ormonde's point about the value of experience.  I intend to inspect the Pembroke ward on my way home and consider the possibility of contesting the election next year.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has examined the issue of expenses.  It is elitist that people on local authorities are expected to serve with little recompense. I served on the Eastern Health Board and I realise people put a great deal of time and effort into their membership of boards.  I congratulate the Minister for considering this area realistically.  I will not delay the House.  I must leave to inspect my potential ward area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate.  It is an indication of the interest in this area that Members contributed less than two weeks after a full debate on local government and introduced a number of new issues and ideas.  I welcome their response to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will endeavour to address the various points raised during the debate and also the issue of local funding and the gratuity in which Members <Col N="906" /> are particularly interested.  I do not think less of the other issues raised but some of the points are more easily addressed.  A number of them will be dealt with in future legislation.</P>
    <P>I take Senator Fitzpatrick's point about planning laws.  The Department is currently in the middle of a complete overhaul of the planning and development laws and a major Bill will be introduced towards the end of the year.  A number of other shorter Bills relating to this area may be introduced in the interim.  This will give Members an opportunity to tease out the difficulties they highlighted.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh mentioned the selection procedures adopted by the Local Appointments Commission and said there should be more local involvement.  I accept the Senator's view but there has been a clear divide up to now in relation to personnel and industrial relations matters in local authorities.  The vocational education committees were cited as an example of what might happen at local authority level.  However, the position in the vocational education committees is not the same.  They have an authority with outside membership to appoint teachers to schools. The procedures in place for chief executive officers are similar to those for managers, secretaries, etc.  I am reluctant to take the route of involving elected members in this procedure. That is not to cast aspersions on elected members but it could cause difficulties for them.  They could come under many pressures as regards personnel arrangements, not that they are not used to that, or could start on the wrong foot with officers appointed to councils &mdash; for instance, people could be seen to be in favour or against those appointed.  It would not be helpful to introduce that measure as it could be divisive.</P>
    <P>Senator Burke asked about more money for secondary roads.  That is more appropriate to another debate but I accept the point.  It is a function of the NRA but it is a function of the Department to make the money available in the first place.  I am conscious of the matter.</P>
    <P>The litter question, also raised by Senator Burke, is also more appropriate to another day but I have not missed an opportunity to talk about it in the last 12 months.  I believe this country is a disgrace as regards litter.  Everyone complains about it but no one takes personal responsibility.  Every piece of litter in our towns and villages is dropped by a person, not by the Government or the county council.  Our record in this regard is abysmal.  Certain people in RTÉ were criticised during this debate but I thank the station for highlighting this problem in its news programmes in the last few weeks.  RTÉ will be continuing this coverage &mdash; it is taking an interest in the Tidy Towns Competition this year and will show the good work being done.  When we criticise certain things we should also acknowledge the good work being done.  People will have to take personal responsibility for litter and local authorities now have the power immediately to <Col N="907" /> enforce the rules, regulations and laws under the Litter Pollution Act.</P>
    <P>I do not want to stray across the line from the Executive to the Judiciary but there are hopeful signs in the way judges have treated cases with the proper seriousness &mdash; maximum fines were imposed in at least two cases and substantial fines in others.  People must realise that littering, even cigarette butts and chewing gum, is a slight on us all and shows a lack of pride in our towns and villages; until they do, our current problem will continue.  The sooner people realise that they, with others, are personally responsible, the better.</P>
    <P>I was asked about an easy payment system for motor tax &mdash; we are working on it and trying to introduce it.  A new computerised motor tax payment system is being tested and in that context we are looking at alternative methods of payment. Some local authorities, including Wicklow, Limerick and Meath, currently accept credit cards and the new computerised system will facilitate that.  The difficulty with an easy payment system is that if people decide to default, one has to put procedures in place to reclaim the tax disc.  That might not happen in many cases but we must be aware of it.</P>
    <P>The strategic policy committees were raised, directly or indirectly, by several people.  I thank Senator McGowan for bringing that statement to my attention.  I have severe difficulties with anyone who has difficulty with giving power to elected representatives and that was an appalling statement for anyone to make.  People should be trying to make systems more democratic and transparent, and to make people answerable through the democratic system for their actions. I am horrified that someone thinks the system should not be made more democratic.  The gentleman in question belongs to groups involved in the Leader programme and I hope he is not stating the general view of those groups.</P>
    <P>I asked local authorities to involve community and voluntary groups through the SPC system in a partnership way and am pleased with the progress made so far.  They have responded to the call and embraced the concept of the committees. I emphasised their importance to such an extent that some councillors thought I was suggesting they would not embrace this concept, whereas apparently it is some people in the community and voluntary sector who have difficulties with it. I believe the opening up of local government through the SPC system, and also through local authorities consulting more people, will be good for the system.  If other people have difficulties with this it is a problem they will have to address. The local government system has shown over the last 12 months and will show that it is capable of partnership.  If other people are not so capable I would cast doubts on them holding the positions they do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> Senator Burke asked for my views on the dual mandate but those are well known and I do not intend to delay the House with them.  I do not believe in the dual mandate and I intend to do something about it in the context of the next local government Bill, which no doubt will have a lively passage through both Houses.</P>
    <P>It was wonderful to hear Members of the Opposition talk about the need for local sources of finance for local government &mdash; Senator Costello was particularly strong on this point.  As I said elsewhere, I would be more inclined to believe that rhetoric if his party had matched it with action when it was in Government.  During the term of the previous Government the Labour Party removed the only source of funding, apart from rates, available at that time to local authorities. The loss of £60 million caused the problem but it also threw out the concept of any local funding system for local government.  It accepted the argument on double taxation and proceeded apace to remove any discretion local authorities might have had.  Psychologically, it caused huge damage to the local government system which will not be easily repaired.  It is not open to me or my successors to return to a system of local financing for local government.  When that system went, the only way to finance local government was through the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I heard wonderful comments about the system put in place in 1997 and acknowledged the then Minister had achieved quite an amount by getting motor tax earmarked specifically for local government.  However, I criticised him and believed strongly then and now that the local government system should not be towed behind the family car.  Senator Doyle suggested one plus of the distribution of the rate support grant was that it was done in a standard and uniform way prior to the 1997 Bill but I contend this was one of its inherent weaknesses.  The very fact each local authority was locked into its 1977 position and the amount of money was increased on a yearly basis, irrespective of needs or resources with few percentage points given across the board annually, was wrong.  It took no account of needs or resources.  Over a few years when that system was in place the amount of RSG reduced.  If State funds are to be distributed fairly, they must be flexible and take account of changes in society.  It cannot be locked in a time warp.</P>
    <P>We should be under no illusion about the wonderful system in place.  The motor tax outturn in 1997 was £284 million.  Lorries and heavy vehicle tax revenue or driving licence fees were not included in the 80 per cent retained by local authorities. In truth 65 per cent of the total was allowed to be retained by them while 35 per cent went into the equalisation fund.  The bulk of the money had to be paid out to local authorities simply to replace the income lost from the abolition of the rate support grant and service charges and inflation each year.  There was little buoyancy in <Col N="909" /> the system introduced by the Minister, unlike mine.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Act was so cumbersome as to be very inefficient administratively.  Under the system local authorities collected a portion of motor tax, were allowed to retain 80 per cent of the tax on private cars and motorbikes while the balance of 20 per cent was submitted to the equalisation fund.  Then local authorities had to start talking to one another to find out whether they would increase it.  The suggestion that allowing local authorities to retain 80 per cent of car tax gave them a degree of freedom and local discretion is total nonsense.  They were getting less in real terms than previously.</P>
    <P>For example, Clare County Council would have gained money if it was allowed to keep 80 per cent of car tax in the county and the previous Minister under his Bill returned 55 per cent to the council because it was getting more.  The 80 per cent return meant local authorities got less in 1997 than they did previously.  The Minister was then going to hand out extra money from the equalisation fund.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello was critical of section 3.  It is a direct transplant from the 1997 Act regarding equalisation which the previous Minister, a party colleague of his, managed to get through the House when the Senator was a Deputy.  Needs and resources will decide funding.  The model is being prepared and will be adapted for each local authority.  The reasons Galway was selected for this were it has county, urban and borough councils within its boundaries and, as Senator Ormonde said, it is one of the fastest growing regions in the country.  These factors are taken into account and Senator Doyle's point that Dublin's problems should be recognised is valid and that is why we are talking about trying to match needs and resources.</P>
    <P>I was very direct when asked about the gratuity. This is a voluntary scheme and I am not forcing anybody to give up their seat on any county council.  If people want to leave with five, ten, 15, 20 years or more service I will recognise that.  Anybody who does not is opting for the new system where they will have a chance when the next Bill is passed of gaining reasonable recompense, <Col N="910" /> a standard payment which they will receive in addition to their expenses.  People will be asked to opt voluntarily for one system or the other but they will not have a two way bet.  People are being told that now and are under no illusions.  They will be given the opportunity between June and September to decide which scheme they want and that decision is final.  I do not want to find myself in a position in six or 12 months where an individual will come to me and say he or she was never told about this.  People are being given adequate notice and I do not want people talking about me trying to force anybody off local authorities.</P>
    <P>Senator McGowan has already told me he has no intention of taking a gratuity after serving on Donegal County Council for 40 years and will continue making his contribution to it.  He made his decision even before he knew the value of the gratuity. The gratuity will be reasonable; people have said I should make it reasonable so as not to denigrate councils or insult them.  That I am introducing something at all and acceding to requests made to me by LAMA show that I recognise the contribution of councillors and that I do not wish to insult them.  If Senators tell their electorate that the Minister will not introduce this scheme except on the conditions laid down and ask them whether he should proceed with it, flawed as it is, they will resoundingly answer yes.  I am not discriminating against people and I am giving everyone notice of the scheme.</P>
    <P>People can apply for the gratuity between June and September and anyone who was elected to local councils in 1991 or to an urban district council in 1994 and who served during the current council term is eligible.  I was asked whether it will apply to those who died in office.  It cannot apply to them, only to their estate, provided they served some time in office since 1991.  The details of the scheme will be made available as soon as the regulations are available, which will be sooner rather than later.  They will be laid before the House and each Member will receive a copy.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for his indulgence and apologise if I have gone over time.  I thank Members for their contributions to the debate.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann notes the growing campaign for Objective One Status in the next round of EU funding for those regions of Ireland which continue to meet the requisite criteria.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I thank him for his attendance.  I acknowledge the success of the national economy.  The country's economy is growing at a rate three times faster than Europe.  Our politicians and many others are to be congratulated on this success.  However, there is a different story to be told in some parts of the country, particularly the west, the Border region and parts of the midlands.</P>
      <P>It may seem childish to spoil the party and to throw cold water on the success at national level. Once again we can expect comments to the tune of &ldquo;They are at it again in the west, complaining and crying&rdquo;.  Various figures to which I will allude show that the west is in crisis compared with the rest of the country.  I believe we are in danger of developing a dual economy.  The situation is so serious that we cannot and will not remain silent.</P>
      <P>In 1994 at the start of the current round of Structural Funds Ireland secured the highest <i>per capita</i> share out of Structural Funds in the EU.  If we look closely at the figures we will see that the west and Border region were so far below the 75 per cent qualifying mark that they managed to pull the entire country just below that level.  Mr. Seamus Caulfield of the Council of the West put it aptly when he said that the lame duck of the west laid the golden egg of the Structural Funds for the whole country.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that on a <i>per capita</i> basis the west is getting slightly more than its fair share of Structural Funds, but the Structural Funds include the premia and headage payments for the disadvantaged areas and the west receives a high proportion of these payments.  However, it does not include the Common Agricultural Policy money, large amounts of which go into Munster and Leinster.  It would be an interesting exercise to factor the CAP money into the equation to get an overall picture of EU funding in this country.</P>
      <P>This assumes that <i>per capita</i> is the proper basis for the share out of funds but three-quarters of the Structural Funds go to half of the land mass, that is, Munster and Leinster and one-quarter goes to the other half, that is to Connaught and Ulster.  The pull of investment is towards the more advantaged and developed areas and this creates an accelerated and almost unstoppable momentum.</P>
      <P>There are imbalances within the west region. The population of the west was 352,000 in 1996 with between one-quarter and one-third of the population living in Galway city and its commuting distance hinterland.  Over the last four years the Irish economy has grown at almost three times the average European rate.  Galway city is recognised as one of the dynamic centres of growth in the present booming economy and, therefore, it must be growing at at least the rate of the national average.  Given that the west as a whole is only keeping pace with the European growth rate it would appear that the entire growth in the west can be accounted for by the growth in the Galway city area.  This would suggest that County Mayo, County Roscommon and most of County Galway are showing minimal if any growth and are losing ground not just against the Irish growth rate but also against the much lower European growth rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Objective One status given to Ireland to allow us to move towards the European average <i>per capita</i> GDP must be deemed a failure in those counties where the gap in <i>per capita</i> GDP between them and Europe has widened rather than narrowed. The fact that this is happening in a country which has at national level moved from 64 per cent to parity with Europe within a decade is unacceptable.  It emphasises further the urgent <Col N="913" /> need to reappraise the mid-term review of the impact of the European funds.  The <i>per capita</i> GDP of the west has remained static relative to Europe at about 57 per cent putting it equal with French Guyana which is the seventeenth of over 200 regions; the tenth lowest is Martinique at 52 per cent and the lowest is Guadeloupe at 37 per cent.  In the light of the above, in what position will this leave much of the west when the present European funding ends in 1999?</P>
    <P>The Border region and the west were so far behind initially that there should have been real and positive discrimination towards these regions in the allocation of Structural Funds to enable them to reach the same levels of wealth as the rest of the country.  Unfortunately, this did not happen.</P>
    <P>I mentioned various statistics that had been released earlier this year which give cause for concern.  The regional accounts for 1991 and 1993 were published in November 1996 and June 1997, respectively.  <i>Per capita</i> GDP of the west &mdash; Galway, Mayo and Roscommon &mdash; was 75 per cent of the national average in 1991 and dropped to 71.7 per cent of the national average by 1993, 28 per cent below the national average.  We must remember that this region contains Galway city which is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe.  Where does that leave Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon?  In 1993 the country was, at most, at 90 per cent of the European average GDP with the west at 64.5 per cent of the European GDP.  The situation in the Border region is similar.</P>
    <P>What has happened since then?  In February this year the Fitzpatrick report on the regional impact of Structural Funds for 1994-5 was published. This report tells us that two regions the west and the Border region started out in a relatively poor position and remained in that position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the other regions.  It termed the regions the &ldquo;non-convergers&rdquo;.  The 1996 labour force survey figures showed job increases of 50,000 in Munster-Leinster minus Louth and 2,000 in Connaught-Ulster over 1995.  Figures for unemployment decreased in Munster-Leinster by 8,000 and increased in Connaught-Ulster by 8,000 over the same period.</P>
    <P>The labour force figures for 1997 just published are an improvement on the shocking 1996 figures, but one figure is particularly interesting.  The labour force survey is only compiled on a regional basis but the live register is compiled on a county by county basis.  A document released on 14 November 1997 shows that all counties recorded a drop in live register figures between October 1996 and October 1997 except Sligo, Leitrim and Roscommon.</P>
    <P>In 1996 the IDA job announcements were overwhelmingly in the Munster/Leinster area. Once again we hear excuses: industry will locate wherever it wants and we cannot force companies into the west.  However, we know that when IDA pursued a regional policy in the 1970s there were increases in IDA employment in the west.  The <Col N="914" /> region is falling so far behind the rest of the country's economic performance that it demands immediate and urgent action and while I strongly support the retention of Objective One status for the region, we cannot wait until after 1999 for increased investment.</P>
    <P>I want the west to be given the opportunity for development which will allow us to participate proactively and on equal terms with the other regions in this small economy.  The need for self-sustaining development is our key target &mdash; we do not expect or want to continue as a beneficiary of State and EU funds <i>ad infinitum.</i>  I am pleased to see the commitment in the Programme for Government to seek Objective One status for those regions which still qualify, but we must ensure that the west does not lose out once again in the final shake up.  I would propose Objective One in transition for those regions that will not qualify and full Objective One status until 2006 for those regions that qualify &mdash; the west, the Border regions and part of the midlands regions. This would maximise the total take for the whole country.  I am seeking Objective One status to 2006 in the long term and in the immediate future; regional policies must be implemented and there must be increased investment in the region now.</P>
    <P>In March 1997, as Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern stated that with regard to Structural Funds post-1999 &mdash; or more probably post-2000 given the time lag in all EU payments &mdash; we will have to look seriously at regional structures if we are to continue to benefit.  Reform is going to be forced on us with regard to cover centralisation, which is worse than in any other developed country.  The west, the Border region, and the midlands in particular might still be able to benefit from Objective One status if Ireland ceased to be treated as a single region.  He went on to state that the next Government would have to take this issue seriously if we are not to suffer a major reduction in Structural Funds, particularly in areas where they are still much needed and where the work of improving infrastructure must go on.  More regional responsibility would in any case improve the dynamism of the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that this is not an east <i>versus</i> west debate.  I accept that there are areas of extreme disadvantage within those regions with high GDP and I see no conflict whatsoever with those areas receiving the funding they need from either national or European sources. The issue here is one of equality.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months the Council for the West has lobbied for full Objective One status for the region; today is not the start of a campaign, rather it is the continuation of one.  The campaign in gaining momentum, with more and more groups adding their support.  I want to place this issue firmly on the agenda because I believe that our case is just and equitable and it is supported by all the facts and figures.  It is European policy <Col N="915" /> to grant Objective One status to regions below 75 per cent of European GDP; not only are we below 75 per cent, we are below 70 per cent.  We are asking for what is fair and reasonable, no more and no less.  We are not making a special case or asking to be treated differently; we are simply asking to be treated like any other region in the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion and concur with everything Senator Finneran said.  It is now generally accepted that Ireland as a unit will no longer qualify for Objective One status because the GDP of our country far exceeds the 75 per cent average standard of living threshold within the EU.  It is well known that the European Commission is adamant that the rules for categorising regions or countries for Objective One status will be strictly and rigidly implemented according to whether a particular area is below 75 per cent of the average EU standard of living.  This has important implications for Ireland because clearly there are regions within Ireland which can and should qualify for Objective One status during the next round of EU Structural Fund assistance for the period 2000-2006.  Objective One status entitles particular regions to the maximum amount of European regional, social, agricultural, fisheries and Cohesion Funds.</P>
      <P>The fact that Ireland has been designated as an Objective One region has paid off in large dividends ensuring that our national economic performance has improved substantially and that we are strong enough to join the new European single currency.  Extensive and widespread discussions are taking place between national Governments and the European Commission regarding the breakdown of the package of European Structural Fund assistance within the EU member states for the period 2000-2006.</P>
      <P>There is a very compelling case for regionalisation in Ireland for the next round of EU Structural Funds.  Some regions in Ireland have clearly been out-performing other regions in terms of economic performance and therefore all regions must not and cannot be put into the same bracket for the next tranche of EU Structural Fund assistance. Figures recently produced from the Central Statistics Office clearly show that the Border counties region is still below 75 per cent of the average EU standard of living.  The case for granting Objective One status for this region for the period 2000-2006 is real and beyond reproach. Clearly much work remains to be done improving the road networks in the north-west of Ireland and in the Border counties region.  The continuation of European regional and Cohesion Funds would be a step in the right direction in ensuring that disparities which exist in infrastructural development in the country is redressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must acknowledge that the EU has played a positive and constructive role in developing the Border counties region in recent years.  The EU <Col N="916" /> contributes 40 per cent towards the overall budget of the International Fund for Ireland.  It finances both the INTERREG II cross-Border initiative and the European Fund for Peace and Reconciliation.  I welcome the statement of Jacques Santer, the President of the European Commission, in Agenda 2000, the proposals for the future of the EU, that cross-Border programmes will continue.</P>
    <P>However, much remains to be done in the Border counties and western regions if economic disparities across different regions in Ireland are to be redressed and a level playing pitch brought into existence.  It makes no sense to group the east coast and counties such as Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Mayo and Roscommon in the same bracket for the purposes of drawing down EU Structural Funds for the period 2000-2006.</P>
    <P>Regionalising Ireland so that differences in economic performance can be levelled out serves only a positive social and economic purpose and it will ensure that Ireland will remain strong and competitive in an internal market where a single European currency is operating across 11 member states and covering a population of 290 million people.</P>
    <P>I disagree with European Commissioner Flynn's recent statement that Ireland's share of EU Structural Funds could be less if the country is subdivided rather than treated as one region. He proposed Objective Two status for the country, while the country as a whole gained from having Objective One status in the last round of EU funding.  This status was gained because of the low standard of living in the western and Border regions.  However, these regions have not reaped the same economic benefits as those in the south and east.  We also fared badly from cross-Border and peace and reconciliation funding and the International Fund for Ireland, getting 20 per cent of the funding as opposed to 80 per cent for Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Objective One status must be made a priority to ensure economic development in the north-west. Live register figures show no significant reduction.  The IDA stated that the lack of proper infrastructure such as roads, water and sewerage is delaying inward investment to the region.  Any new investment project is due to the efforts of existing corporations based in that area.</P>
    <P>Traditional industries in Donegal such as clothing and textiles are in decline.  The fishing industry is also under threat and its survival will depend on more favourable terms, hopefully to be renegotiated at the next round of the Common Fishery Policy in 2002.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to deliver to the Border regions in the west.  The Programme for Government clearly states that priority is to be given to getting Objective One status for the region.  The Taoiseach said last year in Gartan that the gaining of Objective One status for the Border counties post-1999 was a priority.</P>
    <P>The Border regions in the west need Objective <Col N="917" /> One status and funding to build the necessary infrastructure to attract inward investment and industry, to develop tourism, create the necessary employment to keep people in the area and to take pressure off the increasing population on the west coast.</P>
    <P>There is a precedent that regions within countries have been granted Objective One status, even though the countries themselves have been granted another classification.  East Germany, southern Italy, the Highland region in Scotland and Merseyside have been designated as Objective One regions for 1994-9, even though Germany, Italy, Scotland and England have all been classified in other brackets for the purpose of drawing down EU Structural Funds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion tabled by the Government parties.  To make proper use of the opportunity to discuss this matter, we need to ensure we receive answers to hard questions and that we do not just have a self-serving discussion about our success in the past few years and how we have been great in getting a certain amount of money from Europe.  We need to concentrate on the quality of spending, the quantity of the money and how the Government is maximising the Irish position for the next round of Structural Funds.  We also need to look at the future of cohesion funding.</P>
      <P>In reality the debate has not started, certainly not in the public forum.  Legal proposals were published in March to give effect to Agenda 2000. If we concentrate on those we might tease out answers to some of the questions.  The success of the Celtic tiger means we have worked ourselves out of eligibility for continued full Objective One status.  I am not sure we should even take that at face value &mdash; that is acceptable if Objective One status is measured on GDP <i>per capita.</i>  However, GNP <i>per capita</i> is a truer reflection of the situation in Ireland because of the huge repatriation of profits from non-nationals.  This immediately reduces figures by about 5 per cent across the board.</P>
      <P>The west, the Midlands and the Border regions all meet Objective One criteria based on the 1994-95 figures.  We are making our case based on the mean figure for 1993, 1994 and 1995, which is perhaps just as well.  Should we accept the figures based on GDP, which is not a true reflection of the Irish position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is unique in Europe in having this problem because of the extent of the profits from non-nationals. Can we make a case for basing figures on GNP, which would measure like with like in terms of our EU colleagues?  To what extent has the Government pursued this important argument in Brussels?  Assuming that we will be given Objective One status in transition at some stage between 2000 and 2006, has the Government pursued the case made by Government Senators? Has it pursued the case for the west, the Border <Col N="918" /> regions, the Midlands, Laois, Offaly, Longford, Cavan, Monaghan and Donegal?</P>
    <P>What case has been made in Europe for these regions which fall well below the average GDP? They are further disadvantaged because of their distance from the centre of Europe and even from the east coast of Ireland &mdash; because of transport and infrastructural problems and demographic structures.  There has been a huge decline in agriculture in many areas, and the way CAP reform is directing farmers in the future, there will be further consolidation into larger farming units and fewer people will be involved on the land.  What socio-economic problems will this cause and will there be further difficulties in these areas?</P>
    <P>My area of the south-east stands at 79 per cent of GDP <i>per capita.</i>  If we are measured on our GNP, we are under the 75 per cent cut-off figure and therefore eligible for Objective One status. As one goes up the east coast and into the greater Dublin area there is a huge increase which pushes the national average to over 92 per cent. However, on GNP, the south east would still qualify.  This is what we should measure because this is what is left in the country.  The south west would also qualify if Objective One status was measured on GNP.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate to what extent the Government is prepared to fight the case for regions to retain full Objective One status?  There is little evidence it is prepared to fight against the various Commissioners who are trying to dismiss our case before we make it.</P>
    <P>There are many other hard questions which need to be answered.  What type of transition are we looking at, on the assumption that parts of Ireland will be given the new Objective One transitional status?  What will the transition arrangements be?  How will the payments be made, front-loaded or back-loaded?  What effort is being put into the national plan?</P>
    <P>The same Government parties structured the last national plan.  There was an international circus when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Albert Reynolds, came home with a £8 billion plan in May or June.  By November and December that had decreased to £7 billion.  Only £5 billion of that money has been spent.  Within the past month, another £200 million pounds was lost because the LUAS funding was sent back and because funding for the national conference centre is unlikely to be spent in time to draw it down, because of planning problems.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the assertion by the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, that the planning of infrastructural projects can be in place before the end of next year and completed by 2001 to draw down funding.  She made that statement to cover up for the appalling mishandling of the Luas project and it was contradicted by Europe.</P>
    <P>What will happen to the next round of Structural Funds?  How will we continue to attract <Col N="919" /> inward investment?  There is gridlock from Drogheda to Bray and apparently no plans to resolve it.  There are no indications of how the Government will resolve this crisis which will affect investment in the east coast.</P>
    <P>Hard answers to hard question are needed at this stage and not a self-serving discussion, although I have no difficulty with the drift of the motion.  To stand up and give a menu of what we want from our regions and the areas in which we live will not be the answer either.  I can make a case for the south east.  I have the report of the regional committee of the south east which I could read through and put the south east's case. It stands alone and I do not have to tell the Minister of State the case for the second bridge in Waterford, an airport or a third level university in our region.  The shopping list is there and the needs are real.</P>
    <P>With the huge diminution in Structural Funds &mdash; we are down to 20 per cent of what we now get &mdash; how will we fund the capital projects which will be essential for the growth of the Celtic tiger we need to absorb the young people coming on to the labour force and to bring home emigrants who want to return and rear their families in Ireland, as they have been able to do in recent years?  With 20 per cent of the funding we now get, how will the Government make up the difference for the capital projects?</P>
    <P>Recently, the Minister for Finance with his ECOFIN colleagues tied us in &mdash; and rightly so in principle &mdash; as regards the stability pact and to rigid budgetary discipline in return for the 3 per cent revaluation of the Irish pound.  He got the 3 per cent revaluation when he went cap in hand before EMU was nailed down.  He got it because he gave in return commitments in relation to the rigid budgetary discipline and because of the stability pact in place that there will be no budget deficit of more than 3 per cent.  That means in good times we will have to be in surplus to be able to carry the bad times at no less than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>Given the stability pact and the commitment he has given to his ECOFIN colleagues in return for the revaluation of the Irish pound, where will we raise the money?  We cannot spend our own money as we are tied to what we can spend.  How will these major infrastructural projects which are so badly needed be continued if we do not fight hard to retain Objective One status for the country on the basis of GNP rather than GDP assessment? At the very least, we must ensure large regions &mdash; the west, the Border regions, the midlands and the south east &mdash; retain their Objective One status based on GNP figures, to which they are entitled.  The Government will not be able to make up the difference if there is a reduction to 20 per cent in Structural Funds on the capital projects which are critical.</P>
    <P>We only have to look at the M50, the ring road around Dublin, which was much heralded.  We <Col N="920" /> could not wait for it to open.  The cement was not dry or the tarmac was not set before notices went up which said to expect peak hour delays of half an hour.  We are running hard even to catch up on where we should have been ten years ago. There does not appear to be the procedures where we will be able to spend the money ourselves to make up the shortfall from Europe for infrastructural capital projects which will prevent total gridlock in our city and in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>We need answers to these questions as to how the Government will pick up the tab if we lose Objective One status in or around the Dublin area, which by any measurement would be hard to defend.  I urge the Minister to ensure the case is made and fought for in Dublin and that we assess Ireland's eligibility on the basis of GNP and not GDP figures.  On that basis, large areas of Ireland should still be entitled to full Objective One status and smaller areas, including parts of the east coast should be entitled to Objective One status in transition.</P>
    <P>We need to know what will be in the national plan for the draw down for the years 2000-6, the Government's plans, to which bodies it is listening and how it will ensure social cohesion as well as our capital programme, which is critical for Ireland, especially more remote isolated areas. We are the only island left in the European Union, the only country with no land bridge, and yet we are likely to be severed from our source of funding of which we have made good use &mdash; perhaps not the best of use in all cases &mdash; in recent years.  I look forward to the Minister's response and I hope he will take up the points we made when discussing and making his case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this subject which is dear to my heart. I welcome the Minister, who is one of the most conscientious and committed Ministers.  He is sincere and will take the message he receives in this House on board.  It is difficult to stomach the fact Senator Avril Doyle has turned this issue into a political football.  We are fairly committed and sincere.  The Senator may go back over old ground in a political manner and fly as many flags as she wishes, but where will it get her?  Where will she get speaking eloquently about what Deputy Albert Reynolds did not get?  Deputy Albert Reynolds was a suitable person, was well thought of in Europe and did a great deal.  Those who helped him to negotiate did excellent work for Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU has been good to us.  The case made initially in the national development plan included the need for improvements in the infrastructure in the west and in the Border counties. We were not as prepared as Dublin and other centres to take advantage of the funding, which is our problem.  There is no truth in Senator Avril Doyle's statement that the Commissioners are not sincere and committed.  Recently, I, and the <Col N="921" /> cross-Border group, met the Commissioner for Regional Development, who is sympathetic and committed to the need to provide funding for certain regions which have not reached the standard of economic development she expects.  Not only is she ready to negotiate but she is enthusiastic about meeting people from the regions and Government.</P>
    <P>I met the IFA and one of the items on its agenda was to put pressure on to retain Objective One status.  However, it neglected to draw a line on the map.  This is shadowboxing.  I would have thought the IFA with its national spread would have been the first to come up with a plan and recommendations.  We have not done that yet and we will not depend on the IFA.  The Government recognises the need to make a proposal quickly. The Commissioner for Regional Development and the EU are ready to accept and consider proposals. The Commissioner is waiting for a submission, which will not be easy to produce because there are differing opinions on whether we should select areas.  People have even suggested parts of Dublin should be included.  We have to make up our minds and reach agreement, which might not be easy because Limerick, parts of Clare, Cork and Kerry will seek to be included. Where will it end?  Somebody will have to take on the responsibility and make a case for the areas where the retention of Objective One status is necessary.</P>
    <P>We have a special problem in County Donegal. For the past 25 years we have survived despite the focus being on the North.  It was economically profitable to set up a business in the North because, despite the political differences in the North where violence prevailed and people lost their lives, John Hume, Jim Nicholson and Ian Paisley got together and met the Commissioner in Belfast to put their case.  They were successful in coming together to convince the Commissioner about the amount of money the North needed.</P>
    <P>Approximately 80 per cent of the major funding for the Border counties was spent in Northern Ireland which meant that those counties were obliged to survive on the remaining 20 per cent.  There are 70 national organisations, some of which are based in the Border counties, and there is not enough money to pay for the administration and structures which have been put in place.  My team and I are going to fight to ensure that people recognise where problems exist.</P>
    <P>In the past ten years at least 14 American trade groups visited Northern Ireland to identify areas where economic assistance was required.  Not one of those groups visited the South or the Border counties.  As stated on previous occasions, public and elected representatives in the Republic were obliged to keep their heads down and not complain because of the fact that people were being killed in Northern Ireland and the main focus was placed there as a result.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> Representatives of the Border counties have made their case but the issue of the geographical extent of the west remains to be resolved.  In that context, will the Minister of State endeavour to see if his Department can develop a final proposal to put to Europe?  If we do not resolve this issue, we will lose out.  As already stated, I met the Commissioner, who informed me that she would welcome and is awaiting a submission to deal with this problem.  Will the Minister of State ensure that urgent action is taken?  Everyone will lose if we continue to delay putting forward a submission.</P>
    <P>When the initial submission was made in respect of the National Development Plan, the lack of infrastructure in the west was the reason put forward to obtain EU funding.  It is difficult to understand how an area which was highlighted in terms of its need for infrastructural funding lost out to the light rail system, Dublin or other areas when that funding became available.  We must be seen to be committed to obtaining Government support to enable us to get down to brass tacks and make a submission in the near future.  If we do not do so, the west will lose out.</P>
    <P>Representatives of the Border counties have made their submission and the Commission recognises that we have suffered serious deprivation because prospective industries were not sited in our region.  Those who represent the west must come together, draw a line on the map and make their submission quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  The case for Objective One status for the poorer regions, particularly the west, has been well documented by a number of groups throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The level of deprivation in rural areas of the west has been unprecedented in recent years.  Let us consider the example of County Mayo, where the number of Dáil seats was reduced from six to five prior to the last general election.  I am informed that the electorate in the county has decreased by 500 since the election took place. The situation is not improving.  When the figures for GDP per head of population are compared with the European average, it is clear that those which obtain in the west are by far the lowest. According to the statistics for the period to the end of 1995, the figure for the west was 64.4 per cent of the EU average, which compares with a figure of 121.5 per cent for Dublin and a national average of 92 per cent.  There is a need to balance the equation, particularly as it relates to the west and the northwest.  There is also a case for redressing the balance in respect of the midlands &mdash; for which the figure in respect of GDP per head of population is 66.1 per cent, the second lowest &mdash; and the Border region.  I hope the Government will give recognition to these regions, particularly the west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the last round of Structural Funds for the period 1994-99 was allocated, the west, particularly County Mayo, fared badly in the context of <Col N="923" /> national primary and secondary routes and railway lines.  Funding was not provided for a national primary or secondary route in County Mayo and it was not provided in respect of the Athlone-Westport-Ballina railway line.  That line has deteriorated to such an extent that if drastic action is not taken it will have to be shut down on the grounds of safety.  Will the Minister of State convey to the Government the necessity to seriously consider making part of the £114 million originally earmarked for the Luas project available to upgrade the Athlone-Westport-Ballina railway line?  The line is in such a state of disrepair that it takes four and a half hours to travel from Ballina to Dublin on a good day.  Trains using the line travel at a slower pace than the steam trains which used it when it was first put in place.</P>
    <P>A number of sections of the national primary route from Longford to Westport were completed prior to 1994.  However, no further work has been carried out on the road since the new round of Structural Funds were put in place.  At present it takes three and a half to four hours to travel from the west to Dublin.  At a time when huge amounts of money are being secured from the EU in the form of Structural Funds on the basis of the needs of poorer parts of the country, such funding should be allocated to the regions that deserve it. However, when the evidence is considered, it is clear that the vast bulk of this money has been spent on the east coast.  I accept that many worthy projects were completed but it is obvious that there is an imbalance in the way this money has been spent heretofore.  For that reason I fully support the motion before the House because the western, midlands and Border regions clearly require Objective One funding in the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>The Government will face a dilemma unless the Commission accepts the devolvement of power to the regions or regional authorities. Given their present make-up, the regional authorities are inadequate; they have neither finance nor decision making powers at their disposal. Power will not be devolved to them as they stand. Does the Government have the will to devise an effective sub-regional scheme that will be empowered to draw down Objective One status for the next round of Structural Funds?  We are all agreed there is an imbalance in the way these funds have been distributed.</P>
    <P>There are a number of worthy schemes in the western region, from sewerage to water to national primary routes and the railway lines.  No Government has addressed the problem of national secondary routes, which will require much funding over the coming years.  My county has probably more national secondary roads than any other.  Approximately £18 million to £20 million is distributed annually on maintenance and upkeep of national secondary routes, which is inadequate.  In many instances they can be as <Col N="924" /> important as national primary routes.  Schemes must be devised to safeguard the national road network because national secondary routes are deteriorating to an alarming degree.  It must be asked if they can cope with the increasing volumes of traffic on the roads.</P>
    <P>I support the motion.  The west and the north-west deserve Objective One status from the next round of Structural Funds.  The seriousness of the matter must be impressed on the Government.  I hope the Minister will bring the question of the provision of a railway line along the western route to the Government's urgent attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Those with an appreciation of economics can see the improvements and wealth created by the current tranche of Structural Funds.  They have helped economic growth and all aspects of infrastructural development.  Funding for health services, airports, county councils and water schemes have all benefited.  There have been huge improvements in living standards, especially in areas where there has been substantial expenditure.</P>
      <P>I support the concept of Objective One status for some of the regions.  If it is to treat its citizens in an equal and fair way, the Government is obliged to look at the distribution of funding, especially in view of the NESC report which outlined the way investment and growth has occurred over the last eight to ten years.  The report also details the regions which have suffered decline.  In view of this, the Government must do something to redress imbalances which have arisen.</P>
      <P>There has been much activity by the Commission for the West, the Western Development Authority, county councils, agricultural groups, especially the IFA and other interested parties, such as Knock Airport.  There is also greater public awareness of the need to strengthen the Government's hand in redressing the imbalance created by rural decline and the lack of structural development.</P>
      <P>The NESC report recommends strategic investment and specific development schemes.  For example, County Mayo, a maritime county, takes in supplies of fish valued at approximately £500,000 per annum.  Given the county's huge coastline its maritime economy should underpin the rural economy.  Previous Governments have failed to develop the seaweed industry to its full potential in a way that would help the long-term sustainability of rural populations.</P>
      <P>All county councils are setting down their objectives, some of which are very worthwhile. While all will seek Objective One status, the Government must pay specific attention to halting the decline of rural communities.  Many towns in the western region have grown to the extent that industries can locate there.  In view of their natural resources they can sustain most of their population if they are given specific support and if proper structures are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="925" /> It is deplorable that the criteria used for approaching the EU with regard to the provision of funding for the rail services, especially to the west, were based solely on socio-economic issues when an economic case could be made.  For example, semi-State bodies could become involved.  Coillte engages in huge extractions of timber, much of which could be carried for export by rail rather than road.  Iarnród Éireann has failed in that regard.  Such an approach would also help to sustain employment and on that basis areas would justify investment in the long term.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of structural funding for our national road network is that the Government should allocate some Structural Funds to a targeted rural development policy. Many headage payments and subsidies were provided out of Structural Funds in the past and we should now target rural development.  That, together with other strategic investment approaches, would do a great deal to sustain long-term development, particularly in areas which are in decline.</P>
    <P>Commissioner Pádraig Flynn indicated the case for regionalisation needed to be examined on the grounds it might do the State's overall case some harm.  On the other hand, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies said Europe wants regional structures. Further thought must be given to that.  Specific strategic investment must be given to the counties which need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to adopt an attitude similar to that of Senator Chambers and look at the positive aspects of European Union membership. I am delighted we have this opportunity to air our views on Structural and Cohesion Funds.  We all have our own local priorities but we must examine the best strategy to deal with the matter.</P>
      <P>The country has benefited enormously from our Objective One status.  Anyone travelling throughout the country can see how well we have managed European funding and the tremendous benefits it has given the country as a whole.  The European Union is the best show in town in terms of all the bright, new homes throughout the country.  A great deal of EU money has been channelled into every tier of education which has enabled us to advertise ourselves as young, educated Europeans which, in turn, has attracted multinational industries.  We are also a stepping stone to the European Union for multinational companies which see us as a desirable base.  That has, in turn, had an impact on our unemployment levels which are reducing at an attractive rate. There are also many EU funded infrastructural projects and cross-Border activities.  Europe has undoubtedly been good for the prosperity of this country.  We can all indicate pockets in which EU funding has not been evenly spread but the country has generally benefited enormously.</P>
      <P>I sympathise greatly with Senators from the west.  The area west of the Shannon seems to be almost totally an Objective One status area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to occasionally &mdash; one must remember one's roots.  I will talk about Dublin soon.  The west, and to a lesser degree the midlands, have undoubtedly lagged behind in terms of the distribution of funding.  However, we must remember that Dublin has not benefited to a great extent.  There is still massive traffic congestion and gridlock in Dublin and many necessary infrastructural projects, such as Luas, have not been embarked on yet.  The £140 million for Luas will have to be distributed on other projects if we do not meet the deadline.  We are not sure of the target date for the port tunnel, which is another major infrastructural project needed in Dublin.  There is a great need for rolling stock on the various rail lines in the city.  The quality bus corridors are underfunded and under-resourced and we still have not finished the southern cross motorway.  There are substantial outstanding rail and road projects in Dublin.</P>
      <P>There are also environmental issues, such as waste disposal.  When will we reach the tertiary stage of waste disposal?  Some 40 per cent of water in Dublin pipelines is wasted because of leakage.  Does the Minister have any views on who is responsible, because the funding is there? Is it the responsibility of the local authority or the Department of the Environment and Local Government?  What has stopped us from investing the money in that project?</P>
      <P>There is also the question of integrated area projects.  A number of Senators referred to the uneven distribution of such projects.  There is a plethora of areas of serious deprivation in my constituency, such as Ballyfermot, Ballymun, Sheriff Street and Seán McDermott Street, where European funding and the Celtic tiger do not seem to have stopped.  There is a great deal of work to be done there.</P>
      <P>We are now in a transitional period in regard to Objective One status.  How much money are we likely to get from the Structural and Cohesion Funds?  Will there be mid-term reassessment of the funds between 2000 and 2006 or will we be able to plan for a six year period?  Will we be able to get front loaded-funding from the Government or the private sector to make up the difference? These are the hard decisions we must make, but we cannot make them until we know how long the term will be, how much funding we will receive and the type of projects which will be presented.  We have a very short period to present our proposals &mdash; I think the deadline is a few months away and there is a great deal of work to be done.  There are many projects which need to be up and running, both in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must ensure we are at least in transition stage over the entire six years.  The Union will enlarge after 2006.  It is very unlikely we will be beneficiaries at that stage; we are more likely to <Col N="927" /> be net contributors.  Once we are net contributors we shall have to stand on our own and forget about EU funding, even though it is a major contributor to our economy at present.  Therefore, any EU funds we receive now and up to 2006 must be used wisely.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I welcome the debate on our Objective One status and look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted to be able to speak on this issue as I come from the West, a region that has been strongly disadvantaged throughout the last allocation of EU funds.  While there has been fair allocation of certain funds, a larger amount of Structural Funds have gone towards the east coast rather than the west coast of Ireland.  History books will record Ireland's decision to join the EU as a good one because in 1973 we had 55 per cent of the EU average earnings whereas now it is greater than 92 per cent if we include the entire country.  Unfortunately, the average earnings in the west of Ireland are less than 75 per cent compared with the rest of the EU.  It is, therefore, very important that Objective One status and funding for certain regions is maintained at its current level.  Other Members will make a case for the regions they represent but I wish to represent the west.</P>
      <P>We need a thriving private sector to maintain the Celtic tiger.  While it is not the Government's or the EU's responsibility to maintain the Celtic tiger, it is our responsibility to continue to create an environment conducive to private sector expansion and growth.  Job creation is the responsibility of the public and private sector. The economic conditions that must be in place are competitiveness, labour market flexibility, the ability of manufacturers to transport their goods to foreign markets and the ability to employ people to work in factories and centres of employment throughout the region.  This means we must have a proper network of transportation for people to travel to and from work and for goods to be transported by rail or road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not an adequate roads infrastructure in the west.  If a person drove within the speed limit it would take three and a half hours to drive from Galway to Dublin.  This length of time is unacceptable and we cannot allow this situation to continue.  We need to improve the current roads network from Galway city to Dublin.  If someone is driving from Clifden to Dublin by the time they reach Ballinasloe they have half their journey over.  It is not possible for manufacturers in the west to operate in an equal climate to those on the east coast.  We do not have a suitable infrastructure, neither roads nor an airline network. We have Shannon and Knock airports.  In Galway we have only a small regional airport which cannot take aircraft larger than an 18 seater jet; we are looking at a 55 seater propeller aeroplane that <Col N="928" /> Aer Lingus uses three times a day.  Since they added a third flight into Galway airport the volume of business has increased enormously, particularly by people who travel to Dublin on the 6.15 a.m. flight and return to Galway on the 3 p.m. flight.  The west needs more of this type of initiative. We also need a better airport to service the region.  Some people might say there are enough airports here but as an island on the periphery of Europe air transportation is very important.</P>
    <P>Our rail network needs to be improved.  We particularly need a transportation corridor from Donegal to Cork which services the west.  The current roads infrastructure is not good enough. Our telecommunications is not good enough. Telecom Éireann continually invests in this area but we still need better telecommunication services. There is no reason the west cannot become a home-based industry where people use ISDN lines and modern communications systems and computers to enable them to work for the rest of the country, Europe or the world.  In order to do this we need an immediate investment in those types of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Our ports also need to be looked at.  Again, Ireland is an island on the periphery of Europe. Another Member already mentioned that we have no land bridge to Europe.  The west in particular &mdash; a region on the periphery of this island on the periphery of Europe &mdash; is a special case which must be emphasised at all levels, national and EU.  The case for Objective One status for the west cannot be argued about.</P>
    <P>In terms of our national secondary roads I wish to refer to the N84 which services Headford and Galway.  In 1998 the National Roads Authority allocated £200,000 for improvements to that road. That amount does not even cover the necessary laying of tarmacadam on one tiny section of it to maintain its current standard.  There are dangerous bends on this road.  People are commuting to Galway on journeys lasting 30 minutes to an hour and these roads are unsuitable for the current level and type of traffic.  If a person uses the national primary road from Galway to Dublin early in the morning or late at night it will take three and a half hours.  It takes much longer if you have to travel during the middle of the day.</P>
    <P>We must continue to attract jobs to the west, otherwise we will witness rural depopulation. People will leave the areas they grew up in and move to towns, particularly those on the eastern side of the country which are already overpopulated. We must survive rural depopulation.  We must provide people with facilities and jobs to enable them to remain in the areas in which they were brought up.  There must be sustainable development.  If we do not invest in the west, in its infrastructure, and we do not have the assistance of Objective One and the percentage of funds being provided for the west, we will not be able to survive.  I do not want to live in a country where the markets, jobs and economic prosperity are based in one area.  We need to ensure this <Col N="929" /> does not happen.  I appeal to the Minister when he and his Department are fighting to secure the best deal for Ireland &mdash; and I have no doubt that they will do that &mdash; that, while there is no hope of getting Objective One status for the entire country, they should not forget the west.  The west needs the money and the investment.  There is no argument as to what we can do for the rest of the country if we get our fair share of funds.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I am delighted the Government tabled this motion as it is important we have a full public debate on the entire details surrounding our EU membership. The EU was previously referred to as the EC.  We have been members of the EU for the past 25 years.  We have benefited greatly from this association and we must now examine our future within the EU.  Many people feel we are in a position to be net contributors rather than net beneficiaries. We must outline in detail how much EU funding each county has received.  The sooner this is done the sooner we will have a realistic view of our current situation.</P>
      <P>It is claimed that only 8 per cent of Structural and Cohesion Funds have been invested in the west and that the overwhelming majority of money has been invested in the east.  I want exact details of the breakdown because we should strive towards natural justice, fair play and equality.  If a clear picture emerges that there is a serious imbalance, as I believe to be the case, the matter must be urgently redressed.  The Government and the EU must take a proactive and positive approach.</P>
      <P>Various EU Commissioners visited Ireland over the years.  On occasions western counties felt privileged that a Commissioner was brought by the Government of the day to visit them. However, people in the counties may not have recognised that Commissioners were brought there to show a particularly disadvantaged picture, but it was not necessarily the case that the money allocated was spent in the most seriously disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>Between now and the conclusion of the debate next week, I want the Minister to address a number of specific questions in relation to the amount of EU funding allocated to Ireland since 1990 and how much each Department has spent in every county.  Given the availability of modern technology, this information should be readily available on a county by county basis.  This debate cannot be conducted fairly unless the details of <i>per capita</i> income in each county and the source of funding, whether from direct employment or community or social welfare payments, are made available.  Proper figures are needed to ensure that a fair case can be made to Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economy is booming but the Celtic tiger has not benefited all sections of society.  Action needs to be taken in these areas to ensure there is natural justice and equality, particularly regarding <Col N="930" /> investment in employment.  There are many unemployment blackspots throughout the country, including parts of Dublin where there are massive contrasts between rich and poor areas. This position needs to be redressed.  There is also a vast gap in terms of the west versus the east regarding standards of living, employment opportunities and ancillary services which need to be put in place.</P>
    <P>Regarding the investment of Structural Funds, the national primary road network in the east has been dramatically developed in stark contrast to the network along the west coast.  This aspect needs to be redressed.  The position regarding national secondary routes in the west is a total disaster.  If an industrialist who wishes to invest in an area travels on some of the national secondary routes, he or she automatically decides that they will not invest in the area because the roads are so bad.  Substantial investment in national secondary roads is required.</P>
    <P>A matter which does not receive much attention is the large extent of coastal erosion round the country.  In 1994, the then Government made a submission to Europe for Structural Funds to address this area.  This matter, which is a real problem in every coastal county, was not included in the original submissions.  An assessment was carried out a number of years ago but the amount of money allocated would not even have dealt with the problems in one county.  This issue must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There is an international airport in County Clare but it has been downgraded by the removal of its trans-Atlantic status.  From figures which emerged recently, there is no comparison between it and Dublin and Cork Airports in terms of the level of traffic and development. Shannon Airport is not at the races.  The Government must consider investment in this area.  I urge the Minister to take these matters into account when he is preparing the case for Objective One status.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate specific answers from the Minister.  The debate will not be successful unless specific details are provided.  A proper case and proper judgments can only be made on the basis of this information.  I hope the end result will be that the best case possible for the entire country will be put forward.  There is a case to be made for regionalisation because some areas deserve Objective One status.  This has been done in other countries, such as Italy and England.  If the Government is consistent and positive in terms of adopting that approach, I am sure it can be implemented successfully in Ireland also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for tabling this important motion and the quality of their contributions. I will try to respond to some of the issues raised and also set out the Government's approach to this important matter in terms of Ireland's interests in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="931" /> Between 1989 and the end of the current programme in 1999, Ireland will have received approximately £9 billion in Structural and Cohesion Funds.  This has helped co-finance an investment programme of approximately £18 billion.  Structural and Cohesion Fund transfers have, therefore, played an important role in Ireland's economic transformation over the past decade.  They have enabled us to pursue our infrastructural development programme, tackle urban and rural deprivation and to facilitate major investment in key sectors such as indigenous industry and tourism.</P>
    <P>By any standard, Ireland has made excellent use of Structural and Cohesion Funds.  Combined with other factors, they have delivered the excellent economic position which Ireland enjoys at present.  As a result, Ireland is no longer a region lagging behind economically but one which is fast approaching the European average in terms of wealth <i>per capita.</i>  It is against this background that we face into preparations for the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>In the context of the motion, we must be precise about what we mean when we discuss regions which meet certain criteria.  We must be clear about what is and what is not available to us in the next round of Structural Funding.  In addition, we must be clear that what we seek in the negotiations is in the best interests of the economy as a whole with which all our futures are bound up. I stress that the best solution is one in which there is no divisiveness or regional discrimination. Many Senators who represent different regions referred to this aspect.</P>
    <P>Ireland as a whole is currently treated for Structural Fund purposes as a single region under Objective One which channels Community support to the most disadvantaged regions of the Union that are lagging behind economically.  The criterion for this eligibility is a <i>per capita</i> income in GDP terms of below 75 per cent of the Community average.  Ireland's GDP <i>per capita</i> now well exceeds this figure.  Therefore, as a region and member state it no longer qualifies for Objective One status.  This is the first truth which must be recognised.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle and others made the point that there is a larger gap in Ireland compared to most of our European colleagues in terms of GDP and GNP.  However, the criterion used in the last round was GDP.  We cannot expect this to be changed suddenly to suit Ireland.  Nonetheless, we have explained and will continue to emphasise to the Commission and other member states that the GDP figure may overstate our prosperity, especially compared to our GNP.  We expect and hope that the difference between the two figures will be taken into account when the final approach to the criteria for allocations after 1999 are considered.  If it were the case that strict eligibility had to be applied, Ireland as a single region under the relevant regional statistical map of <Col N="932" /> Europe &mdash; which comprises over 2,000 regions across Europe &mdash; would not qualify for Objective One status and would have to settle for much lower levels of transfers from the outset.  The European Commission in its Agenda 2000 proposals recognised it would be undesirable for a region which had been receiving assistance to be suddenly cut off from it.  This would create a shock to the economy which could threaten progress already made.  Therefore &mdash; and the Government had been lobbying for this &mdash; some arrangement was essential to avoid such an economic shock.</P>
    <P>In Agenda 2000, the Commission proposed that regions like Ireland who were &ldquo;graduating&rdquo;, so to speak, from Objective One status would be given transition status.  I will explain what this means in practical terms.  For the first two years of the next round of funding the whole country will enjoy full Objective One status, even if this will not be as generous as in the last round.  It is important that we appreciate this.  From then on there will be a gradual reduction in support levels until, by 2006, the lower Objective Two levels of funding will be reached.  This is the Commission's proposal and we must see what can be done to improve it.  This is what the coming negotiations will be about.</P>
    <P>This idea of transition has been designed by the Commission to ease the way out of full Objective One status.  In the Council of Ministers where the proposals have yet to be agreed there will be some who feel that this treatment is too generous. We must also recognise we cannot expect, on whatever basis the next round of Structural Funds is established, to do as well in money terms as in the last round.  I think everyone in the Chamber recognises that fact.</P>
    <P>Qualifying for Objective One is only part of the story.  A region must also have the population numbers, low prosperity measured according to GDP and GNP, and high unemployment figures to justify its share of funding.  Even if all of Ireland was to qualify for Objective One status under the next round the effect of these factors would be to reduce our share <i>vis-à-vis</i> the current round.  This reduction could be higher given the inevitable fact that either all or most of Ireland will be in transition under the next round.</P>
    <P>Turning to regionalisation, which got much mention this evening, the Government is conscious that the prosperity which has been achieved has not applied uniformly throughout the country and it is committed to addressing this problem.  Undoubtedly certain subregions of Ireland &mdash; I call them subregions to distinguish them from regions for Objective One purposes &mdash; have not done as well as the rest of the country in terms of indicators applying at the more localised level.  In particular, the subregions of the Border counties, the west and the midlands currently have a <i>per capita</i> GDP of less than 75 per cent of the EU average and are likely to be below that level for the reference period to be used for the <Col N="933" /> next round.  In this context one possible approach, as implied in the motion before this House, to address the development requirements of those parts of Ireland would be to adopt a regionalisation approach to the next round of structural unding.  Under such an approach, the existing single region of Ireland would be reconstituted as two regions, of which one could consist of those parts of the country whose <i>per capita</i> GDP is below 75 per cent of the EU average.  If such an approach were put in place, that region would qualify for full Objective One status, while the rest of the country would be a transition region covered by Objective One but on a diminishing scale.</P>
    <P>I emphasise in the strongest possible way that we cannot unilaterally adopt a regionalisation approach.  In the first instance, the proposal for new regions would have to be put to Eurostat, the Commission's statistical service, whose approval on statistical and other grounds would be necessary.  It would then be for the European Commission as a whole to decide.  Indications to date as to the likely response to this option are not positive.  In particular, Commissioner Wulf-Mathies has made clear she could not support proposals to change the current regional map basis for Objective One status which were not adequately based in terms of regional administration. In addition, the Commission fears the precedent effect of such a proposal.  If Ireland and other countries were to opt for this approach on the basis that it would increase their share of Structural Funds, the Commission's overall strategy for the next round &mdash; that is, concentrating aid in the poorest regions of the EU &mdash; would be undermined.  It should be recalled that there are regions in Europe with a GDP <i>per capita</i> well below that of the west, Border counties and the midlands and the Commission will undoubtedly be opposed to transferring funds earmarked for poorer regions to more wealthy regions.</P>
    <P>However, I reiterate the Government's commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium to those regions of the country which are lagging behind.  I assure Senators that the Government has not ruled out pursuit of a regionalisation approach.  The matter is receiving detailed consideration and has been raised with the Commission at political and official levels.  A decision on the issue will be made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Whether Ireland remains as a single region in transition or is split into two regions, the Government will ensure that the ensuing national plan is attentive to the needs of our poorer regions.  The Department of Finance has already started preparations for the next national plan and has invited submissions from all regional authorities including those for the west, the midlands and the Border counties.  I urge those authorities to submit well argued investment priorities for consideration in the context of the next plan.  Whether we opt for the single region or regionalisation route <Col N="934" /> the key must be that we are positioned to make good use of the funds, especially against the background of a drop in EU transfers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>This topic is particularly important to those parts of Ireland mentioned in the motion.  I welcome the Minister's recognition that Objective One status has not benefited certain regions, according to indicators applying at a more localised level, because that is definitely the case in the west, the Border counties and my own region, the midlands.  I am a member of Westmeath County Council.  Twenty years ago the county had a five seat constituency, 15 years ago it was reduced to a four seater and it is now a three seater.  That shows the decline of population in rural Ireland, especially the midlands, west and Border counties.</P>
      <P>Commissioners who decide how best to help Ireland will know that Europe has made a tremendous contribution in the last ten years &mdash; it has transformed our infrastructure on many fronts, including roads and sewerage.  However, the job is only half done.  The Irish people have responded well and made great progress.  Irish Governments have also contributed in this period, especially Mr. Haughey's Government of 1987 which reached agreement with the trade unions, farmers and employers.  That put Ireland on a sound footing as a progressive economy playing its part in Europe.</P>
      <P>Our great asset is our young people, but we do not want to see them going to school and then having to move into the bigger towns and cities.  Longford has received special derogation in the upper Shannon region and it should be congratulated on a job well done.  I know a former Taoiseach and many Deputies in the midlands, Roscommon, Cavan, Leitrim and Sligo will be pleased. However, unless north Westmeath, the area I represent, maintains Objective One status it has no chance of getting investment to help or improve the area.  The parish of Coole has lost 26 per cent of its population and the parish of Castletown-Finnea has lost 31 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quoted these figures previously in the House and received support from Senator Joe O'Toole, who is familiar with the area.  Many Senators have made a case for the west of Ireland, but the Bog of Allen covers most of the midlands.  Much of it is bogland owned by Bord na Móna or old forestry land.  It is poor land and only a small portion of it has been known in folklore as &ldquo;beef to the heel of the Mullingar heifer.&rdquo; 92 per cent of north Westmeath is severely disadvantaged but it never falls into a category where it can be assisted in job creation, population retention or area improvement.  The people of the area are hard working and have contributed a great deal to the economy throughout their lives.  They created Bord na Móna in 1946 and gave it everything they had, but the company has left and there is no <Col N="935" /> opportunity for employment unless tax incentives are given to manufacturers to set up industry.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister on behalf of the people of north Westmeath and the Coole electoral area in particular, whom I have been fortunate to represent.  Ultimately, it is shameful to see a 10 per cent decrease in population during one's tenure as a public representative.  The Cathaoirleach will concur with this because Strokestown is no different to Castlepollard. Serious issues are being addressed and sustaining a population in rural Ireland is a must.  We must maintain our values, the love of our national games and, in the words of Patrick Farrell, &ldquo;Where is the one who does not love the land where they were born.&rdquo; No one likes to go into built up areas in large towns and cities.  North Westmeath is the beautiful lakes district of the midlands.  It is sheer bad luck, based on the breakdown of the country by all Governments, that incentives for investment have not been provided there as they have been in many other areas.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see any more schools or churches close in the area.  I read about the Celtic tiger and am aware of all the good it has brought and the increased employment in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and other major towns and cities. We have seen the success of urban renewal. It has been magnificent and has enhanced derelict areas in large towns and cities beyond our wildest dreams.  In 1987 the most popular area in Europe for filming pre-war movies was from the Aisling Hotel to O'Connell Street in Dublin.  A new building had not been constructed along that stretch in over 40 years.  As a result of urban renewal, almost every building along that stretch of the quays is new.  I congratulate all Ministers for the Environment, Taoisigh and Governments who made that happen.</P>
    <P>Rural renewal is non-existent in the midlands, the west and the Border counties.  If this Government under a dynamic, young Taoiseach is really interested in rural renewal I challenge them to show the people they are by putting the Department with responsibility for it into an area that is deprived and where the problem is understood best.  Sub-offices of the Department were sited in many towns, but Mullingar and other towns in north Westmeath got nothing.  I make a plea for fair play on behalf of the people of north Westmeath, who richly deserve it, and I am proud that I am the representative to make that plea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Cassidy stole my speech. I support the motion and welcome the Minister to the House.  His contribution documented well the Government's current position and the direction in which it may go in future.  It is not right to draw lines through the country.  We need to drift away from the term &ldquo;Objective One status&rdquo; and have proper, professional studies conducted in urban and rural areas to examine where poverty <Col N="936" /> and deprivation exists.  Then we might produce a plan best suited to the country.</P>
      <P>Since 1990 money has been well spent, but the gravitation of people from rural Ireland to centres of population has not benefited the country, even in wealthier areas, such as along the east coast.  If we are to maintain a balanced population it is necessary to recognise the need for rural renewal and to achieve that result.  The Minister needs to have the country examined professionally in terms of income and development potential. Investment in the past was good for Dublin, as Senator Cassidy said, but perhaps it was too good because it may have robbed the south, the west and the south-west of its people.  A balance is needed, and when a new plan is drafted a system should be devised which would allow Dublin and the east coast, the wealthier part of the country, to grow at its natural rate and invest accordingly.</P>
      <P>As for the other regions &mdash; the motion is concerned with the west, the north-west, the Border counties and the midlands &mdash; a study was carried out in northwest Cork by University College Cork and supported by Cork County Council which showed that the region was the most impoverished in the country.  The same could be said for the furthest regions of west Cork and I am sure the same could be said for parts of other counties.  There are parts of Dublin, Cork and other cities which are similar.</P>
      <P>If something is to be done, if people are to be helped and if there is to be balance and common sense, a proper study must be conducted so that funding can be applied to the most deserving regions.  I am not interested in whether it is called Objective One status or transitional status.  We should plan for the whole country, concentrating on the regions most in need and on the regions which can support themselves.  The opportunity should be given to all.  Since 1990 we have received FEOGA grants and Structural and Cohesion Funds.  They have been of assistance, and reference was made earlier to Munster, which did well from them as it had an agricultural base. However, as I pointed out, there are parts of Munster and my county which are badly deprived.  I compliment the people of the west for examining their situation, discussing it and for coming together in a cohesive manner to project their requirements.  There are other equally deprived areas and that is the case I make.  If there were a plan for the country which would lend itself to the development of all the people, we would be on the right road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will leave the House with the names of different parts of the country ringing in his ears as there has been something akin to a tour of Ireland during this debate.  That is appropriate because it is obvious from the debate, and the Minister will be the first to acknowledge it, that there are areas of the country which are severely socially and economically <Col N="937" /> disadvantaged.  There are grave disparities within the nation.  The Minister stated that there is general recognition that areas of the country and aspects of the economy are severely deficient. The most important part of the Minister's speech related to the realities facing this country as it struggles to convince Europe that it needs a continuation of funding under Objective One status. The Minister stated that we must recognise that we cannot expect to do as well financially as in the last round, whatever the grounds on which the next round of Structural Funds is based.  We must start from that premise.  I compliment the Government on its obvious determination to ensure throughout the transitional phase that Ireland gets as large a share of the loot as is going.</P>
      <P>While I support the motion &mdash; coming from County Leitrim, I could not do otherwise &mdash; it occurs to me that we sometimes have a narrow view of the world outside.  Expansion is occurring at an accelerated pace within Europe.  The countries which will join the European Union after 2002 have a GDP well below ours.  They are post Communist countries struggling to rebuild their economies and Ireland is to the forefront in supporting their entry into the EU.  If we are the pacemakers in terms of what Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds have achieved over the past 20 years, it is not surprising that the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovenia are seeking Structural Funds to improve their economies.  This will ultimately create a greater consumer base which will help our economy, which is open and export-led, to sell more of its goods and services.  There is a downside and an upside.</P>
      <P>A trend running through debates on this matter is the sense of anger and frustration felt in the areas seeking to retain Objective One status.  The anger is because they believe that since Structural Funds first became available to the country, successive Governments have tended to support one side of the economy.  The perception is that if one lives on the east coast, from Louth to Wexford, one has gained, be it the development of the DART, the arterial road system around Dublin or the creation of jobs and the consequent infrastructure from the industries which have set up. The frustration is that we now seem to be moving towards a phased reduction in funding from Europe in the very areas in the west and other disadvantaged areas, such as those in the midlands to which the Leader referred, which need assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When people are asked what is meant by Objective One status or what it is they most wish to have for their areas, they will say they want better roads and a better transport system.  They would like more access to buses and rail transport and an upgrading and improvement of the latter. They would also like better water and sewerage facilities so that they can continue to build and live in the areas, towns and villages in which they grew up or to which they have returned after emigrating. <Col N="938" /> That is what Objective One status is about.  People in the agricultural economy will say that they want most of all to be able to stay on the family farm, small and unviable as it may be, to raise their children in relative prosperity and to give them access to educational and other facilities available in cities and towns.  They are the priorities of people when they talk of Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The Government is preparing us for a phasing out of the high levels of European funding which we have enjoyed over the past ten years in the two operational programmes, 1989-94 and 1994-9. There are certain pointers in that direction &mdash; for example, the recent decision of the Government to go in the direction of privatisation.  I welcome that and believe we should have grasped the nettle of privatisation of public utilities a long time ago.  It is the way forward for us.  The Government's actions and the response of work-forces, especially that in Telecom Éireann, is an indication of the new climate of acceptance in the area.  While it is a debate for another day, it is obvious privatisation will generate significant sums of money for the Irish Exchequer.  It is also obvious that this new money will help finance large public projects, such as the Luas and other major transport infrastructural programmes.  That is welcome.</P>
    <P>In the context of European funding, we in the west have not always gained from the criteria and parameters laid down by Europe on co-financing. For example, in the case of the <i>cause céle bre,</i> the Dublin-Sligo railway line, the result of the cost benefit analysis operated as a criteria by the European Commission was that only the Dublin-Mullingar section of the line was eligible for co-financing. Consequently, any further upgrading or improvement of the line from Mullingar to Sligo or for the Galway line, the Westport line or other lines to the west, must be met from Government resources.  Whither Europe in that regard? In the funding provided by other programmes for other measures in the transport area, cost benefit analysis again seems to rule the roost.  I believe that, based on the Minister's confident assertion, there is a recognition of the needs of the areas we are discussing and that the Government, pushed by lobbyists like ourselves, will move towards tackling the disparities which exist.</P>
    <P>The invitation the Minister has extended to the regional authorities, in the context of the development of the new national plan, is to be welcomed and should be acted upon.  May I sound one word of caution.  Some of us remember, in the pre-1989 situation, the very same invitation being extended to the subregions to prioritise their investment projects and many of those projects are still gathering dust in the Minister's office.  We have been down that road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and I ask the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation to provide the necessary funds to the convent school, Roscommon town, for the refurbishment of its multi-purpose hall which is community based.</P>
      <P>The multi-purpose hall which is available to the Convent of Mercy secondary school and the general public in the town has a floor area of almost 8,000 square feet.  It is a vital part of the infrastructure of Roscommon town which has a population of approximately 5,000.  The school is attended by 1,200 students and many people from the mid-Roscommon catchment area use the facility.  The hall has been in existence 24 years and has deteriorated to the extent that the floor is no longer safe for use by the pupils or public.</P>
      <P>I have an engineer's report which states that the hall has a timber floor consisting of sheets placed on batons and covered with vinyl tiles.  The floor area is 7,800 square feet and there is evidence that almost every area of the sheeting has failed.  The rows of batons are beginning to come through and are causing ridges on the floor.  The condition can only get worse and the floor has become dangerous to use.  In one or two areas there is a definite failure with only the tiles keeping the floor intact.  The vinyl tiles have also lifted in some areas and have been nailed down.  This is also potentially dangerous and could cause injury.</P>
      <P>The engineer recommends that the entire floor be removed as no remedial action can save it.  It should be replaced with a maple floor which should not be covered.  Such a floor would last up to 100 years.  I have investigated the cost of such a floor.  This was estimated in 1996 to be £32,000. The price will have increased in the meantime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facility is of vital importance to the convent secondary school and a total of 15 clubs in the town use it.  It is used by Roscommon Town Soccer Club, Roscommon Town Athletic Club, many indoor football clubs including the Garda Indoor Football Club, Roscommon Town Community Games, Creggs Rugby Club, Cherry House and other mentally handicapped groups, Roscommon Christian Brothers School, Roscommon Basketball Club, Roscommon Youth Club, the Irish Wheelchair Association, Roscommon Ladies Hockey Club, Roscommon Tennis Club, <Col N="940" /> all the primary schools in Roscommon town and all the badminton clubs.  That list shows that this is not simply a school hall.  It is a vital part of the infrastructure and recreational life of the town and its catchment area.  This facility is most important for Roscommon and the surrounding area.</P>
    <P>The application for the last round of lottery funding was not successful.  It is hoped that on this occasion the Minister will be in a position to grant aid this very worthwhile development.  The proposal is to replace the existing floor at an approximate cost of £32,000.  It is proposed to upgrade the existing shower and toilet area at a cost of approximately £6,000.  More funds can be raised and £3,000 is already on account.  A grant of £30,000 is sought from the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation.  No other facility in County Roscommon impacts more on young and old as the multi-purpose hall on the Sisters of Mercy grounds in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I recommend the project wholeheartedly.  I believe a positive response from the Minister will be greeted with glee and thanks by the second level schools and the public in Roscommon.  I know there are many demands on the Department and I know the Minister is totally supportive of sports and recreation facilities.  I believe that, as a north-west of Ireland man, the Minister appreciates the severe lack of opportunities for infrastructural development in our areas.  We depend to a great extent on sport and recreation. The hall was provided at no cost to the State and the opportunity now presents itself to the State to come to the assistance of the town of Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I recommend this worthwhile project and I hope that, having listened attentively and investigated the matter thoroughly, the Minister will, at a suitable opportunity, make an announcement of a substantial grant for this excellent and much needed facility in the town of Roscommon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation (Dr. McDaid)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for putting forward an excellent case for this project.  If he will bear with me I would like to outline some of the difficulties I am encountering at the moment before I deal with the specific matter under discussion this evening.</P>
      <P>Sport has come to occupy an increasingly significant place in modern life worldwide.  Its impact extends far beyond the playing pitches and athletic grounds.  It has obvious benefits in promoting health and fitness and has a growing commercial and economic significance.  Sporting achievements provide a morale boost for the country, focus international attention on our country and promote our image as an attractive place to visit and to invest in.  Our high achievers in sport are excellent ambassadors for modern Ireland, typifying the self-confidence and commitment of today's generation of young Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> In line with the Government's recognition of the value of sport and leisure in the physical and mental health of each individual, especially in the role they play in fostering a sense of community identity even in the most deprived areas, I have set goals for my Department.  They are to formulate and oversee the implementation of policies for the promotion and development of sport and to encourage increased participation in sport and recreation particularly by disadvantaged communities. To achieve these goals I have set a number of key objectives: to develop a new policy framework for the promotion and development of sport and recreation, to promote a more strategic approach &mdash; and I emphasise this &mdash; to the use of available resources for sport and recreation in a sector driven mainly by voluntary effort, to develop a new holistic system of supports for high performance athletes,. . to help overcome the isolating effect of social exclusion in disadvantaged areas by developing appropriate sport and recreational strategies for those areas and to encourage the promotion of standards of good conduct and fair play in sport.</P>
    <P>With regard to funding, I am pleased to state that I have secured a doubling of Government funding for sport, from £13 million in 1997 to £26 million this year.  As the first Minister with responsibility for sport I am proud that this is the biggest annual budget allocated by a Government to assist development in sport.</P>
    <P>The recreational facilities scheme assists voluntary and community organisations, such as that mentioned by the Senator, in the provision of improvements to and the equipping of recreational, leisure and community facilities.  There is a provision of £9 million in this year's Estimate for my Department for grant expenditure under the sports capital programme, compared to £5 million provided in 1997.  However, at the end of 1997 overall capital commitments outstanding under the programme amounted to £15.7 million to be met in 1998 and subsequent years on the satisfactory completion of projects in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme. In addition, there were 1,400 grant applications on hand on which a decision, even with regard to matters such as eligibility, had not been given, some of them dating back to 1994.</P>
    <P>Against this background I considered it an urgent priority that following the 1998 round of allocations a totally new review of the sports capital programme should be undertaken.  I announced that 11 February 1998 would be the closing date for the receipt of applications under the existing sports capital programme.  All applications on hand, including those received up to that date, were examined in the context of the 1998 round of grant allocations.  Over 1,400 applications from sports clubs and organisations around the country were examined and assessed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> The application for funding from the board of management of the convent secondary school in Roscommon town, submitted in December 1997, was considered in the context of the old criteria. The school applied for a grant of £30,000 towards the cost of replacing the existing floor of the school gymnasium and upgrading the changing rooms and shower area.  The estimated total cost of the project was £38,000.  Having completed the examination of applications it was not possible on this occasion to include the school for grant assistance for 1998.  The school has been advised that it is not among the successful projects and it has also been advised that those who are unsuccessful must reapply under the new scheme to be introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>The review of the sports capital programme will involve the examination of the objectives, terms of reference and criteria for the schemes and will have regard for the emphasis in &ldquo;An Action Programme for the Millennium&rdquo; on the role of sports and recreation in combating disadvantage. I expect the review to be completed later this year and when it has been details of the revised schemes will be widely publicised.  It will then be open to clubs and organisations to apply for funding under the new schemes.</P>
    <P>From the details Senator Finneran has given it would appear the case is ideal for consideration, particularly as it is in an area in the west.  The Senator has outlined that there are a number of clubs involved and that there is a wide catchment area, criteria which will be envisaged in the new schemes.  I think this project will be ideal for consideration under the new schemes.  I am sure the Senator will follow up on this project and will bring it to my attention again.  It is the type of project which I would like to see carried out in rural areas and towns because it involves bringing together many facilities.  I would be hopeful for the project in the autumn.  I ask the Senator to ensure that the board of management has outlined the scheme in detail to the Department of Education and Science, where there may be an overlap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment Turlough Park House project which has been ongoing for a number of years and I thank the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands for endorsing the decision made by the previous Government on the project.  The project will be important to the economy of Castlebar and County Mayo.  The House discussed the <Col N="943" /> future of Objective One status for the poorer regions earlier tonight and it is fitting that this project should be discussed.</P>
      <P>The Turlough Park House project will house the national Folklife collection.  Much of this originated in the west and it is fitting that the project should be sited in County Mayo.  I thank Mayo County Council for its co-operation in acquiring the site for the project.  The foresight of the county manager and the members of the county council led them to purchase the Georgian house and a considerable amount of land for this worthy project.  I also acknowledge the contribution made by the previous Minister with responsibility for Tourism, Deputy Kenny, to securing the project and driving it forward.</P>
      <P>There is a great need for a local sewerage scheme for Turlough, which is adjacent to the house.  The Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, should contact the Department of the Environment and Local Government to seek such scheme.  Approval in principle has been given and it is important that the scheme would go ahead.  I invite the Minister and the Minister of State to visit County Mayo to see the plans for the project, including the gardens which are to be renovated.</P>
      <P>This is a flagship project for Mayo County Council, put in place under the initiative of the county manager who has been working at this project for many years.  It is only in the last few years that the project has been firmly put in place. I would like the Minister of State to outline the plans for the project.  I congratulate the Minister herself for endorsing the decision of the previous Government.  It is important that this project proceed with haste because it will bring 200,000 visitors to the region annually.  The area could do with a major project of this nature and I appeal to the Minister of State to push the project.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh as ucht an cheist seo a chur síos sa Seanad.  Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh don Seanadóir as ucht an cuireadh dul ar chuairt don láthair seo.  Mar is eol dó, táim féin i mo chónaí níos gaire do Chois Fharraige ná do Chathair na Gaillimhe féin agus tá eolas maith agam ar an gceantar.  Ní amháin go bhfuil spéis agamsa sa cheantar, tá spéis ag an Aire féin ann.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded by this motion to outline the current position regarding the Turlough Park House project.  As Members will be aware, the Government has approved plans to develop Turlough Park House and surroundings to establish a new facility for the folklife collection of the National Museum of Ireland in co-operation with Mayo County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total capital cost of this facility is estimated at £8.53 million.  Of this sum, the Government agreed that £5 million will be provided by the <Col N="944" /> Exchequer through the Vote of the Office of Public Works.  This will be eligible for co-financing at a 75 per cent aid rate under the EU Structural Funds Operational Programme for Tourism Development, 1994-1999 from funds allocated to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The balance of the cost comprises the Mayo County Council input, including the provision of the site itself, associated siteworks, plus a financial contribution, together with architectural and project services management provided in-house by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>The decision to locate this collection to a specific home was not a spontaneous or sudden idea. It has long been acknowledged that the facilities for the National Museum of Ireland, including the Folklife collection, were seriously under-resourced. Much of the National Museum's Folklife collection, comprising approximately 45,000 artefacts, had remained in storage at the former Daingean Reformatory in County Offaly as well as at other locations such as the museum's premises at Merrion Row, Dublin, for many years due to a severe shortage of exhibition space.  Most of this material has remained uncatalogued and unseen to date by the general public.  This important material contains numerous artifacts exemplifying rural life and traditions, including many professions and trades.  As such they will be of enormous interest to students, historians and the general public as well as visiting tourists when they are finally put on display in an appropriate setting by the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The proposal for a National Museum Folklife Facility at Turlough Park House arose therefore in the context of the search for a suitable location for the Folklife collection over a number of years. In 1992 a museum working group had recommended that priority should be given to building a National Folklife Museum, a recommendation that predated the Collins Barracks development. A total of five non-Dublin sites were considered by the group, which recommended that Turlough Park House should be the location for such a facility.  Mayo County Council had expressed a very earnest interest in the idea of the development of a folklife facility at this site for the National Museum of Ireland.  When the county council signalled its commitment to support the project, approval was given by the Department of Finance in the latter part of 1997 to proceed.</P>
    <P>A steering group has been established, chaired by my Department, and comprising representatives of the Office of Public Works, the National Museum, Mayo County Council, and the Department of Finance to supervise the progress of the project.  The Office of Public Works, as agent for my Department and the National Museum, is responsible for the management of the project, including the necessary legal, property and construction aspects of the development.  In this regard I understand that negotiations are proceeding satisfactorily with the county council regarding the terms of a lease to be executed <Col N="945" /> relating to part of the Turlough Park House demesne.</P>
    <P>The functional brief and exhibition documents for the proposed new Museum are being prepared by a firm of prestigious international museum consultants, Messrs.  Sears and Russell of Toronto, Canada.  These are at an advanced stage of preparation and will inform the overall strategy to be adopted for this facility.  As part of this process, an outline design has already been approved by the Museum.  The Office of Public Works is now preparing the necessary documentation in order to apply for planning permission for the proposed works.  Some pre-planning discussions have taken place already between the relevant parties.  It is envisaged the planning application will be lodged within the next three months.  Providing this permission is obtained, the schedule should see work commence on site at the beginning of 1999 and be completed by the end of that year.  The facility will then be fitted out for exhibition purposes and should be open to the public in the first half of the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The recent approval of the appointment of a project manager to oversee the work on behalf of the National Museum is an indication of the level of commitment and seriousness with which the Government views this project.  Applications for this post will be invited shortly in the National Museum.</P>
    <P>The provision of this facility will without doubt require extra resources in staffing and financial terms.  These issues are being addressed in the context of the normal multi-annual budgetary and annual estimates exercises and the museum will be making provision for them in their estimates request.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we discuss this topic today.  I am sure many Members would have been interested in the recent television series broadcast by RTÉ entitled <i>Hidden Treasures,</i> produced in association with the National Museum, which dealt specifically with many of the artifacts contained in this collection.  These programmes demonstrated once again, as if it were necessary, the inseparable nature of our heritage, and reminded us of the heritage which must be preserved.  What we have to remember is that many of the trades and practices shown on these films, based on material in the collection are in a large degree still within living memory, but that for the next generation they will be consigned to history.  It is therefore essential that we secure them for our future.</P>
    <P>The plans which the National Museum of Ireland have for this facility will be the starting point of this preservation.  To have it located in a western rural setting serves to underpin its connections with its origins, much of the collection being rooted in the agricultural sphere.  However, there are other benefits to be gained for this location in addition to the preservation of the valuable national asset encompassed in the collection. <Col N="946" /> There will be an enhanced access to cultural heritage and obvious educational benefits. More significantly, economic and regional developments will accrue, principally through the attractiveness of the new facility to tourists.</P>
    <P>The project is expected to generate significant economic benefits primarily by providing a flagship visitor location.  The strategic position of Turlough Park House will facilitate the development of links with many existing cultural and heritage attractions within the county and will help increase the tourism impact in the west of Ireland.  The significant capital and current funding which Mayo County Council is prepared to provide is demonstrable evidence of the tangible economic benefits expected to be provided for the area.</P>
    <P>I express my appreciation on behalf of my Department and the National Museum for the high level of commitment and generosity which has been shown by the elected members of Mayo County Council in helping to bring this idea to fruition and for their continuing support for the project.  This development should not be seen in isolation.  Exciting things are happening elsewhere for the National Museum of Ireland.  In the past few weeks we have seen the opening of two new exhibitions by the museum &mdash; one commemorating the expeditions of Tim Severn to the Spice Islands, held in the museum's Kildare Street premises and the second in Collins Barracks prepared jointly with the National Library, commemorating 1798.  The provision of the major new facilities at Collins Barracks has been a significant milestone in the history of the museum.</P>
    <P>Phase 1 of this £30 million development has been opened since last September and has received much deserved praise.  This project, which is also being co-funded from the EU Operational Programme for Tourism, involves the conversion of Europe's oldest continually occupied military facility into a flagship development for the National Museum of Ireland.  When completed, approximately 25,000 square metres in additional floor space will become available thus allowing the museum to provide new vitally needed exhibition spaces, visitor and conservation services as well as proper storage facilities.</P>
    <P>Progress is at an advanced stage of planning for phase two with the recent finalisation of functional and exhibition briefs for the site.  Using the many lessons learned from the implementation of phase one, the museum, together with the Office of Public Works, will now move forward confidently to complete the next phases.  Interesting and innovative features are planned for this site which will produce a cultural entity of which all Irish people will be proud.</P>
    <P>Naturally with the provision of these extra spaces, the museum's premises in Kildare Street will also be able to exploit in a new and real way the potential for displaying its range of antiquities material, much of which has had to be hidden <Col N="947" /> from public display for many years.  I look forward to the revitalisation of this building in the coming months.</P>
    <P>I know that the museum wishes to fulfil its mission of educating, conserving and informing to the best of its abilities and with these new major programmes and with the assistance of the EU funds now available, these aspirations will be on the way to being met.  I know that I speak for all Members when I wish the museum well in its future endeavours on the east and west coasts.</P>
