      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>In view of the large number of factory closures in south Tipperary over the past year, the need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to accept the proposal recently submitted by South Tipperary County Council to include Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir in the order of priority for urban renewal.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to provide additional funding for the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, as the hospital has only one outpatients' clinic per week to cater for hundreds of women from all over Ireland, who then have to queue for hours at a time in order to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2" /> I have also received notice from Senator Costello of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to make available for academic research its files on reformatory and industrial schools 1924-68.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Tom Hayes and O'Meara as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Costello may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we start the Order of Business, on behalf of all Members of this House and on my own behalf and that of the Fianna Fáil Party, I wish to express sympathy to our Taoiseach on the death of his mother.  I wish to pay tribute to Mrs. Julia Ahern who passed away on Monday morning last.  It is particularly sad that her death should occur as the Taoiseach leads his team and joins with other leaders to negotiate an <Col N="3" /> historic agreement to replace an era of dissension and destruction with one of peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>Julia Ahern and her late husband, Con, represented that generation of Irish men and women who bridged the gap between our independence and our emergence as a confident, successful, sovereign member of the European Union.  Not by even the wildest lapses of imagination could these heroes of our early years have foreseen just how successful we as a nation would become.  What they did see and understand was the importance of passing on a set of values to their children and their children's children.  They had a love of learning, strong religious belief, an appreciation of our language, culture and traditions, a burning desire to see all the children of the nation treated equally, a love of the land and landscape, a delight in sporting achievement and a firm belief that by positive political action we can achieve our national objectives.</P>
      <P>That is the legacy they successfully passed on to this generation.  Like many thousands of mothers and fathers of that generation, these two proud people from west Cork raised their family in Dublin and devoted all their lives to the betterment of their children.  The great advances of their family are testament to their efforts and the strength of their beliefs.  Mrs. Julia Ahern took great pride in the achievements of all her children, not least her youngest child, the Taoiseach. She was a warm woman of forthright views who advised her son in moments of great importance in his political life.  Today we salute her for her sacrifice, her commitment and her great spirit which made her so many friends and admirers. We join all our colleagues in offering to her family our deepest condolences at this sad time.  In expressing our profound sorrow at her passing, we reaffirm our commitment to doing for this generation what she and her contemporaries did in their efforts to hand on intact these essential religious and cultural values which inspire our beliefs, and our relentless pursuit of peace on this island.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a hanam.</P>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items 1 and 2, item 1, Report and Final Stages.  The contributions of spokespersons on item 2 should not exceed 20 minutes and those of all other Senators should not exceed 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of my colleagues, I wish to be associated with the expression of sympathy to the Taoiseach on the death of his mother.</P>
      <P>We agree to the Order of Business.  In light of the hoped for conclusion of the Northern Ireland settlement talks on Thursday, the outcome will have to be discussed in the Oireachtas as soon as possible.  Will the Leader ensure, if there is to be a debate in the other House during the week of April 21, there will also be one in this House and the Taoiseach or Minister for Foreign Affairs will attend and report on the agreement? Members will then have an opportunity to debate the issue.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent Members, I extend our condolences to the Taoiseach and his family.</P>
      <P>Three times in recent weeks I have raised the need to have a debate on house prices.  Today's business newspapers hail and congratulate the First National Building Society which will give £1,000 to people who will vote for demutualisation. The last time that type of carry on was seen here was on the Act of Union when people were promised £1,000 to vote in a particular way. There is a great need to discuss this issue even though every politician has had a word to say about the price of houses.  That sum of £1,000 will be paid for by young couples buying homes on the price of their mortgages or by those trying to save a deposit, on a reduction in interest rates.  It is time we got stuck into this issue.  The Government should make every attempt to make tax breaks available to people so that it would be tax efficient to do business with mutual companies. RTÉ should be congratulated for showing the other side of the argument on today's one o'clock news.</P>
      <P>Politicians should have a voice on this.  We are courageous enough to talk about how difficult it is to buy houses but we should now point our fingers at where the problems lie.  Today's announcement will raise the price of houses.  This issue should be debated soon as every week that goes by will be a week too late.  Politicians should not just shed crocodile tears.  I do not blame people for taking the £1,000 offered to them but the other side of the argument should also be put. This £1,000 is nothing to be celebrated as it is a cause of worry for young people trying to buy houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I wish to be associated with the expressions of sympathy to the Taoiseach on the death of his mother, Mrs. Julia Ahern.</P>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the draft proposal by Senator George Mitchell on the peace talks in Northern Ireland.  The House should express its support for all the participants who have stayed in the talks despite the difficulties involved.  We should urge a continuing spirit of generosity as we come to the final stages in making an agreement. It is too terrible to think of what the alternative might be if an agreement is not reached after 30 years of violence, mayhem and murder in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate at an early stage on the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission?  We debated this issue last week and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment indicated during the debate on National Irish Bank that she would be happy to come back into the House to debate this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I would like to be associated with the vote of sympathy to the Taoiseach and his <Col N="5" /> brother, Deputy Noel Ahern, on the death of their mother.  It is our hope and prayer that the Northern Ireland peace talks will conclude successfully this week, that the work of Senator Mitchell and all concerned will be fruitful and that we will have a settlement to which all on the island can subscribe.  It will be important for this House to discuss a settlement when and if it arrives; we will have to do so anyway as the constitutional referendum arising from a settlement will be the subject of debate in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This may be one way of dealing with this issue which the Leader might consider.</P>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for a debate on the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission.  Perhaps we could have such a debate after the recess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardHaughey" hpid="Dr. Haughey Dr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the Leader's words on the untimely death of a great lady, the mother of the Taoiseach and our Leader.  She was a great woman who reared an exemplary family and we now have an exemplary Leader.  Our sympathies go out to her family at this difficult time.</P>
      <P>The current peace process in Northern Ireland is probably unique in the history of this State.  As Front Bench spokesperson on Northern Ireland, I wish Senator Mitchell every success.  I congratulate all those who took part in this difficult and delicate process.  In particular, I congratulate the Taoiseach who has so delicately and skilfully brought the people and the Government to the edge of a settlement to this dreadful situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On numerous occasions I have asked for debates on finance and the sale of State assets, such as the ICC, ACC and TSB.  I have also called for a debate on changes to the structure of local authorities.  I have not had success in either call.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come into the House at the earliest opportunity to discuss the changes in local authorities before he makes any decisions?  I have a document produced by the Department of the Environment and Local Government following a seminar.  The document is called <i>Focus on Strategic Policy Committees</i> and the keynote address was given by Senator Quinn who is not a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot discuss that document.  The Senator is in order to ask for a debate on the matter but not to discuss a particular document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is most important.  I have asked for a debate on numerous occasions.  Local authority members are elected and we are elected to this House by local authority members.  If there are going to be changes in the financing and other structures of local authorities it is only right that we would have a full debate on the matter in this House.  I attended a meeting of Mayo County Council last night and I want to assure the House <Col N="6" /> that members of Mayo County Council are not at all enamoured of the changes which are due to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The views of Mayo County Council members are taken into account when people are being elected to this House.  Prior to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government making any announcement in regard to these changes, I urge the Leader to have a full debate in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past number of weeks, various Members have rightly attacked banking and financial institutions.  However, we should also consider the insurance business in Ireland, in particular life assurance and the pressure which was, and is still being, exerted on people to take out life assurance policies.</P>
      <P>In 1985 I received a letter from the Insurance Corporation of Ireland setting out the projected maturity fund of a policy &mdash; it stood at £159,177; at present the actual maturity fund stands at £47,000.  Had I been foolish enough not to check out the matter, nobody from the ICI would have approached me about it.  The ICI was amalgamated with Prudential Life and was subsequently taken over by the Irish Permanent to become Irish Progressive.  The biggest robbers in the country are people who sell pension policies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>We should hold a debate on the life assurance industry.  A reduced annual pension of £19,388 or a lump sum of £39,000 was offered by the policy to which I referred.  In fact, the reduced annual pension stands at £133 per month, or less than £1,500 per annum, and the tax free lump sum becomes £8,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The life assurance industry is ripping off people who are now approaching old age, who will find themselves without the necessary means for survival and will be unable to obtain medical cards.  The banks have ripped people off to a certain extent but the life assurance industry also has a lot to answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to consider school opening hours?  Anyone driving around Dublin since the schools closed for Easter will have noticed the way traffic has been flowing freely. As all other avenues of easing the traffic problem in the mornings have been exhausted, perhaps the Minister could do something to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I drive into the city from the southside and normally experience bottlenecks but traffic has been flowing freely there for the past couple of days. The Minister should consider delaying school opening hours by one hour while people travel to work.  I do not think this would adversely affect children's education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order to discuss the Dublin traffic on the Order of Business. There are other ways the Senator can raise these matters.  I recognise this is important and that is why I am suggesting it might be a suitable matter for a motion or an Adjournment debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking the Leader to ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid there is very little Easter spirit about today.  I support Senator O'Meara's motion on the Adjournment.  At St. Vincent's Hospital women congregate as early as 7 a.m. to await the opening of the clinic at 9 a.m.</P>
      <P>The Leader promised the full support of his side of the House when the child pornography Bill comes to the House.  I note that the Bill contains no reference to what is known as &ldquo;aural sex&rdquo;, the abuse of children on the telephone.  The Minister has mentioned the question of pornography on the Internet.  Will the Leader ensure that my amendment relating to this salacious practice is supported?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the expressions of sympathy extended to the Taoiseach and the members of the Ahern family on the death of their mother.  Coming from west Cork, I know Mrs. Ahern as Julia Hourihan.  I know her friends <Col N="8" /> and extended family.  Mrs. Ahern epitomised all that is good in Irish people.  She was kind, generous and noble and she reared her family well. She never lost touch with her roots in west Cork. She returned there at least twice a year and most of us met her on those occasions.  I spent an evening with her and some friends last August in a place called Templemartin and she enjoyed and took part in the songs, stories and music that night.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam.</P>

      <P>To be helpful to my colleague, Senator Burke, we have tabled motion No. 18 regarding local government reform, particularly regarding SPCs and the equalisation fund.  In view of the recent announcements by the Minister and the concern being expressed by local government members, will the Leader allow a debate on this question during Government time and Private Members' time?  This would facilitate Members on both sides in bringing this matter forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the recent release of a paedophile offender in Britain after serving only half his sentence and in view of the ease of movement between our two countries, will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the urgent need for a register of sexual offenders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyMcGowan" hpid="Mr. McGowan Mr. McGowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader arrange for a debate on the various forms of EU funding? Every voluntary organisation is demanding the retention of Objective One status for part of the country but no one has drawn a line on the map defining the area to retain Objective One status. It would be helpful if the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment came into the House for a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>I support the call for a debate on Northern Ireland.  It was encouraging that the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body unanimously agreed a motion supporting Senator Mitchell's proposals and the efforts to reach a settlement.  Members from all parties in Britain and Ireland supported the motion.  I am hopeful that there will be a settlement and immediately after the proposals are published I hope we have a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few weeks Members have been complaining about financial institutions, including insurance companies, banks and building societies.  It is imperative that we have a discussion soon because it is an urgent matter and no one is happy at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two other Members mentioned local authorities. No one has come to the House to explain <Col N="9" /> the restructuring of local government but, judging by the report of the seminar held in Dublin Castle on 8 February, everyone else has been informed. Local government is particularly important to first time house buyers, who were mentioned by Senator O'Toole.  In the 1960s, local authorities provided first time buyers with facilities which no financial institutions were prepared to provide. When will we have a discussion on what is happening outside the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Connor, Haughey, Costello, McGowan and O'Toole expressed best wishes for the success of the talks, for Senator George Mitchell's initiatives and to the various leaders and groups who will be participating in the coming hours and days.  I join in those wishes. A prayer might not go astray over the next day or two and if agreement is reached it will be a terrific cause of celebration at Easter.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, Senator Doyle and Senator Cregan mentioned house prices and I will facilitate the House by having a debate immediately after Easter.  Senator Costello called for a debate on the report of the National Minimum Wage Commission; we debated his motion a few weeks ago and if he had waited we could have discussed all the views on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has probably been published because of the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will allow the Senator time to express his views after Easter.  Senator Burke, Senator Cregan and Senator Coogan called for a debate on finance; I have discussed this with the Minister for Finance and he will come to the House during the first week after the recess for a debate on banks and financial institutions.</P>
      <P>All Members probably concur with Senator Burke and Senator Cregan that we should ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to come here to discuss the mooted changes to local government.  The Minister will be here tomorrow and I will note the presence of those Senators who are interested in local government activities.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consult the Minister and arrange to have a debate on this matter at the earliest opportunity.  The majority of Members owe their seats to the electorate of local government representatives and there should be a full attendance at tomorrow afternoon's session.</P>
      <P>Senators Lanigan and Cregan requested a debate on the serious crisis in the insurance industry, particularly the part of it which relates to life assurance.  I will discuss this matter with Senator Lanigan, a former Leader of the House, following the Order of Business to see how I can facilitate his wishes.</P>
      <P>Senator Bohan tabled a proposal on education. This morning I had a similar experience to the one outlined by the Senator.  It was pleasant to be able to commute freely to Dublin from my home. I did not travel from the south side of the city, I drove from Castlepollard, County Westmeath. There is food for thought in the Senator's proposal. As Shakespeare said, &ldquo;To discuss is not to agree&rdquo;, and this matter requires discussion.  I will afford time for a debate on the Senator's proposal.</P>
      <P>I note Senator Ridge's comments on the Child Pornography Bill and I will pass them on to the relevant Minister.  I hope progress will be made in respect of her wishes.</P>
      <P>I will pass Senator Leonard's request for a register of sexual offenders to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Members will agree that the Senator's suggestion is good.</P>
      <P>Senator McGowan requested a debate on Objective One status for the part of the country where he lives, which has an urgent need for assistance.  The current discussions on this issue will probably copperfasten the claim that Connacht and Ulster will require Objective One status for the next ten years.

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced amendment No. 1 last week in the Dáil to meet concerns Deputies had raised on recommendations by the Courts Service as to the appropriate level of court fees.  Section 6(2)(e) provides that, at the request of the Minister, the service may recommend to the Minister appropriate scales of court fees and charges.  The Minister agreed with Deputies that the power of initiative in this regard should also lie with the Courts Service. I am satisfied the amendment improves the Bill by ensuring that the service will be in a position, both on its own initiative or at the request <Col N="12" /> of the Minister, to recommend appropriate scales of court fees.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2 would require the Minister to have regard to the need to ensure that the Courts Service Board includes both men and women members in nominating the three members of the board which the Bill provides are to be nominated by the Minister.  Those three nominations are an officer of the Minister, a person to represent consumers and court services and a person representing commerce, finance or administration interests.  I am satisfied this amendment improves the Bill.  It is a practical step as the Minister of the day will have latitude with three nominations when taking into account the issue of the gender composition of the board.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 is a technical, drafting amendment.  The purpose of section 19 is to provide that the chief executive will be the accounting officer for the purposes of expenditure by the service.  The amendment realigns the wording of the section to ensure consistency with the provisions of the Comptroller and Auditor General (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 4 is a drafting amendment which updates the citation in section 23 of the Bill in relation to the Civil Service Regulation Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not have a problem with amendment No. 1, which allows the board to initiate a request regarding the recommendation of an appropriate scale of court fees and charges. To what extent does this cover court fees and charges?  Does it include the fees and charges of barristers and solicitors in terms of payments in private practice and State legal aid schemes, both of a criminal and civil nature?  Will the Minister rather than the Taxing Master have the major role in deciding these scales?</P>
      <P>In relation to the nominations I may not have heard correctly, but I thought the Minister said he could exercise the powers given under the amendment only in the area of three nominations in order to achieve a gender balance.  There are 17 members of the board, and while it is top heavy with judges I would have thought it would be appropriate to examine gender equity in each of those categories rather than simply referring to practising solicitors and barristers, members of the staff of service, an officer of the Minister nominated by the Minister, a person nominated by the Minister and so on.  Is that what the Minister is talking about or is the Minister referring to the member nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions so that a request could be made to the ICTU in relation to gender balance, as is the case in a number of other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="13" /> How many gender specific people are we talking about?  What rule of thumb is the Minister proposing?  Previously we had an indicator that 40 per cent of State boards should have each gender representation.  Is the Minister suggesting the Judiciary make their own appointments without suggesting they might choose a balance between the genders?  Are we talking about the other areas being the same in terms of the appointment of members to the board?  I fully support the amendment, which the Minister tabled at the request of both Houses.  However, having done so he should seek to ensure balanced gender representation on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

      <P>Senator Connor asked about the gender balance of the board.  Section 11(1) states the categories of members of the board in paragraphs (a) to (q).  The Minister will nominate three members of the board.  Amendment No. 2 inserts a new subsection (2) which states the Minister, in making those nominations, must take account of gender balance.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister stated in the Dáil last week that he would ask the nominating bodies to also take account of the need for gender balance. The Minister is obliged to take account of gender balance in making his three out of the 17 nominations and he has undertaken to ask the nominating bodies to do likewise.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello raised the issue of court fees, which was the purpose of amendment No. 1. Court fees are not the fees charged by barristers and solicitors but are administration and application fees which must be paid to the court clerk, even in the District Court.</P>

      <P>That Seanad Éireann takes note of the recommendation from the Commission of the European Community, pursuant to Article 109j of the Treaty establishing the European Community done at Rome on the 25th day of March, 1957 (as amended by the Treaty on European Union done at Maastricht on the 7th day of February, 1992) concerning the fulfilment by Ireland of the necessary conditions for the adaptation of the single currency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy) Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. McCreevy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for tabling this motion is to provide Seanad Éireann with an opportunity to discuss Ireland's prospective participation in economic and monetary union from the outset on 1 January 1999.  EMU is one of the most significant economic events of this century and it is only proper that we should have the opportunity to discuss it again before the next major decisions are made at European level during the first weekend of May.</P>
      <P>The people decided by referendum in 1992 that we should participate in EMU if we qualified and the Government is resolved to give effect to that decision.  Following the Commission's recommendations, published on 25 March, we are very well placed to be confirmed as one of the countries which will be part of this most historic development in European integration on 1 January next.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Article 109j(1) of the EC Treaty, the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute are required to report to Council on the progress made in the fulfilment by member states of their obligations regarding the achievement of economic and monetary union. On the basis of these reports, the Commission is required to submit separately to Council a recommendation as to which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.</P>
      <P>These reports examine whether there has been a high degree of sustainable convergence among member states and this is assessed primarily on the basis of progress made by member states in fulfilling each of the four convergence criteria of Article 109j(1), namely, price stability, Government budgetary position, observance of the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange rate mechanism and durability of convergence as reflected in long-term interest rates.  In addition, the compatibility between national legislation, including the statutes of national central banks, and the treaty and the statute of the European System of Central Banks is examined.  Senators will be aware that these two convergence reports together with the recommendations of the Commission were published on 25 March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The publication of these reports and recommendations is the first step of the procedure set out in Article 109j which will lead to confirmation by the Council, meeting on 2 May 1998 in the composition of the Heads of State or Government, <Col N="15" /> of which member states fulfil the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency. Based on the two convergence reports, the Commission's recommendations to the Council are that the following 11 member states are suitable to enter the third and final stage of EMU on 1 January 1999: Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Finland and, of course, Ireland. Denmark and the United Kingdom are exercising their opt-outs and Sweden and Greece are judged by the Commission not to have fulfilled all the relevant criteria.  As the next step, the European Parliament, meeting on 29-30 April, will deliver an informal opinion to the ECOFIN Council based on the convergence reports and the Commission recommendations.</P>
    <P>On the basis of these reports and on the recommendation of the Commission, the ECOFIN Council, meeting on 1 May, will assess for each member state the fulfilment of conditions for the adoption of the single currency and formulate its recommendations to the heads of state or government. The European Parliament, meeting on the morning of 2 May, will then deliver its formal opinion to the Heads of State or Government who will meet that afternoon to confirm which member states will participate in EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the Commission and EMI convergence reports, I considered it would be important to have an assessment of Ireland's convergence from the Central Bank of Ireland.  This report was published on Tuesday, 31 March and on the same day it was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Central Bank's report also concludes that Ireland meets the four convergence criteria concerning price stability, Government budgetary position and exchange and interest rates.  The bank states that membership of EMU offers Ireland the prospect of stable economic conditions based on price stability.</P>
    <P>In terms of legal compatibility, the convergence reports of the EMI, subject to some comments about minor imperfections, and the EU Commission found that, following the enactment of the Central Bank Act, 1998, legislation in Ireland is compatible with the requirements of the treaty and the ESCB statute.  The Central Bank convergence report also states that Central Bank legislation is now fully compatible with the requirements of the treaty.</P>
    <P>As regards convergence among member states generally, the Commission recommends a total of 11 member states as fulfilling the necessary conditions for the adoption of the euro.  In the words of the Commission, convergence is now an established fact in Europe.  Member states have made great progress in bringing their economies closer together and have demonstrated a revitalised commitment to controlling inflation and placing public finances on a sounder footing.</P>
    <P>The report from the Central Bank also acknowledges that substantial progress has been <Col N="16" /> made on convergence and that this is true of all countries aspiring to participate in EMU from the beginning.  The bank also states:</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to anticipate greater convergence when the single currency is established. The single market and currency will promote further the process of integration and real convergence, and this should, over time, lessen the risk of major shocks affecting individual countries.</P>
    <P>The Commission's convergence report includes a detailed assessment of the impact of the cyclical economic factors on the budgetary performance of all EU member states.  The Commission concludes that Ireland's underlying or structural budget was in broad balance last year, in accordance with our own forecast.  For 1998 it forecasts that our structural budget balance will be unchanged, indicating that the macroeconomic impact of last December's budget was broadly neutral.  The EMI report draws attention to the significant underlying improvement in the Irish budgetary position in recent years which, in its opinion, may reflect a lasting structural move towards more balanced fiscal policies.</P>
    <P>I recognise that concern has been expressed about the sustainability of the performance of some member states, a concern which is reflected in the views of the European Monetary Institute that further budgetary consolidation is warranted in some member states.  However, it is the objective independent assessment of the European Commission, which is the guardian of the European treaties, that these 11 member states fulfil the necessary conditions in accordance with the treaty.  That assessment is based on the convergence reports of the EMI and the Commission which, under the treaty, examine the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence.  In the context of the decisions to be taken at the beginning of May, it is my intention, therefore, to support the Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the effects, both negative and positive, which EMU is likely to have on the Irish economy were analysed in detail by the ESRI in its study, The Economic Implications for Ireland of EMU, published in July 1996.  This report concluded that membership of EMU would, on balance, be economically advantageous even were the UK to remain outside.  The net benefit to the Irish economy from taking part in EMU, without the UK, was estimated by the ESRI to be an additional 0.4 per cent of GNP on an annual average basis over the medium term, allowing for possible shocks to Ireland arising from the United Kingdom's non-participation. The ESRI also looked at potential but unquantifiable effects of EMU participation.  It concluded that some of these, such as the increased attractiveness of Ireland as a destination for foreign direct investment, could be substantial.  The ESRI conclusion was endorsed by the National Economic and Social Council in its report, European Union: Integration and Enlargement.  NESC <Col N="17" /> found no reason to revise its long standing position that Ireland's strategic interest lay in full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>One of the editors of the ESRI report, Terry Baker of the institute, recently examined the current situation in order to assess if the conclusions of the report could still be found to hold true.  In relation to external shocks, Mr. Baker concluded that the risks are now thought to be considerably lower than they were in 1996 for three reasons &mdash; an increase in the number of prospective EMU participants, a massive appreciation of sterling and a fundamental policy shift by the UK Government in favour of eventual membership of EMU.</P>
    <P>The use of interest and exchange rates as economic instruments to deal with shocks which are particular to Ireland will, however, no longer be available in EMU.  This means that if there are any shocks in the future, which are particular to Ireland, the adjustment process will have to be assisted by a combination of fiscal policy, pay policy and structural reform.  In this context, Mr. Baker points out that the room for manoeuvre has increased significantly with the further strengthening of the public finances since 1996.  It might be useful if I quote Mr. Baker from the summary of his reflections:</P>
    <P>The risks attached to EMU entry have diminished significantly since mid-1996, while some of the risks that would be faced had Ireland opted to delay entry to EMU have tended to increase.  With hindsight, it appears that our 1996 assessment underestimated the advantages of initial entry.  The balance of risks now seems to confer a clearcut and substantial benefit to Ireland from the decision to join EMU at the outset.</P>
    <P>In relation to our long-term strategic interests, it is necessary to view EMU membership in the context both of past long-term economic performance in other member states and of the appropriate medium to long-term future strategy for Ireland while, at the same time, taking account of the short-term challenges that may arise.  In summary, the case for Ireland joining EMU from the outset is now stronger than it ever was given the remarkable convergence that has occurred among the 11 potential EMU participants which is sustainable into the future, assuming that appropriate stability orientated policies are pursued by them.  This is confirmed by the EMI, Commission and Central Bank convergence reports and the Commission recommendations. Taken with the economic assessments that have been made by the ESRI, together with the review by Mr. Baker and the NESC, it is clear that Ireland's long-term strategic interests lie in joining EMU from 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>However, EMU brings with it certain responsibilities to ensure that we can sustain our excellent economic performance into the future.  Despite our low inflation to date, inflationary pressures in the economy, if left unchecked, could cause severe <Col N="18" /> damage to our future potential.  This is widely recognised in Ireland and is a concern I referred to in the past.  It is also a concern at EU level and is reflected in the reports of the EMI, the Commission and the Central Bank of Ireland.  It is important, therefore, that we act appropriately and prudently to ensure the future balanced and sustainable development of our economy.  It is against this background that the recent revaluation of the ERM central rate of the Irish pound must be seen.</P>
    <P>On 14 March 1998 it was agreed that the central rate of the Irish pound would be revalued by 3 per cent against other ERM currencies, from DM 2.41105 to DM 2.48338. The new central rate of the Irish pound is broadly in line with its recent market rate.  This revaluation was agreed unanimously by our European partners who recognised the determination of the Irish Government to adopt the mix of economic policies best suited to ensuring price stability on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>The decision on the revaluation was taken with a view to ensuring that our economic success continues in a balanced and sustainable way.  The communiqué issued in Brussels on 14 March refers to three elements of Ireland's economic and budgetary policy stance: the revaluation itself, our budgetary policy in 1998 and 1999 and the Central Bank's intention to continue its present monetary policy orientation which is aimed at price stability.</P>
    <P>These three elements of policy taken together make up a coherent and prudent policy stance in view of the challenges facing the Irish economy. One of these challenges was the risk of a significant increase in inflation, particularly in 1999, because of our rapid economic growth, prospective lower interest rates in EMU and the overall currency depreciation of recent months, even in circumstances where the current strength of sterling is not sustained.  We needed to avoid adding to these pressures by a further fall in the currency to our previous ERM central rate of DM 2.41. This was especially so because of the threat that significantly increased inflation would pose for the current Partnership 2000 agreement, as well as the negotiations on the next wage agreement.</P>
    <P>Having considered the inflationary risks that lay ahead I decided the most prudent course of action was to bring the ERM central rate of the Irish pound broadly into line with its recent market rate.  In making this decision, the needs of the whole economy were taken into consideration and I had to strike a balance between inflation concerns on the one hand and competitiveness considerations on the other.  The short-term advantages for some sectors were balanced against the need to counter inflationary risks for the economy in general, including those sectors.</P>
    <P>The new central rate broadly confirms the recent market level of the Irish pound against the Deutsche Mark.  Therefore, assuming that ERM central rates form the basis for EMU entry rates, this new higher EMU entry rate for the Irish pound of DM 2.48338, when compared with the <Col N="19" /> recent and current exchange rate situation in the market, will not result in a worsening of the Irish pound value of EU payments nor will it make our exports any more expensive.  It should also be noted that Irish producers have received a gain in competitiveness from the depreciation of the currency over the last 12 months or so.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, as a general statement that, again assuming ERM central rates will be the basis for EMU entry rates, the revaluation of the Irish pound's ERM will mean that when compared with the situation of entering EMU at DM 2.41105, the Irish pound value of EU payments, including agricultural payments, will be about 3 per cent lower and our exports will be 3 per cent more expensive.  However, this negative impact on EU payments is just one of a wide set of foreign exchange flows which will be affected by the revaluation.  Annual debt servicing costs, for example, will be lower in Irish pound terms than they would have been if there had been no revaluation.  In any case, it should be remembered that any short-term gain in competitiveness that there might have been from entering EMU at DM 2.41 would have been eroded if the risk of higher inflation were to materialise.</P>
    <P>Similarly, any gains to farmers and others could have been quickly eroded if the lower value of the Irish pound had resulted in higher inflation. It should also be remembered that both the exporting and agricultural sectors will, like the rest of the economy, also benefit from the convergence of interest rates across member states participating in EMU by the beginning of 1999.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to focus on what some see as the negative aspects of the revaluation in isolation from the benefits of a less inflationary environment from which those in receipt of EU payments will also gain.  The purpose of the revaluation was to provide a more stable and balanced economic and business environment which would make the challenges ahead more manageable by lessening the threat of inflation.  I am confident the recent revaluation was a balanced and appropriate response to the challenges that lie ahead.  Taken together with the expressed intentions on domestic economic policy, it places Ireland in a strong position to participate successfully in EMU, and so will facilitate the continued sustainable development of the economy.</P>
    <P>The communiqué that issued following the revaluation of the Irish pound signalled my decision to hold strictly to the tight expenditure targets set out in last December's budget and hence to allow the general government surplus &mdash; already pitched at 0.5 per cent of GDP &mdash; to increase in line with any unanticipated revenues this year.  The communiqué also noted my resolve to propose a budget for 1999 having as its primary objective the continuation of low inflation in Ireland.  This approach to budgetary policy will help secure the medium-term sustainability of Ireland's economic growth.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> This decision regarding the conduct of budgetary policy in 1998 and 1999 is in accord with the commitment contained in the economic background to the budget last December to run budget surpluses when the economy is doing well. Prudent management of Ireland's public finances has helped underpin our strong economic performance. Low budget deficits and a rapidly declining debt ratio have helped secure the stable low inflation and interest rate environment which has proved so conducive to strong economic and employment growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that the end-March Exchequer returns were released last Thursday, 2 April.  Based on current receipts for the first quarter it is now anticipated that tax revenue for the year as a whole is likely to be about £500 million ahead of the budget target.  I have already reiterated that these additional receipts will be used to increase the general government surplus rather than fund extra expenditure.  Consequently, the outturn forecast for the general government surplus has been revised to 1.2 per cent of GDP for 1998.</P>
    <P>The final decision on the pre-announcement of the bilateral exchange rates between the currencies that will participate in the euro area will, as I have said many times, not be taken until the first weekend in May.  However, it is widely expected that these bilateral exchange rates will be based on the ERM central rates.  These rates will become effective on 1 January 1999, at which date one euro will become equal to one ecu.  In line with the Treaty on the European Union and because the ecu is a notional EU currency which contains elements of currencies which will not participate in the euro, actual setting of the conversion rates against the euro can only take place on 1 January 1999.</P>
    <P>Ireland' s competitive position, which has been strong in recent years, stems from a strategic framework built upon <i>inter alia</i> the foundations of a consensus approach which brings the social partners into the national goal-setting arena, sound fiscal and economic policies pursued by successive Governments and a long-established investment in education.  This is now translating into strong employment growth, a continuous decline in unemployment and increased national resources to tackle social priorities.  Competitiveness is a multifaceted concept.  While a purist might be inclined to list the many factors involved, as a man who prefers to home in on the core issues, I am indebted to the National Competitiveness Council for its succinct definition, namely that it boils down to &ldquo;success in markets that delivers a better standard of living for all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The social partnership process is one of the strengths of the Irish economy in addressing the challenges of EMU.  The preparation of the Irish economy for entry to and participation in EMU was a vital consideration for the social partners in the negotiation of Partnership 2000.  The continuation of the social partnership process and the negotiation of an appropriate successor to Partnership <Col N="21" /> 2000 will be essential in ensuring Ireland's successful participation in EMU.  The competitive challenge of EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  The Partnership 2000 agreement provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of a disturbance to Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU. In this regard, the Government, IBEC and ICTU have agreed to meet soon, in the context of Partnership 2000, to accelerate the preparation for the competitive impact of EMU.</P>
    <P>The success of our response to any economic shocks will depend to a large extent on how well the Irish economy has been prepared in advance to cope with such an eventuality.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments will be critical to these preparations.  The reduction in policy options in macroeconomic terms which EMU will bring will also heighten the importance of factors such as skills, costs, infrastructure and quality. The work of the National Competitiveness Council, established under Partnership 2000, will provide a basis for developing appropriate medium-term policies in this area.  Also important are the maintenance of competition in product markets and the development of suitable infrastructure &mdash; both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; or physical infrastructure and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure, such as public services and the skills and knowledge base.</P>
    <P>A key concern of many Irish firms is how sterling will perform against the euro once our entry rate has been determined.  The sterling issue is clearly important but we must be careful not to overstate its importance.  When analysts talk about a &ldquo;sterling shock&rdquo;, they are for the most part talking about a sharp fall in sterling from its equilibrium level.  Sterling is currently well above what most commentators, including the Bank of England, consider to be its equilibrium level. Therefore, sterling would currently have to fall a very long way before it could be considered to represent an economic shock.</P>
    <P>However, the Government is not ignoring the need to prepare for the possibility, no matter how remote, of problems for Irish industry as a consequence of sterling falling significantly below its equilibrium level.  Consultants have been appointed by Forfás, under the auspices of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign, to examine the implications for Irish industry of the United Kingdom remaining outside EMU.  I understand the consultants' report has been received by Forfás and that it identified a wide range of actions in the fields of finance, marketing, distribution, etc., that firms could consider as part of their contingency planning.  These actions will be summarised in a document to be included in a Forfás information pack prepared as part of the EMU Business Awareness Campaign to be widely distributed in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="22" /> Monetary policy in EMU will be the responsibility of the European System of Central Banks which for this purpose brings together the central bank governors of the euro area member states and the executive board of the European Central Bank.  The treaty guarantees the independence of the ESCB; it cannot receive any instructions from either member states or the European institutions. The primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability, an important objective which will facilitate growth and employment generation in the years ahead.  Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the treaty requires that the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Union with a view to contributing to the objectives of the Union.  In that regard, arrangements for dialogue between the ECB, the Council and the European Parliament are provided for under the treaty.  The issues arising from the establishment of the European Central Bank have been debated at some length in the House recently in connection with the Central Bank Act, 1998.  I propose, therefore, not to repeat them and instead to move on to the practical preparations which are being made for the changeover to the euro.</P>
    <P>I am glad preparations are going well.  My Department has responsibility for co-ordinating the preparations of the Irish public administration and has a key role in helping the rest of the economy to prepare itself for the changeover. Private and public sector representatives were centrally involved in the preparation of the national changeover plan, the second edition of which I published in January.  The plan outlines the arrangements which will be made across the public sector, by banks, building societies and by the Stock Exchange to facilitate the changeover. The plan also shows the designs for euro notes and coins, including the design for the Irish face of euro coins.  An appendix to the plan describes the changeover work being done by various public bodies and trade and professional associations and lists contact points for further information. All Members of the Oireachtas received copies of the plan so I do not propose to describe it in detail.  It is also available from my Department, from Forfás and on the Internet.  I draw attention to the statement in the plan that, assuming the European Council confirms during the first weekend of May that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for entering EMU, a currency changeover board will be established after the European Council's decision to oversee the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.  The Euro Changeover Group is expected to provide the nucleus of this board.</P>
    <P>As regards information about the changeover, the EMU Business Awareness Campaign run by Forfás has been very successful in providing information for businesses about EMU and the changeover to the euro.  The campaign has produced an excellent information pack, of which more than 30,000 copies have been circulated. <Col N="23" /> The campaign has run two radio advertising campaigns and has also circulated a summary leaflet to employers in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners.  More than 140,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed.  Forfás has also drawn up a short leaflet specifically for small and medium enterprises and more than 60,000 copies of this leaflet have been distributed.  Forfás will continue its activities for 1998 and it plans to issue further documents on issues such as information technology and a guide for retailers.</P>
    <P>With the proximity of EMU, the national information programme will be extended to provide information on the introduction of the euro aimed at the needs of the general public.  The objective of the public information programme is that all citizens will be made aware of and informed about the changeover and that they will be familiar with the timetable for EMU and the planned introduction of the notes and coins on 1 January 2002.  It should reassure them that the change will be gradual and that they will be able to cope with it.</P>
    <P>The Government recently approved the drafting of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) Bill, 1998, to cater for the other legislative changes necessary for the introduction of the euro from 1 January 1999.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure a clear and comprehensible framework in Irish monetary law following the introduction of the euro, to remove incompatibilities between Irish monetary law and the legal framework for the use of the euro and to give effect to enabling provisions within the legal framework, for example, in relation to the redenomination of outstanding debt.  The Bill is also designed to facilitate companies which wish to redenominate and renominalise their capital structure in euro even before the final changeover to the euro on 1 January 2002.  It is intended to have the Bill enacted by summer 1998.  In preparing it, my Department is consulting with the European Monetary Institute, the European Commission and with interested parties in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The establishment of the euro will yield significant benefits for the Irish economy as part of the wider European economy.  A permanently fixed exchange rate will consolidate the gains already achieved through the Single Market.  The euro will allow for the full advantages of the Single Market to be obtained due to higher price transparency and greater competition.  EMU will enhance overall economic efficiency and stability within the euro area, boosting the sustainable rate of output and employment growth and creating a truly single market of some 288 million people.</P>
    <P>Successful participation in EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness, as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments, will be critical.  I am certain that the Irish people and <Col N="24" /> their Government will face those challenges and opportunities imaginatively and successfully.</P>
    <P>Ireland is well placed to participate in EMU from the outset as reflected by the positive recommendation from the Commission and I am, therefore, very pleased to commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I may not utilise all the time allocated to me as I am standing in for a colleague.  I will keep going while I have ammunition and I will sit down when I run out of ideas.</P>
      <P>There are three main channels of benefits which will accrue from membership of EMU &mdash; competitiveness, the exchange rate and the cost of transition.  The Irish economy has always been subject to fluctuations in interest rates.  The construction industry was one of the industries which suffered badly from this.  When interest rates rose, the construction industry ground to a halt and when they dropped the boom started.  In the past few years we have seen great development in the industry, mainly due to the low cost of money.  If the EMU works, this area will be greatly beneficial to the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>One area where we believe EMU will work is in the cost of foreign exchange transactions.  Companies will no longer have to pay for changing money from one currency to another, which will have major benefits for the economy.  As the Minister said, the ESRI report which examined all the possibilities of our entry came up with mainly positive conclusions.  However, in the field of competitiveness, the report found that with EMU, Irish firms will continue to be subject to a variety of shocks which will damage their competitiveness and the Government will no longer be able to insulate the economy from the effect of such shocks through exchange rate adjustments.</P>
      <P>We all know that sterling is causing the main problem.  A massive depreciation of sterling would result in serious problems for Ireland.  I have yet to hear anyone state why England is so loath to join EMU.  If it joins, it will eliminate the few areas of worry as regards our joining.  Sterling is high at the moment and our exporters are doing extremely well while importers are suffering badly.  If the case is reversed and sterling depreciates, it will be far more serious for the Irish economy as more than half of our exports go to the English market.  I do not know what adjustments the Government can make to prevent this.</P>
      <P>Many other areas will benefit from EMU, such as tourism.  Tourists will no longer have to change their money from francs to deutschmarks to sterling to punts.  They will come to Ireland, have an idea of what they will spend and they will spend it.  I anticipate there will be massive improvements in the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Agriculture will be more affected by CAP reform than by EMU.  Farmers and farming organisations are worried that CAP reform is going against them and Partnership 2000 is setting <Col N="25" /> a new agenda which is not to their benefit.  Unless there is a major trade-off as regards compensation, I do not see how farming will continue to improve.</P>
    <P>There are other practical problems which will arise.  Our retail sector will be affected and retailers will have to reinvest.  There will be a great deal of redundant hardware such as cash registers and vending machines.  Computer software and hardware will have to be replaced. There is a great deal of cost inbuilt in the changeover. Is the Government looking at any way of compensating industry and business for the massive costs which will be incurred?  This also includes training costs as staff and customers will have to adjust to the new currency.</P>
    <P>There is a major problem with educating the public.  We are used to the punt &mdash; people recognise its value and have an instinctive feel for it. There will be a psychological problem in adjusting to the new currency as people will have difficulty in valuing their assets and money. Someone knows when he or she owns a house to the value of £100,000 and he or she will find it extremely difficult to get a concept of the new value.  The Government and the Minister need to look at the area of education.  It may seem farfetched but it is extremely important that the public readjusts and that people have a sense of their wealth and assets.  Everyone remembers when decimal currency was introduced and that change was nothing in comparison to that which is about to take place.  People found it extremely difficult and some never adjusted to the new currency as they could not get a sense of its value.  It was only a minor change compared to what faces us now, but I am sure the Government and the Minister will iron out those problems.</P>
    <P>The buying and selling of foreign currency is one of the areas from which the most beneficial effects are supposed to emanate upon joining.  There will be substantial job losses because foreign exchange creates many jobs and that will cease following the three year transition period after Ireland joins EMU.  This will have to be looked at and I hope compensation will more than offset losses in this regard.  We are not sure in terms of competitiveness and interest rates whether there will be benefits.</P>
    <P>Ireland was lucky enough to meet the criteria to join and one of the major benefits should be a degree of stability in interest rates which we have not had for many years.  I recall in the mid-1980s when interest rates stood at 22 per cent and if one was unfortunate enough to have surcharges on that one paid 25 per cent.  Those charges were colossal and they dampened the expansion of the economy.  No economy could thrive with such interest rates and those in business had to endure them to survive.  Many businesses, unfortunately, did not and went to the wall as a result of those penal interest rates and we do not want a return to that.  EMU should stabilise interest rates for the foreseeable future and allow people to plan <Col N="26" /> and expand.  People borrowed money in the 1980s at a 10 per cent interest rate and ended up paying 25 per cent for the same money five years later. No business could thrive in such an environment and it led to the stagnation of the economy for many years.  Everyone is looking forward to the levelling off of interest rates.</P>
    <P>Britain will not be a member of EMU even though it has stated it may join at the last moment.  Its absence is a cause of worry because we will have no control over how sterling performs during the next few years.  The indications are that it will continue to appreciate.  If it does, it will still have considerable impact in Ireland because importers will be faced with substantially rising costs annually while exporters will do extremely well.  The balance will not be right.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider compensating business for the costs it will incur during the transition period?  The commercial sector will be saddled with a massive re-education programme and reequipping of businesses which will impose a considerable strain.  However, I welcome the broad thrust of the Minister's contribution.  He stated we are living more in hope in terms of joining and are relying on expert opinion and interpretation on how Ireland will fare when it joins.  We are entering financially uncharted waters and I hope there are no hidden icebergs.  We have had enough of them in the past, but I hope everything works out according to expert opinion.</P>
    <P>The best opinion is that Ireland would be better off in than out.  We must go along with that scenario and hope the economists and experts have got it right on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, to the House.  I am pleased the Minister has afforded us the opportunity to debate EMU and analyse the most forward step any Government has taken in recent times.  It is larger than any other we have taken towards European integration and Ireland will be in the unique position of being the only English-speaking nation which will be a member of EMU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great tribute must be paid to the management of the country by successive Governments as Ireland finds itself easily fulfilling the conditions for first phase entry into the single currency. Governments over the past ten years have played their part in bringing Ireland to a state of readiness for entry.  Bearing in mind the new currency needs to be strong and will stand alone, certain criteria for entry were laid down &mdash; low inflation, interest rates and borrowing, a stable exchange rate within the European monetary system and an independent central bank.  Ireland has lived up easily to these achievements in the sense that the vital signs of the economy are excellent.  Successive Governments and Ministers for Finance, starting with the tough decisions taken by Ray MacSharry in 1987, have contributed to the situation in which we find ourselves.  Our European experience has been overwhelmingly positive in <Col N="27" /> terms of what we have gained from membership. One only has to look at the infrastructure now in place: agriculture, roads, communications and our standard of living have been transformed since we entered the EU.  Ireland has gained in stature and economic independence and now provides a standard of living equal to almost anywhere in Europe.  Our convergence has been dramatic and this is why we are one of the first countries eligible for membership of the euro.</P>
    <P>Historically Ireland has a proud record of bringing great benefits to Europe.  During the Dark Ages after the fall of the Roman Empire, Irish missionaries played a central role in the reintroduction of Christianity and classical learning. That is there for everyone to see.  The contribution of the Irish in far flung fields is a great tribute to those who came from this peripheral island.</P>
    <P>To some extent Europe has now repaid us and we must ensure we are able to take full advantage of the single market and the euro.  As a result of our meeting the convergence criteria, Ireland will form part of the first wave of full economic and monetary union on 1 January 1999.  Exchange rates will be fixed and transactions will begin in the euro from that date.  Due to an obvious degree of confusion which may arise in the public, it is good that the euro notes and coins will not come into circulation until 1 January 2002. National currencies will continue to be used until phased out later that year.  It is incumbent on all public representatives to reassure and convince the public, wherever possible, that the advent of a single currency and the accompanying Amsterdam Treaty will bring overwhelming benefits to Ireland.  It is our duty to ensure the benefits of the euro are clearly transmitted to the public.</P>
    <P>The single market will have a currency which will be one of the strongest in the world; competing favourably with the yen and the dollar.  The currency turbulence which has damaged trade between member states will be a thing of the past. Such instability had a major negative effect on jobs and growth, most recently in 1995 when EU growth was cut by 2 per cent and 1.5 million jobs were lost.</P>
    <P>Under the euro the cost of doing business will be considerably cheaper.  There will be no need to handle several currencies, leading to better competitiveness and resulting in benefits which can be passed on to the consumer.  Perhaps most critically and crucially, a stable and strong single currency, coupled with the continued sound management of public finances by this Government, will lead to even lower interest rates which will stimulate investment and be good for jobs, borrowers and home owners with a mortgage.</P>
    <P>The gradual disappearance of the punt and the pre-eminence of a European Central Bank should not be viewed as a dissolution of our independence and distinctiveness as Irish people.  In joining the euro we will enjoy the full anticipated advantages of a confident Europe with a bright <Col N="28" /> future on the eve of the 21st century.  It is historic that we are entering unchartered waters to some extent, but our preparation and the evaluation and investigation by our agencies have shown, on balance, that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. The Minister reiterated this point in his speech.  This will be the case even if the UK does not enter.  I was pleased the Minister stated that the Government's consultants have indicated that they are more confident than they were in 1996 that the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages even if the UK does not join.  It was consoling to hear the Minister state that it is believed that sterling is at a higher rate than it should be and would have to depreciate significantly before it caused shocks inside our economy.  This is the type of comment we wish to hear from the Minister for Finance.  The recent Central Bank report was also very positive and welcome.</P>
    <P>After almost two weeks of public debate about bank scandals, the commercial banking system and the failure of the Central Bank to oversee that system, it is heartening that we can move forward and debate the important issue that this country has taken a decision to join the single currency, that the European Commission and member states have decided that we have met the criteria to join the first phase of the euro and that the Irish people are in favour of such a development. The approach of the Irish people to Europe over the years has been extraordinary.  Irish people are pro-Europe and outward looking.  We do not have an insular approach.  I sometimes read with awe some of the comments made about Ireland's approach to Europe.  In a UK newspaper last Sunday I read a comment by Norman Tebbitt criticising the Taoiseach.  However, this was a veiled criticism in so far as he was really criticising the Irish nation which, he claimed, had a begging bowl approach, that Germany and the UK were contributing to Ireland and that we were not contributing anything.  I disagree totally with that view.  Figures produced by independent analysts indicate that we contribute in the region of £2 billion of fish to the European economies. When we joined the EEC we gave up control of our seas.  The vast potential and resources of those seas and the economic benefit which they have brought to Europe are seldom calculated and put forward as an Irish contribution to the EU.  Such comments from people such as Norman Tebbitt are unhelpful.  It also shows ignorance of the facts; it was a political statement rather than an economic fact.  I hope the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach or the Government will issue a suitable response.</P>
    <P>There are some worries concerning the euro, particularly for those who remember the introduction of decimalisation.  At that time it was felt that prices were rounded up.  The consumer was the loser.  Business generally availed of the opportunity of the changeover to hike prices and to cream off extra profits from the consumer.  I hope that will not happen on this occasion.  I urge the Minister and the Department to be very conscious <Col N="29" /> of what happened in the past and to ensure, in so far as it is possible to do so, that the same does not happen again.</P>
    <P>I could see that some concerns might arise in regard to our Border regions.  A unique situation will develop in Northern Ireland and along the Border as people there will be dealing with the euro, punt and pound sterling between 1 January 1999 and 1 January 2002.  I wonder what consultation, if any, has taken place in regard to that matter.  I asked the Governor of the Central Bank the same question at a meeting of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service recently.  He stated that the matter had been discussed but I believe further discussion should take place.  I believe this issue can, and will, cause some problems.</P>
    <P>In the initial report received from the ESRI, we read that massive job and other losses could ensue from the fact that the UK would not enter the first phase of monetary union.  That concern seems to have waned somewhat.  The Minister's statement seems to clarify the situation in that regard and people are more confident now that the knock-on effects will not be as great as originally expected.  That is reassuring for Irish business people.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the point made by a Member of the Opposition in regard to the possible appreciation of the pound sterling.  He stated that if it were to appreciate greatly it would be beneficial to exporters but would have a penalising effect on importers.  We would certainly have to be conscious of that.  The mushroom industry has benefited greatly from the appreciation of the pound sterling, as have other exporters to the UK market. That will continue to be the case if appreciation occurs but the Minister pointed out that if the pound sterling were to depreciate sharply, shocks could result in the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to hear the Minister state that surpluses would be available to assist Ireland's economic growth and that we would not squander extra tax revenue.  What will happen to any Central Bank surpluses at the time of the changeover or what moneys are expected to be left there?  What is the intention of the Minister and the Government in regard to such moneys? Will they be used to reduce Ireland's national debt or will they be channelled into infrastructural development?  Will they be held for the rainy day when we might have to contend with some shock in the economy?</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter in the House.  It is desirable that matters of such importance to Ireland are debated.  I wish the debate on the euro was carried further than the Houses of the Oireachtas into our businesses, schools and so on.  The public should be involved in a debate on the euro.  I am aware there will be an information campaign prior to the referendum on the Treaty of Amsterdam.  However, due to the constraints on Government in regard to spending on elections and referenda, it may not be in a position to carry out an information campaign.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="30" /> I feel that people are still somewhat in awe of the euro, what it entails and what its knock-on effects will be.  A ruling of the Supreme Court prohibits the Government from spending money on referenda campaigns.  Would it not be important in the national interest that a very extensive national information campaign should be launched by the Government on the issue of the single currency?  The national interest is at stake here and, in those circumstances, no prohibition should be placed on the Government to prevent it spending a reasonable amount to inform the people of all aspects and implications of the single currency.  The people should be informed when they cast their vote on the Amsterdam Treaty.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for attending this debate and I am pleased to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the Minister's speech very interesting as it covered a number of areas. Senators Caffrey and Finneran have covered quite a range of topics.  I hope this debate will serve as a reality check because I believe that is what we need.  There has been far too little public debate on the difficulties which Ireland will face in EMU.  Neither has there been much evidence of serious advance planning to prepare ourselves and our economy for the new challenges which we will meet.</P>
      <P>I met someone today who showed me a bank statement from a French bank.  Banks in France are already issuing such statements in francs and euros.  Perhaps that is also being done in Ireland. Some of us involved in the supermarket business did it for one week last year to demonstrate the impact of euro pricing, but I have not come across such a measure in Irish banks.</P>
      <P>Much preparation remains to be done in regard to the euro.  It is not that far away at this stage.  I believe the decision to enter EMU is the right one for Ireland, even though the circumstances under which we are doing so could hardly be less favourable.  I remain convinced that, in the long run, this is the right course for Ireland, though I believe equally strongly that the degree of success we will experience within EMU will depend on how effectively we plan our response to the difficulties which it presents.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, opposition to Ireland's entry into EMU has become more vocal, particularly from what I would describe as the &ldquo;UCD school of economists&rdquo;.  I say that in spite of the fact they are my electors.  Although I disagree with the conclusion they reach, I firmly agree with their diagnosis.  They are carrying out a public service by promoting a debate and discussion on this vitally important subject.  Until now there has been a virtual conspiracy of silence in regard to the issues surrounding EMU.  Because of this, we will be less prepared than we should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition to our entry to EMU can centre round one or both of two main issues.  The first relates to our position in regard to the United Kingdom.  The argument could be made that because our economy is so interlinked with that <Col N="31" /> of Britain, we cannot afford to step out of line with it.  The second issue relates to the fact that our economic cycle is out of step with that which prevails in other EMU countries.  As a result, the monetary conditions imposed by EMU will be precisely the wrong ones for Ireland.  By joining we will surrender a large part of our control of the future direction of our economy.  These are both real issues and a pro-active policy is required to deal with them effectively.</P>
    <P>Britain remains our most important trading partner even after 25 years in the EU.  More than a quarter of our exports go to Britain.  This figure is somewhat misleading because a much greater proportion of the exports from Irish owned companies goes to Britain.  It is an obvious market for companies to begin their exporting experience in and, for that reason, many small companies see it as their only export market.  As we have found time and again since we broke the link with sterling in 1979, having a different currency from Britain is a major problem for exporters.  From one month to another they are subject to fluctuations in the price they must charge to their British customers.  These fluctuations can cause a change from a situation in which large windfall profits can be made to the other extreme where products have to be sold at a loss.  All of this occurs without any change in the basic price in the Irish currency.</P>
    <P>This situation is, however, manageable provided exporting companies adopt the right strategy. In the past too many companies based their existence on the British market on the basis of a favourable exchange rate.  When the rate moved against them, as it invariably does from time to time, they got into trouble.  Theirs was a fair weather strategy.  They had no means of coping when the storms came.</P>
    <P>I was reminded of this during the past week when I read that the chief executive of the Irish Exporters Association, Mr. Colum MacDonnell, has been appealing to Irish companies to take advantage of the current exchange rates to enter the British market at this stage.  I agree, but only if companies who enter the British market do so in the full knowledge that the present exchange rates will not stay that way for all time.  Sterling is bound to go up and down against the punt as it always has done in the past.  Companies should base their strategy on an exchange rate much less favourable than it is at the moment and take the present rate as a windfall profit.  They should plan on the basis that they can still be profitable at a much less favourable exchange rate than at present.  A strategy of this kind is quite possible for Irish exporters.  I also think it is necessary as a permanent approach because with every passing month I become less convinced that the British will ever go into EMU.  Present trends in Britain are pushing interest rates upward.  This will draw even more hot money into Britain and allow them to run a balance of payments deficit as well as enjoying the pleasures of cheap imports.  Eventually the damage that a high exchange rate is doing <Col N="32" /> to British manufacturing industry may force a correction, but this is likely to leave the UK permanently at the opposite end of the business cycle from most of the rest of Europe.  In other words, it is extremely unlikely that the conditions will ever be right for the UK to join and that of course is the condition that is attached by the present British government's provisional support for entry.</P>
    <P>Our national strategy should be based on that assumption.  As I have already suggested, exporters can cope with that situation.  We should expect and encourage them to do so and we should not listen to them, down the road, if they find themselves in trouble when the exchange rate turns against them.  When that happens, it will not be an unforeseen disaster.  It will be an event as inevitable as night follows day and one that should be allowed for in any prudent business plan.  Nobody should be encouraged to export to Britain if the viability of doing so depends on the present exchange rate.</P>
    <P>Similarly, we need a national strategy on imports from the UK.  I know this topic is exercising the mind of the Minister for Finance.  This is even more important, because our biggest potential enemy at the moment is inflation.  It can come from two sources.  It can be generated internally, by pushing up wages and prices, or it can be imported by buying in more expensive goods from abroad.</P>
    <P>In importing, the UK is also our most important trading partner, accounting for at least a quarter of our imports.  This is why a sharp fall in the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling, such as we have seen over the past 15 months, is potentially very dangerous from an inflation viewpoint.  Compared to the end of 1996, the punt is now worth 25 per cent less in sterling terms.  If this is so, why has inflation remained so low?  This is something that has puzzled economists who are never so unhappy as when the statistics refuse to do their bidding.</P>
    <P>I am sure that many forces have been at work at keeping inflation down so far and some of them may be once off factors that we cannot depend on to continue.  Inflation is like walking along a clifftop.  For a while you seem to do all right, then suddenly you fall off the cliff and the speed of your descent is totally outside your control.</P>
    <P>However, there is one factor which I have noticed at work in my own business and which perhaps points to what should be our national strategy in the matter.  Many of the international brands we sell, which were once sourced in Britain, are now being sourced by our importers in other European countries.  These would be products of multinational companies with manufacturing capability in several European countries. They can switch the source of the products at will and they have done so because they found that the price of the product, when billed to us in sterling, was uncompetitive in this market.  Producing the same product at a factory in Holland, for instance, suddenly becomes more competitive <Col N="33" /> in terms of the Irish market because our currency has kept in step, broadly speaking, with the currency in that country.  This trend has been largely invisible to the customer on the shop floor, because the brand name remains the same and the product remains the same.  If you look closely, you would probably notice that the small print on the package is now not just in English but in at least one other language as well.  So far, this is a response that has been open only to multinational companies selling European or global brands into Ireland, but it offers us a path to the future.  In the EMU context, it should be our national strategy to reduce our dependence on imports from the UK to an absolute minimum.</P>
    <P>I am not, of course, suggesting that we should discriminate in any way against British goods. That is unthinkable and highly undesirable in the free-market context that is at the very heart of Ireland's trading ethos.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that we should not let inertia or plain laziness lull us into paying higher prices for goods whose names we are familiar and comfortable with when equally good products are available at much lower prices from European sources.  If we remain creatures of habit and blindly go on doing what we have done in the past, we will end up taking the easy way out and import inflation through buying British goods when the price is not right and suitable alternatives are available on the Continent.  If, on the other hand, we become increasingly open to buying goods from other sources, then we have a much better chance of containing inflation on a continuing basis.</P>
    <P>Importers and retailers have a role to play in this.  Customers, above all, have a role because in the end they are the ones who decide what to buy.  The Government also has a role in making these issues clear to people.  Senator Finneran made this point when he called for greater publicity for the EMU debate.  The Government has more at stake than anyone else in keeping inflation down.  It has a role, therefore, in informing public opinion about the ways in which inflation can be kept down so that the public can make their buying decisions from a position of knowledge.</P>
    <P>The UK problem is quite manageable on the import and export front.  However, it will not manage itself.  We have to be pro-active.  In the belief that we can and will be pro-active, I believe we should not be deflected from taking part in EMU by the situation in Britain or by the state of the sterling/punt exchange rate.  One of our main motivations for joining the European Economic Community 25 years ago was to overcome our overwhelming dependence on Britain and on the British market.  To turn our back on EMU and throw in our lot with Britain would be to reverse that process.  It would be to embrace a future even more dangerous and full of uncertainty than the one facing us in EMU.  In a real sense we simply have no choice in this matter and I agree with the steps the Minister has taken.  We must join EMU and, once part of it, we must make the <Col N="34" /> best possible fist of the position we find ourselves in.  We should make no mistake about it, life under EMU is not going to be easy &mdash; I have been saying that all along.  Perhaps now our entry is certain, the time has come when we can draw back the veil that has carefully concealed the realities of life under EMU.</P>
    <P>We are already seeing signs of the dilemma we will face on a daily basis in EMU.  The economy is overheating, which means that there is a danger of stoking up inflationary forces within the economy itself.  It would be a tragedy if we succeeded in keeping imported inflation at bay but still allowed inflation to take root within the economy. However, as we are already seeing, being part of EMU greatly restricts our ability to respond.  For instance, one of the things we should be doing is raising interest rates &mdash; that is the classic response to an overheating economy. We cannot do that and because of EMU the medium-term trend of our interest rates will be down, not up.</P>
    <P>I have thought up an analogy suitable for the Minister &mdash; what has happened is that one of the clubs in our golf bag has been taken away.  This is more important than it sounds, since in this game our golf bag consists of only three clubs &mdash; the Minister is a keen golfer but he would not relish having so few options.  Our position is that of a player who has to play in a higher league than he has ever been used to, and as he arrives on the first tee he finds he must play with only two-thirds of his clubs because one has been taken away.  Our future reality is that instead of using interest rates to control our economy, we will often be faced with interest rates that are the opposite to what we want.  That is also the case at present &mdash; we want higher interest rates but the rest of Europe tells us we have no choice, we must have lower rates.  Let nobody think this is a transitional problem &mdash; it will be a permanent fact of life under EMU.</P>
    <P>This makes it all the more important that we use carefully the remaining clubs in our bag.  Let us remind ourselves what those clubs are.  The first is budgetary policy &mdash; what is raised in taxes and what the Government spends.  One can control overheating with this club by raising taxes and reducing public spending; one adds to the overheating by reducing taxes and/or increasing public spending.  In other words, our current budgetary policy is adding to the overheating, not playing a part in controlling it.  This is a reality the Irish people will have to face sooner or later and the later it comes, the more painful it will be.</P>
    <P>The remaining club in the bag is wage flexibility. When one is part of a wider economy, as we will be in EMU, the real danger of inflation is the risk of letting one's wage costs get out of line. This is how a country becomes uncompetitive and it can happen overnight.  As I said, it is easy to switch the sourcing of products from one country to another when the sums do not add up.  EMU will cost Ireland many thousands of jobs unless we are ready to be considerably more flexible on wages than we have been in the past.  This is why <Col N="35" /> recent talk by the unions of tearing up the current national agreement if inflation takes hold is unrealistic.  A wage spiral would be a quick way to economic suicide &mdash; I speak not as an employer, but as a realist.  I was delighted to hear the Minister state:</P>
    <P>The competitive challenge of EMU will require an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  The Partnership 2000 agreement provides an explicit review mechanism in the case of a disturbance to Ireland's international competitiveness in EMU.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognises the dangers ahead of us but do we as a nation?</P>
    <P>Equally, the moves towards a national minimum wage are sending the wrong signals about the realities we are about to face.  If we lock ourselves into unsustainable costs, we will quickly destroy our competitiveness.  Even in the service industries which do not compete internationally, we need to be careful about the risk of destroying what I call &ldquo;optional&rdquo; jobs, which can exist only at a certain rate and would simply be abolished if they were much more expensive.  EMU has already taken away one third of our golf clubs. We need to be careful not to throw away the other two thirds as well.</P>
    <P>Considerations like these have led some people to suggest we should stay out of EMU altogether. I do not agree, although it would be in Ireland's interest if the starting date of next January was postponed for a year, while keeping the final crunch date of 2002 still in place.  EMU provides this country with the toughest economic challenges we have had to face since the foundation of the State, but we should face them, not run away from them.  Still less should we pretend that these challenges do not exist.  If we do that, we will soon find there are animals in the jungle capable of gobbling up even Celtic tigers.</P>
    <P>Although this is a debate on EMU I wish to make a further point, touched on by Senator Finneran, relating to the six month currency transition period between 1 January and 30 June 2002.  As Senator Caffrey said, we are the only nation in EMU which experienced a currency change, on 15 February 1971, so we know the change should be short and snappy rather than spread over six months.  I spoke a couple of weeks ago about the difficulties for bus drivers in handling two currencies for six months &mdash; sometimes giving change in euros, sometimes in Irish pounds.  I urge the Minister to consider doing what we did in 1971 and make the change on one day &mdash; have Irish currency up to that point and from then on give change in euros.  We can still pay in Irish currency for months after that but we should only give change in euros from then on.  It is called the &ldquo;big bang&rdquo; approach and if we follow it the public will understand it and costs will be considerably reduced for businesspeople and consumers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> I thank the Minister for paying attention and thank the House for giving time to this matter because it is a worthy debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, and commend the words of the Minister for Finance.  This is an important discussion but the debate as to whether we should enter is well and truly over.  Senator Quinn mentioned the UCD school of economists &mdash; or pessimists or however they would like to describe themselves &mdash; many of whom have only intervened at the later stages of the debate, when it would have been more telling and appropriate to contribute at an earlier point.  However, that may have much to do with the reluctance of newspapers to cover these issues until the day is upon us.  We are confronted with the ECOFIN meeting on 1 May at which the initial locking of rates will take place and we wish the Minister for Finance well at that event.  Although the debate on entry may be over, the debate on what we do after we join EMU and introduce a single currency is only beginning.</P>
      <P>Participation in EMU will be beneficial to the economy and there are many reports, such as that of the ESRI, which analyse in great detail what the effects will be.  We can look forward to lower interest rates, reduced transaction costs and easier access to the Single European Market.  All of that will be beneficial and reduced transaction costs in particular will be of benefit to travellers within the Union.  This is part of the consolidation of the single market and it is a product of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Amsterdam Treaty has only a peripheral application in our consideration of these issues.</P>
      <P>We must accept that joining EMU will deprive the Government of two traditional and principal economic levers which have been used to good effect here, namely, the control of interest and exchange rates.  As a result, we will have to be more skilful in our use of the other levers remaining under our control.  The Central Bank Bill, which deals with the diminution of that institutions sovereignty, had an easy passage through both Houses.  In the context of the controversies which affected the associated banks, would that legislation have gained such an easy passage if it had been introduced after the events at National Irish Bank and other financial institutions came to light?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I started out on the side of the Euro sceptics on whether we should enter EMU.  I had serious concerns about our vulnerability to a unilateral shift in the exchange rate of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the punt and the euro.  Several speakers referred to trade statistics and the degree to which domestic Irish companies depend on the UK market in terms of trade.  However, I have gained confidence in our ability to deal with a change in the sterling rate.  This is likely to be less dramatic than it was in the past because when we devalue or revalue our currency against the euro we will be dealing with a much larger mass than the Irish punt.  There will be benefits from this, <Col N="37" /> particularly in terms of the raids that took place on the punt in the past &mdash; which led to wide fluctuations and, on one occasion, to an overnight increase in interbank rates of between 25 per cent to 30 per cent.  There is less likelihood of that happening as a result of our being tied to a European currency than there would be if the Irish punt remained outside that currency.</P>
    <P>The Minister must be congratulated on his handling of this matter, particularly in respect of the rate at which we will enter the exchange rate mechanism &mdash; ERM.  He has consistently employed a &ldquo;vow of silence&rdquo; which was prudent because when it came to dealing with revaluation the central market rate was applied.  This aspect of joining EMU had the potential to be difficult and damaging and the Minister dealt with it admirably.  It is important that the House recognise the role he played.</P>
    <P>To return to how we will deal with our economic situation when responsibility for the exchange and interest rate mechanisms is taken out of our hands, we must consider what might be the nature of those mechanisms.  In that context, we are concerned because the economy is expanding and our performance has been good in recent years.  When we join EMU and the exchange rates are locked, will we lose control over the way we manage our economy and will our capacity to manage economic growth be removed?  The answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  If we can manage our economy having lost the two levers to which I referred earlier, we will retain our capacity to maintain economic growth and confer prosperity on our citizens at a differential rate compared to other European countries.  That is the key issue. If growth slows down in France or Germany, there is no reason it should slow down in Ireland or that our economy should enter recession.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated &mdash; his point was reiterated by Senator Quinn that the new situation would demand &ldquo;an intensification of the flexibility and problem solving approach displayed by the Government and the social partners over the past decade.  Structural policies for the development of Ireland's competitiveness, as well as prudent budgetary policy and appropriate pay developments, will be critical.&rdquo; That is a succinct and accurate summary of this issue, which involves competitiveness and how it can be maintained through wages, infrastructure, the tax environment &mdash; including capital tax and income tax &mdash; the social consensus which has been critical in developing the Celtic tiger and control of public spending.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a significant statement in referring to the growth of £500 million ahead of budgetary targets in revenue from tax earnings. He said &ldquo;I have already reiterated that these additional receipts will be used to increase the general government surplus rather than fund extra expenditure.&rdquo; That is critical and we must adhere to the Minister's advice if we are to ensure that some of the benefits to be accrued are not thrown away.  There are things we can do within our remit to ensure that economic growth is <Col N="38" /> maintained as we look forward to joining the single currency.  There will be a smaller threat of inflation if these things are done properly.</P>
    <P>We need a clear and coherent economic strategy to maintain and enhance our competitiveness within EMU.  The basic economic prescription must follow that which has been part of my party's advocacy since its foundation 13 years ago. Essentially this will mean liberalising our economy on a range of fronts, beginning with privatisation &mdash; the Labour Party describes it as strategic alliance &mdash; which should be returned to the political agenda.  The State should be the regulatory body for industries but it should not be responsible for their operation.  That regulation should be designed to protect the interests of the consumer not, as in the past, those of the utilities involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government has decided to float Telecom Éireann on the stock exchange next year.  That move is long overdue.  Everyone seems to be in favour of privatisation but it is remarkable that it only occurs when the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil are in Government. Deregulation is also essential.  We should promote competition, not prevent it.  For almost a decade, Telecom Éireann has been allowed to frustrate the development of real competition in telecommunications through its control of Cablelink. That company should be completely demerged from Telecom Éireann and sold to an independent operator.  The new owner could invest in upgrading the Cablelink infrastructure and offer real competition to Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government intends to move in this direction in the near future and that Cablelink will split from Telecom Éireann.  If that happens it will be one of the best economic decisions made by an Irish Government and the benefits to be derived from it could be enormous.  It is obvious that we need to create more jobs, which must be of high quality and offer good wages and prospects.  If we want to create those jobs, we must develop a modern efficient telecommunications market which is cost effective by international standards.  We do not have such a market at present and we are paying the price for it. Major investment projects are being lost because of our failure to take these issues seriously.</P>
    <P>Competition for mobile international investment has never been more intense.  The countries of central and eastern Europe will be able to undercut us in terms of wages.  We must ensure that no one is in a position to undercut us on the quality or cost of key services such as telecommunications or energy, which we have had success providing and which are becoming increasingly significant factors in attracting mobile international investment.</P>
    <P>Public private partnerships must also feature in Irish public policy.  We have a major infrastructural deficit and our road network falls short of what is necessary in a modern exporting economy. There are also major gaps in areas such as sewage and water treatment which have had detrimental effects on the environment.  They in turn <Col N="39" /> can deter inward international investment which seeks a clean environment in which to locate.</P>
    <P>Continued investment in these areas is essential if we are to sustain economic growth, but we must be aware that there will be a fall off in EU support, which will make investment more difficult to find.  We can argue, as we did on the Order of Business, about whether the whole country or only the west should be an objective 1 region. However, that argument will be overtaken by an overall diminution in our net take from EU supports. There is a role for the private sector in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>Private sector provision of public infrastructure is common in other countries.  There have been no such efforts in this country since the opening of the east-link and west-link bridges in Dublin. The Government should now look at the possibility of similar initiatives.  The concept of public and private partnership must be revived and encouraged.</P>
    <P>In the struggle for competitive advantage inside EMU, taxation will be a key battleground. We need lower tax rates across the board and I am glad to see the Government has made an excellent start.  By the time this Administration completes its term of office capital taxes will be 20 per cent, the standard rate of corporation tax will be nearer 20 per cent and falling rapidly towards the target rate of 12.5 per cent and personal income tax rates will be at 20 per cent and 40 per cent.  Not many European countries will be able to match that kind of enterprise environment by the turn of the century.</P>
    <P>Few countries have been so successful at exploiting the incentive of low taxation as Ireland.  The special 10 per cent manufacturing rate has been the cornerstone of our economic success over the past 20 years.  It stands to reason that we can benefit enormously by applying low rate taxes to other areas.</P>
    <P>Social partnership has served us well for several years and it is vital that the partnership model is retained until we join EMU.  The next partnership deal will have to address the issue of flexibility, to which the Minister referred.  It will especially have to address the issue of how Irish companies in the exposed sector of the economy will be able to cope with a sharp fall in the value of sterling.  I am confident the Government, the unions and the employers will be able to come up with new models to enable us cope with the challenges of EMU.  Irish companies must have the flexibility of response to enable them reduce costs when times are tough and to share the benefits with their work forces when times are good.</P>
    <P>Membership of the EU has been enormously beneficial to Ireland in terms of the Structural Funds, agricultural transfers and free access to the European market.  The more enthusiastically we have embraced Europe the more we have benefited.  Being a founder member of EMU will keep us in the European fast track.  Staying outside EMU will raise serious questions about our <Col N="40" /> commitment to Europe and to the tight fiscal discipline inherent in EMU.  That would send a negative signal to foreign investors on whom we are heavily reliant.</P>
    <P>Our commitment to fiscal discipline is one of the benefits which the convergence criteria of the Maastricht Treaty brought to us and which we have adhered to in all but one respect.  There are still difficulties regarding our debt.  While the debt to GNP ratio has headed in the right direction, which will enable us to enter EMU, we must continue to be concerned about the level of debt.  In this regard, I spoke earlier about the need to curtail Government spending.</P>
    <P>Entry to EMU will be one of the biggest challenges ever experienced by the Irish economy. For us to prosper, workers, business and the Government will have to respond to the challenge in an innovative and imaginative way.  I am confident that will be done.  I wish the Minister well when he attends the ECOFIN meeting at the beginning of May and I am sure he and the Government will continue to protect the interests of producers, workers and taxpayers in the months and years ahead and that the benefit we expect to accrue from EMU will be shared throughout society.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This country benefited enormously from entry to the EEC in 1973.  Nobody at the time could have anticipated the prosperity which membership would bring.  We owe a great deal to Europe for the way in which the country has prospered and the way in which the people of Europe have invested money here over the past 25 years.</P>
      <P>During this period we have seen the difference which high and low interest rates have made to the economy.  For many years, the country was ravaged by high interest rates which proved disastrous for business, farmers and home owners. However, in recent years we have seen the benefits of low interest rates.  Property values have increased, the country has boomed and employment growth has been enormous.</P>
      <P>Few can disagree with our entry to EMU because it will provide a strong single currency. It will ensure that, unlike on previous occasions, we will not be vulnerable to currency speculation. However, there are concerns.  Some take the view that changing to the euro will have the same impact as the change to decimalisation, when we moved from having 240p to the pound to 100p. The Minister should allay their fears that our currency will be worth much less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People are also worried that property prices which have soared in recent years, will soar even higher because we will be part of a strong currency with low inflation and low interest rates. There is a fear that prices will go beyond the reach of young people, which would be disastrous. <Col N="41" /> It is bad enough at present for young couples who are attempting to buy a house to start up a home.</P>
    <P>When negotiating the next round of Structural Funds, the Government should ensure that Objective One status is given to the western region, which has performed poorly in recent years.  Structural funding should also be matched by Exchequer funding.  The economy has grown considerably.  We now have one of the strongest economies in Europe.  In view of this, Exchequer funding should be directed at poorer areas.</P>
    <P>At what rate should our currency enter EMU? Would it be advantageous to have a strong or a weak currency?  At present our currency is much weaker than sterling.  While this has advantages for exporters it has disadvantages for importers. Where should our currency be on the day of reckoning? Nobody in financial circles seems to be able to say whether we should have a weak or strong currency on that date.</P>
    <P>I favour Ireland's entry into EMU.  It will bring benefits in terms of a stronger currency and lower rates of interest.  It will also put pressure on the banks.  There has been a great deal of talk about our financial institutions in recent weeks.  One would think, given the number of financial institutions that there would be more competition. Towns the size of Castlebar have about 12 lending institutions.  The competition provided by such institutions should result in very low interest rates but that has not been the case.  We will see much lower interest rates with the advent of EMU when German and other banks can put real pressure on Irish banks.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Government has decided to enter EMU.  However, will the Minister tell us at what rate our currency should be on the day of reckoning?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, said at the beginning of this debate about how Ireland is well placed to participate in EMU from the outset.  We have always been pro Europe and pro EMU, despite our reservations. EMU involves a certain loss of independence but we believe the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages.  The ESRI has continually been strongly in favour of EMU, which has been a source of great comfort to us.</P>
      <P>A case for remaining outside, at least until Britain decides to join, has existed but we have overruled it.  Everyone accepts Britain will join but it wants to time its entry in terms of its best interests and other issues.  We are heading into the unknown and Members referred to uncharted waters today.  Our entry to EMU involves an act of faith but we have done the calculations as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EMU begins on 1 January 1999 with the launch of the euro and the irrevocable fixing of the conversion rates of the various currencies.  D-day is next month and, no doubt, there will be nervousness. It is intended that Ireland will join at an exchange rate which meets the best needs of our economy.  This is not an easy call, as the Minister <Col N="42" /> has readily admitted.  There will be major changes and EMU will be irreversible.  Nevertheless, the common currency will make trade and travel between states much easier.  Once people acclimatise to the new position they will not want to return to the old ways, in terms of the costs, hassle and time wasting associated with changing currencies when one is travelling.</P>
    <P>Britain's intentions remain the big imponderable for us.  Will Britain seek competitive advantage through its currency policy or will it quickly adopt a tracking mechanism with a view to easing its membership in due course?  The latter option would assist stability from the perspective of the other member states.  Our biggest fear is that sterling will be volatile against the euro.  If sterling were to fluctuate wildly much of our industry would be very exposed.  We are repeatedly told that sterling is overvalued and well above what the Bank of England considers to be its equilibrium level.</P>
    <P>Given our continuing level of trade with Britain, one occasionally wonders if it was wise for us to ever break from sterling.  If we had not done so it would be much easier now to remain outside EMU until both countries reached a common position on joining the single currency together.  That, however, is not on the menu.</P>
    <P>However, we can take comfort from the ESRI report.  The Minister cited the conclusion of Terry Baker of the institute that the risks of external shocks are now thought to be considerably lower than they were in 1996 for three reasons: an increase in the number of prospective EMU participants; a massive appreciation of sterling; and a fundamental policy shift by the UK Government in favour of eventual membership of EMU. We all concur with those views.</P>
    <P>Preparing for EMU has been a good disciplinary measure for Ireland.  The policies pursued by successive Governments have greatly strengthened our economy.  One of the primary objectives of the ESCB will be to maintain price stability, as well as implementing the single monetary policy.  Experts tell us Ireland is well qualified for entry to EMU and we have been accepted with flying colours.  This is because of our growth levels, <i>per capita</i> income, employment increases, low inflation and low budget deficits.</P>
    <P>We are tying ourselves to Europe irrevocably and, therefore, we must make it work.  We have already shown over the years that we have a great capacity to make European matters work.  There is a large element of trust involved for us in EMU but, on balance, I very much believe it is the right course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Coghlan referred to the break with sterling.  Varying economic opinions were expressed publicly at that time on the wisdom of that move.  Many commentators cast doubt on our ability as a small island to manage our currency effectively and productively in the interests of the country.  History has shown it was a very progressive, courageous and correct move and one which, despite the Senator's comments, <Col N="43" /> has contributed to our economic planning and success in recent decades particularly the last one.</P>
      <P>Those who succeeded in winning our independence made many sacrifices in the early years of the State so that we could have a real independent economy.  We can cast our minds back to the tremendous deprivation caused by the economic war of the 1930s.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>We were not but I am sure the Senator is as close a student of modern Irish history as I am and I do not think he will disagree with what I am saying.  Those people would be very proud of the economic achievements of this State.</P>
      <P>This is another step in asserting our independence. Some would say it is somewhat analogous in that we broke with sterling to have our own currency in the late 1970s and we are now joining a broader European currency.  We have been enthusiastic members of the EU.  I listened with interest to Senator Finneran's comments regarding some recent intemperate utterances by former Tory Minister, Norman Tebbit.  We should make allowances for such comments which are understandable in the context of the tremendous power Britain had in the early 20th century.  In the mid-century the boast was that the sun never set on the British Empire.  Currently the sun shines on the empire for a couple of hours each day at most. I see why this change is regretted and why it inhibits people's vision regarding the very progressive developments throughout continental Europe in which we have been a significant player over the past 40 years, particularly since our accession to the Community in 1973.</P>
      <P>Management of our currency was an important component in managing our economy.  Certain disciplines and instruments could be applied in the past in order to control, direct or influence economic events.  Once we join EMU we will find ourselves involved in a different level of discipline and different skills will be required.  Our experience over the years in ERM, in which we have successfully managed our currency, will stand us in good stead and provide confidence in the knowledge that we can successfully manage it to the advantage of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has made a historic and honourable contribution to Europe over the years.  Its contribution in the early Christian days was significant. There has been a fair amount of reciprocity for that investment many centuries ago through convergence and the various funds which have been available and which have had a major impact in ensuring that the level and standard of development, quality of infrastructure and competitiveness of the economy have been brought almost to the level of the EU.  It is significant, and perhaps the most compelling response to those such as Norman Tebbit, that the standard of living here has surpassed that of Northern Ireland; <Col N="44" /> we are about to surpass the standard of living of Britain, something which was undreamed of a number of decades ago.  I have no doubt we will also play our part in the same constructive spirit of unselfishness which fired those of many centuries ago as we approach the position of being net contributors to the EU budget with other economies lagging behind the EU norm being assisted.</P>
    <P>We must ensure the competitiveness of the economy and the discipline to meet the convergence criteria are safeguarded by the current and successive Governments.  In this context we should recall events which occurred under recent Governments, particularly that led by Garret FitzGerald from 1982-7.  The profligacy of that Government almost ruined the economy.  Entry to EMU will ensure such irresponsible Governments will not be possible in future.  We must recognise the disciplines and respond in the manner desired by the people so that those who follow the current generation of politicians can be proud of the mark and decisions we have made and that they will look back with incredulity to the time when there was a plethora of currencies in the EU.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their participation in the debate and their many interesting and constructive comments.  While the decision as to whether Ireland will be part of this next step in European development was made by the people in 1992, it is important that public representatives engage in debate in order that the issues are aired and to ensure public awareness is raised.</P>
      <P>The movement of Europe towards full economic and monetary union and the adoption of a single currency, the euro, is not simply a question of how a particular country or interest can gain an immediate benefit or how they would be affected by an immediate cost.  It is a quantum leap in the construction of a European Community based on peace and prosperity.</P>
      <P>I reiterate the long-term strategic economic rationale for Ireland's long standing commitment to European integration.  It is clear that when the majority of EU member states come together to create an economic and monetary union covering nearly 300 million people, Ireland should take part and not remain a bystander.  On examining the progress and potential of Ireland as a member of the European Community and the relative long-term economic performance of the countries forming EMU, it is clear that any attempt to disengage from our involvement in Europe, such as an ambivalent or negative attitude to EMU, could only be damaging to the interests of the people who decided on EMU participation in a referendum where the vote in favour was 70 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EMU will mark a substantial change in the economic environment of the EU.  This is true for all member states, whether they join EMU.  Continuation of the <i>status quo</i> is not an option for any member state.  EMU will change things, even for member states which do not join.  Nobody is <Col N="45" /> pretending there will not be challenges, but we must think of these in the context of what life would be like for a member state which remained outside EMU, particularly a small country such as Ireland, the prosperity and growth of which fundamentally depend on trade and access to overseas markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister has already pointed out that sterling is well above what most commentators, including the Bank of England, consider to be its equilibrium level.  Therefore, sterling would have to fall a long way before it could be considered to represent an economic shock.  As the Minister pointed out we should not be complacent about preparing for this possibility, no matter how remote.  Information contained in the Forfás information pack will, I hope, be helpful in this regard.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that an economic shock that affects the EMU area as a whole will be dealt with jointly by member states and the relevant Community institutions, including the ECB. However, a successful response to a shock which affects Ireland in particular will depend to a large extent on how well the Irish economy has been prepared in advance to cope with such an eventuality. As the Minister said, the use of interest and exchange rates as economic instruments to deal with shocks which are particular to Ireland will no longer be available in EMU.  This means that the adjustment process in the case of future shocks which are particular to Ireland will have to be assisted through a combination of fiscal and pay policy and structural reform.</P>
    <P>The terms of the stability and growth pact, requiring the Government to achieve a budgetary position of close to balance or surplus in normal economic conditions, can allow fiscal policy to help stabilise the economy following an economic shock.  One of the main objectives of the pact is to help ensure that, by making provision in the good times, sufficient flexibility will hopefully exist in the bad times to allow fiscal policy be used to cope with the problems which might then exist.  A medium-term budgetary objective of being close to balance or in surplus will, however, require the adoption of prudent policies in relation to the rate of growth in public expenditure and appropriate tax policy within the overall framework of Partnership 2000.</P>
    <P>Enhanced competitiveness has an important role to play in the economy's capacity to successfully accommodate economic shocks.  Provided we maintain our competitiveness, disturbances can be absorbed more readily by appropriate adjustment to domestic costs and prices.  The social partnership arrangements are important in that regard in providing a framework for both long-term competitive labour cost development and for strategic and dynamic responses to shocks, such as the provision for review under Partnership 2000.  Also important are the maintenance of competition in product markets and the development of suitable infrastructure &mdash; both hard, that is, physical infrastructure, and soft, that is, social infrastructure such as public <Col N="46" /> services and the regulatory framework, the skills and knowledge base and information management.</P>
    <P>There are those who say we should wait and see, expressing fears that in various ways Ireland is not ready to be part of economic and monetary union.  In that respect, I refer to the views of the European Commission.  One of the fundamental roles of the Commission is guardian of the European treaties and it is a role that is not taken lightly.  It is the recommendation of the Commission that Ireland fulfils the necessary conditions for the adoption of the single currency, a recommendation based on both its convergence report and on the report prepared by the EMI.</P>
    <P>More particularly in Ireland's case, the convergence reports show clearly that we are ready.  We are among the best performing member states on several criteria, including price stability and the budgetary position.  As indicated by the EMI, we are on track to fulfil the requirements of the stability and growth pact and of having a medium-term budgetary position of close to balance or in surplus.  Perhaps as important is our position on those areas of structural economic policy which may present challenges to other governments' performance in EMU, such as unemployment, demographic trends and high public debt.  In each of these areas, Ireland is well placed to perform well in EMU.  Unemployment is falling and is already below the EU average, our demographic position is favourable, our pension provisions are much better than those in most of our EMU partners and our debt is forecast by the EMI and the Commission to fall below the 60 per cent GDP reference value later this year.</P>
    <P>Irish business is well placed to compete in the euro zone.  The performance of Irish firms on European and international markets is clear proof of that.  We must continue to build on our achievements.  We may be fit but we must strive to be fitter.  The social partnership framework &mdash; and particularly the work of the National Competitiveness Council established under Partnership 2000 &mdash; provides the basis for ongoing improvements to our competitiveness.  That framework of partnership is a significant comparative advantage for Ireland.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment about possible surplus reserves of European central banks, including the Central Bank of Ireland, following the establishment of the ECB.  I note Senator Finneran's comments in this regard.  The ECB is empowered under its statutes to call from participating national central banks up to 50,000 million euro in foreign exchange reserves &mdash; that is, assets in currencies other than the euro.  Each national central bank's contribution will be in proportion to its shareholding in the European Central Bank which, in turn, will be in proportion to each member state's share of the euro area's GDP and population &mdash; like shareholdings in the EMI at present.  In addition, the Central Bank will be subscribing to the capital of the ECB, which is to total 5,000 million euro.  The Irish subscription is likely to be around £35 million.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> These will remain assets on the balance sheet of the Central Bank, although they will not be under the control of the bank.  However, it should be noted that both the foreign reserves contribution and the capital shareholding will earn income for the Central Bank and thus indirectly for the Exchequer, as the participating national central banks will share the profits of the ECB among themselves.  This will leave a substantial amount of assets, both domestic euro assets and foreign non-euro assets, with the Central Bank. However, just because they are not needed as official external reserves does not make them surplus. Certain commentators on this issue, speaking of billions of surplus reserves, appear to have forgotten that the Central Bank's balance sheet includes liabilities as well as assets.  These include deposits from financial institutions, the Exchequer deposit and legal tender notes.  It is not possible at this time to assess whether the Central Bank will have assets in EMU which are surplus to its requirements.  However, the Minister will keep the situation under review as the shape of EMU unfolds.</P>
    <P>As regards the practical preparations for the changeover to the euro, the Minister has already outlined the arrangements the Government is putting in place to ensure that the changeover to the euro proceeds smoothly, both in the public administration and across the board.  The establishment of the euro changeover board of Ireland will drive arrangements for the detailed implementation of the changeover, including the areas of public and consumer information.  The successful EMU business awareness campaign being run by Forfás will be complemented by the rest of the national information programme aimed at the needs of the public.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, Forfás has a specific campaign aimed at small and medium sized enterprises.  I also agree that there is a big job to be done in terms of educating the public prior to the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002.  My Department will give this aspect of preparation a high priority over the period leading up to 1 January 2002.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their constructive participation in this debate.  We are on the threshold of one of the most momentous changes in the Irish and European economies.  Our participation has received support across a range of Irish opinion, including the social partners, the vast majority of public representatives and, most importantly, the people.  Our priority now is to ensure that we respond to the challenges and make the most of the opportunities opened up to us.  The recommendations of the European Commission are that we are ready, a view which is widely shared in Ireland and elsewhere.  That view is also endorsed by the Government.  I ask this House to respond by supporting this motion.</P>

      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I am grateful to the Minister of State for his attendance.</P>
      <P>South Tipperary County Council has submitted a proposal for two towns in south Tipperary to be designated for inclusion in the urban renewal scheme.  Tipperary town is given precedence for renewal in the submission.  The reasons for this are many and varied.</P>
      <P>Tipperary has been devastated by major loss of industry in recent years.  Many industries have closed down, creating huge unemployment.  The proximity of the town to the fast growing services centres of Limerick and Clonmel has resulted in Tipperary suffering from the shadow effect, whereby private investment is drawn to the other towns.  Limerick and Clonmel benefited from inclusion in previous urban renewal schemes thereby increasing their competitive advantage to the detriment of Tipperary town.</P>
      <P>Development has also been impeded by inappropriate land use close to the town's centre and poor traffic circulation.  The N24 passes through the Tipperary town centre but the town lacks a focal point or a central area of civic space.  The high level of unemployment, lack of investment and poor physical appearance have resulted in a poor image for such a well known town.</P>
      <P>Tipperary is situated near the Glen of Aherlow, an area of great natural beauty which has considerable tourism potential.  Indeed, the name of the town is famous throughout the country. However, as a result of its huge unemployment, investment has suffered and Tipperary is probably one of the most neglected towns in the south of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I can offer the Minister of State many more reasons for the designation of Tipperary town for urban renewal.  There has been a great deal of lobbying on the part of many interests in the town and it is generally agreed, particularly by the independent consultants who were employed by South Tipperary County Council, that the inclusion of the town in the urban renewal scheme would be of great benefit.  It is probably the best boost a Government could give the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same is true of the second town proposed for inclusion in the scheme, Carrick-on-Suir.  The people of Carrick-on-Suir were disappointed with the results of the independent consultants' report which concluded that Carrick-on-Suir should be placed second, behind Tipperary town, in the submission. However, it was unanimously agreed by South Tipperary County Council that both towns be included in the proposal, particularly because <Col N="49" /> of the huge unemployment problems in both areas.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give Tipperary town the chance it so badly needs when he is making his decision on what towns should benefit from inclusion in the urban renewal scheme.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Molloy, is unable to be in the House this evening and he asked me to respond on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Cases for designation under the new urban renewal scheme, which is due to come into operation on 1 August 1998, will be considered on the basis of the integrated area plans prepared by local authorities for areas of greatest priority in urban renewal terms.  Guidelines were issued setting out the criteria to be used by local authorities in the selection of such areas.  A copy of these guidelines is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>A broadly based expert advisory panel, which the Minister of State established last year, will assess the integrated area plans when received and make recommendations in relation to the designation of areas for tax incentives.  Tipperary (South Riding) County Council has submitted integrated area plans in respect of Tipperary town and Carrick-on-Suir, which were prepared on the basis of the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The integrated area plans from relevant local authorities have now been received in the Department.  After an initial assessment within the Department, copies of the plans are being sent to the advisory panel as soon as possible for its consideration.  Until such time as all integrated area plans have been examined by the expert advisory panel and considered further in the light of the panel's recommendations, it will not be possible to say which towns are likely to be included in the new scheme.</P>
      <P>Integrated area plans are expected to set out a range of objectives for the future development of the disadvantaged urban areas to which they relate.  They are required to balance physical development against social, economic and community development, conservation and amenity improvements.</P>
      <P>The guidelines issued to local authorities to assist in the preparation of integrated area plans specified that the award of incentives can only be justified where it can be shown that they will assist in overcoming identifiable barriers to development.  The case for applying particular incentives has to be set against the value and type of development to which this will lead, together with the broader economic and social improvements expected to emerge from the implementation of the integrated area plan.</P>

      <P>I raise this matter &mdash; conditions in the breast clinic in St. Vincent's Hospital &mdash; because it has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents and by other women, some of whom have attended the clinic to be treated for breast cancer.  While they have high praise for the service provided by the staff at the hospital, they are particularly concerned that the clinic is under severe pressure.</P>
      <P>There appears to be an increasing incidence of breast cancer throughout the country.  In recent weeks I have encountered eight women who have been treated for breast cancer of varying degrees of severity; in fact, two of the women were in my class in school in Roscrea.  It is particularly worrying to meet women of one's own age and with whom one grew up who have been stricken by breast cancer.</P>
      <P>There is a weekly outpatients' clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital which caters for between 200 and 300 women each week.  As a result, there are long queues and long waiting periods for attention. While patients receive a courteous and good service from the staff, they are under considerable pressure when attending the clinic.  One woman, who is in recovery and must attend the clinic on a monthly basis, is obliged to travel from Nenagh on the train and spend a number of hours waiting in the clinic to see a doctor for 20 to 25 minutes before returning to Nenagh.  This places additional pressure on a woman in recovery after already having been through a traumatic experience or on a woman being treated for the first time or who is unsure whether a lump she has found is cancerous.</P>
      <P>I want to know whether past indications of additional funding for the clinic and the expressed wish of staff that it should be a daily clinic, something which would obviously relieve pressure, are being responded to by the Department of Health and Children.  Will the Minister tell me if there are any plans, possibly in the overall context of the development of St. Vincent's Hospital, to give increased funding to the breast clinic?  I look forward to his response.</P>
      <P>I know the Department of Health and Children and successive Ministers have done excellent work in raising consciousness of breast cancer, providing services at health board and at local levels and providing support services.  I do not deny that.  However, I raise this matter because it has been mentioned to me by a number of people and because it is part of the role we play in this House.  Has any thought been put into the need for support services for spouses of those suffering from cancer and breast cancer especially?  I await the Minister's response to the need for additional funding for the development of this clinic in St. Vincent's Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>Breast cancer is a major contributor to the premature death of women in this country resulting in approximately <Col N="51" /> 640 deaths per annum.  In 1996, 278 women aged under 65 died from breast cancer.  I fully appreciate the great level of trauma and stress experienced by women found to be suffering or who suspect they are suffering from this condition. The Government is committed to the enhancement of services in this area at both national and regional levels.</P>
      <P>A key principle of the health strategy is the need to develop regional self-sufficiency in the provision of health services.  This principle is reflected in the national cancer strategy which sets out a plan for reorganising cancer treatment services around supra-regional and regional cancer centres.  Each region will have a high quality cancer service for treatments which can be administered locally with speedy access to appropriate specialist services in the supra-regional centres.  Each centre has a regional director of cancer services who is currently overseeing the reorganisation process and preparing a regional plan for the development of services.  A number of these plans have been prepared while others are being finalised.  Part of the approach under these plans will be to develop appropriate services for the detection and treatment of breast cancer.  In this regard, a number of breast clinics in hospitals throughout the country have already been financially assisted.</P>
      <P>Another key objective in the national cancer strategy is the establishment of screening programmes for the earliest possible detection of breast cancer.  It is hoped to commence screening in phase one of the breast cancer screening programme in September of this year.  As part of my Department's national breast screening programme, the sum of £360,000 has recently been allocated to St. Vincent's Hospital against the cost of priority equipment required for phase one of the programme.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties faced by patients attending the breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital.  One of the principal difficulties is that there has been a significant increase in the number of patients attending the clinic, many of whom are referred from outside the St. Vincent's Hospital catchment area.  For example, the number of attendances at the clinic has increased from approximately 6,200 in 1996 to nearly 7,300 in 1997.  The clinic at St. Vincent's was the first of its kind in this country and, to some extent, its reputation has led to this dramatic rise in referrals.  The breast clinic at St. Vincent's Hospital is not a national centre; rather it should be seen as a model for the development of breast clinics on a regional basis.  The priority is to ensure that women who need to avail of the services of a breast clinic can receive a multi-disciplinary service at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The hospital management and the clinic staff are doing everything possible to alleviate waiting times and to improve services.  The hospital has stressed that women referred to the clinic who require urgent appointments are given appointments at the following Friday clinic.  A series of measures has been put in place to reduce pressure on the clinic and further improvements are planned.  The hospital is conscious of the need to curtail the number of inappropriate referrals to the clinic and it has been in contact with general practitioners as part of an ongoing education campaign.</P>
    <P>The hospital operates a consultant led clinic every Friday.  To improve the level of service provided, my Department made additional funding available to the hospital to facilitate the introduction of new nurse led clinics which are held twice weekly on Mondays and Thursdays.  These additional clinics deal with return patients who would not necessarily require to be seen by a consultant. In addition, one of the consultant surgeons and the specialist breast clinic nurse are seeing patients every Wednesday.  These clinics are focused on return patients who require time for discussion and counselling.  The authorities at St. Vincent's have advised me that the block booking of patients on Friday has ceased and patients are now given appointment times.</P>
    <P>Since October 1997 the hospital has carried out a review of the systems currently in place at the breast clinic and has issued recommendations for improvement of the service for clinic users.  I understand many of the recommendations are in the process of being implemented and improvements to date include the computerisation of the breast clinic since 27 February of this year, which includes patients receiving appointment times, patients outside the catchment area being facilitated in relation to appointment times, new patients being seen first as many require access to diagnostic facilities on the same day, a senior administrative officer who also acts as a liaison officer being appointed to improve the patient services, the general manager responsible for clinical services receiving a weekly management report on the breast clinic and the chief executive at the hospital intending to have a follow up on the original review of the breast clinic services after six months.</P>
    <P>The major capital upgrading programme approved in 1997 for St. Vincent's at a cost of approximately £50 million includes provision for the complete upgrading of the breast clinic.  This work is progressing and construction work will commence at an early date.</P>
