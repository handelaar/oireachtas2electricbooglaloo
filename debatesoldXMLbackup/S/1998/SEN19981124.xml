      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, in view of the decision by Dublin Corporation to introduce a limited park and ride system in Dublin for the pre-Christmas period, to encourage an expansion of the scheme to other areas on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Leonard of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Finance to provide special incentives to attract industries to Border towns which have suffered as a result of 30 years of armed struggle due to close proximity to the Border.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is item 2, Education (No. 2) Bill, 1997, Committee Stage to be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume from what the Leader said that, as this is a substantial Bill, it will be dealt with in a steady and ordered way and that there is no intention of concluding it today given that there are so many amendments.  Perhaps the Whips could agree that it will be debated until 7 p.m. and resume tomorrow.  Since this is the first serious legislation the House has debated this session and some Members have a deep interest in it, it should not be rushed.  Will the Leader give an assurance that there is no intention of concluding the Bill today and that it will be dealt with in a flexible and orderly way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> Will the Leader indicate what legislation he intends to take in the remaining three to four weeks of this session?  Will he confirm the Mental Health Bill will be published this session?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Leader there are 96 amendments tabled to the legislation and that it will not be possible to deal with them today unless it is intended to sit through the night, in which case he should indicate that is his intention. Even on that basis, they would not be concluded. It is not a good way to conduct business.  The Leader said Committee Stage would be taken today and, as Senator Manning said, that does not indicate if his view is that it should conclude today.  As the legislation has been in existence for more than two years, this is no time to rush it.  It would be wrong if people did not have their say. At same time, for business to be conducted with a certain amount of dispatch, people should be able to plan their way around the debate on the legislation.  I would agree to some arrangement as outlined by Senator Manning where it would be discussed until 7 o'clock or 8 o'clock tonight and resumed tomorrow.  If it were concluded tomorrow, Report Stage could be taken next week.  As it is, the Minister has tabled a number of amendments to the legislation which means it must return to Dáil.  There is no immediate rush and it is hugely important people have an opportunity to air their views.  Perhaps the Leader would give a clear outline of today's business so that we can co-operate to deal with business efficiently.</P>
      <P>I again ask for a debate on literacy or education. I will insist on this next week if I do not receive a date or time from the Minister.  Another report from the OECD today indicates the need for greater investment in resources for primary education.  Will the Minister and the Leader keep it in mind as an issue which needs to be discussed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Senators Manning and O'Toole said about the Order of Business. If the Leader persists in taking Committee Stage today and Report Stage tomorrow, as has been indicated, we will certainly oppose the Order of Business.  The Bill should be presented in an orderly fashion.  There are 96 amendments, many of which are substantial, that have been tabled by the Minister.  In its previous form, the Bill spent approximately a year in the Dáil and now, as the Education (No. 2) Bill, it has again spent most of a year in the Dáil.  Two years or thereabouts have been devoted to this Bill, which is the most important legislation to come before this House or the Dáil since the Government took office.  It is not proper for us to take Committee Stage today and Report Stage tomorrow. A breathing space is required so that we will have an opportunity to reflect upon it and ensure that a full contribution is made by this House in dealing with this important legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole called for a debate on literacy and adult education.  The Minister of State at the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> Department of Education and Science today published a Green Paper on adult education and this House would be the appropriate forum in which to introduce the debate on it.  The Leader should arrange for a debate on the Green Paper on adult education at the earliest opportunity, perhaps next week.</P>
    <P>Will the Leader find out if any legislation is planned to deal with the demolition of our architectural and literary heritage, given what happened over the last couple of days to one of James Joyce's homes in Millbourne Avenue, Drumcondra?  The planning regulations were broken and a house that had enormous cultural, literary and architectural value was demolished without any planning permission; indeed, it was contrary to and in breach of planning permission. Such architectural and cultural vandals should be prosecuted and should receive the full rigours of the law.  Seeing that the house was in the Taoiseach's constituency, I would like to know if there are any plans to provide legislation that would protect our architectural heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello with regard to the house associated with James Joyce. Because of their unfortunate circumstances, the Joyce family lived at about 17 different locations throughout the city of Dublin.  Not all of them were of great architectural distinction, and that could also be said of No. 2 Millbourne Avenue. It was not of great architectural significance but it was very significant in terms of a passage in <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.</i>  It simply beggars belief that the developer did not know this.  It is a classic case of a northside planning permission being activated.  Legislation exists for taking this kind of house into public ownership but, unfortunately, on this occasion the corporation was too slow.  That should be recorded in the Seanad as a matter of regret.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1 to the Order of Business: &ldquo;That item 29, motion 17, be taken today&rdquo;. This motion deals with East Timor.  The item is extraordinarily prophetic because 60 people were murdered recently by Indonesian troops.  Once more there has been a massive infusion of Indonesian troops into that tragic island and we are poised for an even greater tragedy.  Students have invaded the parliament building in Dili and are holding a protest there.  This is an opportunity for us to do something, with your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh.  We often hear it said on the Order of Business that we want to make this House more relevant, both nationally and internationally. Will the Leader facilitate us with even half an hour, giving people four or five minutes each to pass this motion?  I think everyone in the House would agree with that in the present tragic circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of amendments have been put down on the Education Bill.  Debate on them might not conclude today so there should be room for flexibility.  The Minister for Education <Col N="332" /> and Science would probably welcome a coffee break or sos.  I appeal to the Leader to provide half an hour for the House to pass this motion. There would then be an instrument which the House could transmit to Jakarta indicating its concern.</P>
    <P>The issue of overseas development aid will probably be raised again by my colleagues on this side of the House.  I have just left a conference in the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, sponsored by the Department of Foreign Affairs, on Irish aid and non-governmental organisations.  It is a superbly organised conference.  Perhaps the Leader will convey to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, my congratulations on it.</P>
    <P>I asked who financed it and whether anybody from the Department of Finance was present to see what good value the Department is getting. Not one person from that Department was present despite an invitation having been sent. This is the Department which is sitting in judgment on spending money on overseas development aid.  If it wishes to do that, it should send a representative to see the excellence of the product the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Minister of State are providing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCreganFF" hpid="Mr. J. Cregan Mr. J. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard an alarming statistic on the radio this morning.  Approximately 55,000 people under the age of 25 years have failed to register to vote.  This is disturbing given that tomorrow is the closing date for registration.  Will the Leader allocate time for a debate on this matter? It is extremely relevant and important.</P>
      <P>We should adopt a co-ordinated approach to this issue and initiate a promotional drive to make people aware of their responsibilities. While it is their responsibility to register, there is also a responsibility on politicians to do something about this alarming statistic and to improve voter registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Green Paper on adult education has already been mentioned while Senator O'Toole and others have called for a debate on literacy.  Today, statistics were issued on the number of people leaving education after primary school.  That number is substantial and many of the early school leavers are subsumed into Youthreach programmes.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Education and Science to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the long dispute on conditions and pay for directors, resource personnel and other staff involved in the Youthreach programme?  I brought this to the Minister's attention during the debate on the Education Bill.  The people running these programmes are doing wonderful work and it is a pity that the dispute should be allowed to drag on for so long.  Perhaps representations by the Leader might encourage the Minister to bring the matter to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I join Senator Norris in requesting that time be made available to discuss East Timor.  There is considerable urgency about it. We must view with extreme concern the television pictures depicting what is happening in Indonesia, particularly the fact that a religious war appears to be developing.  It is desirable that this would be an all party motion</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Absolutely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the course we adopted on the Lisbon declaration following the conference on East Timor.  An all party resolution from the Seanad would also be desirable in this case.  I ask the Leader to deal with this as early as possible, if not today at least on Thursday when the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs will be in the House to discuss overseas development aid.  She could also attend the debate on East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Having it today might save lives. I am happy to agree to it being a Government motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave the decision to the Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a matter which should be of concern to everybody and which the Leader should raise with the Minister for Public Enterprise and possibly debate in the Seanad: it is the alarming fact that the ESB is in serious jeopardy of having to reduce power supply to its customers because it is not permitted to build another power station due to ideological rigidity on the part of the Government and the EU.  The latter claims the ESB cannot build another power station until full competition comes into operation. However, by the time the ideological niceties are met, it will be too late to build it because of the amount of planning time required.  There is a danger of an electrical supply crisis within the next two years, which makes this an extremely urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to comment on the appalling decision taken by the Department of the Environment and Local Government to make life difficult for asylum seekers who wish to apply for driving licences.  This is one of a succession of ideas &mdash; which also includes keeping them in detention, depriving them of social welfare payments, etc. &mdash; put forward to deal with asylum seekers.  Why not simply do it properly and ask these people to wear yellow stars, given that week after week they are obliged to endure new forms of abuse? The Government should oblige them to wear such stars and we will then know the nature of its thinking in respect of them.  We are being embarrassed by the leaks, hints and undercover suggestions asylum seekers are somehow unworthy. These people are frightened and they deserve to <Col N="334" /> be supported, not subjected to this malicious campaign of denigration.</P>

      <P>I have given Senator Ryan a great deal of latitude on the Order of Business, to which this matter is not really relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Norris's amendment to the Order of Business I also wish to amend the Order of Business.  My amendment reads: &ldquo;That item 17, motion 30, to be taken at the commencement of business today.&rdquo; This motion is in the names of all Members on this side of the House and deals with overseas development aid.  A debate without a motion in which the Members opposite are not obliged to defend the indefensible is not a debate, it is a token gesture.  Such a debate would be of no benefit.  Church leaders, ordinary citizens and delegates at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis have commented on the scandal of freezing overseas development aid.  Everyone is prepared to criticise the Government in this regard while the Members opposite support its action.  The House should be given an opportunity to oblige them to defend what has been forced on them by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What steps are being taken to ensure that traditional fishing rights cannot be interfered with?  It has been brought to my attention that a consortium is claiming rights to, if not ownership of, the internationally famous stretch of river known as &ldquo;the Caragh&rdquo;, where people have fished the tidal stretch since time immemorial. Will the Leader indicate the steps, if any, the Government is taking to ensure that the traditional fishing rights obtaining on the river will be maintained?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The first matter to which I wish to refer is this morning's rail chaos which prevented between 60,000 and 70,000 travelling to work in the normal way.  I deplore the unofficial action which brought about this problem which, it is threatened, will continue.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Public Enterprise to come before the House to outline the contingency plans she has put in place to deal with further occurrences of this type in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris' comments in respect of East Timor.  In the past 48 hours at least 60 people have been killed by the Indonesian Army in the city of Dili.  We had hoped, because of changes in the ruling regime in Jakarta, that the situation might improve.  There were many indications that there had been a change of attitude in Indonesia towards East Timor.  I suggest that 60 minutes be made available this evening to allow those Members interested in this issue to make statements on it. Following that, a resolution should be adopted <Col N="335" /> which can be sent to the Indonesian Embassy in London.</P>
    <P>Is it intended to introduce the wildlife Bill &mdash; it would be ideal if it were initiated in this House &mdash; during the current session?  This is important legislation because the Minister cannot fully implement all sections of the controversial Habitats Directives without it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Norris.  I was present at that conference with Senators Dardis and Henry and the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, when the Lisbon Declaration was produced. This is an important issue.  I know the Leader is pressed for time.  However, we do not need a long winded debate; we are all in agreement. As Senator Connor said, a statement from the House might help save lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Ryan's amendment. The international group reviewing the Dublin Institute of Technology with a view to awarding it university status reported yesterday. The report suggested that with certain modifications the institute should receive university status.  Can we have a debate on this report? There needs to be a sense of urgency about the conditions which the group says need to be implemented, starting with finance.  If the recommendations are not implemented rapidly those students who entered the institute this year will not receive university degrees &mdash; they will fall between Dublin University and the new university to be established.  I would be grateful if the Leader asked the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to debate the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the importance of the Education Bill and the views expressed, I appeal to the Leader to allow Committee Stage to be taken over two days.  I do not think anyone on this side of the House is trying to be obstructive. We are trying to give Members who put down amendments, including the Minister, due time to make their points and have them considered.  It was to the credit of the Government that, despite temptations to do otherwise, all Stages were allowed run their natural course in the other House.  That should be allowed here.</P>
      <P>I agree with the motion to debate East Timor. I compliment Conor O'Clery for the first hand information he is relaying from Dili which is informing our debate directly.  I agree with Senator Dardis that we should table an all-party motion.  If that is the case as regards East Timor I hope it is the case as regards overseas development aid.  We should be speaking to a motion urging the Government to rectify the situation outlined in the Book of Estimates and not just having statements on Thursday as originally proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the many Senators who called for statements on East Timor, I propose <Col N="336" /> to allocate one hour tonight from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m. with seven minute contributions.</P>
      <P>As regards Senator Manning's question, we can review progress on the Education Bill at around 8 p.m. I do not intend that any part of this legislation will be rushed through the House.  Senators will be given as much time as necessary to make their contributions.  I have before me the various Second Stage contributions made last week. Many amendments have been put down but 23 are grouped with other amendments, 11 of which are related to one amendment.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning asked about the Government's proposed legislation between now and the Christmas recess.  I will inform the House of that tomorrow morning. Senators Manning and O'Toole asked about the Mental Health Bill; I will give them the information tomorrow morning. Senators O'Toole, Costello and McDonagh asked for a debate on adult literacy and education a number of times.  The Minister for Education and Science will be in the House this afternoon, I will see if time can be made available for a debate on this matter in the near future in light of the OECD report published today.</P>
      <P>Senator John Cregan informed the House that 55,000 voters have not yet registered.  This is a serious matter.  The Government might consider extending the period, if the article is correct.  The figure is alarming.  I will inform the Minister for the Environment and Local Government immediately following the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan called for a debate on the ESB and the imminent power shortages envisaged in the next two years.  I will make time available for a discussion on this matter at the earliest opportunity. Senator Ryan asked for a debate on overseas development.  I have set aside time on Thursday afternoon for a discussion on this matter.  The time will be agreed on the Order of Business on Thursday morning.  I will be flexible and try to allow Senators as much time as possible to make their contributions.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan expressed a view on traditional fishing rights which I will pass on to the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor called for a debate on the one day strike which occurred today.  The Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, will be in the House tomorrow evening when the Senator can air his concerns.  We all share these concerns and the Minister is doing everything she can to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position tomorrow morning to inform Senator Connor and other Senators when the wildlife Bill will be taken and to inform Senator Henry regarding the matter she raised.</P>

      <P>This amendment seeks to lengthen the period from one to three years within which all sections of the Act must be commenced after enactment.  The Bill, as drafted, proposes a one-year limit.  While I am committed to the implementation of all parts of the Act as quickly as possible, I must be mindful of the practicalities. It may not be possible to implement all sections within the one year period.  Therefore, to be prudent and to allow for the drafting and laying of regulations where necessary I propose to lengthen the commencement period from one year to three years.</P>
      <P>I assure Senators there is no intention to delay implementation of the Act.  I am trying to be practical.  When this matter arose during the Committee Stage debate in the other House, we rather optimistically agreed to revert to the inclusion of the one year period, but when I reexamined the various sections of the Bill and the Acts which would be consequential on its passing, I could not put my hand on my heart and say it would all be done in one year.  Knowing the volatility of politics, I do not want to place such an obligation on the person who may occupy this seat in the future.  I would hate to think it would take us three years to implement all sections of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it is wiser and more prudent to allow for a three year timespan.  I know Deputy Costello has tabled an amendment which seeks that all sections be implemented within six months.  Knowing how slow the State can move at times, that would be difficult to do.  This is a large Bill and there will be many consequential actions upon its enactment.  My amendment is reasonable.</P>

      <P>The Minister is being very fair. Given the details of the Bill and what will be involved in setting up the committees and implementing various sections of it, we all know it is absolutely necessary to give the Minister adequate time.  We should go along with his view on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that I have tabled an amendment which proposes to reduce the implementation period by half, from one year to six months; he is trebling it.  We are going in opposite directions.  The reason I seek implementation of the sections within six months is that we have waited a very long time for this legislation.  It has been in gestation since 1989 when the proposal was introduced by way of a Green Paper, followed by a White Paper, the convention, the consultations, the Education (No. 1) Bill and finally this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing a three year period by which time he will be out of office and will have handed over <i>carte blanche</i> to a new Minister who will then be determined by the timescale of the legislation.  I presumed the Minister would ensure the legislation would be fully operational during his time in office.  On reading the functions of the Bill, I cannot see where the difficulty lies. We talk about the patron of schools, its functions and the inspectorate, all of which are already in place.  These matters are provided for in the Bill and will be put on a statutory basis.  We are talking about boards of management which we can discuss later.  That matter has been set in train. The provisions concerning principals and teachers are in place.  Some of the miscellaneous items, including the school year, grievance procedures, appeals, educational disadvantage and teaching through Irish, will be put in place.  However, none of them is of such a substantial nature that it cannot be implemented by the Minister in the morning. The NCCA is already in place, but not on a statutory basis.  This section states that what is already in place will be turned over and provided on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>I do not know where the problem lies.  The Minister said there were technicalities, implications and so on.  I am not prepared to accept an amendment which would extend the implementation period from one to three years, unless the Minister can say precisely where the difficulty exists as regards the corpus of sections, functions, class of school and so on referred to in the Bill.  I would be inclined to go in the opposite direction. Now that we have this consolidating legislation, we should put it on a statutory basis as quickly as possible.  The Minister should ensure it is implemented at the earliest possible date.  I cannot accept three years as a satisfactory period of time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There seem to be many possible reasons for this amendment.  I am still not clear what is behind it.  I understood that when a Department produced a major Bill, parallel work was in train within the Department on its implementation. If that is not the case perhaps a course in the IMI is called for on how public bodies do business.  No other agency would seek a fundamental change in the way it does its business without beginning the planning stage as the process of change was taking place.  It does not have to be, and should not be done in series.</P>
      <P>I am astonished as this is one of the best Ministers for Education we have had.  We will wait and see.  He has been imaginative but he seems to have given up and is not going to be able to see this out.  This Bill is the Minister's monument, yet he is not going to see it through.  I wonder what is going on.  It is not legally obligatory to have all sections of the Bill in place before the next general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this amendment is accepted it will not be legally obligatory to have this Bill in force before the next general election.  There are many other ways the Minister could have done this.  For example, he could have asked for the power to extend the implementation of the Bill by another year by order by a positive affirmation of both Houses.  He could have introduced a simple amendment which would pass through both Houses quickly but would require parliamentary scrutiny as to what caused the delays.  Everything will have to wait as a consequence of this amendment.</P>
      <P>I know what Departments are like.  For example, the Freedom of Information Act stipulates that there should be a maximum delay of two or four weeks in Departments responding to queries.  The maximum delay has become the minimum delay in all Departments.  A maximum of three years will now be the deadline for everything, whereas a maximum of one year was the previous deadline.  Someone persuaded the Minister to make this change and he has made a genuine mistake.  I am disappointed he has taken the impetus out of this reforming legislation.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire agus gabhaim leithscéal leis nach raibh mé i láthair don díospóireacht ar an Dara Céim den Bhille.  I support the Minister's amendment enthusiastically. We should commend his forthrightness and honesty in coming back to the House to say that the original implementation time of one year was unrealistic.  A three year period is more so.  This Bill places the administration of education, which heretofore was conducted by circular letters, on a statutory basis.  Senator Costello, like myself, is a former teacher and he knows that this legislation will cause a tumultuous cultural change in the Department and in the education system. <Col N="341" /> Senator Costello's amendment is well intentioned but unrealistic.  Even a shorter Bill with fewer and less complex implications for the administrative change could not be realistically implemented in six months.  The Minister's approach is realistic, fair and honest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a pity to open the debate on an acrimonious note and perhaps with a division.  There has been a huge amount of discussion on this Bill.  All of us involved in education have seen the Green Paper and White Paper and we know the work done by the previous Minister and Government.  The Minister, when in Opposition, was very much involved in the debate on this legislation and is familiar with its detail.  Like Senator Costello, I am disappointed that the Minister is placing a three year term on the implementation of the Bill and I hope he will not adhere to this stipulation.  I do not wish to score political points but, given the situations in our hospitals and in agriculture, it is likely the Government will not last three years.  I would hate to see this Bill falling because of a change of Government and having to be reintroduced by a future Administration.</P>
      <P>I would support a compromise of two years' implementation time.  Three years is too long, considering the degree of debate and scrutiny the Bill has already received.  We are ready to implement the Bill and I urge the Minster to accept my proposed compromise of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no secret motivation in proposing to extend the implementation time of the Bill.  It is now 12 months since the Bill was published and the Education (No. 1) Bill was debated for a previous two years.  Not everything is in place for the implementation of the Bill.  For example, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment must be set up by ministerial order.  Section 40 states &ldquo;The composition of the Council shall be determined by order, made by the Minister following consultation with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations&rdquo;.  The ethos of the Bill is one of consultation and consensus.  It will not be implemented by ministerial diktat. Some of the mechanisms for what is contained in the Bill are in place and some are not.  Some mechanisms which are in place will have to be reinvented in consultation with the partners. Section 29 which deals with appeals, also refers to further consultations with the partners. Throughout the Bill there are references to the Minister's obligation to make orders following consultations with the partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned boards of management. At primary level we have agreement with all the partners about the establishment of boards of management and their composition.  It took two years of consultation and eventually arbitration and facilitation to arrive at that agreement. It was concluded last November following <Col N="342" /> more delicate diplomacy among the partners.  We arrived at a very good solution which we are reviewing and which is working successfully.</P>
    <P>A year is too short.  On Report Stage, I might consider putting in place a review mechanism which would require the Minister to come before both Houses annually to advise on the implementation of the Bill.  It is not my intention to wait for the third year to implement the legislation. The Attorney General's office advises that, because hundreds of orders must be made and regulations formulated, an implementation term of one year is not practicable.  In proposing this amendment I am motivated by a desire to be practical.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister proposes this amendment in good faith.  I have every sympathy with him that it took 12 months for the Bill to be passed by the other House.  Perhaps he should speak to the Leader of this House who wanted to have the Bill dealt with in one sitting day.</P>

      <P>The Bill was not being debated for 12 months.  The entire process of drafting the Bill and arranging parliamentary time took that length of time.  The large number of regulations resulting from the Bill will also have to be processed by the parliamentary draftsman's office. This takes time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The workings of parliamentary draftspeople is a mystery to those of us who have never been in Government.  I would have thought that the parliamentary draftsman would have noticed the number of orders needed when the Bill was being drafted and would have advised accordingly.  I am surprised by the extension of the implementation time from one to three years at this late stage.  What has arisen since the Bill left the other House to cause this dramatic change in the estimated time for the implementation of the Bill?</P>
      <P>I am very wary of Bills whose full implementation is not guaranteed in the lifetime of one Government.  I have watched the Refugee Act languish after a change of Government and become unworkable.  I am surprised that we may now see the implementation of this Bill drag on into the period of office of the next Government. The Minister believes that he or someone from his party will be Minister for Education and Science after the next election.  Nevertheless, I would like to know what happened in the last week to cause this change.</P>

      <P>If somebody wants to push this Bill through the House it is imperative that the Minister is not seen to make a mistake because the Bill must work.  I am the only person present who is not a teacher.  I am also the only person who did not get the primary certificate.  Therefore, I would have a different opinion to Members but I can understand what the Minister is trying to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister may be prepared to compromise. It would be better if the final Stages of this Bill were taken in this House.  I also recommend a compromise of two years.</P>
      <P>I understand the problems the Minister has dealing with teachers.  I know how they work and how they can monopolise things, particularly during general elections.  We should not be negative about this because the time has increased from six months to three years.  I am on the Opposition benches but I understand what the Minister said.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we agree I wish to refer to what the Minister said.  I have looked at the areas where he said he might encounter difficulties which were the NCCA, boards of management and appeals mechanism.  With regard the NCCA I cannot see where the Minister would not get that through in the morning.  Section 40(1) states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;. the Minister following consultation with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations, recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This has been done already on a non-statutory basis.  I am unsure where the new bodies that have to be consulted are mentioned.  I have not heard of anyone being opposed to the NCCA and this provision should not take any more than a few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Boards of management are already covered. The Bill provides that &ldquo;it shall be the duty of a <Col N="344" /> patron, where practicable, that a board of management will be established&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are mostly dealing in terms of implementation with second level boards of management. We have voluntary secondary, vocational colleges, community colleges, lay voluntary secondary schools and Church of Ireland secondary schools, all of which have different management models.  We envisage we will need almost different discussion procedures with the various sectors at second level.  This will take time.  It will not happen overnight and some cases will be more difficult than others.  We think the major sectors will come on board and will be able to implement this Bill.  If we had, for example, six months to reach agreement with the bodies they, in turn, would have to go to their constituencies. They would have to deal with the parents' associations in each of those schools to make sure they have annual general meetings to elect their representatives on to the board, etc.</P>
      <P>At the moment some schools have boards of managements but others do not.  Many issues still have to be teased out.  At primary level it took a full two years before agreement was reached and a further couple of months for that agreement to be implemented.  We had to advertise in the media advising parents that they should belong to a parents association and that they had a right to have an annual general meeting and to nominate two members.  Members may take a lot of that for granted.  When a Bill is enacted it becomes law and it has to be procedurally correct.  This takes time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that a great deal of that work had been done.  The Minister confirmed that discussions had taken place over a long period but there is no guarantee that a board will be established after three years.  It is an open ended section.  I presume that is why the Minister inserted &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo; in relation to the establishment of a board.  It only states &ldquo;it shall be the duty of a patron&rdquo;.  It would be better to insert &ldquo;to appoint where practicable a board of management&rdquo;.  By inserting six months, two years or three years we still do not have a guarantee that there will be a board of management in every school because the out clause has already been inserted.  The Minister will be working hard to get as many boards of management as possible up and running but the legislation provides a mechanism in the event that there is no board established.</P>
      <P>I would not like to see school owners or patrons never reaching a decision on the setting up of a board of management.  This legislation already deals with this issue and a period of two or three years will not have any effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Minister is operating from the best of intentions but if we consider it on the basis of a two year maximum period, then we should have an annual review mechanism.  I also hope it will <Col N="345" /> be dealt with during the Minister's term of office.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, lines 15 and 16, to delete &ldquo;, other than a school or a place providing university or other third level education,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment provides for a centre for education. Under amendment No. 8 the words &ldquo;a school&rdquo; is deleted and substituted by &ldquo;an establishment&rdquo;. In the section it says that &ldquo;school means a school.  .&rdquo;.  Of course a school means a school and a house means a house but if a &ldquo;centre for education&rdquo; means a place where certain things happen, then we can say &ldquo;a school&rdquo; means &ldquo;a place&rdquo; or &ldquo;an establishment&rdquo;.  Purely on the issue of propriety of language the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;an establishment&rdquo; or &ldquo;a place&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Bill &ldquo;a centre for education&rdquo; is defined as a place &ldquo;where adult or continuing education or vocational education or training is provided and which is designated for that purpose under section 10(4)&rdquo;.  Why do we need &ldquo;other than a school or a place providing university or other third level education&rdquo;?  Why could it not be a school or a place which provides other third level education, perhaps university education?  Should they be mutually exclusive?  Any place the Minister designates should be capable of becoming an education centre.  Why do we need to exclude certain areas?  For example, many of the VEC colleges <Col N="346" /> are centres for education and they are almost designated as such &mdash; for example Ballyfermot senior college &mdash; it would have started off as a second level institution and there are many similar institutions, such as that in Inchicore.  Coláiste Dhúlaigh would be a mixture of second level and further education.  Is there any need to exclude certain premises which might provide a centre of education of a vocational or continuing education nature?</P>
    <P>I presume with the Green and White Papers on adult education, the Minister will proactively seek centres to designate for this purpose if the amount of emphasis indicated by his Minister of State this morning is to be placed on this sector. It may well be that some of these centres could be existing community schools or colleges, or second level schools such as Coláiste Chonghaile in Dublin's north inner city, which will shortly be amalgamated with another school and which will have suitable premises.  Such a centre for education could be in the saolscoil proposed for the docklands to where the National College of Industrial Relations is relocating.  A new integrated approach to education is proposed there which would entail a centre for education similar to that suggested in the Bill offering an ongoing level of education rather than just third level education.</P>
    <P>Our education system is tiered.  Why should provision not be made on any premises capable of being designated a centre for education for a multiplicity of tiers of education, be they pre-school, primary, post-primary or adult education? If we are to define a centre for adult, continuing or vocational education or training, it should not exclude other premises or types of education which might be pursued in that premises.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal of merit in what Senator Costello said.  He has thought it out well.  The Green Paper on adult education will be published shortly.  The idea of a centre for education is more appropriate than ever before because there are many opportunities now.  For example, in my capacity as an adult education organiser, I have seen the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, run diploma courses in local history in the Lackan Heritage Museum and Centre in County Galway.  The word &ldquo;centre&rdquo; is very appropriate.  We have discussed distance learning, broadening of education and adult education. What Senator Costello said makes sense and I appeal to the Minister to respond positively to his suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 deletes the words &ldquo;other than a school or a place providing university or other third level education&rdquo;.  The Universities Act was passed last year.  If we were to delete that phrase, the universities or other third level colleges could come within the legal remit of this Bill.  That is not the intention because the Bill deals substantively with primary and second level schools.  The term &ldquo;centre for education&rdquo; covers places or establishments outside <Col N="347" /> universities or third level institutions, centres where adult education exclusively takes place or colleges of further education which no longer offer second level programmes.  We cannot delete the wording as suggested by the amendment because a separate body of legislation has been enacted after a long consultation period involving all the interests.  Various Acts have also been enacted for institutes of technology.  Furthermore, we will shortly publish the National Qualifications Authority Bill which will deal with the full spectrum of qualifications and awards beyond post-primary level.  It will be specific in terms of qualifications in adult, continuing and third level education from colleges of further education and from all other bodies providing training qualifications, such as CERT and Teagasc.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on adult education published today is a comprehensive discussion paper on adult education.  It would not be possible to embrace all which that entails within the Bill.  We intend to produce a White Paper following a period of discussion on the Green Paper which will lead to decisions.  Most of the sentiments expressed by Senator Costello can be dealt with in the context of other legislation and also in the context of Government decisions in relation to adult and continuing education and the allocation of resources to that, which is always the key issue.</P>

      <P>When I first read Senator Costello's amendment I did not agree with it.  Then I thought about the purpose of the section.  I am confused as to the legal definition of &ldquo;third level education&rdquo;.  If the Minister had said a university as defined by the Universities Act or a regional technical college or institute of technology as defined by the appropriate legislation, I would have understood exactly what he meant because they are covered by separate legislation. However, there are centres for education, schools and colleges, which cover the whole spectrum of education, particularly post-leaving certificate courses which, while so called, do not all have the leaving certificate as an admission requirement. Are the colleges which provide adult or continuing or vocational education or training and also some third level education, for example, PLC courses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have a specific PLC grants scheme which is similar to the higher education grants scheme in terms of income thresholds and maintenance rates, but it is a separate scheme for post-leaving certificate students.  The definition section also covers Youthreach centres, for example.  In the context of the Green Paper, we hope to develop what we are calling &ldquo;multiplexes&rdquo;, which would have a range of training and education provisions for out of school situations. For example, a multiplex could be developed in an area which does not have a great degree of added provision and it could cater for Youthreach, adult education and some element of training.  It could even embrace FÁS as well as education inputs.  The section is a definition section so some phrase is needed to define activity outside bodies defined within the Universities Act and the Regional Technical Colleges Act.  That is what this definition endeavours to do.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>Lobby groups argue that they should be accepted as such but they are classed as post-leaving certificate courses.

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not entirely satisfactory.</P>
      <P>There are a number of PLC courses which lead and are stepping stones to degrees.  Within the City of Dublin VEC they are pathways to degrees and there is accreditation from other universities in Britain and elsewhere.  There is a movement towards this pathway system so they are in fact steps on the ladder of third level education and I do not think the Minister can simply exclude it, as such.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the point he is making &mdash; that the centres for education we are dealing with here are separate from the university and Dublin Institute of Technology provision. However, this definition does not say that.  It says it means a place other than a school or place providing university education. Why can the same place or campus not provide varying degrees of third level education, including continuing education and training?  It would be better to say that what the Minister wants from <Col N="349" /> centres for education is a place where adult, continuing vocational education or training is provided, and forget the reference to university and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>In addition, one is talking about premises, a place or school where it is happening.  As I mentioned earlier, we are trying to move towards the saolscoil, which is now attempting a holistic approach towards education on its campus.  The National College for Industrial Relations in Milltown has made proposals to the Dublin Docklands Development Authority to set up a £21 million development on a site identified in the new authority's area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The NCIR will be approaching the Minister for £7 million and will be putting £40 million of its own money, from fund raising, into the project.  It will provide a third level institution along with further education, including vocational training and PLCs.  It will link up with secondary, primary and pre-school levels.  It will try to provide its own model.  It could provide university education as well as the type of education the Minister envisages for centres for education.  The Dublin Institute of Technology, which will be relocating to the Grangegorman site, could very well provide the flexible type of courses that are now being provided by the vocational education committees.  There will be space on the campus for such courses.  I do not see why the existing VEC colleges that provide PLCs, which are effectively part and parcel of a holistic third level educational system, cannot do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>They are and I will tell the Minister why.  Accreditation has been given to them from many universities abroad so that they can continue their studies.  For example, the work that is being done in Ballyfermot senior college is now accredited for university and degree purposes and a number of people have been conferred with degrees arising out of the work they have done.</P>
      <P>The simplest thing for the Minister to do is to define &ldquo;centre for education&rdquo; without reference to universities or other third level education, and simply say it is a place where adult, continuing education and vocational training takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not be prepared to take out the term &ldquo;university&rdquo;.  We have to be very careful that we do not go down the road where everybody thinks they can be everything.  The National Qualifications Authority Bill will be a key Bill in that regard.  At third level, for example, I believe in the retention of the binary system.  I do not think that all institutes of technology should become, or aspire to become, universities overnight.  They have a particular function which they undertake very well.  They should be proud of that and should certainly advance.  A <Col N="350" /> number of PLC colleges have done extremely well and have achieved excellence in niche areas, such as film animation at Ballyfermot.  However, the vast bulk of PLCs are either at NCVA levels 1 or 2.  The key issue is to provide for pathways of progression within legislation on to third level and in institutes of technology.  We do not want PLCs to take over the work that institutes of technology are doing already.  In fact, we should be trying to reduce the degree of duplication that takes place.</P>
      <P>The School Attendance Bill will be coming on stream, but the key issue on the agenda is the National Qualifications Authority Bill which will deal with many of the issues to which Senator Costello referred.  The Bill before the House is substantively about primary, secondary and other centres of education that are non-university and non-institute of technology based.  That is basically what we are saying in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In terms of definitions in the section, it would be wrong to change that phrase simply to try and reflect on a major new scenario that Senator Costello envisages developing.  The new college in the inner city proposed by the NCIR will not be a primary or secondary school.  As part of its terms of reference, however, it may endeavour to provide certain education programmes that would facilitate second chance students &mdash; people who never got a chance the first time around.  It may facilitate parents returning to education and a range of programmes like that, which a number of third level institutions are beginning to provide. However, that is covered by legislation which is already in place for third level colleges.</P>
      <P>There is nothing stopping any third level college, be it an institute of technology or a university, from adopting and implementing programmes that would link it into second level schools in areas of disadvantage to encourage higher participation in third level education. There is absolutely nothing stopping any university from developing a particular interest in early education and providing link ups and research bases to primary schools.  They are not doing it to any great degree, but nothing is stopping them from doing so.  In fact, UCC was the first university to provide a BA course in early childhood studies because one or two people on the campus had a particular interest in that area.  Dublin Institute of Technology has also developed very good programmes on early education.  Many people involved in early education use that programme as a resource for their own work in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we need to get hung up about it in the context of definitions in this particular Bill. I have much sympathy with what the Senator is saying but we must be careful.  One of the situations I inherited upon taking office was that many sectors and institutions had, in my opinion, ambitions that were miscued in some respects. We must always be mindful of the core mission of certain sectors of education and of our education system generally.  We must facilitate growth and <Col N="351" /> development, but we must not lose sight of the fact that we are there to serve learners who have different needs.  Some sectors can serve the needs of certain learners better than others.  If we dilute the core mission of many of our sectors and institutions, we will dilute the quality of education overall.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The progress that has been made in providing adult and continuing education by a number of second level schools, including the VEC sector, is very commendable.  There are no barriers to facilitating their further expansion and development towards full third level education. Nevertheless, I fully agree with the Minister that it is equally important to recognise each sector that is being served and what it is trying to attain.  While there is much merit in what Senator Costello says, to follow his approach completely would significantly blur the current and future boundaries of certain areas of excellence.  That may sound elitist, but it is not.  Every area of education needs to promote its own objectives of excellence, whether it is at primary, secondary, PLC, institute of technology or university level.</P>
      <P>It is equally important for each sector to be able to identify targets and seek to attain its level of excellence.  What Senator Costello is proposing could have an impact in blurring those edges and we could lose sight of many of the goals that are legitimately being sought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that the Department of Education and Science still insists on defining university education as the pinnacle of education, essentially allowing universities to define everything else.  Essentially they do so.  They are the arbiters of everything and they are consulted about everything.  The report on the forum on education established by the previous Minister, for example, was written exclusively by university academics.  This happens all the time.</P>
      <P>It is not so much that institutions which are not universities want to be university institutions, but that anybody who works in these institutions is aware that every student in every sector of third level education ultimately wants to get a degree. They do not believe any other qualification will ultimately be as significant.  The universities have created a mystique about degrees which enables them to get away with extraordinary things, such as teaching students in a cinema in the mornings because classes had to be cancelled for the week of the Cork Film Festival when the cinema was in use.  If an institute of technology did such a thing, public representatives, legitimately, would kick up murder.  However, universities can get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="352" /> I wish the Minister had defined third level education as education provided by certain sectors. Then there would be no problem.  Apart from that, he should instill into the thinking of his Department a perception of equality &mdash; which I believe the Minister has &mdash; about the different sectors in education.  The Department is about 20 years out of date in terms of its perception of the relative roles of the sectors and does not yet understand what equality means in this context.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The spirit in the Department is far different and is very much what the Senator articulated, not in terms of universities, but in terms of education being an extremely broad canvas. Our focus in formulating policy is directed at giving that sector of the population which has not to date had access to education better opportunities of access.  That is our objective.</P>
      <P>The problem in this case is that the Universities Act has been passed.  The title of the Bill clearly outlines the areas to be covered.  We could not define all other sectors because the Attorney General would not permit it.  This Bill relates to general education at primary and second levels and to adult and continuing education and vocational education and training.  These are the sectors defined in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the Bill is not about universities. However, I wish to raise one issue related to the Department and its perceptions, the National Board for Science, Technology and Innovation, which I mentioned on Second Stage. Not one person on that board works in the non-university sector of education.  All ten are from the university sector.  There is supposed to be a sector of third level education, equal to the universities, which deals with science and technology, but not one member from that sector is on the national board which advises the Government on policy in this area.  However, according to the Minister, the Department views that sector as equal to the universities in terms of status and prestige.  That is not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not appoint that board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I put down the amendment to clarify the situation, but I am still not clear about it.  The Minister spoke about the distinction between universities and further education.  I have no problem with the Minister making that distinction although, ideologically, I have a problem with the distinction itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are discussing a centre where this type of education will take place.  The Minister has chosen to exclude two types of premises &mdash; one where a university provides education and the other where any other third level education is provided.  There is no reference to pre-school or <Col N="353" /> primary schools, which are other premises where education is provided.</P>
    <P>There should be a more integrated approach to education.  The Minister can designate a place to be a centre for education under section 10(4).  He might decide to designate such a centre on a university campus where university education is provided. He could also decide to designate one on a regional technical college campus.  We do not know what the demands on the new legislation might be.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why it is necessary to include a definition which excludes two sets of premises.  Why not exclude primary school premises? The Minister might designate a primary school premises as a centre for a certain type of education.  I am not happy with the language in this section.  We are discussing the designation of a premises as a centre of education.  That is defined as a place &ldquo;where adult or continuing education or vocational education or training&rdquo; takes place.  It is the premises that will be designated, not the university or other third level centre.</P>
    <P>If a premises can be secured on a campus, the university can provide the two types of education side by side.  We are not interfering with the delivery of education by the university or with its accreditation.  We are simply discussing the designation of centres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the Senator is exercised about this.  Universities are autonomous under the Universities Act.  That Act was passed by both Houses and it confers a certain degree of autonomy on the universities.  No Minister could force a centre of education into any university. However, there is nothing in the universities legislation which prohibits universities from engaging in a range of new education programmes and developments.  Likewise, there is nothing in the Regional Technical Colleges Act to prohibit innovation or development in those colleges.</P>
      <P>We are not excluding anything; we are putting in place a definition which allows the Minister to define certain activities in Irish education which fall outside the university and regional technical college definitions.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 27, paragraph (b), to delete &ldquo;chronic&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill's definition of disability is good. However, under paragraph (b), disability is defined as the &ldquo;presence in the body of organisms causing, or likely to cause, chronic disease or illness&rdquo;. <Col N="354" /> The use of the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; is questionable. Surely there is a disability if there is a disease or illness caused by the presence of organisms.  The danger is that the debate on whether the disease is a disability would focus on the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; rather than the illness or disease. The word should be deleted.  It is extremely difficult to determine what is and is not chronic and what would be a disability by using that term.</P>
    <P>Under paragraph (e), disability means a &ldquo;condition, illness or disease which affects a person's thought processes.  .&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Affects&rdquo; is a neutral word in that it might yield a good or bad result. Amendment No. 5 proposes the insertion of the word &ldquo;adversely&rdquo; between &ldquo;which&rdquo; and &ldquo;affects&rdquo;.  The condition is not a disability unless there is an adverse effect which causes damage or harm.  One could have a condition which heightens or increases perception or thought processes. The condition should adversely affect if it is to be a disability.</P>

      <P>If the word &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; is deleted from paragraph (b) it will read &ldquo;the presence in the body of organisms causing, or likely to cause, disease.  .&rdquo;.  I am not familiar with the dictionary definition of the term &ldquo;disease&rdquo; but, if the amendment is accepted, diseases, even those of a temporary, passing or short-term nature, will have to be included in the interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Fitzgerald.  The majority of people carry organisms in their bodies which can cause disease but to which we have built up resistance.  For example, a large number of people carry the organisms which cause meningitis but most of them are fortunate enough not to contract the disease.</P>
      <P>I have no intention of poking fun at serious matters but I disagree with the implication that only adverse effects represent disturbances.  Anyone who suffers from manic depression can have a heightened perception of reality which others do not believe to be real.  Therefore, I am not satisfied with the term &ldquo;adversely&rdquo; because it could be misinterpreted.  On this occasion I do not agree with Senator Costello.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the amendments because our use of the term &ldquo;chronic&rdquo; is extremely important.  The definition in paragraph (b) was inserted following comprehensive consultations with the various bodies which deal with disabilities.  In addition, it is similar to the definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; used in the equal status legislation.  Therefore, the wording used has been the subject of a great deal of examination. It must be remembered that professionals will be charged with assessing whether a condition is chronic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan's point about the term &ldquo;adversely&rdquo; is valid because people can be affected in different ways by various ailments.  In any event it is not necessary.  The parliamentary draftsman has assured me that our definition will <Col N="355" /> deal with situations where people have been adversely affected by any condition or disease.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following definition:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;educational disadvantage&rdquo; has the meaning assigned by section 32(9);</P>
      <P>This amendment involves the insertion of the definition of educational disadvantage assigned by section 32(9).  I consider this to be one of the most important amendments in my name.  I am disappointed that the legislation does not appear to adequately address the problem of educational disadvantage.  Section 32 (9) states that &ldquo;In this section &lsquo;educational disadvantage&rsquo; means the impediments to education arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools.&rdquo;.  I propose to include the term &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; so that the subsection will read &ldquo;social, cultural or economic disadvantage&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As stated on Second Stage, I am not pleased that the problem of educational disadvantage is being consigned to a subsection of one of the sections of the Bill which caters for miscellaneous matters.  I propose that a section be devoted to addressing this problem which will confer on it the relevant degree of status and importance.  The remainder of the Bill involves placing a statutory imprimatur on existing elements of the education <Col N="356" /> system which function effectively, whether these be boards of management, the inspectorate, the patron system or the National Council for Curriculum Assessment.  However, there is no structure or mechanism in place to deal with educational disadvantage.  For this reason, I am disappointed that the Minister's only proposal in this area involves the establishment of an educational disadvantage committee.  I acknowledge that this represents an improvement on the current situation but I would have thought that a Bill of this nature would address the question of educational disadvantage in a holistic, integrated and structured fashion.  However, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have been informed that a committee on educational disadvantage will be established and provided with details of its work, its membership, etc.  However, we do not know what will happen in terms of the recommendations because there is no obligation on the Minister to act on them.  One of the amendments discussed with amendment No. 6 proposes that he should be obliged to act on those recommendations.</P>
    <P>At present, approximately 20 per cent of young people do not obtain the full benefits of their second level education because they do not sit the leaving certificate.  There has been much discussion about the number of people who fall through gaps in the education system.  ASTI carried out a great deal of research in this area &mdash; which it recently published in its document &ldquo;Issues in Education&rdquo;&mdash; which shows that only 47 per cent of people aged between 26 and 54 have completed second level education and that it would take until the year 2015 for us to reach the attainment levels which obtain not only in European Union countries but also in the OECD countries.</P>
    <P>There is a high level of educational disadvantage in Ireland.  Unless we put in place the legislation structures or mechanisms to deal with this problem I fear that we will have missed an important and significant opportunity to address the gravest problem faced by the education system. People always refer to the need to have a good education system.  I accept that we have such a system but it is only good for those within it.  The system is not designed to prevent those who are vulnerable for social and economic reasons from dropping out of it or to encourage them to return.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I agree on a large proportion of these matters.  However, we differ in terms of the fact that I believe that the Bill could have been more proactive in providing a mechanism to address the problem of educational disadvantage. While I acknowledge that this essentially is a consolidation Bill, nevertheless, this is an area where vision could have been shown and where the Minister could have led from the front by providing a section outlining a programme to deal with educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the plethora of amendments I tabled in respect of the section should be incorporated into the legislation because they would <Col N="357" /> strengthen it.  This could be done in much the same way that the Minister incorporated provisions relating to students with special needs. Provisions of that nature were an excellent leavening of the Education Bill.  The Bill would benefit from a similar leavening as regards provisions dealing with educational disadvantage.</P>

      <P>I disagree with Senator Costello.  This is an area of which a number of us have experience and we have drawn a number of conclusions over the years.  One of the most important of these is that areas such as this need definite foci.  A separate focus is strongly needed in the case of disability and educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>It is my understanding that Senator Costello is proposing that disability, as we traditionally and historically understand the term and as defined and outlined by the Minister, and educational disadvantage, as both defined in section 32(9), should be coalesced.  If that is what he is suggesting, it is the wrong road to go down.</P>

      <P>Every aspect of the Bill which legislates for provisions, boards, access to schools, refusals, etc., deals with special needs holistically.  Equally, the question of disability is addressed fully and forcefully in the Bill.  I stand corrected as regards what Senator Costello said. However, my understanding was that his aim was that the two areas should have a single focus.  I am strongly opposed to that.  There are two distinct areas of expertise which must be focused on. Case studies done not only in Ireland but in the US and Europe indicate that when it comes to educational disadvantage, the multi-disciplinary expertise needed is quite distinct from the focus needed for dealing with disabilities or special needs.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Costello for putting down these amendments.  I will deal with them comprehensively first and then I will go through them individually.  I am happy to inform the Senator that I will accept his amendment No. 6 which provides for a definition of educational disadvantage to be included in section 2.  It is already included in another section but the Senator wanted it included in section 2.  Since the definition is clear enough, I do not propose to accept amendment No. 74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is very committed to tackling the problems of educational disadvantage which <Col N="358" /> is why in this Bill, as opposed to the Education (No. 1) Bill, we have provided for the establishment of a disadvantage committee.  I see a proactive role for this committee in terms of the realistic assessment of existing policy, engaging in research and providing insights and recommendations to the Minister of the day in terms of new strategies to counteract disadvantage.  In addition, the Bill provides that half of the members of the committee will be nominees from voluntary or other bodies working in the field.  This ensures that one cannot simply appoint a committee comprising Government supporters irrespective of who is in Government.  We want this body to be effective.</P>
    <P>We have taken a number of initiatives on educational disadvantage.  Legislation on its own will never deal effectively with the issue.  It will always come down to resources and the Government must be prepared to spend money on educational disadvantage.  We have developed an eight to 15 year old pilot project where we want to establish models of best practice in terms of identifying children at risk and then intervening.  We have also signalled that we will be bringing forward the Education (School Attendance) Bill; perhaps educational welfare legislation is a better title than the old one.  The Government has endorsed the heads of that Bill and it is currently being drafted.  This will have significant implications for early school leaving and educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I am not predisposed to accepting amendment No. 14 which proposes to include in the list of support services children who are educationally disadvantaged on the grounds that support services will obviously be available to children who are educationally disadvantaged.  However, we do not want to limit the support services structure or the section in the Bill to children with educational disadvantage.  They will be entitled to such support services like other children.</P>
    <P>In a number of his amendments, Senator Costello wishes to include references to children with educational disadvantage.  In the Bill we have divined educational disadvantage as applying to children who, because of social and economic disadvantage, are educationally disadvantaged. We need to keep a separate focus in terms of children with educational disadvantage as opposed to those with special needs.  If we can keep the focus on children with special needs separate we will make more progress with them.  I have strong views on this and the Bill has been significantly strengthened as it has gone through the House in terms of children with special needs. If the educational disadvantage committee became involved with that, it could dilute one or the other.  Children with special needs need to be given a clear focus, which should be exclusive to make sure we get it right so that we improve the services which deliver special needs.</P>
    <P>Our progress as a nation has been quite slow in terms of meeting the needs of children with special needs.  Anything that does not keep the <Col N="359" /> focus clear would be a regressive step.  Children who come from areas where there is unemployment or who are in socio-economic difficulty and experience educational disadvantage will require strategies and approaches that can be quite different to those which children with special needs might require.  They may also require different types of intervention.  Senator Costello has put down four amendments which would give effect to this and would attach provisions for educational disadvantage to sections dealing with children with special needs and disabilities.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 24 would impose an obligation on all schools to ensure that the needs of children with educational disadvantage are met. The obligation should be on the State as opposed to the school.  This arose in terms of special needs. Originally when the Bill was published the obligation was on the school to meet the needs of children with special needs.  When we debated that in the other House we accepted an amendment specifying that the Government of the day should have the obligation as the schools cannot do it if they do not have the resources.  They cannot do it for children with educational disadvantage either if they do not have the resources. People felt it was unfair on schools, particularly as we know where the schools will be which deal with the vast bulk of children who experience educational disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for additional funding for schools having regard to their level of educational disadvantage.  Section 21 provides for school plans to include equality of access to and participation in schools and the measures which schools propose to take to achieve these objectives.  These provisions go a considerable distance to meeting the points raised by Senator Costello.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 70 to 75 relate to the educational disadvantage committee.  As regards amendments Nos. 70 and 71 which relate to the establishment of structures, I am happy that the committee established by section 32, which also provides for the funding and staffing of the committee, will provide a sufficient structure for the present.  It allows for the structure to be improved as time goes on.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 72 seeks to delete all references to resources.  However, as the Senator knows, that is a standard part of legislation.  Any disadvantage committee should have regard to resources.  I would not like a disadvantage committee to look for the sun, moon and stars, knowing that no Minister is in a position to provide that.  Many bodies like to do that.  I would prefer an advisory committee that would not pennypinch, but that would have a realistic regard for what is possible in any one year.  Very often that type of committee has a far better impact on policy. Those who keep looking for the icing on the cake type of solution are often discarded as their demands are not seen as realistic.  People ask why they seek £400 million worth of expenditure in one budget when they know it will not be allocated? <Col N="360" /> That approach can reduce the credibility of the advice tendered.  Those who advise Government should have regard to available resources.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 75 seeks to impose an obligation on the Minister to respond to any report of the disadvantage committee within a month and that he or she should receive a written reply in return.  I oppose putting that obligation on a Minister.  We cannot put in place a committee which would require a Minister to put in place ideas no matter how ridiculous they might be. The advisory committee should work in consensus with Ministers to seek to improve and to change policy for the better to cater for children with educational disadvantage.  There should not be conflict.  If it ends up as such, it will not be effective and will not lead to real change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to rain too much on the Minister's parade because I accept his commitment to educational disadvantage.  The impediment to education arises from social and economic disadvantage.  We will have economic disadvantage for as long as we tolerate the worst level of income inequality in the OECD.  We have the most uneven income distribution in the entire OECD.  The share of income that accrues to the top 10 per cent of people relative to that which accrues to the lower 10 per cent is greater by a factor of four and a half.  This is worse than in the United States and the United Kingdom and spectacularly worse than in most civilised countries in Northern Europe which have low levels of disadvantage among children.  The reason 28 per cent of children live in poverty is that their parents are victims of income inequality in this State.  Not only must the Minister for Education and Science provide for this in legislation &mdash; which is probably the easier job &mdash; but he must persuade the Minister for Finance that there is an issue of income inequality.  The Minister for Finance does not recognise that income inequality is a problem, not to mention that it needs a solution.  This is how the Minister can begin to solve the problem of educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On special needs, the Minister's argument about not confusing the issue is plausible. However, special educational needs as defined in the Bill is peculiar because it states &ldquo;the educational needs of students who have a disability&rdquo;, which is what most people think it means.  It goes on to state &ldquo;and the educational needs of exceptionally able students&rdquo;.  I have no argument with the introduction of recognition for the educational needs of exceptionally able students.  I am sure the Minister was at a disadvantage in primary school because he was not recognised for his exceptional abilities.  He made a point about mixing disadvantage with special needs.  The same problem will arise by confusing children who have special needs because of disabilities with children who have special needs because of <Col N="361" /> exceptional ability.  The Minister made a convincing case for separating those two issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The term &ldquo;exceptionally able&rdquo; refers to the society for gifted children.  It is a paradox, but the gift of being gifted can almost be a disability in the classroom.  There have been heartbreaking examples of children who were far ahead of their contemporaries and peers and who were being disruptive and not catered for.  The legislation endeavours to give recognition to these children so that the schools and the Department will reflect this in their policies.  There was the case of a child who was in third class in terms of age, was ready to go into first year at second level and who spent the last three years in sixth class and watched friends go on to secondary school.  Perhaps this could be included in a separate line in the Bill, but we want to give some recognition to it.  The numbers are not very high, but I do not think it dilutes the focus on children with special needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that special needs and educational disadvantage are two clear-cut areas.  The definition of special needs is already on the record of the House.  I commend the Minister's proposals to set up the educational disadvantage committee in consultation with patrons, teachers' representatives, parents and student bodies to reflect policies as to how best to correct educational disadvantage. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Education and Science has received many submissions on educational disadvantage and we are preparing a report for the Minister.  The Minister has put a lot of work into setting up this consultation committee to see how we can best move forward. I do not know how we can correct this if we integrate special needs and educational disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dispel the notion that there is any attempt to integrate special needs and educational disadvantage.  That is not the intention in any of my amendments.  Because the Minister has introduced a provision in relation to special needs in various sections of the Bill I am suggesting that on a similar and parallel basis there should be provision for educational disadvantage. My complaint is that there is not a broad provision for this throughout the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said it is not proper to put the onus on the school to deal with educational disadvantage. If it will not be dealt with in the school, where will it be dealt with?  I did not put the onus on the school; I put the onus on the school, the Minister, the board of management and the inspectorate.  These provisions are divided throughout the Bill in the same way as the provisions on special education.  The two are totally different.  First, the objective of the legislation must be to put the onus on all the responsible bodies and partners.  Each of the other sectors responsible for implementation of this legislation <Col N="362" /> is also responsible for providing an educational service to deal with the educationally disadvantaged. The responsibility is spread.  If the Minister goes through it carefully, he will see all those major sectors &mdash; the boards of management, the inspectorate, the Minister and NCCA &mdash; have responsibility.</P>
    <P>A committee is insufficient.  Structures, support services and support mechanisms must be provided and resources must be spent.  Section 32(6) states:</P>
    <P>In preparing a statement as provided for in subsection (5), the educational disadvantage committee shall have regard to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the resources, including the financial resources available,</P>
    <P>I would prefer if that provision was not there.  I know the Minister always makes reference to resources but we are attempting to do something special in this area.  This caveat should not exist. The subsection could have been omitted so that we know it will be done anyway and a special provision against it is not in the section.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want the Minister to act on recommendations from the educational disadvantage committee and respond within a specified time.  I suggested one month but that is not necessary.  It was simply a suggestion to give direction to the Minister's thinking.</P>
    <P>There is no implementation time or mechanism. No structure is being proposed.  Members sit on the committee for three years before they are reappointed or resign.  The Minister could receive many reports from the committee and that would be it.  The legislation is inadequate in that respect. The issue of educational disadvantage should permeate this legislation and the structures required to deal with it should be accepted.  There should be a commitment and a timescale for the Minister to respond to provisions.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has agreed to accept amendment No. 6, the substance of my proposals has not been accepted.  If it is not accepted the legislation will be defective.  I could have proposed that the Minister restore an element of county boards as a mechanism for delivering it. Like the Minister, I was not in favour of regional boards, but I am in favour of a structure which can integrate on a local level.  Instead, I attempted to accept the Minister's proposals and spread it across the various units of the legislation responsible for delivery.  I would like the Minister to reconsider.  Perhaps there could be more special provision for educational disadvantage in the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>A Minister is not obliged to respond within a month to the recommendations of advisory bodies which have been established to date, for example the Higher Education Authority, and this is for good reason.  There needs to be discussion with the body giving advice about its research and other matters.  It would be wrong to place that obligation on it.  There are many <Col N="363" /> provisions in the Bill guaranteeing equality of access and participation in schools and placing an obligation on the State and schools in this respect. However the key issue in terms of disadvantage is resources and legislation alone cannot remedy this.</P>
      <P>Two other measures will impact on this, one is the school attendance Bill, or as I would call it, the education and welfare Bill which will, for the first time ever, create a nationwide service to deal with the prevention of early school leaving.  It will have a preventative philosophy which will lead to the appointment of welfare officers to key areas throughout the country.  At present there are only school attendance services for Dublin city, Cork city, Dún Laoghaire and Waterford.  It is hard to believe the rest of the country is still serviced by gardaí.  That is a key structure in terms of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>The other key structure is a national educational psychological service.  At present we do not have one.  We do have an educational psychological service within the Department but many of those psychologists are busy with other work. However, not enough psychologists have been appointed.  Before we talk about co-ordination at local level, let us establish the services to co-ordinate. There is no point forming committees to co-ordinate something which is not there.</P>
      <P>An educational welfare officer will in time be appointed under the educational welfare board. Approximately 20 psychologists were appointed early this year, and another 15 are to be appointed and more next year.  They with the home school liaison service should co-ordinate on educational disadvantage.  This committee is a welcome first step.  The Bill creates a dynamic and framework for improvement of the situation if it is merited in the future.</P>
      <P>Every measure implemented by the Department of Education and Science and every Minister for Education and Science in the future should have a clear focus on educational disadvantage. We currently have this focus.  Most of the emphasis is on plugging the gaps in educational and social disadvantage.</P>

      <P>In page 7, line 7, after &ldquo;basis&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;(which may include Northern Ireland)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment relates to a national association of parents and the establishment of its remit.  It may be organised on a national basis and membership may be distributed over a substantial part of the State.  My amendment adds to that by inserting&rdquo;&ldquo;(which may include Northern Ireland)&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am proposing this because a major area of primary education and the INTO's remit and membership cover sections of Northern Ireland. Whether a national association of parents covers <Col N="364" /> the whole island depends on one's political position. Nevertheless it is not inappropriate to allow for the extension to Northern Ireland.  Provision is made for cross-Border co-operation and structures in the context of the British-Irish Agreement. The Minister spoke eloquently of his desire to extend the education system and services to Northern Ireland as far as possible.  There is scope for co-operation and joint enterprise with his colleagues in Britain and Northern Ireland.  A major focus of the British-Irish Agreement is to support and promote that as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The remit of this legislation obviously only refers to the jurisdiction of the State, nevertheless, a hand of welcome could be extended to give a role on a cross-Border basis to Northern Ireland wherever parents organise State-wide, or over a substantial part of the State, or across Northern Ireland or parts of Northern Ireland, where people would be interested in coming together. We are talking about &ldquo;a body of persons established by parents with objects which include representing the views and interests of parents with regard to education and assisting parents in exercising their rights and role in the process of the education of their children&rdquo;.  This does not interfere with any particular geographical remit. It is not something which interferes with the jurisdiction of the State.  It is parents coming together for the purpose of improving education for their children, etc.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a testing provision to put before a Fianna Fáil Minister which he must reject.  It is premature and it could be provocative to be frank.  In addition, it is beyond my jurisdiction. This is the definition section and we are defining the &ldquo;national association of parents&rdquo;. The Bill states that it is &ldquo;established and organised on a national basis&rdquo; and Senator Costello wants to insert &ldquo;(which may include Northern Ireland)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The national association of parents will be the representative body of all the parents associations in the Republic who are on the boards of management of all the schools within the Republic and who will be discussing with the Minister policies pertaining to those boards of management and schools.  It would be inappropriate and wrong &mdash; I cannot do it &mdash; to extend that definition to parents associations which are outside the legal jurisdiction of the State.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer &mdash; I know it is happening already &mdash; that the associations themselves engage in consultations and discussions with their counterparts in Northern Ireland to develop natural links over time.  That is a far better way of doing it and developing an all-Ireland consensus than to pre-empt it <i>via</i> legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also be mindful that there are moves afoot in terms of cross-Border bodies which are about to be established.  We should allow that to happen.  This could be interpreted as a provocative measure by the Legislature in <Col N="365" /> the South.  For those reasons I would not recommend it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) provides early childhood education, or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not understand why the Minister has decided to have this interpretation of &ldquo;school&rdquo;.  I know he has accepted that school now means an establishment which provides primary education but I cannot understand why he will not give each section of education its due in the definition and why he will not begin by stating that a school means a school which &ldquo;provides early childhood education&rdquo; or provides primary education or provides post-primary education or provides courses in continuing and adult education.  Why should it be those which provide primary education &ldquo;and which may also provide early childhood education&rdquo;? It seems to be suggesting that pre-school education is subservient to primary education as seems to be the case in relation to post-primary education, in other words, two levels of education count, primary education and post-primary education. Anything else is less.</P>
      <P>It seems that the Minister could as easily have adopted a more egalitarian approach to the legislation by giving equal place to the various sectors of education where they are provided in the school.  I still do not understand why he decided to do it in this manner.</P>
      <P>I would also have thought that it would be an appropriate opportunity for him to emphasise clearly that he is now embarking on providing a full blooded pre-school programme of education as he appears to be doing in continuing and adult education with the launch of the Green Paper today.  I know he is referring to an education centre to provide that, but these distinctions should have been made.  I do not know what the Minister means by &ldquo;may also provide early childhood education&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remind him that pre-school education or early childhood education is not the same as primary education.  That is quite clear.  In terms of the provision of early childhood education, there is a constitutional guarantee to provide it also.  Education is to be provided to a child at the earliest <Col N="366" /> moment at which education is of value to the child.  That is primary education but in the Bill primary education is really what we call national primary education.  I am arguing for each sector of education to be given its place in the sun.  The particular wording which the Minister has presented seems to be stating that one sector of education is subservient or less than the other. That is where my disagreement lies.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 79 reads:</P>
    <P>In page 34, subsection (2)(a), lines 5 and 6, to delete &ldquo;early childhood and primary and post-primary&rdquo; and substitute all&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 11, where I am asking to have the words &ldquo;which may&rdquo; removed.  I speak in the context of the launch today of the Green Paper on adult education.  I heard Minister O'Dea wax eloquently at the Aontas AGM on Saturday.  He spoke about a new torch having been passed to a new generation of education providers and making schools all embracing.</P>
      <P>The wording of the Bill leaves a doubt and a type of <i>ad hoc</i> situation.  There is an onus on a school to provide courses in adult education.  If we are committed to lifelong learning and talk about the Green and White Papers, we should be definitive here.</P>
      <P>It is my dream to see schools open not only during the day but at night also.  Yesterday in the context of the estimates for my council in Galway I appealed to the county manager, who told us there was about £20,000 more for public lighting, that these lights should be put outside schools and community centres.  With the new torch being passed and adult education courses going on here, there and everywhere, there should be proper lighting in rural areas.</P>
      <P>There is an onus on schools to provide adult education.  I appeal to the Minister to remove the words &ldquo;which may&rdquo; and to be definitive and positive in moving forward in the context of the Bill. It is a simple request but it is important in the context of what we are talking about and the type of education at which we are looking as we approach the new millennium.</P>

      <P>I thought there was a lot of merit in what Senator McDonagh was saying until I realised the core of his argument was based on the introduction of a ministerial diktat.  The Senator wants to amend section 2(1)(b) to read &ldquo;provides post-primary education to its students and also provide courses in adult, continuing or vocational education or vocational training&rdquo;.  As someone with experience of administration in primary and vocational education, I was impressed by the manner in which the vocational education sector promoted and expanded adult and continuing education.  It has been a spectacular success in the City of Dublin VEC.  Senator Costello <Col N="367" /> is also <i>au fait</i> with this as he is involved at that level.</P>
      <P>If the words &ldquo;which may&rdquo; are deleted, the Minister will ensure that every second level school must provide &ldquo;courses in adult, continuing or vocational education or vocational training&rdquo;. That would be ruling by ministerial diktat which would be contrary to the spirit of consultation and consensus building in the Bill.  This amendment must be rejected as being out of character with the Bill.  I am sure the Minister would be the first to admit he had failed if he accepted the amendment, given that he introduced this Bill. The Minister should facilitate schools to provide such education and training rather than ruling by ministerial diktat.  I have a strong and principled objection to this amendment.</P>

      <P>Approximately half of all four year olds and almost all five year olds enrol in primary schools.  If we accept Senator Costello's amendment, we will ringfence early education within the primary school system, which we should not do. Early education is provided by different agencies, including the Department of Education and Science through the Early Start project and a number of pre-school traveller projects which have been in place for over 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are going down a different track in terms of early education which is extremely important. I established the National Forum for Early Childhood Education which met in February.  It was the first time we got everyone involved in early education together because until then, they were all watching each other and wondering who was <Col N="368" /> getting more and taking precedence over the other.</P>
    <P>Early education covers every child from zero to six.  I am a great believer in and advocate of early education.  The Bill gives the Minister a framework to develop early childhood education. However, before we get to that stage, we must sort out where we are going in terms of early education.</P>
    <P>The National Forum for Early Childhood Education produced a report by Professor Coolahan and his independent secretariat, which I published a week ago.  It took on board all the submissions made by a variety of organisations at Dublin Castle.  Our next move is to produce a White Paper on early education.  It would be premature to try to deal with that area by referring to it in terms of the definition of a school or by placing it in the legislation.</P>
    <P>A range of issues must be addressed, the most crucial of which is intergovernment co-ordination. Seven Departments are involved in early education, including the Department of Agriculture and Food through the Leader project, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment through FÁS, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through the equality and law reform unit, the Department of Education and Science through Early Start and the traveller pre-school services and the Department of Health and Children through the health boards which fund IPPA playschools throughout the country in an uneven and unstructured way.  The Child Care Act has also created difficulties as it defines child care facilities and pre-schools but excludes primary schools.  We need to define the main Department, to create structures to facilitate intergovernment co-ordination and to ensure that Departments do not pass the buck and that there is no duplication.</P>
    <P>The Bill facilitates the Department of Education and Science to set up the National Council for Curriculum Assessment which should provide curriculum guidelines for a range of pre-school facilities in the voluntary, private and State sectors. There is no reason that should not happen and the NCCA should not appoint a course committee or group of people to work on the curriculum for pre-schools.  We must deal with a range of other issues pertaining to qualifications, for example, in terms of standardising the qualifications of those involved in pre-school education and ensuring there is a qualifications framework to improve their qualifications.  That is why I cannot accept amendment No. 10.</P>
    <P>The essence of amendment No. 11 would be to place an obligation on schools to provide for adult and continuing education.  We cannot place such an obligation on every school, although it is desirable that schools should do it.  However, experience shows that it works when a dedicated staff member has a particular interest in developing adult education and continuing education, and the rest tends to flow. <Col N="369" /> Some principals and boards of management may feel they have enough to do in terms of the existing difficulties within a school campus.  We have identified schools &mdash; we do not publish this information &mdash; where retention rates are very low.  It is obvious they are low because of educational disadvantages, etc.  Is it not more appropriate that we ask those schools to concentrate on strategies to increase the numbers remaining at school as opposed to diversifying elsewhere and going away from their core responsibility in terms of adults and continuing education?  We must also remember that adult and continuing education is provided in other areas.  Some adults do not like going to schools; they prefer to go to a community centre, a health centre or even a family resource centre.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin </NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they may even go to college. The Green Paper published today will set out a separate framework for adult and continuing education. One of the reasons we will not adopt the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; in amendment No. 79 is that it is clear from the Green Paper and those involved in adult education that the needs of the adult learner are significantly different from the needs of the second level or primary level student.  There may be a need for a different curriculum content or even different language provisions or teaching expertise.  We may need to consider, for example, special qualifications for those involved in the adult learning arena.  It would be wrong for the Bill to pre-empt the work of the Green Paper and the White Paper process.  That might lead to different solutions from those we normally apply to the primary and second level systems.  That is why we are stopping short of placing obligations on schools to provide adult and continuing education in all circumstances.</P>
      <P>The NCCA ethos is primarily driven by the primary and second level systems, but that is not to say it will not have a future role in adult and continuing education.  The Green Paper may suggest that the organisations involved in adult education should have a stronger input.  At present they are not strongly represented on the NCCA.  We know from the attendance at the launch of the Green Paper that a wide range of bodies are involved in adult and continuing education who would like to have an input into curriculum formulation for adult learners.  We are not dismissing the points raised.  A White Paper on early education is being prepared following submissions made in the light of the publication of the Green Paper.  They are the appropriate contexts in which to deal with the issues raised by Senators.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister said.  I am pleased we will have a Green Paper on adult education and a White Paper on early education, two areas which have been neglected for so long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="370" /> The Minister told Senator Cregan that primary education relates to four to six year olds.  Pre-primary education is not being properly addressed at present.  Is there any reason the definition of &ldquo;school&rdquo; should not include an establishment which provides early childhood education?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not just a general definition; it is a definition within the context of the Act.  I do not have authority over many pre-schools and could not assume such authority overnight without consultation with all the bodies concerned. The Child Care Act has placed responsibility for a number of pre-schools with the Minister for Health and Children.  The only way to work this out is through a consultation process with all those involved in the context of producing a White Paper on early education.  To define it in that way would mean everything relating to a school under this Act would apply.  That would not be realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is saying that if we wish to bring this to its logical conclusion and if we are not going to deal with early education in this Bill, why include it here?  Pre-school is referred to as &ldquo;a school which may provide early childhood education&rdquo;, but if the remit of this legislation does not extend to that and it is to be dealt with by the White Paper and future legislation, what is the purpose of pretending schools extend beyond two sectors, primary and second level?  The Minister is stating that the other two areas may exist.  There is a contradiction in his terminology.</P>

      <P>Nearly every school has a special duties teacher with responsibility for adult education and as such this amendment would not put extra pressure on anyone.  The appointments boards was on overdrive in the summer appointing special duties teachers.

I will not, therefore, press this amendment.</P>

      <P>I agree with the point raised by Senator Costello.  Line 40, page 7 reads &ldquo;(a) provides primary education to its students and which may also provide early childhood education. .&rdquo;.  If the Minister recognises that early childhood education may be provided in some schools, that should be promoted.  One cannot have a number of Departments responsible for pre-school education.  Such schools now operate on every corner and one often wonders if the children are being properly looked after.  I am not suggesting they are not, but there is a danger they may not be.  I would rather if the Minister, through this Bill, encouraged primary schools to take on responsibility for early childhood education.</P>

      <P>The ideal way to go forward with this is by way of a White Paper.  The onus will increasingly fall on the State to provide pre-school facilities in disadvantaged areas.  We are all aware of what happened when the early start programme was introduced in some areas where community pre-school play groups existed.  There was a great deal of controversy about the way that was implemented.  We set up State facilities in areas where community facilities existed and other areas had no facilities.  We need to work with local community groups, agencies and the Department of Health and Children.</P>
      <P>There is a better mechanism through which early education could be dealt with through the NCCA.  We are not sure the NCCA, as currently structured, is the proper structure within which to deal with adult and continuing education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his clarification. What I had in mind in relation to amendment No. 79 was not that adult and continuing education would be dealt with by the NCCA or that university education would be dealt with by the NCCA, which will not be the case.  This amendment refers to the bodies which will have representation on the NCCA.  While I do not envisage people involved in adult literacy, continuing or third level education would have equal representation, the NCCA is such an important body, in terms of what it will mean for pre-school, primary and second level education, that those who deal with continuing and third level education should know what is going on as of right, but should not have sufficient representation so as to be a major influence.  We would expect that people who represent those sectors would make the policy, draw up the papers and the curriculum and prepare the assessment modes and modules. However, we could allow a varying degree of representation from all facets of education.  Any body that represents education outside of early childhood, primary or post-primary level would have a lesser degree of representation, as those areas will be subject to curriculum and assessment development.  They should have a right to representation so that they know what is going on <Col N="372" /> and are able to pass it on to other sectors which follow, whether continuing or third level sectors.</P>

      <P>In page 9, line 41, to delete &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;comply with&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to those who are responsible for the implementation of the Bill and how they take that responsibility on board.  The Bill states that they &ldquo;shall have regard to the following <Col N="374" /> objects&rdquo;.  I am suggesting that we strengthen this provision by demanding that they comply with the objects of the Bill.  Anyone can have regard to the Bill and dismiss it.  It is easy to have regard to something and that is the end of it.  The only reason objects are inserted in the Bill is to implement them.</P>
    <P>Surely those responsible, whether the Minister, boards of managements, the inspectorate, the NCCA, principals, teachers and so on, must comply with the provisions and objects of the Act. Otherwise, what is the purpose in having a statutory Act?  The objects, which are set out, include the constitutional rights of children; availability of resources; promoting equality of access; promoting opportunities for adults; promoting the rights of parents; promoting liaison and consultation; the national educational policies; the maintenance of the Irish language and so on.  All these matters have to be complied with.  I cannot see why the Minister should water down that to something as limited as &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo;.  I am sure he will agree it is necessary to strengthen this provision.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 18 refers to the ubiquitous expression &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;.  I am sure every Minister loves this phrase as it shifts the onus to someone else.  It is a wonderful scapegoat. This clause should be abolished from all legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 6(b) states, &ldquo;to provide that, as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources.  .&rdquo; The Minister does not need all this. Surely one or other would do.  He should proceed in accordance with section 7(1)(a) and section 7(4)(a)(i) which states that in carrying out his functions the Minister shall have regard to the resources available.  That is enough for the Minister. He should leave out &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;. It should also be deleted from any other parts of the Bill.  The term &ldquo;resources available&rdquo; is a sufficient caveat.  The phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; should be deleted from this section, from any other section in which it occurs and from all proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 19 is a technical amendment which attempts to improve the language of the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister succeeded me as Lord Mayor of Cork in 1992.  We were both associated with an association for severely and profoundly mentally handicapped children.  I speak with an awareness of what the Minster achieved in this area in Cork because he continued what I began.  I do not seek any glory for what I began because it was not soon enough.  At that time there were 29 profoundly and severely <Col N="375" /> mentally handicapped people in the city of Cork; there are now 32.  They had neither educational nor other facilities.  In 1993 we were able to provide a bus for the association and, with the help of a grant from the Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, we were able to provide two full-time staff for half a year in the city.  This is relevant to what is now happening nationally.</P>
      <P>In 1993, parents of mentally handicapped children were obliged to go to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court where they argued for three weeks before their children's constitutional right to education was clearly stated.  There are very few profoundly and severely mentally handicapped people.  The needs of much larger and stronger sectors are met but handicapped people had to embark on a long and expensive campaign just to have their constitutional right stated clearly.  Mr. Justice Rory O'Hanlon made his judgment after long argument by the Department.</P>
      <P>However, these people are not being granted the education which is their constitutional right and they will never get it if it is conditional on the availability of resources.  I know the Minister receives limited resources from the Minister for Finance but the primary education sector has been deprived of resources for many years.  Must we now say to our mentally handicapped children that they can have their constitutional rights in theory but not in practice because resources are not available?  Lack of resources must not be used as an excuse to deprive children of their constitutional right.  They must be granted that right unconditionally.  This Bill does not do so.  Many experts in this field have expressed concern that the Bill does not clarify the level of educational service which is guaranteed to mentally handicapped children.  The Supreme Court judged that they had a constitutional right to education and they must be given it.  .</P>

Section 6 sets out the aims and objectives for the delivery of a comprehensive educational service. It is refreshing to see these objectives set out in a Bill.  I commend the Minister for that and I welcome section 6 for that reason.  I believe he has got it right.</P>

      <P>There was no legislation in place to cover this.  One could argue that the Constitution was not observed and that the Government of the day was tested in terms of whether it implemented a constitutional right.  The case in question cost the taxpayer £250,000.  I agree with Senator Cregan that the case should not have reached the courts, that parents should not have to assert their children's right to an education.  I inserted section 6(a) to be doubly sure that this Bill contained a provision ensuring that all those concerned with the implementation of the Bill would have to give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children, including children who have a disability or other special education needs as they relate to education.</P>
      <P>The functions of the Minister are set out in section 7(1):</P>
      <P>(a) to ensure, subject to the provisions of this Act, that there is made available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of that person,</P>
      <P>...</P>
      <P>(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), each of the following shall be a function of the Minister:</P>
      <P>(a) to provide funding to each recognised school and centre for education and to provide support services to recognised schools, centres for education, students, including students who have a disability or who have other special educational needs, and their parents as the Minister considers appropriate and in accordance with the Act;&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Until now the obligation was on schools in some instances.  The obligation should be on the State and the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Senators are aware that almost four weeks ago we announced a major initiative and then the Government took a decision following my recommendations after a re-examination of the situation within the Department.  The O'Donoghue judgment was not being observed over the past 15 months in some cases.  It provided that a special school for the severely and profoundly handicapped should be supplied with one teacher and two child care assistants.  Up to four weeks ago not every special school had a teacher and two child care assistants, they may <Col N="377" /> have had one teacher and one child care assistant and the Department was meant to rob Peter to pay Paul.  I have put an end to that and a Government decision gave an automatic staffing entitlement to all children with disabilities.  Every severely profound handicapped child now has an automatic entitlement to be in a class of six with one teacher and two child care assistants.  Every child with autism will have an automatic staffing entitlement of one teacher and one child care assistant.  Four weeks ago the State did not recognise autistic children as being an educational category in their own right and requiring an education service and provision in their own right.</P>
    <P>In terms of resource teachers we have put in place an automatic entitlement to wherever there is a cluster of 12 children with special needs in mainstream education that they should have a resource teacher allocated to them.  In relation to child care assistants in mainstream national schools, we have an automatic provision for children who need the help of a child care assistant to arrange and provide for a whole range of needs that that child requires.  Again, until recently child care assistants were not appointed to national schools.  Every Senator will be aware of representations made by parents that their child's needs were not being catered for in a given national school &mdash; for example, their toilet needs, etc.</P>
    <P>The Government has initiated a series of automatic entitlements.  Even if we objected to the pupil-teacher ratio and stated that it should be lower, there was another one agreed between the social partners and the Government with regard to national school children but there was never a similar staffing schedule agreed for children with special needs.  A lot of this over time had more to do with implementation and a commitment to implement, than it had with Acts or anything else.</P>
    <P>The Constitution has always provided for free access to an elementary education and very often cases are brought to court to define what that means.  The O'Donoghue judgment defined it. The O'Hanlon judgment provided for one teacher and two child care assistants for every six children who were severely and profoundly handicapped.  The State did not contest the case when it reached the Supreme Court but it did allow the case to drag on for two to three years.</P>
    <P>My aim is to ensure that the parents of the future do not have to go to court to assert their children's basic entitlement to an education.  We can never be sure in every situation and there will always be arguments and disputes.  Again, the State should be generous when dealing with disputes.</P>
    <P>I am afraid the terms &ldquo;have regard to&rdquo; and &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; are always part of legislation. The term &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; is used in section 6(b):</P>
    <P>. as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available, there is made available to people resident in the State a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of those people;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="378" /> This should be the objective of the Bill.  The section entitled &ldquo;Objects of Act&rdquo; is dedicated to principles.  This is the first time that an objects section has been included in education legislation or any other type of legislation.  This should be noted.  These are fundamental principles and they should inform what happens within the system.  It will be a good day's work if we pass this legislation.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; should not be interpreted as a phrase that will stop things from happening.  At some stage there needs to be balance in what is happening and most people would appreciate that.  I am only 15 months in office and the issue always boiled down to resources.  As Minister for Education and Science I made a decision to get the resources.</P>
    <P>Why was there not such a provision in the past? As the Minister, I decided not to stand over this and I approached my officials and asked them to quantify what is required.  Why should there be court cases every month?  I am not saying this legislation solves this problem but I want to find out what is needed and then approach the Government stating what is required and that we want the following staffing schedules for children with disabilities.  The Government agreed and I was allocated £4 million for 1999.  That is my Department's estimate of how much it will cost but if it costs more then we will have to get more funding.</P>

      <P>The point I am making is that, in comparison to other areas and other educational groups, handicapped children are not doing as well.  The Minister said that section 6(b) provides that &ldquo;as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available..&rdquo;  Again, for comparative reasons, we are putting handicapped children in the same category as others.</P>

      <P>Section 6(a) contradicts section 6(b).  Section 6(b) refers to the quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of those people. With respect to those people, we will never know the extent of their ability because they are not receiving educational benefits.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for providing additional facilities in the past month for these children who did not receive such resources until now.  The first children to receive facilities were from Cork and that was thanks to my efforts and those of the Minister. When Deputy O'Rourke was Minister for Education she provided two nurses.  However, little or no money was provided and a case had to be taken to the Supreme Court to obtain it.</P>
      <P>I will not let this rest.  The Bill gives the right to education subject to resources, practicability, ministerial discretion and availability.  While the Minister means well and has argued at Cabinet level that such people should not have to resort to the courts, the Bill still does not protect them accordingly.</P>

      <P>I do not agree.  This is the first legislation which includes a provision obliging all those covered by it to give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children, including those with a disability or other special educational needs, as they relate to education.  That is in paragraph 6(a) which was included specifically to meet concerns articulated by parents of children with special needs.  Paragraph 6(b) is a general principle which applies to the education of everyone and covers second level and primary schools. For example, people may request the provision of a 600 pupil school in Castletownbere or elsewhere, but we have to be realistic.  There will always be disputes about the provision of education, for example, people arguing over the location of a primary school.  Paragraph 6(b) deals with that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>Education is a constitutional right, but in the case of the handicapped, the issues of resources, availability of money and ministerial discretion come into the equation. While it is fine for me to make the point to the Minister and for him to show concern, at the end of the day it does not mean very much.  Circumstances may change in three or four years.  A different Minister could be in office in the next three years who would have a different view, which means ministerial discretion is what counts, not constitutional rights.  I have been a Member <Col N="380" /> of the House long enough to know that, so I will not leave until I receive a commitment in this area.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on what he has said and I know his concern is genuine.  However, under no circumstances can people in either House say we are protecting the handicapped in terms of resources.  We still will not specify in legislation that these people have a constitutional right to those resources.  Without question we should specify that and allocate resources accordingly. The Minister has made some effort in this area and I congratulate him on it.  This is long overdue and he knows it.  However, under no circumstances should it be specified in any Bill that resources for people with special educational needs should be provided at ministerial discretion or when they become available.  People have a constitutional right to such resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Cregan. He told me he would be on the attack this afternoon on the issues of disability and the mentally handicapped which we discussed at length earlier. Many people have expressed an opinion to me down the years and I have dealt with the debate in schools on whether there should be special or integrated schools.  That is an ongoing discussion. It is not a question of lack of commitment.</P>
      <P>I commend the Minister for inserting in the Bill the constitutional right of those with a disability to an education.  He has given an indication of his intention.  He has already made a commitment in this area to classes of six for each teacher.  He has spoken about provision being made for autistic children, of resource teachers, of support in the form of child care assistants and of how people with a disability can be integrated into the system as far as practicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is where I see that phrase coming into operation and not where Senator Costello sees it. The phrase must be used and I am delighted it is because I have to work the system as far as practicable to make the school structure acceptable to some mentally handicapped children.  It <Col N="381" /> was not possible to cater for all of them in a school setting.  That said, it must be acknowledged that there are insufficient resources but the Minister has made a commitment and has become emotional about it this evening.</P>
    <P>I believe the perception that the mentally handicapped and those with disabilities are not catered for will be put to bed.  The Bill guarantees equality of access and opportunities for adults and this deals with the suggestion that such people are not catered for once they leave the school system.  The Bill promotes the right of parents to send their children to school.  The Minister has clearly shown he has dealt with this in great depth.  Senator Cregan has a right to air his views. However, the Minister has acknowledged that the House as a whole is very concerned about this area and I know he will give a firm commitment that there will be an improvement during his term of office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to see us all waxing emotional.  Senator Cregan certainly put the case strongly for the special educational needs of people with disabilities.  I welcome what the Minister has done recently, especially concerning autism and special staffing needs.  I have tried to have a commitment to the whole area included in the Bill.  It is one thing for the Minister to take an initiative but it is another to have a legislative structure with corresponding commitments.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not address my two amendments, although the debate seems to have progressed to the totality of section 6 and other areas to which no amendments have been tabled. However, it impinges on my amendment that the wording &ldquo;Every person concerned in the implementation of this Act shall have regard to the following objects,&rdquo; which includes special needs, should be changed to &ldquo;Every person.  .shall comply with the following objects&rdquo;.  That places a greater onus of responsibility to implement all the objects.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 would at least go some distance towards meeting Senator Cregan's point.  It seeks to delete the words &ldquo;as far as is practicable and&rdquo;.  Both amendments would strengthen the legislation and give some proactivity to these objects to ensure that everybody who is responsible, in whatever area, would fulfil their obligations in relation to the objects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it still falls short of what Senator Cregan said.  I take his point on board because I also have been circulated with a very good report by the HOPE project concerning the Education (No. 2) Bill, in which they addressed the Bill as amended.  The HOPE project cited a number of quotes from Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's judgment in the O'Donoghue case, the most telling of which was:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced, on the evidence, that the provision of free primary education for children severely or profoundly handicapped, mentally and/or physically, requires a much greater deployment of resources than was thought <Col N="382" /> appropriate even as recently as 1983, when the Blue Report was completed.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in this statement of objects that suggests a much greater deployment of resources for the severely and profoundly mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>Section 6(b) states:</P>
    <P>to provide that, as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available, there is made available to people resident in the State a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs and abilities of those people;</P>
    <P>Between now and Report Stage, could the Minister come up with a separate amendment to try to encompass something that would get round the words &ldquo;as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available&rdquo; in terms of people who are severely or profoundly handicapped?</P>
    <P>None of us has tabled an amendment directly to that effect.  Such a subsection would recognise the Supreme Court's decision relating to a &ldquo;greater deployment of resources&rdquo; than would be the norm for other sectors, including children with special needs, and would specifically cover children who are severely or profoundly handicapped. We are not talking about enormous numbers, but it is a significant minority that has never been dealt with adequately.</P>

      <P>An initiative such as that which the Minister has taken should be transferred into the objects of this legislation, or go beyond it into the functions of the Minister.  However, once it is in the objects it means that everybody concerned with education, including the Minister, principals, teachers, boards of management and the inspectorate, has a responsibility in this area.  If we can come up with some such amendment it would go a long way towards satisfying the concerns that have been expressed, particularly those of Senator Cregan, and to address this problem once and for all, ideally in this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to what other people had to say, which is usually very good for me and I do not do it often enough.  One would want to be very careful about our Constitution which guarantees the right to primary education. However, the great and the good who reviewed the Constitution found no reason to extend equivalent rights to shelter, health or income.  By implication, even though they did not say it, they criticised the guarantee of free primary education contained in the Constitution.  The argument they used was about resources and the fact that these matters were essentially ones for political debate and decision rather than constitutional.  One has reason to be wary of the constitutional guarantee and where it might end up, although not with the current Minister, I hasten to add, but in principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is undoubtedly true that if the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable and having regard to the <Col N="383" /> resources available&rdquo; was in the Constitution the O'Donoghue case would have been lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of that there is no doubt.  That is the sort of phrase that many in our society would like to see inserted into the Constitution.  My problem with the word &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; is that in its defence in the O'Donoghue case, the Department argued that the child in question was not capable of being educated, in other words, it was not practical to talk about this child being educated. Although I have not discussed it with them, I suspect that is one of the reasons the parents in question are extremely unhappy about the phrase. They had the experience of being told it was not practical to educate their child.  That is why the phrase causes the hurt.</P>
      <P>I want to make a minor suggestion concerning the constitutional guarantee of primary education. Section 6(a) states:</P>
      <P>to give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children, including children who have a disability or who have other special educational needs, as they relate to education;</P>
      <P>The constitutional rights of children only relate to primary education.  It is doubtful if an argument about resources could ever win in this State in terms of primary education.  I am convinced, for instance, that if parents of pupils attending any primary school in an unsanitary or otherwise unhealthy condition took a case to the courts under the Constitution, they would win.  If a case was taken because of an absence of a level of teaching available in the rest of the country due to a shortage of teachers they would win as well. In a case like that, parents would win because of the constitutional guarantee.  The Minister and the Department could argue all they like about resources and the courts would say: &ldquo;The Constitution says you must provide it&rdquo;.  That is the reassurance people need.</P>
      <P>As regards the separate issues of &ldquo;resources available&rdquo; and practicality, I suspect that what is intended is an aspiration beyond the minimum guaranteed under the Constitution.  It is not within the capacity of the Oireachtas to put a qualification of practicability or resources on the provision of primary education.  Therefore, it would probably be more sensible to make clear in this section the distinction, if that is what it is meant to be, that there is an unqualified constitutional right to primary education but that the questions of practicality and resources apply to anything beyond that.  That is the only place where practicality and resources can apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a valid point.  That, in essence, is the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisDinoCregan" hpid="Mr. D. Cregan Mr. D. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because it is a constitutional right.  The section does not say that one <Col N="384" /> is getting a constitutional right, it mentions &ldquo;as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available&rdquo;.  I thank Senator Ryan for his contribution which broadened the point.</P>
      <P>Section 6(a) states:</P>
      <P>to give practical effect to the constitutional rights of children, including children who have a disability or who have other special educational needs, as they relate to education;</P>
      <P>Will the Minister consider tabling an amendment on Report Stage that would protect the handicapped by using the words &ldquo;to give every practical effect to the constitutional rights of children&rdquo;? I would settle for that compromise, as I did with regard to the period of two years earlier.  Would Senator Costello agree with that?  I think that covers it all.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the time he has devoted to this debate and for his sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a considerable background to this.  I took much legal advice on this matter, even before it went to the Lower House. The Department's legal adviser was as absolute about this as Senator Ryan articulated it in terms of the unqualified nature of the constitutional right to primary education.  My legal advice was that in reality section 6(a) was not required.</P>
      <P>With regard to the O'Donoghue judgment, it was appalling that the State did not contest the case when it reached the Supreme Court.  In essence, the judge asked if the State was contesting it and the State's counsel said it was not. It affirmed the action.  In other words, the State spent two or three years going through the system and conceded the case at the last hurdle.  That was the unacceptable aspect, in my opinion.  It should never have been allowed to happen although I do not wish to make a political point about it.  It is over now, but it cost £250,000 to get to that stage.</P>
      <P>I am not a lawyer, but I am not sure the inclusion of the words &ldquo;every practical effect&rdquo; would add to or detract from the provision.  I will certainly examine it before Report Stage and ascertain if it would strengthen the provision or deal with the point made by Senator Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I caution Senators in that regard because there is the issue of mental age versus chronological age.  Until now, in certain systems chronological age was used to define the end of primary education for a child with a disability.  My view differs.  In such a situation in Cork, for example, I have made provision to ensure that children over 18 years of age can still attend a primary school.  That has satisfied some of the parents' concerns.  Their argument was that the child had started school at eight or nine years of age, chronologically, but was still getting a primary education.  Therefore, we must be careful how we define this.  It might be safer for children in that situation to leave the provision as it is. However, I will examine it further with my legal advisers and the Office of the Attorney General. <Col N="385" /> This section deals with the objectives of the Bill, not the specific functions of the Minister. Objectives, by nature, are general.  That might sound strange, but one cannot comply with an objective in its specific terms.  One has regard for the objective.  The Office of the Attorney General is quite strong on this issue and with regard to the terminology used in legislation such as this.  I thank the Senators and I accept the sincerity of the case they made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the phrase &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo;, one can look at it in two ways.  There is a need for balance with regard to what is and is not practicable in all the provisions of this legislation. As Senator Ryan pointed out, second level education after 15 years of age is not a constitutional right, although in the school attendance Bill we hope to extend the school leaving age to 16 years or until the student has a qualification.  That would be a new departure.  Even if the Constitution does not provide for such a limit, it does not mean the Legislature should not do so.  One could argue that the Constitution is deficient now in terms of how one defines an elementary and a primary education.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan also referred to the constitutional review group.  I would oppose any attempt to dilute the right to a primary education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The group's position is that the guarantee to primary education is an anomaly because it has already stated there should be no guarantee for health, housing, income or anything else.  If the group states these are political issues, there is no reason the guarantee of primary education should be anything other than an anomaly. It makes me nervous.</P>

      <P>There is a world of difference between complying with something and having regard to it.  If I have regard to something, I take cognisance of it or consider it.  However, if I comply with it, I am making a more proactive response.  I am conforming to it and taking responsibility for that compliance.  It is a different ball game.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If Senator Cregan's suggested inclusion of the words &ldquo;every practical effect&rdquo; strengthens the requirement for the provision of resources, I would be happy.  However, as Senator Ryan pointed out, there are two authorities. There is the constitutional guarantee of free education to everybody at primary level, which brings somebody to the age of 15, but children in their late teens also have special education needs. Section 6(a) will provide that every practical effect is given to children's needs at primary level. Does that mean the child is covered by section 6(b) after that, which provides for those needs &ldquo;as far as is practicable and having regard to the resources available&rdquo;?</P>
      <P>Paragraph (b) uses different language in that it provides that an appropriate level and quality of education is made available to people &ldquo;resident in the State&rdquo;.  It does not refer to students or to children.  Is the legislation only limiting education within practicality and resources to people when it is above the constitutional requirement?  Can one take paragraphs (a) and (b) separately and acknowledge that special resources over and above the norm will be made available to children who are guaranteed an education by the Constitution and, after that, the clauses of practicality and having regard to resources will take effect? Why is the phrase &ldquo;people resident in the State&rdquo; used when the earlier sections refer to children and students?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann, in the light of the partial <Col N="388" /> and temporary troop withdrawal from East Timor by the Indonesian regime which has now been replaced by the heaviest troop saturation for five years (21,000 troops having been introduced which amounts to one soldier per 40 members of the indigenous population), calls for the immediate introduction of UN observers on the ground in the island of East Timor and calls for the release of the political leader of the East Timorese people, Xanana Gusmao so that he can participate in talks leading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Leader and to Members for allowing this motion to come before the House today.  I tabled it in light of the fact that tragedy has again struck East Timor, on this occasion in the town of Alas where a number of people were recently murdered by Indonesian troops.  The exact number is in dispute but even pro-Indonesian East Timorese confirm that at least 44 people were killed.  Others estimate that up to 60 may have been killed but the Indonesians deny that anyone has died.  I recommend that Members, if they have not done so, should read the good and detailed report on this matter in <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>This tragedy was inevitable and predictable. Those of us who have supported East Timor &mdash; virtually every Member of the House &mdash; informed by the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign, have been aware for some time that the alleged Indonesian troop withdrawal was a sham.  While the Indonesian Government under Mr. Habibie, the incoming president, was receiving the plaudits of the international community for having withdrawn troops, those troops were returning to East Timor in far greater numbers than heretofore.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession an analysis of classified military documents which incontrovertibly show that the number of military personnel on East Timor has increased.  The information analysed originated from documents belonging to ABRI, the Indonesian armed forces.  In referring to those documents the analysis states:</P>
    <P>They prove that ABRI regard East Timor as a place where they must maintain a pervasive and deep-rooted military presence to deal with people living in the towns, the countryside and in the bush, the vast majority of whom are totally opposed to the occupation.  The documents also prove conclusively that &mdash; contrary to claims by the military and civilian authorities that the number of troops in East Timor has been reduced this year, the number has actually increased &mdash; contrary to claims that combat troops in East Timor have been greatly reduced and are being phased out altogether, combat troops have increased in number and amount to nearly 40 per cent of the total number of troops in the territory &mdash; the civil defence, Hansip or Pertahanan Sipil units which are clearly a key element in the control of East Timorese society, is barely mentioned in the documents; they are not part of ABRI but fall under the Department of Home <Col N="389" /> Affairs, the most militarised department. ABRI provides the training, usually retired officers, and also supplies Hansip units with their weaponry.  Hansip is the recruiting ground for Timorese members of ABRI &mdash; that the paramilitary forces in East Timor are under the direct command of ABRI and are not an independent force of vigilantes outside the command structure as is usually claimed, and finally &mdash; that army personnel occupy all the key posts within the civilian administration, giving them control over the political, economic and social life of the occupied country.. The tables show that in August this year, the number of troops in East Timor amounted to 17,941 if only regular soldiers are included.  The figure rises to 21,620 if we include the armed and trained military personnel from the ranks of civil servants and the so-called wanra or &ldquo;people's resistance&rdquo; units.  Since the beginning of Suharto's New Order, the Indonesian state has been heavily militarised.  However, the figures show that militarisation of East Timor far exceeds Indonesia as a whole.  In 1995, ABRI consisted for 507,137 men for a population of around 200 million, roughly 2,500 troops for one million inhabitants.  The ratio in East Timor is nearly 18,000 regular soldiers for less than a million people or even higher as a ratio of the East Timorese people who currently amount to probably no more than 700,000.  Put another way, whereas in Indonesia as a whole, there was roughly one member of the armed forces for 400 Indonesians, in East Timor, the ratio is seven times as high &mdash; one member for every 56 inhabitants of East Timor.</P>
    <P>I have further documentation in my possession but it would be better if I did not spend my time placing the information they contain on the record.  However, I am prepared to make them available to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and to interested Members.</P>
    <P>It is apparent that the Indonesians used their camouflage operation, which involved the transmission of images that apparently showed the withdrawal of troops, to again saturate East Timor with military personnel.  The resultant tragedy in the town of Alas was inevitable.</P>
    <P>I understand the motion will be passed unanimously by the House.  I suggest that it be despatched to certain locations with an accompanying letter, which should draw attention to this tragedy and also to the fact that this is an immediate and urgent response &mdash; a fact which is highly unusual and for which I am grateful &mdash; given in the context of the Seanad's knowledge and understanding of the situation in East Timor. It is valuable to signal to the Indonesian authorities that we are observing events.  I do not believe we should place ourselves in the same situation as the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> and appear slightly ludicrous.</P>
    <P>The East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign is an extraordinary organisation and it enables us to become aware, almost instantaneously, of events <Col N="390" /> taking place on the tragic island of East Timor. Mr. Tom Hyland from that organisation and one of the Timorese guests in Ireland, José, are present in the House and this debate holds special importance for them.  As Members are aware, Mr. Hyland has been active in this area for many years.  East Timor is José's homeland, he has witnessed the devastation visited on his family and his people and, at a remote distance, he is now obliged to witness similar tragedies befalling others.</P>
    <P>As already stated, I suggest that the text of the motion, an accompanying letter indicating the circumstances in which this highly unusual step was taken by Seanad Éireann, the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, and a copy of the debate be sent not only to the Indonesian Embassy in London, where it will probably be immediately thrown in the bin, but also to Jakarta, the United Nations and Mrs. Mary Robinson, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. Such action is appropriate because we are seeking the introduction of UN observers to East Timor which is vital in ensuring the protection of the indigenous people.</P>
    <P>The town of Alas has been secured, cordoned off and no one is allowed to enter or leave.  The people there are terrified and the only individuals who have been given permission to enter or leave are Roman Catholic priests.  I honour these men and Bishop Belo for their continuing struggles in East Timor.</P>
    <P>The motion before us also seeks the release of Xanana Gusmao, the leader of the Timorese people, who has played the same role as that played by Nelson Mandela in South Africa, so that he can participate in realistic talks leading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.  We all bear in mind the sufferings not just of the Timorese people but also of the Indonesians in the current turmoil brought about by the despotism and crookery of former President Suharto.  I am grateful to the House for allowing us this opportunity to pass this resolution unanimously, as I hope will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Senator Norris in condemning the events in East Timor.  I am glad this is an all-party motion, which is unusual.  The situation in East Timor has deteriorated dramatically in the past week.  I am glad that what is happening there is being brought to the attention of Irish people by Conor O'Clery in <i>The Irish Times,</i> and by the work of Tom Hyland and the East Timor-Ireland Solidarity Campaign and Senator Norris.</P>
      <P>The people of East Timor have been let down by the world, the media and its appalling Government. It seems that, rather than the situation improving since Habibie took over from Suharto, it has deteriorated.  Many people thought the East Timorese would at least get some form of human rights back and that they would be able to live in relative peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not need to go into what effect this <Col N="391" /> motion will have as it does not make a difference whether it has an effect in Indonesia.  It has be brought to the attention of the United Nations, the Commissioner for Human Rights, the Irish governmental agencies, the Department and Minister of Foreign Affairs, the foreign affairs committees and the subcommittee on human rights.  It is a unanimous motion and the fact that it has been discussed here should be brought to everyone's attention.</P>
    <P>Conor O'Clery is sending back disturbing and accurate reports.  This is important as a further example of what might be done to bring the East Timorese to the fore of people's minds.  I am glad <i>The Irish Times</i> is doing that because to my knowledge no other bunch of the media has gone to East Timor to bring back details in a concerted way.</P>
    <P>East Timor was discussed at the Fianna Fáil Árd Fheis on Saturday and a motion was passed unanimously.  The young people who supported that motion are well aware of what is going on out there.  I was delighted that motion was passed as it shows a maturity entering the debate on foreign affairs and a recognition that Ireland does not exist in a cocoon and that we have certain human rights which others do not have.  We must ensure that governments far removed from here apply decent standards.  In areas such as East Timor, where so many have died, we should acknowledge that and fight for their human rights as if they were our own.  The world is now an extended family because of instant communication. It is no longer fitting that regimes such as that in Indonesia should be supported by the Australians.  They are imposing a continuum of problems on the East Timorese.</P>
    <P>The introduction of independent observers under the aegis of the United Nations would highlight what is going on.  They would have to be even handed and give an exact account to the United Nations, which unfortunately today is not the organisation it was meant to be as it is controlled by the United States and Britain who think they can undertake measures bilaterally, even against the wishes of the United Nations Security Council.  We have to be careful if we send in observers that they are impartial and will send back proper reports which cannot be appropriated by Britain or the United States for their own uses.</P>
    <P>If Gusmao is released and he can participate in talks leading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, the Indonesians will be giving a signal they are willing to do something.  We must acknowledge that he is the man who can give hope to the Timorese.  That part of the motion is extremely important.  We send our sympathy to the people of East Timor.  We have passed motions similar to this about other places &mdash; we hope someone will listen to this one and give some solace to the people in East Timor who have suffered for so long.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate at what is a sadly opportune time.  We are here again discussing the problem of East Timor, a subject which has been vented in this House a great deal since it was first brought to our notice after the massacre in Dili in 1991.  We are returning to the issue following the further massacre of possibly 60 people or more &mdash; as Senator Norris said, the figures are not clear &mdash; in a small remote town in the south of the territory called Alas.</P>
      <P>The West must be more insistent that the Indonesians honour the United Nations Security Council Resolutions 384 of 22 December 1975 and 389 of 22 April 1976 which call upon all states to respect the territorial integrity of East Timor as well as the inalienable right of its people to self-determination.  That is a resolution of the United Nations of which we are a member and the resolution demands action by the states party to it.  That should mean exactly what it says when it calls on the world to recognise the inalienable right of its people to self-determination.</P>
      <P>An independence movement in East Timor is nothing new &mdash; it goes back to 1912 when they first sought their independence from the Portuguese. The Portuguese left precipitously in 1975 which allowed the Indonesians to invade.  Ironically, the day before the Indonesian invasion, Mr. Henry Kissinger, the then United States Secretary of State, left Jakarta after what was described as a very successful visit to the then very favoured client Government &mdash; the Suharto regime &mdash; in Jakarta.</P>
      <P>Senator Norris read from a document which makes frightening reading.  Indonesia is one of the most militarised countries in the world.  It has a large population of approximately 200 million people.  It holds a standing army of in excess of 500,000 men.  That is approximately one troop for every 2,500 people.  That is an extraordinary level of militarisation in peacetime in any country. There are in the order of 800,000 people in the territory of East Timor, approximately 18,000 troops and between 3,000 and 4,000 military personnel who are there to infiltrate the administration on the island.  This means there are approximately 22,000 military personnel in the territory of East Timor.  This is an extraordinarily high ratio of military personnel to population.</P>
      <P>It is often forgotten that the tragedy of East Timor in terms of its invasion and annexation by Indonesia in 1975 and 1976 is one of the greatest genocidal and human rights tragedies, proportionately speaking, of this century.  In 1975 and in the two years that followed, more than one-quarter of the population of the territory &mdash; 200,000 people &mdash; died.  They were either shot, murdered or starved to death in a famine.  Proportionately speaking, that was one of the worst tragedies of the 20th century, and terrible things occurred in this century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the call for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, to take up this matter immediately with the Indonesian Government. <Col N="393" /> We have every right to do so as a supporter and signatory to two United Nations resolutions.  We should immediately inform the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson.  We should also take the case to the European Union.  Member states of the European Union are the major arms suppliers to the Jakarta regime.</P>

      <P>The Jakarta Government is one of the most unstable regimes in the world. Indonesia has its own tragedy in that it is inherently an unstable country made up of several ethnic groups with no history of democracy or participation by its people.  The repression of Suharto kept the lid on the cauldron for 30 years but it is at least half off since he was thrown out of power and the people saw they could destroy someone as powerful as he by demonstrating on the streets.  However, the violence on the streets of Jakarta last May when this was taking place was an ugly manifestation of the violence of the native Indonesian population against ethnic Indians and ethnic Chinese. Thousands of ethnic Chinese were murdered when law and order broke down in that country last May and we saw the removal from office of General Suharto and his replacement by his protégé, Mr. Habibie.</P>
      <P>The issue tonight is about East Timor and the second massacre in a few years which has temporarily brought an end to the United Nations brokered talks between Portugal and Indonesia.  Portugal is still recognised by the United Nations as the administering power in East Timor since it is a former colony.  Since last Friday Portugal has suspended talks with the Indonesian Government on future autonomy for East Timor.  A very serious situation has arisen and Ireland can play a part in resolving it.  There is no resolution to this other than recognition by the international community, by action rather than empty words, of the right of self-determination by the people living in the territory of East Timor.  I enthusiastically support the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that this House should once again express its solidarity and support for the people of East Timor in their continuing suffering.  This suffering has gone on since December 1975.  This is a significant occasion.  It is usual to have statements on matters such as this, international matters, foreign affairs matters and domestic matters.  What is less usual and noteworthy is that this is an agreed motion from <Col N="394" /> all the groups represented in the House, that it has the support of all the parties in the House and that it is a substantive motion.  In my experience this is only the second time this has occurred &mdash; the previous motion also related to East Timor, when we endorsed the resolution adopted in Portugal several years ago.</P>
      <P>I welcome someone from East Timor to the House and to recognise the work done by Tom Hyland and the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Campaign over many years.  They have been instrumental in ensuring this matter was kept to the forefront of public debate in Ireland.  One might question why it is appropriate that a small country on one side of the world should be concerned about another small country many thousands of miles away on the far side of the world. This is not surprising because there are many parallels in the history of the two islands &mdash; ours going back much further than theirs.  Nevertheless, freedom is cherished everywhere and it is the responsibility of this House to on all occasions proclaim the right of any people to their freedom. It is not enough for a people to be autonomous under some other rule.  There has to be freedom and that freedom has to be by self-determination by the will of the people.  There are parallels with our recent history with that principle.  The Good-Friday Agreement adopted in Belfast states that the status of Northern Ireland can change through the expressed wish of the majority of the people there as expressed through the ballot box. It is the minimal right of the East Timorese people to ensure any arrangement, whatever that may be, should have their support and that they are entitled to have it implemented through the ballot box.</P>
      <P>There is an urgency about this matter.  I am pleased the Leader found time this evening to have it debated and dealt with by way of substantive motion.  The history of East Timor and what has occurred since the invasion in December 1975 has been well catalogued in this House.  There is no need for me to repeat this other than to say virtually one-third of the population of a single island on the far side of the Pacific was wiped out through tyranny and occupation.  It can be compared with the Holocaust.  More recently, in 1991 when students attended a funeral in the Santa Cruz cemetery in Dili, 300 people were mown down by occupying forces.  In that context it is surprising the response has not been more vigorous and violent.  The international community has a solemn responsibility to ensure the terms of UN resolutions and other resolutions passed in the intervening period are adopted.</P>
      <P>I wish to read the reaction of the Timorese political parties to President Habibie's proposal for a type of political autonomy for East Timorese. At the time that was announced, hopes were expressed in this House that it would lead to a more secure future.  However, one has to be sceptical now.  It was hoped when there was a change of leadership in Indonesia from President</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> Suharto to President Habibie that things would improve.  There may have been an illusion that would happen.</P>
    <P>In that context it is important to read the statement of the leaders of the Timorese political parties on this matter.  It is noteworthy that those who signed this statement issued on 11 August 1998 includes leaders of political parties who previously would have been supportive of Indonesian occupation.  One of these is Apodeti, the Democratic Popular Association of Timor.  The others are Timorese Democratic Union, Fretilin which has campaigned vigorously for autonomy over many years, the Traditionalist Monarchist Party and the Labour Party.  Their statement reads:</P>
    <P>1.  We completely reject any discussion of East Timor being an autonomous province within Indonesia as proposed by Indonesia.</P>
    <P>2.  We demand Portugal send a committee of observers to East Timor to observe the situation on the spot before entering a dialogue and substantive discussion with Indonesia about the autonomy for East Timor proposed by Indonesia.</P>
    <P>3.  We wish to go ahead with dialogue under the proposal in our joint declaration by UDT, Fretilin, Apodeti, Kota and Trabalhista, dated 25 July 1998.</P>
    <P>They completely rejected the programme proposed by the Indonesian Government for East Timor.  They stated it is essential &mdash; and we agree with this, it is in the motion &mdash; that the President of the National Council of Timorese Resistance, Xanana Gusmao and all other East Timorese political prisoners be freed and that there is dialogue to find a solution to the problem of East Timor. This is proposed by the motion.</P>
    <P>They also talk of the need for the presence of a UN High Commissioner with powers to participate in identifying and resolving problems.  In this context, it would be appropriate for the resolution proposed by Senator Norris to be circulated to various international bodies such as the UN.</P>
    <P>My final point regards the response of the European Union.  The Troika should also be appraised of this motion.  There was a three day visit by EU ambassadors in June 1998 and a report was prepared.  According to the October 1998 edition of <i>Timor Link,</i> the report recognised the importance of bringing the East Timorese directly into the peace process, called for a ceasefire and called on the Indonesian Government to withdraw troops from East Timor.  This evening we are confirming this position of the EU.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other speakers, I am pleased to be party to this all-party motion which condemns the repressive regime in East Timor and calls for the introduction of human observers and the release of the political leader Xanana <Col N="396" /> Gusmao and other political leaders so as to achieve a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</P>
      <P>As Senator Dardis stated, this is a unique occasion.  The last time a similar discussion took place was after the Good Friday Agreement where all parties came together with a common view on the issue.  It is unusual to have no serious divisions in a parliament on a political issue, domestic or international.  There is a total harmony of views of events in East Timor, the repression, the holocaust and the genocide by the Indonesian Government since it annexed East Timor in 1976 when Portugal withdrew.  Given the number of people who have been killed and the regime of terror imposed, it is appropriate that we, a small nation which has suffered considerable repression from a colonial power over the centuries, would now identify with a small nation which is experiencing similar conflict and repression.  In our case that is all in the past.</P>
      <P>We should also identify with their aspiration to self-determination and do all we can in this regard.  As a neutral country we have a reasonable amount of influence in the world.  We should impress upon the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Andrews, the need to raise at international fora our concerns regarding events there at the earliest moment.  There were recent reports of large numbers of Timorese being killed, students protesting, curfews in place and the terror continuing unabated.  We must present the Minister for Foreign Affairs with this all party motion so that he can present it to the Council of Ministers of the European Union.  He should make a strong case to them because much of the suffering in East Timor is a result of weapons produced by our neighbours in the European Union.  The Labour Party is in government in Britain and, sad to say, its foreign policy seems to favour Indonesia in terms of selling weapons to that country.  Germany and France, which are regarded as the principal countries underpinning the European Union, could be exporting terror to a small, almost defenceless people such as the East Timorese.</P>
      <P>We should bring this motion to the attention of the UN High Commissioner, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and urge her to act on this issue.  We can move from this small domestic area to the large international arena and put pressure on those who have a say in events, be it in terms of the arms trade, UN sanctions or European Union observers.</P>
      <P>I compliment the work of the East Timor Ireland Solidarity Committee under Tom Hyland. He has impressed on all of us the importance of making East Timor a central issue in our international policy and our domestic concerns.  It is difficult to achieve this with so many other issues coming to the attention of politicians.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I support the East Timorese approach to self-determination.  They want a UN peacekeeper, dialogue between East Timor, Indonesia and Portugal, a withdrawal of Indonesian troops and the release of prisoners, particularly <Col N="397" /> Xanana Gusmao.  Of course it would be difficult to have dialogue without the principal political prisoners who are in jail being released to participate.  They want the final decision to be made by referendum.  All that is very democratic and we can all support those aspirations and practical steps towards their achievement.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to be a signatory to this all party motion.  I urge the Leader of the House to take this motion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and impress upon him the need to take the steps we have suggested towards the effective use of this resolution.  I hope it will play some small part in the resolution of the conflict in East Timor.</P>

      <P>I, too, am glad to add my voice to those of the Senators who have already spoken on this matter.  I have spoken on it before on a number of occasions as have the other Senators.</P>
      <P>I suppose we must ask ourselves if what we are doing here tonight is any good and will it achieve anything &mdash; Ireland is a small nation and it is on the far side of the world from East Timor.  I think it is and it will.  If we are silent and we do nothing, we will condone what is happening and by our silence it will get worse.  Even though we speak we may be ignored, but we must speak out always when we see injustice like this.</P>
      <P>The motion mentions 21,000 troops or one for every 40 members of the population.  If that was the situation in this country, you would see troops everywhere.  Everywhere you looked you would see a soldier, an armed person, ready not to protect you but to gun you down.  Speaking of Indonesia itself, a spokesman the week before last stated that if it has such a great and brave army, why do they not go and fight somebody instead of turning on their own population.  That seems to be the way of the regime there and it is something into which we should not buy.</P>
      <P>This is an all party motion but I want to give credit to Senator Norris because he is the man who keeps pushing this agenda irrespective of what everybody else says.  We all support him and it is an all party motion but, in fact, it is he who keeps pushing this.  I suppose he does it because he is pushed by that great man, Mr. Tom Hyland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>What can we do?  If we pass the motion, it is only one motion and one senate in one part of the world, but perhaps it will inspire another senate somewhere else, and another senate and a lower house, and so on until there are a number of parliaments involved.  If enough people speak out, change may happen.  If we were doing something like this here and we heard voices from the other side of the world condemning us, we would ignore the first, the second and the third condemnation but by the time we would get to the tenth <Col N="398" /> or eleventh we would begin to get a little worried, particularly if there were sanctions involved.</P>
    <P>I would love to see one nation speak out against these people, and that is the Australians. I have said this before here, but I believe this is about oil.  It is about Indonesian and Australian interests taking the oil from the East Timorese people.  I know we offend the Australians by saying this but I have no hesitation in doing it because I believe firmly they are not strong enough.  They are manipulating the situation to a large degree.</P>
    <P>Many Senators have spoken about the arms trade.  I see the countries of the European Union, countries with whom Ireland will become more and more intimately involved, supplying weapons. The European Union will never really be a complete union until there is some kind of common foreign or security policy which does away, for example, with nuclear weapons and bans the sale of weapons of destruction to people who really do not need them.</P>

      <P>There is no need for it.  There are many other ways of making money, such as tourism. However, there are big interests involved. For example, I believe that the war in Kuwait used up all the weapons which were needed up until 1989 so the war gave them a chance to manufacture more weapons in America.  We do not need that we really can get on without it. There may be a need for an army to defend us, but there is no need for the aggression and the supplying of arms in particular to people, who are mad men, who destroy small nations, who act in their own interests and rip these people off.  That is what has been happening in East Timor for years.</P>
      <P>What I would say to the Indonesian authorities is that maybe something can be worked out by negotiation.  Maybe if they talk to these people instead of killing them and beating them to death, they could achieve what they want or reach a compromise of some sort.  We never thought we would get peace in Ireland.  We never thought there might be some chance of peace in Palestine or Israel, but there is if one talks.  The leader of the people of whom you are most afraid is usually the man who can bring peace, as with Nelson Mandela in South Africa or Xanana Gusmao in East Timor.  If this man was released and discussions took place, a peace could evolve which would, perhaps, please all concerned.</P>
      <P>I do not want to delay the House on this matter on which I could speak for ages.  I was at conferences on this subject many times.  I have spoken about it before and I know as well as the rest of the Senators what goes on in East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion may not achieve a great deal but, as a senate, as the Upper House of the Irish Parliament, if we do nothing, say nothing and stay <Col N="399" /> silent, we condone what is happening and we should never be a part of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the sort of thing which Seanad Éireann should do and do with the sort of unanimity which has been displayed here tonight.  If East Timor raises any issue above all else, it raises the issue of morality.  In particular, it raises the issue of the morality practised by what likes to call itself the free world, the world which claims to be based on democracy and the free consent of the governed, which, in fact, has over and over again shamed those principles for reasons which are never apparent to the rest of us and which are dressed up in the language of democracy, freedom and resistance to tyranny.</P>
      <P>Let us not forget that East Timor was occupied by a country which in turn had a military coup which resulted in the slaughter of 500,000 of its own people, all in the name of anti-communism. No more than anybody else &mdash; apart from the occasional bit of fun we have here &mdash; am I a communist anymore than anybody else in the way in which that is said.  However, as a Christian I would have profound reservations as to whether there is any evil in the world which could justify the slaughter of 500,000 people.  Therefore, the idea that the slaughter which began in Indonesia and which has continued in East Timor would have been both sponsored and connived at by the powers which would claim to be the leaders of what is called western civilisation means of course that even though it is 10,000 or 12,000 miles away it is essentially our problem.</P>
      <P>To a considerable extent, the institutions and the so-called value system to which we claim to subscribe is, in fact, corrupted and undermined in a fundamental way by its association with the oppression of the people of East Timor.  The best friends of the Government which has oppressed the people of East Timor for over 20 years are governments which all claim to be democratic. The governments of Australia, the United States and the United Kingdom all have conspired to make East Timor invisible.  For a considerable part of its history since occupation, East Timor was invisible.  As Noam Chomsky and John Pilger stated, the biggest achievement of the Indonesian Government was to persuade the media of the western world that East Timor did not exist.  The first time it was mentioned in this House &mdash; I do not know who mentioned it &mdash; the reaction of most Members of this House was where is East Timor?  I do not say this as a criticism but as a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us were adults when East Timor was invaded.  We remember clearly things that happened before East Timor was invaded.  We remember the overthrow of Salvador Allende in Chile and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. Many of us remember the six day war.  However, we do not remember the invasion of East Timor because it was not mentioned as it was a long way away and inconvenient to do so.  I remember the <Col N="400" /> immortal phrase of a senior journalist in RTÉ ten years ago when he was asked why RTÉ was not showing a documentary which had been made about East Timor.  He said nobody in Ireland knew anything about East Timor, therefore nobody would be interested in it.  That is wonderful media logic.</P>

      <P>The letter appeared in <i>Hot Press</i> because it was critical of the same individual.  We are not talking about something done by an oppressive foreign power thousands of miles away but about something done with their connivance.</P>
      <P>I am also glad Senator Lydon mentioned the European Union.  I do not describe myself as a Europhile or Euro sceptic, but a critical Europhile. I was in Brussels recently where senior officials of the European Union explained to me that we had to establish a European armaments industry so that we could compete on the world market with the United States.  That is an obscenity because more innocent people &mdash; children and non-participants in war &mdash; die each year as a result of the arms race than from the abuse of drugs.  Yet we have a world war on drugs and a world war to sell arms.  Unfortunately, the first new major political entity of this century, the European Union, which was democratically conceived with the will of its people, wants to become another arms exporter.</P>
      <P>Arms exports always go to places which should not be allowed to buy arms.  If such countries want to buy arms, we should not sell to them because they would not want to buy them if they were democratically governed or did not have designs on their neighbour or a restless internal population.  No democratic government would want to buy arms on the scale on which the Saudi Arabian Government, the Indonesian Government, the Sudanese Government or a dozen other governments want to buy them.  They want them because they need them either to oppress other people or to oppress their own people.  By definition, the arms industry is immoral.</P>
      <P>The armaments industry and arms exports have corrupted politics not just directly in terms of backhanders, but indirectly in terms of corrupting values.  In particular, they have corrupted the politicians of the Left who go into government with pretences of a higher standard of international morality but who are ultimately corrupted by what they call the pragmatic necessity to protect the arms industry.  That is an obscenity. What has happened in East Timor for the past 20 to 25 years is as good an illustration of that obscenity as we have had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad we will pass this motion and that we will send it to the Indonesian Ambassador in London.  I am also glad the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who told us recently that he will visit Xanana Gusmao in prison in Indonesia, will have the strength of this motion to support him and <Col N="401" /> to make it clear that we, as one House of the Oireachtas, believe that freedom from oppression is indivisible and that it is always wrong, regardless of whether we like the oppressor or they are politically correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for taking part in this well informed and balanced debate.  Each Senator brought individual characteristics to their contribution.  It is significant that we should not only blame the Indonesians but that we should accept part of the blame ourselves in Europe.  I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Ryan on this.</P>
      <P>This is a matter of shame and reproach, particularly to the British Labour Party.  I am considering my stance as regards the visit by Mr. Blair. We have heard Mr. Robin Cook, the British Foreign Minister, talk about an ethical foreign policy, yet it continues to sell Hawk jets in the full knowledge that this type of machinery is being used against an innocent civilian population in East Timor.  This highlights the moral evasiveness even of well intentioned people from the Left in confronting these circumstances.</P>
      <P>There are also the Australians who, for naked financial advantage because of the illegal Timor Gap Treaty, are unwilling to enter into the complete condemnation which is required of Indonesia. However, truth has a way of coming out. Senator Ryan referred to Mr. John Pilger, a journalist and television reporter in whose debt we all stand, and others who indicated that the greatest achievement of the Indonesians was to persuade the world that East Timor did not exist. However, they failed because we know now.</P>
      <P>I remember with great pride that in the airport at Denpasar, when we were illegally taken from an aircraft by the Indonesian authorities, I had with me a poem handwritten by Bono and given to me by Mr. Tom Hyland in which he made this point.  I cannot remember it all off the top of my head, but he said things such as &ldquo;there is no silence deep enough&rdquo;, &ldquo;there is no darkness black enough&rdquo;, and &ldquo;there are no politicians crooked enough&rdquo;&mdash; I am sure he did not mean us &mdash; to ensure we will not know of what is happening in East Timor or that we will not hear the cry of the oppressed people.  Tonight we have heard that cry and we have responded to it effectively and with dignity.</P>
      <P>In a moving speech Senator Lydon asked if we, as an Upper House in a small country, could be of any use.  He answered that question affirmatively. If anything shows us that this can be effective, it is the example of Mr. Tom Hyland and his neighbours in Ballyfermot.  I was one of those who, the first time I heard about East Timor &mdash; it was Mary Robinson who asked me to add my name to a resolution &mdash; did not know where it was.  I suspected it was somewhere in the sea near Australia and I knew vaguely that terrible things were happening there.  I associated it with another territory misruled by the Indonesians, Irian Jaya.  However, I would have been hard put to go any further than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I accept the point made by Senator Ryan and others that we did not know much about East Timor, but we do now.  That means there is no excuse for the French arms industry selling Alouette helicopters to it.  The excuse Alain Juppé produced that the European Union was not a human rights association is no longer true &mdash; it was undoubtedly true at that point. However, there is a human rights protocol since the Amsterdam Treaty was passed.  There is also a human rights desk in Iveagh House as a result of the implementation of the White Paper and part of its duty is to monitor such issues.  With our tragic history as a people from which we have so victoriously raised ourselves, we have placed ourselves in a position where we can, and I believe, will be listened to.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to you, a Chathaoirligh, the Leader of the House and all my colleagues for passing this resolution and for providing an opportunity without much advance notice to sympathetically respond to the continuing tragedy of East Timor.  I am sure you, a Chathaoirligh, and the Leader of the House will ensure that the targets in Jakarta, London and the United Nations and Mrs. Robinson, whom I know is sympathetic, get this resolution.  Mrs. Robinson was the first person to raise this issue in the House when virtually none of the rest of us was aware of what was going on in East Timor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment to promote best practice in teaching methods with regard to the diverse needs of students and the development of the skills and competences of teachers.  I am delighted that is incorporated in section 6.  We had a very long and torrid discussion on section 6 and how it should be implemented, particularly in relation to resources and the &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; clause contained therein.  The objects and principles enshrined in this section, where every person who is concerned with the implementation of the Act is at least bound to have regard to them, are welcome. I am glad the Minister has included the provision in relation to teaching methods.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 21 proposes to delete &ldquo;economy&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  We are moving now to section 7 which deals with the functions of the Minister as opposed to the objects of the Bill which are dealt with in section 6.  One of the functions, as outlined in section 7(2)(<i>b</i>), is to monitor and assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the education system provided in the State by recognised schools and centres of education.  It seems rigid, mechanistic, almost utilitarian that the Minister feels he should monitor and assess the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of the education system.  Surely, the first thing he should monitor and assess is the quality of the education system.  I cannot understand why he included the words, &ldquo;economy, efficiency and effectiveness&rdquo; while not including &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  I would have thought &ldquo;economy&rdquo; was covered by &ldquo;efficiency and effectiveness&rdquo;.  It is unbelievable that the Minister has not given any priority or made any reference to &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  Obviously we should provide an &ldquo;efficient&rdquo; education system, but I ask the Minister to accept that our first priority should be the provision and delivery of a quality education system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am intrigued by the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; in Senator Costello's amendment No. 21.  I do not know what it means in the context of this Bill.  Obviously, his amendment makes a lot more sense.  Can the Minister of State educate us as to what the phrase &ldquo;the economy of the education system&rdquo; means?  I have not heard the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; used in this context.  If the Minister of State means the economic efficiency of the education system, that is fair enough.  If he means something else, let us use a different word.  I would like to know what the Minister of State <Col N="404" /> understands by the phrase &ldquo;the economy of the education system&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>My interpretation of the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; in legislative terms means value for money and general financial efficiency.  It implies that we are obliged to ensure the money being spent on the education system is spent to best purpose and targeted most effectively and that the taxpayer, whose money it is, gets the best possible value for it.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator Costello's amendment, despite his contribution, is not just to substitute the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; but to take out the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; and replace it with &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  I do not propose to accept this amendment.  The combination of effectiveness and efficiency defines quality in the education system.  As regards the use of the term &ldquo;economy&rdquo;, I make no apologies for ensuring, given the growing and competing demands on the education budget, that all spending in this area is done wisely.</P>
      <P>The Minister intends to submit the heads of a Bill to Government on the establishment of a teaching council in line with the report of the steering committee on this matter which he recently published.  The teaching council, when established, will obviously have a major role to play in overseeing and maintaining standards in the teaching profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is about time we had a teaching council.  That idea has been mooted for the last 20 years, although various problems have arisen, not least of which are the legal problems.  I do not know when we will get a teaching council.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with an education Bill which specifies the functions of the Minister.  It is incredible that we should specify these functions without the Minister having regard to the quality of the education system he is delivering.  I cannot accept what the Minister of State says.  If he has a problem with the wording of my amendment, which seeks to delete the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; and substitute it with &ldquo;quality&rdquo;, I am willing to adjust it for Report Stage to read, &ldquo;a function of the Minister is to monitor and assess the quality, economy, efficiency and effectiveness..&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable suggestion.  If the Minister feels he must retain the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo; he should have no objection to accepting the inclusion of the word &ldquo;quality&rdquo; before &ldquo;economy&rdquo;.</P>

It would not serve any purpose to change the word.  That would bring a whole new interpretation to this section.  The quality of the education system is already specified in the Bill.  It does not make sense to insert &ldquo;quality&rdquo;.  One would need to change the effect of subsection 7(2)(<i>b</i>) to achieve the quality to which the Senator is referring. That quality already exists and we are talking <Col N="405" /> about the functions of the Minister.  The quality of education has been stated.</P>

      <P>In page 12, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister shall direct each local authority to establish an education welfare committee with such number of education welfare officers as may be prescribed, to co-ordinate the statutory and other agencies concerned with the welfare of children in their functional area.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A substantial amount of responsibility for education has been devolved to local authorities. They are responsible for vocational education committees and school attendance in some areas and the Garda is responsible in other areas.  Local authorities are also responsible for providing school meals in some instances.  The education area has not been developed.  It is a Cinderella area in local authorities.  When vocational education committees are set up there is no reporting mechanism on how they operate as regards the parent body.  The school attendance service is in a dire condition with a mixture of Garda and local authority supervision.  The Minister intends to introduce legislation in this respect, but I do not know when that will take place.  School meals is another area which operates on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities are being reformed.  New policy committees are being established and it would <Col N="406" /> be appropriate, in terms of these reforms, that their responsibilities should be emphasised.  The educational support mechanisms they could provide could be teased out.  This amendment suggests that each local authority would establish an education welfare committee with such number of education welfare officers as may be prescribed. This would give elected members a role. It would also allow for the establishment of a welfare committee with education welfare officers. However we wish to describe them, welfare/development officers would know what is going on within the jurisdiction of the local authority.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have experienced is the inability to deal with people who are failed by the system.  People fall through the system. They drop out of school, mitch, end up in trouble, perhaps in prison, and their education is lost.  We have not devised a mechanism to solve this problem. We got rid of regional boards but have not replaced them with local boards or any other structure.  We have a stand alone school system. Why should local authorities not have this remit? They have a remit in education, but it has not been developed.  Should we not now establish a local structure?  Why not utilise that structure and set up the committees?</P>
    <P>Many committees are established by local authorities. Why should they not have an education welfare committee which would also deal with educational disadvantage and provide a support mechanism?  These committees would identify the problems.  Councillors are knowledgeable about everything going on in their areas and they are well able to provide information which could be fed to a local welfare committee.  This would be a valuable mechanism.  It would be worthwhile considering this issue now that we are reforming the local authority system.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government will introduce such legislation before the local elections. Why not make an input at this stage so he can consider how to reform local authorities?  We should give a boost to the educational aspect of the remit of local authorities.</P>

      <P>I understand Senator Costello's wish to involve local authorities.  However, I am not sure we should introduce education welfare officers in this context.  Such a measure should be within the remit of the Department of Education and Children which, perhaps, should have a co-ordinating function.  School attendance legislation will be brought before the House in the coming months.  In that context there is a role for welfare officers.  In whatever mechanism we come up with, I am sure there will be a role for the homeschool link and the support services which are a part of this Bill.  However, I am not sure we should spread it out.  We have been down that road too many times and it gets so splintered that people in the education system do not know with whom they should make contact.  I believe in <Col N="407" /> keeping matters tight and under one umbrella. This is the only way to make the system work.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Costello's idea.  Many local authorities set up local traveller accommodation committees.  My council did so yesterday.  It is a duty of all councils to provide halting sites for travellers.  This type of committee would be helpful in that area.  We already have a number of successful training centres for travellers at senior and junior level.  Many operate successfully in my county.  I am not specifically referring to travellers, but if we are to integrate travellers we must go down the road of training and education.  Perhaps this is what Senator Costello is getting at.  If this issue was examined in depth we might be able to include situations in which social workers and travellers could be represented on these committees.  That would be beneficial and worth considering.</P>

      <P>Section 7(1)(c) already provides for the co-ordination of educational support services. Subsection 7(4)(a)(ii) makes reference to services provided by other State agencies and, more generally, in the State.  Further provision is made in section 33(j).  It would be difficult to accept any proposal the effect of which, whatever the intention, would be to establish another layer of planning and co-ordination.</P>
      <P>I share the view expressed by the Minister that local education bodies similar to education boards would be an expensive and unnecessary imposition on the education system.  Senator Costello's education welfare committees could, with the best will in the world, turn out to be regional education boards in another guise.  I agree with Senator Costello that there is a need for the co-ordination of local services.  The school attendance Bill which is being drafted and will come before the other House early in the new year will provide for an education welfare service to do the sort of work at local level which is referred to by the Senator.  However, it will be done in a different way in that the education welfare service will be a national body with local subcommittees. While I accept that the work described by Senator Costello needs to be done, I believe there is a more efficient way of doing it. That will be provided for by the school attendance legislation.  Despite the logic of what Senator Costello says I cannot accept his amendment.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 7(3), the Minister's functions are laid out.  I take it that we are agreed that the Minister should have those functions.  Some Members of the Opposition have proposed giving the Minister more functions.  If someone is given functions, that person must be given the power to carry them out.  Section 7(3) is intended to ensure that no one can find a legal impediment to the Minister's carrying out his functions.  For example, section 7(2)(c) states that the Minister has power &ldquo;to lease land or buildings to any person or body of persons for the purpose of establishing a school.&rdquo;  One might imagine a difficulty in a title which might prevent the granting of a lease.  I presume that if such a difficulty existed, the Minister's powers as stated in section 7(3) would override it.  That is my understanding of the subsection.  If Senator Ryan requires more clarification I will speak to officials in the Department and communicate with him.  The Minister has been given certain duties and we must ensure that he has the legal powers to carry them out.</P>

I am still at a loss as to why we have patrons.  I think it is an historical anachronism and we could do without it where we do not need it.

      <P>In page 13, paragraph (d), lines 10 and 11, to delete &ldquo;having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 25 has some bearing to the issue raised by Senator Ryan, that is, school patrons. The reason the system of school patrons has never been questioned is that it has been in existence for a very long time and people have taken it for granted.  The system of providing a patron for every school both primary and secondary is very unusual and I presume it is not replicated anywhere else in the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the term &ldquo;having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo;.  What does the &ldquo;characteristic spirit of a school&rdquo; mean? There are almost 3,000 primary schools and 800 <Col N="411" /> post-primary schools, almost 4,000 in total.  Are we talking about a characteristic spirit of each individual school?  It seems strange for us to legislate for that type of mixed group because we are talking about almost 4,000 different characteristic spirits.  How can they be characteristic if they are all individual schools and they develop their own spirit?  It is a mind boggling concept.  The definition in section 9 (d) is to &ldquo;promote the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students and provide health education for them, in consultation with their parents, having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo;.  It would make sense if the definition referred to the spirit or the ethos of a denominational school but are we talking about individual stand alone schools having a characteristic spirit?  Does it refer to Belvedere College in Dublin or Clongowes or any new school that might be set up tomorrow, for instance, the North Inner City Community College? Where does a school get its characteristic spirit?  It is built up over the years.  Is a &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; a good thing?  There is no definition of &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;.  I failed to find one in the interpretation section.  Can the Minister clarify what is meant by the elusive characteristic spirit of a school and how it is created?  What is it?</P>

      <P>It refers to the ethos of the school.  There are not 4,000 different types of ethos here but there are various religious undertakings and we have to reflect their views.  The parents also expect us to reflect their views; this will come under the phrase &ldquo;consultation with their parents&rdquo;.  I have no difficulty with that paragraph.</P>

      <P>We went to great length during the debate on the Employment Equality Act to define the term &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;.  In section 2(b) of this Bill there is a description of the characteristic spirit of the school which states: &ldquo;as determined by cultural, educational, moral, religious, social, linguistic and spiritual values and traditions which inform and are characteristic of the objectives and conduct of the school&rdquo;.  That is a stab at defining it but I cannot find anywhere in the Bill where it is required that anyone has to write down and describe the characteristic spirit of the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that people must have regard to the characteristic spirit of the school as long as they know what it is.  Is there a requirement in the Bill that the teachers, the pupils or the board of management of the school have to be informed of the characteristic spirit of the school in an intelligible <Col N="412" /> fashion so that it is not something that can be defined to suit the convenience of the patron when they do not like something the school wants to do?  I do not want to get rid of it but the definition of a school's characteristic spirit should be written down somewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief perusal of the Bill I have not found it either but we will search more assiduously later tonight.  We are talking about a school ethos.  We have to use some expression where we all know what we are talking about.  It is a matter of finding an appropriate expression to put into legislation.  It might not be the best definition; perhaps there is a better one.  My note which forms part of the background to the discussions on the drafting of the legislation states that the characteristic spirit of a school is the intangible character of the school which encompasses the purposes for which the school was established and the collective attitudes, beliefs, values, traditions, aspirations and goals of the school community.</P>
      <P>While the expression itself is often associated with religion, the reality is that ethos encompasses much more than that.  It is as much a concern for gaelscoileanna and multi-denominational schools as it is for denominational schools.  To convey this wider sense of ethos, the Bill uses the expression &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; rather than the more limiting term &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Regarding amendment No. 25, it is the view of the Minister and of the Department that promotion of the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students and the provision of health education can only be done having regard to the characteristic spirit of the school.  We are supported in this by local school committees, communities, parents, teachers and management authorities.  It would take from the effect of the section to remove the reference to &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;.  Therefore, the amendment cannot be accepted.  However, I will take account of what Senator Ryan said and pass on his comments to the Minister.</P>

      <P>What Senator Ryan identified in relation to paragraph 15(2)(b) needs to be stated clearly.  My amendment does not so much disagree with the phrase &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; as to attempt to find out what it is about.  We are discussing the moral, spiritual, social and personal development of students which are important parts of their learning and education.  The undefined characteristic spirit seems to vary from school to school.  It would be appropriate for its definition to be included in the interpretation section of the Bill so that it is understood.  I am sure the Minister would have no problem providing for that.  However, the fact that he began his description with the word &ldquo;intangible&rdquo; makes it very difficult to define.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This needs to be defined because one man's or woman's intangible characteristic spirit may not be another's.  This could result in a huge variety <Col N="413" /> of characteristic spirits which may well be uncharacteristic in terms of all schools of which there are almost 4,000.  While it is a better expression than the word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;, I am not sure it should not be defined; the phrase &ldquo;stated characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo; or something else which ties it down might be suitable.  A definition in the interpretation section may not be possible but the phrase merits something more tangible.  The Minister might examine this to see if it can be tied down to some extent.</P>

      <P>I recall a similar debate some months ago on the Employment Equality Act.  It was the last occasion views were exchanged on terms such as &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; and &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;. There was a reasonable consensus at the time that such terms could not be pinned down.  When I suggested that attempting to find the term which best describes mercury as being perhaps most akin to attempting to describe &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; or &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;, I was criticised on the basis that it only confirmed what certain Members found to be a cause for alarm &mdash; that schools or school boards could, at a whim, change the characteristic spirit or ethos to suit themselves.  It was suggested that churches should be called upon to define the ethos and characteristic spirit of their schools.</P>
      <P>Ethos has historically served us well.  The Minister has sought to broaden it by referring in the Bill to the &ldquo;characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo; and that is as broad as he can go in the circumstances given that ethos cannot be defined.  Ethos means one thing for me and something else for other Members.  For a school, it is the totality of the values it has and we should not be any more limiting than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know this has been discussed at length before but a number of issues arise.  One is that the ethos of schools is referred to in the Employment Equality Act.  Does the Minister have legal advice about the relationship between the word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;characteristic spirit of the school&rdquo;?  It is important because people can be sacked from schools for reasons of ethos.  Can they be sacked for reasons to do with the characteristic spirit of the school?</P>
      <P>I am a believer in denominational education and am in a small minority on the political Left who do.  Does each individual Catholic school have the right to define for itself a separate characteristic spirit?  This could mean a conservative parish priest in one area having one definition of characteristic spirit and a liberal parish priest in another area having a different definition. Senator O'Toole has spoken of the experiences of national teachers in this regard &mdash; that there was nothing like a uniform understanding of the ethos or of the characteristic spirit of a school.  This is why I ask if schools can be encouraged to describe but not to define in writing their characteristic spirit to give some protection to people involved.</P>

      <P>The term &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; emerged from a two year process.  I referred earlier to a two year process which led to the deeds of variation being agreed at primary level.  Given the diversity of provision, especially for those who do not fall within the denominational variety of provision such as the multi-denominational schools and the gaelscoileanna, the term &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;, with which the facilitator came up, was one which found greatest agreement.  All agreed to the phrase rather than what was perceived to be the more limiting word &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It embraces a wide area and there are different emphases in certain schools and different characteristic spirits inform them.  There is an argument whether we should aim for uniformity or diversity. Should we accept that diversity exists?  The provision in the Bill and its terminology accepts it exists.  While I do not wish to be facetious, given that it took two years to devise the term &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo;, I am not sure what would happen if schools were directed to state what it meant for each of them.  Getting the school community to agree to that in the first instance could be a long process.  However, it would not be in some cases. The gaelscoil movement has a clear view as does the multi-denominational movement.</P>
      <P>Characteristic spirit can embrace a sporting or cultural ethos or a range of areas for which schools have a reputation or in which they have developed a record or proud tradition.  I see this travelling around the country to various schools. Drama is a defining characteristic in one, traditional music in another and sport in another.  It varies from school to school and that is healthy. Broadly speaking, the INTO has always accepted the position that teachers would never do anything to undermine the ethos or characteristic spirit of a school.</P>

      <P>We all agree with everything the Minister has said.  One could have virtually 4,000 different characteristics.  One could also have an individual patron who, as Senator Ryan said, can be quite different from another patron in terms of views and input.  Some patrons have a hands on approach, particularly in primary schools, while others do not.  Since one can have a collective patron as with the vocational education committees, is one talking about the characteristic spirit of an individual school in that case?  Is one talking about the collective spirit that the VEC, as patron, is responsible for or is one talking about each individual school within a VEC system of education that will have its own individual characteristic spirit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> On the other hand, one could be talking about a single owner who is the single patron of a school and who can go about his or her merry way. Under the legislation they do not even have to have a board of management.  There may be problems getting a board of management in such cases.</P>
    <P>There should be ground rules for a characteristic spirit, despite the difficulty involved in defining it.  There is some attempt to define what a characteristic spirit is in section 15(2)(b).  In terms of equality legislation and issues that may have a bearing on the dismissal of a teacher, it would be very valuable if the characteristic spirit, which is now replacing ethos, would have some recognition or stated format in which at least the key elements are prescribed or laid down, even though they may vary in intensity and emphasis from patron to patron or from school to school. Nevertheless, there should be some collective parameters in relation to characteristic spirit that could not be breached by a particular school. There may be others which might be deficient as regards the rounded characteristic spirit, or rounded ethos in the old language, but we are looking for something a bit more tangible than is in the section and which could give some indication of a certain unity of principle in relation to characteristic spirit.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is possible to specifically provide a uniform definition of &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; in the sense that Deputy Costello has put forward.  In terms of ethos, the Equality Bill deals with the rights both of patrons and those who work in institutions, be they in the health or education area.  As the Senator knows, much work went into that and during the reign of the last Government there was much input both from Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; would embrace the term &ldquo;ethos&rdquo;.  It would fall within the broad term &ldquo;characteristic spirit&rdquo; and, therefore, there is a relationship between this Act and the equality legislation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
      <P>In page 13, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) ensure that the language/cultural needs of minority groups such as refugees are identified and provided for,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a clear and simple amendment.  Whether we like it or not, people from other cultures are settling here and we have a responsibility to cater for their needs.  Other countries are doing it, so <Col N="416" /> why not Ireland?  For example, in Britain, our near neighbour, Asian and Arabic schools cater for the specific cultural needs of settlers there. This area will grow sooner rather than later and we must face up to it.  The Bill contains no provision to cater for these people but one should be included.  I would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are committed to dealing with the educational needs of children of refugees or, indeed, of children who seek asylum within the State.  We do not discriminate and under UN resolutions we have obligations to provide education for all children in the State, irrespective of their background, creed or denomination.  Even in the case of children of asylum seekers who have no legal residence, we do not turn them away &mdash; we provide for them in schools.  A designated inspector in the Department is dedicated to drawing up proposals and making provision for the children of refugees, particularly with regard to language requirements.  One of the basic necessities for any such groups that comes into the country is to provide for competency in the English language to facilitate their children to communicate within the country.</P>
      <P>I would like to come back to this issue on Report Stage.  I do not want to interfere too much in the admission policies of individual schools, but I want to check the background to the legal obligations on us as regards providing for the children of refugees.  At the moment, the obligation rests upon the State and to a large extent we are doing it, although some schools argue that they need more resources particularly since the recent growth in the numbers of those seeking asylum.</P>
      <P>If the Senator does not mind, I will come back to this matter on Report Stage with an alternative wording to capture the spirit of what he wants included in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endorse to some degree what the Minister said and I hope the Minister will amplify his thinking in this area.  Although language and culture have always been intertwined, parents who come to live in this country are insistent that their children, who do not speak English, should be given every opportunity to learn it because it is the language of communication here.  However, cultural needs are a separate issue in the educational context.  When he reexamines this matter, the Minister should amplify his thinking in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>To place an obligation on individual schools to provide for such cultural needs could be difficult given the resources of individual schools around the country.  If we were to place a <Col N="417" /> strict obligation that schools had to provide some African languages, for example, where the school does not have any competency in that area, it could pose a difficulty.  The State, however, must try to help in a general sense by providing resource centres or other bases for assisting children in this situation.  An example of what we have done is the specific provision for Bosnian refugees.  I do not know how one would enshrine that in legislation.  This question did not arise in the Lower House.</P>
      <P>As I was dealing with Private Members' business in the Dáil, I did not get a chance to check this matter.  I may rephrase it on Report Stage so that we can reflect Senators' sentiments in the Bill.  However, I suspect that the obligation should be on the State as opposed to the schools.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted Senator McDonagh put down this amendment.  It will address an aspect of school attendance that is currently operated on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.</P>
      <P>In my constituency, up to 10 per cent of enrolments at a number of primary schools are children of refugees or asylum seekers.  Their parents do not arrive on a structured basis but at any time during the year.  The children go to the local primary schools.  The Minister will be aware that schools where enrolments were declining are now increasing due to a concentration of refugees and asylum seekers in the area.</P>
      <P>The majority of these children do not speak English and the language barrier is a problem when attempting to integrate into the education system.  I am not aware of the Department putting any extra resources into dealing with the mixture of language, cultural and educational problems these youngsters will experience in adjusting to their new environment.  It is appropriate that there should be a responsibility in this area on the school or on the Minister.  It certainly should be an objective of the Bill that this aspect of education and the needs of such children should be addressed.  If it were included in the section dealing with the objectives of the legislation, there would be a responsibility on all those involved in the implementation of the objectives to fulfil it.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties in fulfilling that objective. How does one address cultural needs in the school context?  One child might be from Africa while another might be from Romania.  The children bring a mixed set of cultural experiences to the school as well as being faced with the Irish cultural experience.  The language barrier is a major issue and substantial support mechanisms are necessary to deal with it, certainly in the short term, so that youngsters do not lose out in fulfilment of their early educational needs simply because they have difficulty learning the language or coming to terms with the education system.</P>
      <P>The amendment is worthwhile and I hope the Minister finds a means of addressing it.</P>

      <P>Unlike many of my colleagues, I was an emigrant and I still have strong links with <Col N="418" /> the Irish diaspora.  I cannot help but reflect on the polyglot nature of American society.  On one occasion it was suggested that German rather than English should be used in a school.  There was even a referendum on the matter.  In recent years the question of language arose again and it resulted in a definitive statement being made by the people.</P>
      <P>If Ireland is moving towards becoming a multicultural society, I welcome that.  That is why I strongly support many of the views expressed by my colleagues on this issue in other debates. However, in this context I am concerned that the needs of the parents are taken into consideration. The heavy hand of the Department should not be involved in giving legislative effect to something which, perhaps, the parents of the children might not want or like.  That is why I am curious to know the Minister's thoughts on the issue.  It requires original thinking.</P>
      <P>Families arrive in Ireland in much the same way as the Irish arrived in England and America. Irish emigrants integrated and were assisted in that integration.  At the same time, however, they had support services which were provided not by the State but by their fellow emigrants.  There are many such societies in England and America which have been visited by the Minister and by other public representatives.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about legislating on such a complex area.  I do not have the answer to this problem, but when people make a conscious decision to come and live in a country such as Ireland, England or America whose societies have certain mores, it means they must decide to integrate into or segregate from that society. There are also other pressures such as attitudes and so forth.  I can anticipate the thoughts forming in the minds of Senators Costello and Ryan, but that is not what I mean.</P>
      <P>I am referring to the position of families who decide to live in this country.  They accept the structure of the society, but the issue is to balance their needs with the obvious points that have been raised about language and culture.  A balance must be struck and I am concerned that the Minister might be pushed into introducing legislation which, in practical terms, might be more of a hindrance than a help.  I do not have the solution to this problem and I am curious to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of a heavy handed approach.  Obviously, one would have to work with the various cultural minority groups. What we are discussing is an educational provision that would recognise the cultural rights of minority groups who are refugees or have refugee status.  We should not put in place obligations that cannot be met in practical terms.  There is no point including something in the legislation in order to look good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are practical problems involved, particularly at school level.  Obligations in many instances rest with the communities or the parents <Col N="419" /> who are often responsible for maintaining the cultural identity of their children.  Only a few weeks ago the British Government included the Irish language in its national curriculum even though Irish community groups throughout England were engaged in cultural and language provision.  Some schools were teaching the Irish language, but without State resources.  They welcome the fact that they have received recognition.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello might have pointed the way in suggesting that this provision be included in the section that deals with objects.  I am willing to articulate the issue in the Bill to show that the State understands it has an obligation in this regard, albeit there are practical problems in providing certain things.  That would be a welcome step forward.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 28:</P>
      <P>In page 13, paragraph (m), line 36, after &ldquo;policy&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;which does not involve entrance examinations and&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes that where an admissions policy to schools is established, it should not involve entrance examinations.  While the Minister of State said the established policy in a school should provide for maximum accessibility, it should be enshrined in the legislation that entrance examinations should not be permitted as part of that policy.</P>
      <P>Aptitude testing for the allocation of classes and so forth is not a problem, but an admissions policy that depends on entrance examinations has been shown in the past to be discriminatory and to have been used as a mechanism to exclude children who are not wanted for certain reasons. If such a policy were to operate, it could give rise to enormous dangers.  Some schools still persist in using it.</P>
      <P>When providing for the functions of a school, the legislation should make it clear that entrance examinations should not be part of the admissions policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with many of the points made by Senator Costello. Everyone has come across cases of serious allegations of discrimination against aspiring entrants to particular schools but it can never be categorically stated whether such discrimination took place.  However, the deaneries, with whose work I am most familiar, in consultation with the Department and successive Ministers have succeeded in breaking down and removing perceptions of discrimination, particularly in the part of the city where I live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am sympathetic with the idea that schools' admission systems should not be open to supporting discrimination of any kind &mdash; I strongly support this sentiment &mdash; I am equally conscious of the need for schools to have local <Col N="420" /> autonomy in terms of admissions.  There are many reasons for this opinion with which Members are <i>au fait.</i>  Senator Costello's amendment is too prescriptive and it would limit schools' local autonomy, which must be seen to obtain.  Having said that and given that people are concerned about this issue, I know the Minister will be anxious to bring the influence of the Department to bear on individual schools to ensure that the system is as open, transparent, accountable, fair and non-discriminatory as possible.  I assume the Minister will support those sentiments.  I do not believe Senator Costello's amendment, which recommends the total abolition of schools to hold entrance examinations, is in the interests of local democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Costello.  I am intrigued by the section he is seeking to amend which states that a school must provide &ldquo;maximum accessibility&rdquo;.  I presume this refers to children who can gain entrance to schools on foot of their social background, educational attainment, etc.  However, as I understand it, fee paying schools will be recognised schools under the legislation. How will the Minister ensure maximum accessibility to schools which charge fees of £1,000 or more per term?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Constitution, our system of education is State aided.  When drafting the legislation we decided not to be overly prescriptive in terms of schools' admissions policies. However, we are placing obligations on them to clearly set out and publish those policies in order that people can gain access to them.  The provisions in admissions policies which form obstacles to certain students gaining access to a school are those which state that a person, even if they do not live in the locality, may gain access to a school if their brother, father or mother were past pupils.  That tends to be the major issue in terms of access to second level schools.</P>
      <P>There is a rich diversity of institutions offering second level education.  I accept that there are fee paying schools but these are in a minority.  Some parents continue to believe it is worth paying money for their children's second level education but I do not hold that opinion.  Voluntary schools have their own admission policies and these institutions are State aided.  The Constitution did not develop a State owned system of education, it provided for a State-aided system and the State has never owned schools.  It is constitutionally questionable whether the State, even if it so desired, could in law prescribe that no school should hold entrance examinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science discourages entrance examinations and the vast majority of schools do not have them.  However, <Col N="421" /> some have pre-selection tests to identify the strengths and basic abilities of students before they enter the system.  That is not a bad idea because it is important that schools should gain an idea of students' level of education.  There are certain legal constraints on what can be done in this area.  Given the small number of fee paying and other schools which hold entrance examinations, one could go down a tortuous legal route trying to enforce a regulation to prevent them holding such examinations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's comments in respect of fee paying schools.  However, I was referring to standard voluntary schools which are not fee paying but which are assisted by the Department of Education and Science.  An inordinate number of schools retain admissions policies based to some extent on entrance examinations. The problems attached to this discriminatory mechanism have not been addressed.  Those problems might disappear if we determined that funding could be withheld from schools with admissions policies which use entrance examinations as a discriminatory mechanism and which limit students' access to those institutions.  That could also be used against the fee paying schools if the Minister so desires because the Department pays the salaries of the teachers who staff these schools.</P>
      <P>As far as I can determine there is no entrance examination mechanism for primary schools but one definitely exists in many secondary schools. It does not seem appropriate that the Bill should pass without dealing with that question.  Do we want a relatively small number of schools to be allowed to use mechanisms which decide whether a student will be granted entrance on the basis of their ability on leaving primary school or do we want to ensure maximum accessibility so that students can attend the college or school of their choice?  How we incorporate that in policy is another matter but students should not be obliged to overcome the hurdle of entrance examinations which can be used by schools in whatever fashion they desire.  We should a find of way of asserting that schools should have a maximum accessible admissions policy and that should not include an entrance examination.  I do not see any other way to do that than to specify this mechanism which is being used by some schools.  Entrance examinations are not used by other schools who are proud to state that.  All voluntary schools should be on the same wavelength as regards their admissions policy and an entrance examination should not be one of the means by which they refuse admission.</P>

      <P>There may also be implications for school transport in section 9(m), line 37, which provides for maximum accessibility. Perhaps &ldquo;within a school catchment area&rdquo; should be inserted there.  In rural areas the concept of a school catchment area is usually the bus journey for the collection of students.  While I subscribe <Col N="422" /> to the concept of maximum accessibility within the confines of a defined school catchment area, there may be a danger that the concept could be abandoned following this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is absolutely no danger of that.  I do not want to apply the school bus catchment area to this issue or we will never solve it.</P>
      <P>I empathise with Senator Costello but I cannot accept the amendment.  We could look at it under the regulations or in terms of the recognition section of the Bill where the Minister has powers to recognise schools or withdraw recognition if their behaviour or conduct is not in keeping with either the objects or functions of the school. Under sections 10 and 11 the Minister can intervene. I am not disposed to including the amendment on a legal basis.</P>

      <P>This is the key area of difficulty in the present system and not addressing it is turning a blind eye to the problem.  I do not recollect any school for which recognition has been withdrawn on the basis that it has operated a selective policy which would be discriminatory. There is no precedent for that so I am not sure if it will happen.  Schools often deny it but effectively it is happening.  I do not know if there is a mechanism under which the Minister can establish regulations or issue a circular.</P>

      <P>I wish to revisit an issue which is relevant to section 9(a) which ensures that the educational needs of all students, including those with a disability or other special educational needs, are identified and provided for.  My colleagues have referred to the initiative undertaken by the Minister some weeks ago.  However, I want to express my personal thanks to the Minister on behalf of my daughter who is a special needs child and many of the others who have benefited from this initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="423" /> Living in rural Ireland, the fight to get a special class in a small rural national school was not easy. However, having got it, to retain and resource it was an uphill battle.  I know Ministers make decisions and take initiatives and a cynical public, and perhaps even more cynical politicians, will question his motives.  However, the fact that the Minister has taken this initiative will have enormous trickle down benefits for parents of children with special needs.  This will be a legacy the Minister will look back on proudly, no matter how long he stays in this Ministry or whatever other one he may go to.</P>
    <P>It is a special area and I hope that, as a follow on to the initiative, the resources will be put in place and that what the Minister has outlined will happen.  I have no doubt it will but it is important we keep the pressure on and that this happens by the provision of psychologists, speech therapists and especially teaching assistants, who are a wonderful addition.  I hope the initiative will be implemented quickly.  I know the Minister has made the decision and then bureaucracy will take over.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the area of arts and culture and section 9(f).  As a member of the Leitrim VEC, I am also a member of an organisation called the Sligo-Leitrim Arts Committee which was set up by the Sligo VEC with a contribution from the Leitrim VEC.  There are only a small number of arts officers employed in this context across the country.  The arts officer responsible to the joint vocational education committees operates in the two counties by providing accessible arts programmes in the vocational sector.  He encourages those of an artistic bent in a variety of areas, including music and painting, to go into vocational schools to teach for a number of hours.</P>
    <P>It seems that the origins of this arts officer's employment goes back 25 years.  He is unique as there are only two or three others similarly employed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>With the vocational education committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This gentleman and his colleagues are in an anomalous situation.  I did not give the Minister any warning of this question although I briefly discussed the matter with his officials.  I do not expect him to answer the specifics. However, I wish to put in context the general request.  It is fine to say a school will have this function but will the Minister now look at the possibility of arts officers being appointed across primary and second level?  There should be more arts on an extra curricular basis or in the school curriculum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are paying lip service to the arts.  I accept this is all to do with resources.  The officer, Leo Regan, is doing outstanding work with very limited resources in a rural part of the country.  The examples he has highlighted on the committee indicates that schoolchildren in all secondary <Col N="424" /> school sectors would benefit from a refocusing on the arts.  Left to their own devices schools will not necessarily do it.  Some vocational education committees have had enough hours in their quota to appoint music teachers, etc.  However, this is very haphazard across the country.  In stating that, the function of the school under section 9(f) is to promote the development of language, the arts and other cultural matters and, notwithstanding the opt-out regarding when resources allow, I would be grateful if the Minister would indicate his thinking in this area from an education point of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments on the special needs initiative.  We are determined to provide the necessary resources. We are putting in place automatic entitlements in terms of a staffing schedule for children with special needs.  In other words, they will not have to await the crumbs of any future dividend; the provision is there as a matter of right.</P>
      <P>The Senator outlined a unique situation in terms of arts and culture.  Every VEC does not have an arts officer, but obviously many would like one.  We would need to discuss the expansion of that system with the local authorities who have increasingly appointed arts officers.  If a VEC arts officer and a local authority arts officer operated in the same area, there would be significant duplication. This would not be desirable.  I am committed to expanding the arts in schools.  This can be done in a number of ways.  The artist in residence programme which the Arts Council, in conjunction with the Department, has developed is a good initiative.  Under this programme, an artist resides in the school for a particular period.  The fruits of that work has had a dramatic impact on certain schools.  There is no difficulty in schools where there are good arts teachers.  In some second level schools there are two kilns and pottery craft and so on is very successful.  In others there is not a painting in sight.  The programme is patchy to that extent.  However, provision is increasing.  In second level schools the change in the arts syllabus is having a significant impact on participation.  Generally speaking, more music tuition needs to be provided for at primary school level.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the many national bodies who are collaborating with us.  The National Gallery has many good school initiatives in place.  The Hugh Lane Gallery has very good education initiatives and works with the schools.  The Arc Centre in Dublin has an extraordinary impact and has an enormous schools programme.  I hope other regional arts centres will replicate what is happening in Dublin in terms of the outstanding service being provided to schools in the field of the arts.  I would like arts centres throughout the country to do the same.  However, they are increasingly appointing education officers.  That may be the route to go in some areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put his finger on the need for co-ordination.  As he was speaking I was thinking of Mr. Regan and the fact that local authorities have been given financial resources by the Arts Council to appoint arts officers.  At the Estimates meeting yesterday, we were informed that such resources have been provided and that a new arts officer for the entire county has been provided.  Heretofore, it was a joint effort between Longford and Leitrim.  The incumbent was snatched by our Longford friends and we were left without anyone.  The resources are now being provided and the area partnership boards are also appointing arts officers.  In County Leitrim there is a Sligo-Leitrim arts officer who operates between the two counties, an arts officer who is funded through the area partnership boards and there will now be a new arts officer appointed by the council.  The situation is similar in many parts of the country.  The area partnership boards are increasingly appointing arts officers to develop the arts at local and community level.</P>
      <P>In light of the Minister's remarks, perhaps his officials would consider co-ordinating this resource and directing it into the educational area.  I know I am talking to the converted, but it is vital for a well rounded education that young people in primary and second level have an awareness of the arts.  I am not talking about the arts only in the context of painting and music, I am concerned about the creeping globalisation, particularly in the area of music.  Children of six and seven years of age are now mouthing lyrics by international pop acts that would have been severely censored when I was growing up.  It is an old story that if children are not exposed to a wider artistic environment they will grow up with a great lack in their education.  This is a very serious issue in the context of the function of schools.  I hope the Minister will bring the same commitment to this area as he has brought to many other areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Every young person in the North is offered a tin whistle or other low cost instrument in primary school if they wish to learn music and participate in their local communities.  Playing Irish music is a great way of getting young people to play a part in their communities and to be proud of their villages and schools.  It does not matter what type of music it is.  Music is a very uplifting experience.  People go out in the evenings to places where music is played because they find it uplifting.  It enhances the evening's entertainment, even for those who do not drink.</P>
      <P>A former Taoiseach had a novel idea when Minister for Health.  He made a toothbrush available to every young person in school who wished to use it.  On this occasion the Minister could put some life into rural communities and schools.  As one who has benefited from the gift of music, I would like to pass on my experiences to future generations.  Music allowed me to see the world and to experience the university of the world through the gift of music.  In these days of the Celtic tiger it would be nice if a small allocation of money &mdash; perhaps on a pilot scheme basis &mdash; could be made available to counties such as Senator Mooney's where there is a great appreciation of music.  I agree with most of his views.  He has a wide knowledge of the music industry and people like him could progress what I am proposing. Perhaps the Minister would return to this on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Tá dhá cheist agam don Aire, an chéad cheann faoi scoileanna Gaeltachta.  Seo rud a mholfainn dó smaoineamh air &mdash; nílim ag lorg freagra ar an bpointe.</P>
      <P>Ós rud é go bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar scoileanna atá lonnaithe sa Ghaeltacht cabhrú chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn mar bhunteanga cumarsáide, mholfainn dó na rialacha a athrú. Nuair atá ar mhúinteoir atá ag múineadh i scoil Gaeltachta dul ar an bpainéal, ní chóir go gcuirfí brú air nó uirthi an Ghaeltacht a fhágáil chun post a thógáil áit éigin eile.  The Minister has a pretty good idea of cén áit atá i gceist agam, ach mar phrionsabal ba chóir go smaoineofaí faoi.  Má tá múinteoirí maithe ag múineadh sna Gaeltachtaí, ní chabhróidh sé leis an sprioc atá againn maidir leis an teanga má bhíonn orthu an Ghaeltachta a fhágáil.  B'fhéidir nach mbeadh an cumas céanna Gaeilge ag an múinteoir a thiocfadh isteach, ná an sprid ná an coimitmint céanna.  Ba chóir go ndéanfaí <i>cordon sanitaire</i> idir an Ghaeltacht agus an Ghalltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second question deals with a matter about which I am concerned although I agree with it as <Col N="427" /> far as it applies to primary schools, that is, &ldquo;the quality and effectiveness of teaching in the school, the attainment levels and academic standards of students&rdquo;.  This is a requirement on individual schools to maintain systems to assess all these things.  Where is the guarantee to parents that there will be comparable ways of doing things between schools?</P>
    <P>I am concerned that in an increasingly competitive environment where schools seek pupils, claims can be made which cannot be verified or selective claims will be made.  We could end up in the position the Minister is correctly trying to avoid in section 53, but which applies more to State examinations.  These would be evaluations conducted within the schools.  I am concerned we could have an informal league table or schools making exaggerated claims about the attainment of their pupils.  I do not want to go down that route, neither does the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual parents will have access to school records and boards of management must be consulted in relation to the school evaluation pilot project we are currently undertaking with 12 pilot schools; there are 12 more coming on stream.  Parents are on boards of management so they will have an input through boards of management in the school evaluation project.</P>
      <P>On the issue of schools making exaggerated claims, parents will have access to a range of information which the school publishes or makes available.  To a certain extent, parents will inevitably make judgments on the schools to which they send their children.  Ireland is different to other systems in that we have diversity in many areas.  There are different types of schools even within a town.  There can be three different types of second level school.  That helps the parent in some respects.  Word tends to get around locally about what happens &mdash; or does not happen &mdash; in schools.  There is still a need for general access to information about issues such as which subjects are taught in a school and the result of a whole school evaluation pilot project.</P>
      <P>We have to be careful.  The issue of league tables is dealt with in section 53.  We are anxious not to allow the publication of league tables.  It is a question of balancing one against the other.</P>
      <P>Maidir le scoileanna na Gaeltachta agus múinteoirí ar an bpainéal, cheap mé nach raibh deacrachtaí ann i ndeireadh na dála.  Sa chás speisialta sin bhí sé an-deacair dul thar an Conor Pass.  In áiteanna éagsúla ar fud na tíre, tá saghas limistéarú ann ó thaobh an oideachais de.  Ach táim sásta machnamh a dhéanamh ar an gceist agus ar an gcóras.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 9 gives all the functions of a school.  I am disappointed educational disadvantage is not included.  I would have thought the Minister would regard this as an area for separate provision in terms of the function of a school.  A <Col N="428" /> school should be given responsibility where educational disadvantage is the concern of a number of its pupils and there should be an onus on the school to respond.  That provision should be made in relation to the functions of the school.</P>
      <P>Other specific areas are mentioned here from the Irish language to arts, literature and special needs, so why not educational disadvantage which, as I stated earlier, is the major problem affecting schools?  It is the major problem school management needs to address and correct but there is no reference to it as a specific function of the school.</P>
      <P>I would like to see admissions policies reflecting open admission.  This was mentioned earlier in the context of entrance examinations. Educational disadvantage is not covered in any of the provisions in section 9.  It is a significant and single omission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have argued before that in terms of educational disadvantage, the obligation to provide resources has to be on the Minister for Education and Science of the day.</P>
      <P>The functions of schools have to apply to all students.  The span of educationally disadvantaged students could be quite wide in some areas, narrow in others and hard to define in others.  I would argue that it is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not there specifically.  Special needs, the arts and literature are provided for specifically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are specific things we can do with special needs which in some cases schools were not doing before, such as making schools physically accessible.  In some instances the Department was being blamed for situations for which it had no responsibility because schools did not even apply for ramps or specific toilet facilities in some instances.  We did not receive the applications.  The first we heard was when parents rang us.  That has happened in the past.  We are trying to cover those situations in terms of the functions of schools.</P>
      <P>In the context of the educational disadvantage committee, we are making a significant statement in relation to educational disadvantage.  We can go back to the tautology approach to everything in the Bill and insert language everywhere.  There is a commitment to educational disadvantage in the Bill.  However the primary focus for educational disadvantage &mdash; and I keep coming back to this &mdash; has to be the provision of resources from the State.  Legislation on its own will not remedy that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is exactly why I am saying we should insert a provision to target educational disadvantage.  If it is covered with resources like everything else in terms of the legislation, obviously it should be dealt with in that context. However if a school is specifically told that educational <Col N="429" /> disadvantage is a priority issue, it has to address it and must prepare how to do it as part of its school plan in the same way it would address special needs.</P>
      <P>There are no structures to deliver on the educational committee being set up.  Perhaps there will be in the future.  We should place an onus on boards of management, the Minister and the schools in terms of schools' functions and how to target the resources.  The biggest function is in relation to disadvantage and it is not even referred to here.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister have a definition of a viable school?  Are there criteria by which the concept of viability is measured or is it a local matter depending on circumstances?

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have criteria for the recognition and establishment of a school.  We normally grant provisional recommendation which is followed by permanent sanction and recognition.  The school accommodation committee which was formed over a year and a half ago has compiled a report on a new process of school recognition.  We envisage moving to a much faster school recognition process so that people will not have to wait five or six years.  The Minister may introduce regulations from time to time to change the criteria for recognition <Col N="431" /> of schools, but that would be done only after consultation with all the partners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The criteria for a viable school seem to relate exclusively to the number of students attending or likely to attend the school. How does that relate to primary schools in the vicinity of a Gaelscoil?  There is a perception that primary schools might lose pupils if a Gaelscoil is established.  Are other schools in the general hinterland part of the criteria?</P>
      <P>Section 10(4) states that the &ldquo;Minister may from time to time designate a place to be a centre for education&rdquo;.  Why has the Minister included that in a section which deals with schools?  He pointed out that a centre for education does not come within the Bill's definition of a school.  Centres for education should be dealt with in other legislation.  Is a centre for education different from a VEC college? A centre for education provides adult, continuing or vocational education or training.  If the Minister establishes further centres for education, will they be stand alone centres or attached to vocational education committees, or will they be part of a new dispensation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The school accommodation committee involved all the partners which represented Gaelscoileanna, multi-denominational and denominational schools, the Department, parents, teacher unions, etc.  The idea was to try to develop a common system of recognition.  Parents have a right to choose under the Constitution the education of their choice.  We are, in the context of the school accommodation committee report which has yet to be accepted and put in place, endeavouring to put in place a local community consultation process before a school is established so that those who wish to establish a certain type of school will take due cognisance of the impact it may have on other schools in the area.  We are assessing that report at present.</P>
      <P>Until now, the position was that if the Gaelscoil attained a certain number of students in one year, it justified and merited provisional recognition and that over time permanent sanction was given if the numbers were high enough to merit permanent viability.  In other words, the school will develop and generate sufficient numbers to render it viable in the future.  At present, a school must have 20 pupils to start with.  However, that could change if the school accommodation report is implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards a centre for education, we felt it would be useful, for the purpose of the legislation, to insert it in a section which deals with the recognition of a school or the recognition or designation of a centre.  A school could over time become a centre for education.  We have seen how second level schools have changed to become centres for further education.  Youthreach is a centre of education.  We intend to develop further multiplex centres in which a <Col N="432" /> range of education provisions will be provided under one roof.</P>

I assure the Senator that unprecedented amounts of capital funding &mdash; £117 million this year &mdash; are being spent on capital projects at primary and secondary level.  Not all schools comply with health and safety regulations.  That is a personal observation, I may be wrong.  The primary focus is on our obligation in terms of health and safety issues or fire safety.  Local authorities issue fire safety certificates and a range of legislation is in place to deal with those matters.  We had a 40 per cent increase in capital for the primary sector last year.  We have gone from £27 million in the 1997 budget to £55 million this year for capital projects and £32 million in 1997 to £59 million this year in terms of second level capital.  Those are significant increases.  I cannot put my hand on my heart and say every school meets all the safety regulations. I visited a school in Wexford this week and was appalled at the conditions there.  The Department is not at fault; it took 12 months for the relevant VEC to appoint a design team which had been sanctioned in January.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 29:</P>
      <P>In page 15, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) The functions of the Chief Inspector shall be&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to manage and co-ordinate the activities of Inspectors so as to maximise output,</P>
      <P>(b) to assist and support Inspectors in the discharge of their functions,</P>
      <P>(c) to take direction from the Minister in relation to policy matters,</P>
      <P>(d) to report to and advise the Minister,</P>
      <P>(e) to prepare and present to the Minister by November 1st each year, an annual report on the Inspectorate and the Minister shall, with or without amendment, lay the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the first sitting day of the following year,</P>
      <P>(f) to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities involved in or seeking access to the education system are addressed, and</P>
      <P>(g) to ensure that the needs of the educationally disadvantaged are addressed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an attempt to insert a new subsection which would give fresh functions to a chief inspector.  While the Minister refers to the chief inspector and inspectors collectively, he only provides responsibilities and functions in relation to the inspector.  I invite him to provide functions for the chief inspector.  Obviously, a chief inspector has a superior role to an ordinary inspector and that should be specified.  The Minister should specify that his or her role is to co-ordinate and manage the activities of the inspectors, assist and support the inspectors, take direction from the Minister in relation to policy matters, communicate with the inspectors and report to the Minister.  There should also be a responsibility on such person to provide an annual report from the inspectorate.  As we refer in all areas of responsibility to the needs of special education and disabilities, such person should have a particular role in that regard.  Finally, such person should ensure the needs of the educationally disadvantaged are addressed.  That would be a valuable role for a chief inspector.  I seek to expand the functions of the inspectorate as outlined to include specific roles and responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  Section 13, following amendments in the other House, states that on the initiative of the inspector, he or she shall visit <Col N="434" /> recognised schools and centres of education; evaluate the organisation and operation of those schools and centres; evaluate the education standards in such schools or centres; assess the implementation and effectiveness of programmes of education devised in respect of individual students who have a disability or other special educational needs; assess the implementation of regulations made by the Minister and report to the Minister or to the board, patron, parents of students or teachers, as appropriate, and as prescribed, on these matters or on any other matter relating to the activities of those schools or centres.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive range of functions are assigned to each inspector.  I know what the Senator is getting at.  His amendment is similar to one tabled in the other House by the Opposition spokesperson who seemed to be anxious to create a new office of chief inspector which would be at one remove from the Department and would offer critical evaluation of what the Department was doing.  My view is that the chief inspector should be an integral part of the team of the Department.  I do not want to refer to the British model where inspectors concentrate on the inspection dimension of their work.  I know from experience &mdash; I have been in office only 15 months &mdash; that inspectors play an effective role in terms of curriculum development, monitoring and the State examination system and in advising Ministers in terms of psychological services and special needs.  We have to decide if we want to create a division within the existing structures and move the inspectorate from the Department or whether we want to retain it in the Department. I think it is preferable to keep the inspectorate within the Department.</P>

To eliminate any confusion or misinterpretation, advice rendered should come only after consultation with school management. That is the basis of my amendment No. 31.</P>

      <P>Parents might find that unacceptable.  They might not like the idea of an inspector consulting them having already consulted school management.  Parents feel &mdash; and I agree with them on this &mdash; that they should have the right to consultation, irrespective of whether an inspector has talked to management.</P>

I am considering the realities from a school management perspective.</P>

      <P>It may not be the intention of the Senator's amendment, but its effect would be that the inspector may consult with parents only after he or she has consulted with the board of management. That may not be desirable from the point of view of parents.  What would happen if a board of management was non-co-operative and did not communicate with a parents' association? That is one of the frustrations experienced by many parents' associations &mdash; they cannot get past boards of management to access decision makers and inspectors.</P>
      <P>I do not see a problem.  If we accept this amendment it could restrict the right of parents to access a key player &mdash; the inspector.  Parents are also key players and must be seen as equal partners in the process.</P>

      <P>As regards the chief inspector, I agree we would create another layer.  Will the role of the chief inspector incorporate the function highlighted by Senator Costello?

      <P>I understand what the Minister is saying.  He would like the inspectorate to operate in a collective fashion.  However, this would omit any role for the chief inspector.  Is the chief inspector a <i>primus inter pares</i>?  Why is he or she chief inspector?  The inspectorate will carry out these roles.  The Minister is saying that all the functions I have specified for the chief inspector, apart from those in paragraph (g) concerning educational disadvantage, which he has not taken on board, are covered by the inspectorate in a collective fashion.  This begs the question of what the chief inspector will do which is different from any other inspector.  How will he or she perform his or her functions?  How will he or she relate to the Minister?  Will he or she be a go-between or will the inspectorate communicate with the Minister on an individual basis, if an inspector is dealing with a particular subject or area of operation? It is not clear how this collective will operate or what the role of the chief inspector will be.</P>

I am seeking that the chief inspector's functions should include managing and co-ordinating the activities of inspectors as a whole to maximise output; to take directions from the Minister and report and advise the Minister.  This would establish a line of communication in which the chief inspector would have a specific role and his or her responsibility would be to manage the inspectorate.  Otherwise, how will the inspectorate operate collectively out of the blue?  There will have to be some leadership role, otherwise it is not necessary to appoint a chief inspector.  As the Bill stands, the chief inspector does not appear to have any managerial, co-ordinating or communicative role.  That is done by the inspectorate, collectively.  This is confusing and will give rise to a lack of direction, function, targeting and communication.  I like the principle of a collective entity.  However, the chief inspector would need a defined role.</P>

      <P>I am confused.  What will the chief inspector do which an inspector will not do?  One function will be determining such examinations as an inspector may be required to do.  The other function I can find is that a teacher or a board <Col N="437" /> may request the chief inspector to review any inspection.  These are the only two functions I can find in the section which give the chief inspector a different role.  One concerns examinations and the other concerns appeals which can be made about inspections.  Is there anything else the chief inspector will have to do that an inspector will not have to do?</P>

      <P>At present, the chief inspector has the status of assistant secretary in the Department. The Public Service Management Act has to be implemented before the end of the year and it will lay down the hierarchy and the functions of each officer in the Department.  The key is to have an integrated approach.  The Senator is correct that the chief inspector has always been involved and is responsible for the conduct of State examinations, the school evaluation process and the inspection process.  Therefore, for example, the chief inspector would have been primarily responsible for developing the school evaluation pilot project.  We have to be careful about creating competing orders of hierarchy in the Department or separating functions from the Department.  The Public Service Management Act will do this, but someone has to make the final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely in view of the decision taken yesterday and the ongoing discussions on traffic management in the greater Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The motion is the result of requests from a number of business people in Dublin city who are concerned at the continuing traffic gridlock which prevents or discourages shoppers from coming to the centre of the city.  This is affecting the economy of our capital city.  I have framed the motion in a way which will allow the Minister to indicate the Government's opinion on park and ride facilities in areas other than Dublin.  It is coincidental that the Minister who will reply to this Adjournment debate comes from a city where park and ride has operated successfully for 12 months.  It is interesting that the southern capital has taken a lead in this regard.  Even yesterday's announcement was merely about temporary park and ride facilities for Dublin.  The case for park and ride is well made and I hope the initiative announced yesterday will be encouraged by the Department. I am surprised this matter comes under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  I would have thought it would be dealt with by the Department of Public Enterprise.  This, too, indicates some confusion in the area of traffic management in Dublin and generally.</P>
      <P>The motion also affords me an opportunity to examine the whole question of traffic management. Traffic gridlock appears to be exacerbated by the extension of the bus lane system in that bus lanes dominate many of the approach roads to our cities. While bus lanes are a welcome development, we do not yet have a viable public transport system and restricting access to city centres to motorists when such a public transport system is not in place is a recipe for disaster.</P>
      <P>The present situation cannot continue.  One suggested initiative which I would like implemented on a permanent basis is the granting of permission to private buses to use bus corridors. I see no reason private sector buses could not access these corridors, particularly in the absence of a viable public transport system.  When I speak of a public transport system I include trains and the DART system as well as buses.  We must remember that the DART system is the privilege of the east coast.  The rest of the country does not enjoy such a facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of penalising those who bring cars into the centre of major cities is a live issue.  A newspaper article earlier this week proposed that motorists should pay to come into city centres.  I am not convinced that such a radical approach is called for at this stage, but where a viable public transport service is available a case can be made for imposing a penalty on such motorists.  The penalty could take the form of restricting the number of hours a car may be parked at a meter <Col N="439" /> or in a car park or making such parking financially prohibitive.</P>
    <P>We are all agreed it is frustrating to see a line of cars driving to a city centre in the early morning or late evening with only one person in each. We cannot allow such a practice to develop unhindered.  Whatever the deficiencies in our public transport system, many of these drivers cannot justify using their cars to come into the cities.  The article I referred to earlier suggested that solo motorists are anxious to justify the use of their cars because they have formed the habit of listening to a favourite radio programme every morning or evening and do not relish the prospect of sitting in a cold and airless bus among a crowd of strangers.  Encouraging the use of public transport may intrude on the private preferences of our citizens, but the greater good must be recognised.</P>
    <P>My purpose in bringing this matter to the House is to highlight this serious issue and to maintain it on the public agenda, particularly in the weeks leading up to Christmas.  I hope the initiatives announced yesterday will go some way to alleviating the problem and I reiterate the central point of my motion, that the Minister should encourage the establishment of park and ride facilities on a permanent basis in Dublin and their extension to other parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for raising this important issue.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, is unable to be in the House this evening and has asked me to respond to this matter on his behalf.</P>
      <P>Park and ride facilities are widely recognised as an important instrument in achieving an integrated approach to urban traffic congestion.  Well located facilities of this kind can assist in encouraging commuters to leave their cars in secure parking areas and travel by public transport to the city centre, thereby reducing traffic congestion. Park and ride facilities offer potential benefits to the car user in terms of less congestion and more affordable parking charges, to public transport in terms of increased passenger numbers, to local authorities in terms of better management of limited road space and for the public at large in terms of less traffic and a better quality environment in the inner suburbs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are only limited park and ride facilities associated with certain DART and suburban rail stations.  The Dublin Transportation Office has, however, been working with its constituent organisations to establish a framework for the more extensive development of park and ride facilities in the Dublin transport initiative area.  In May last, the DTO produced a park and ride strategy for the DTI area.  The strategy identified 20 sites throughout the DTI area where park and ride facilities could assist in encouraging commuters to travel by public transport to the <Col N="440" /> city centre, estimated that the sites would provide an additional 8,360 car parking spaces and could be used by up to 14,700 persons daily and that the total cost involved would be £39 million, including the cost of land purchase and £6 million for a dedicated bus fleet to serve the six bus-based sites.  It concluded that revenue from parking charges and public transport would not be sufficient to cover costs and, accordingly, substantial financial support for the investment involved and ongoing running costs would be required.</P>
    <P>The strategy is being addressed by the DTO to CIE, the Dublin local authorities and other relevant agencies.  In response, and as part of the DTO short term action plan, Dublin Corporation is considering the development of a major pilot park and ride facility in Finglas.  In addition, Dublin Corporation and Dublin Bus announced yesterday, as part of Operation Freeflow, the provision jointly of park and ride facilities at Whitehall and Simmonscourt during the Christmas period.  These pilot projects together with similar experiments in the Cork area, to which Senator Mooney referred, will provide invaluable experience which will assist in the development of park and ride facilities on a wider and permanent basis throughout the DTI area and in other major cities.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the DTO strategy that there is no single or universally applicable model for the development, financing and operation of park and ride facilities.  Different models will be required depending on circumstances.  In general there will have to be an openness to a partnership approach involving public transport operators, local and other public authorities and the private sector.</P>
    <P>Park and ride facilities are undoubtedly part, and an important part, of the solution to problems of urban traffic congestion.  A good start is now being made to implementing and testing viability in the Dublin area.  DTO and its constituent bodies will continue with this important work as part of the integrated approach to Dublin transport management which we must actively take forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Education and Science for taking this motion tonight on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  I ask the Minister for Finance to provide special incentives to attract industries to Border towns which have suffered from 30 years of armed struggle in the North.  I tabled this motion because this is the right time to provide a package to allow towns in my area that have been badly affected for 30 years to have an opportunity to reach the same standard as towns further south, for example, Clones which is the nearest town to me.  Other examples are towns such as Castleblayney or Ballybay, Belturbet and Blacklion in County Cavan. In Clones our initial problems started when the railways closed.  For the past 30 years the commercial <Col N="441" /> trade in Clones has been badly affected by road closure, the political conflict and the difference between sterling and the Irish punt in latter years.  Clones is only half a mile from the Fermanagh border to the North and if one travels west one must cross into Fermanagh twice before reaching County Cavan.  Seventy-five per cent of its trade came from Northern counties but with all the problems it was cut off from the rest of the country.</P>
      <P>Last week the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy McDaid, announced an EU special support programme for Peace and Reconciliation and £750,000 was allocated to 20 towns and villages in the Border region which were the most badly affected by the Troubles.  The money is targeted at improving shop fronts, the layout of premises and management of business in the area. Luckily four towns in my constituency have been included in this package.  Unfortunately, this incentive scheme on its own is not enough to attract businesses to Clones and that is why I tabled this motion.  There is no point in simply having shop fronts looking well.  We need another incentive scheme which will work in conjunction with the special support scheme to attract industries to the area.</P>
      <P>It is only now that proprietors in the town are regaining their confidence after years fighting a losing battle.  Now that they are getting the confidence to invest we need to provide tax incentives or some other scheme to attract other investors into the area, either foreign investors or indigenous companies.  If we have good premises they will be used and if people work in an area they will spend their money there.</P>
      <P>In Clones what was the business centre of the town 20 or 30 years ago now has one foodstore, one newsagent, about a dozen pubs and betting offices, 20 derelict houses and one derelict cinema. The money we will get from Europe will help to improve the look of the premises and then all we need is for people to spend their money there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>County Monaghan has been the product of our own misfortune because it has always been viewed as an entrepreneurial area.  Unfortunately, all of our industries are home based and many of them are family run, ranging from the manufacturers of furniture, to agriculture, turkey rearing and mushroom production.  We have been very unsuccessful in attracting foreign investors.  I do not mind what type of industries set up or whether they are multinationals.  There are people who would be willing to invest in a company but it is very difficult for anyone to start up on their own.  An incentive scheme to attract industries to areas like Clones would be of benefit to the county.  To emphasise my point, the live register figure for unemployment has decreased by 22 per cent nationally over the past five years. In the Border area the figure has decreased by 10 per cent but in the Cavan-Monaghan area it has only decreased by 6 per cent.  These statistics <Col N="442" /> show that we are not on a par with the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>The economy is going well at the moment and people are gaining confidence from the British-Irish Agreement.  People are willing to invest in their own area.  We have a number of development associations and various groups that are trying to improve their areas.  The time is right for us to utilise our European funding and my area will improve financially if we get a package from national funding.  If we can improve economically then there will also be social improvements.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for taking this motion and I look forward to his reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Finance could not be here but I am glad to be in a position to speak on his behalf.</P>
      <P>The Government is keenly aware of the negative impact of the conflict in the North on the economy of the entire Border region.  We all hope the Good Friday Agreement will herald a new era characterised by lasting peace and economic prosperity for both the North and the Border counties which have endured so much over the past 30 years.  The Minister is convinced the achievement of lasting peace is the greatest incentive for economic development in the Border counties.  Prospective investors need to be assured of stability if they are to be attracted to a region. This is the case in all economic sectors but is particularly true in the case of the tourism industry.</P>
      <P>However, the Minister is also aware that a region which has suffered from so many disadvantages over recent decades requires special assistance to overcome such obstacles.  This view has also been shared by successive Governments and by the EU Commission.  A reflection of this commitment is the number of initiatives established to address the special needs of the region.</P>
      <P>The EU community support framework for Ireland, 1994-9 includes a commitment on the part of the Irish and UK Governments to maximise co-operation on Northern Ireland.  Under the existing round of Structural Funds, the entire country enjoyed Objective One status which entitled it to the highest rate of assistance from the funds.  <i>Per capita</i> income in the Border region remains below the threshold of 75 per cent of the EU average.  If the Government's regional approach meets with the approval of the EU Commission, then the Border region would continue to enjoy the benefit of Objective One status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will be aware that the Border region is already receiving special assistance under various programmes.  These programmes include the International Fund for Ireland, the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation and INTERREG. The International Fund for Ireland was established by the Irish and British Governments in 1986 with the aim of promoting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border <Col N="443" /> counties.  The fund has received contributions from the European Union, the United States, Canada, New Zealand and Australia.  It has already provided a total of £350 million in funding for a large number of projects.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, established by the European Union in 1995, is aimed at Northern Ireland and the Border counties. It involves total EU expenditure of approximately £320 million over four years.  At least 20 per cent of this funding is available for the six Border counties.  The Commission recently indicated its support for a further 100 million ECU, approximately £80 million, for 1999.</P>
    <P>Under the joint INTERREG II programme, £130 million of EU funds have been allocated to Northern Ireland and Ireland on the basis of a 43 per cent allocation for the North and 57 per cent for the South.  Together with matching funding from both Governments and other sources, the <Col N="444" /> total investment available is £210 million.  The regions covered by the programme are Northern Ireland, with the exception of Belfast, and the six Border counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan, and Louth.  The programme is divided into six subprogrammes covering regional development, human resources development, infrastructure, agriculture/fisheries/forestry and environmental protection.</P>
    <P>Further funding for these programmes beyond 1999 will be pursued in the context of the next round of Structural Funding and EU Commission and Council support for underpinning the peace process.  In addition to the measures assisted by the EU, the Border region can avail of various national incentives for development.  The Minister believes the benefits flowing from the Good Friday Agreement and the many measures in place to aid the Border region will result in a new era of economic prosperity for that region.</P>
