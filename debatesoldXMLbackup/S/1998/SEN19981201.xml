      <P>I have notice from Senator Tom Hayes that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to grant the request made by the board of management of Cappawhite national school, County Tipperary, for an extension to the school and the details of the timeframe that will be involved.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the introduction of a quota system for a stated number of refugees on an annual basis as a similar quota system operates in other EU countries.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to approve the Terryglass sewerage scheme as part of the Lough Derg submission for EU funds in order to ensure that the badly needed scheme begins in 1999.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected Senators Hayes' and Mooney's matters and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator O'Meara may give notice on another day of the matter she wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>With regard to the proposed debate on the budget tomorrow, is it envisaged that there will be a longer discussion at another time?  The debate tomorrow will not provide Members with adequate time to make a sufficient response on mature reflection.

      <P>Item 19, motion 17, calls for the retention of duty free status at airports and ferries. Will the Leader obtain clarification from the Minster for Public Enterprise on the present status of duty free which is due to be abolished next July? There appears to be a conflict between the remarks made by President Santer in his recent address to the House &mdash; when he indicated there was little hope for duty free and that his sole role was in respect of the implementation of the decision taken in 1991 &mdash; and the stance taken by the Minister, who today appears to hold out the strong prospect that the decision will be overruled. The employment consequences of the abolition of duty free is a matter of considerable concern among various sectors.  Will the Leader clarify matters or ask the Minister to return to the House early in the new year to address the matter?</P>
      <P>Will the Leader indicate if the Government is considering new legislation regarding city and council development plans?  Yesterday Dublin Corporation proposed a five year development plan.  However, it was suggested that An Bord Pleanála could overrule a decision not to rezone 105 acres of agricultural land.  That is an anomaly which must be addressed because it is the prerogative of the councillors to determine their development plan for the given period without infringement from an external body which would not know all the details of the integrated aspects that go into the preparation of the plan.  I would appreciate if the Leader of the House could find out if legislation is being planned in that respect.</P>

      <P>When will the debate on homelessness, which the Leader promised, take place? Last weekend Dublin looked like Calcutta.  We need a meaningful debate with realistic proposals <Col N="623" /> on how to tackle this complex issue.  I hope the Leader will respond in a positive manner.  I have asked three times recently for a debate on disability. The Leader assured me that there would be a Bill before the House shortly.  Will he indicate when that will be?</P>

      <P>I invite the Leader to consult with the Minister for Education and Science and make a statement on the disparity in the dispersal of third level grants to VEC students throughout the State, which is very unfair.  Many hardpressed families are totally dependent on these grants to keep their children in third level education. It is shocking that the payments are arriving so late.  I would like to know who is responsible for this delay.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government the plans he has to celebrate 100 years of local government next year?  We are all aware of the contributions which local authorities and councillors have made to the furthering of this country over the past 100 years.  We talk about celebrating the millennium; it is important also that we mark in a fitting way the centenary of local government in 1999.  It would be nice if the Minister would outline his proposals to celebrate this special year in the history of local authorities.</P>

      <P>Senator Manning asked about proposed legislation.  The Tourist Traffic Bill will be before the House on Thursday; the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill will be before the House next week; the Scientific and Technological Education Investment Fund (Amendment) Bill will be in the House on 17 December and the Appropriations Bill will be in the House on 18 December.  Other Bills which will come before the House are the Comptroller and Auditor General Bill and the Bretton Woods (Amendment) Bill.  The mental health Bill is at an advanced stage and will be published before Christmas, as will the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill.  In reply to Senator O'Toole there will be statements tomorrow between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m on the Shannon River Council Bill.  I hope Senators will agree to a sos from 4 p.m. until 6 p.m. so that Members can join colleagues in the Dáil to make themselves aware of the proposals in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Costello's views regarding the issue of duty free.  I understand that Germany, France and the UK are of the view that duty free sales should be retained indefinitely.  I compliment <Col N="624" /> the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, who played a major part in formulating the thoughts of our European colleagues and pointing out the serious consequences of the abolition of duty free sales.  I hope the Minister for Finance will be successful in his deliberations in the coming days.  I will inform the Minister for the Environment and Local Government of Senator Costello's views regarding the city and county development plan. An Bord Pleanála is an independent authority.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge asked for a debate on homelessness and disability.  A Bill is in the pipeline and I will have further information for the Senator on the Order of Business tomorrow morning regarding this matter.  There is no problem making time available for a debate on homelessness.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education and Science will be available in the House today and tomorrow and Senator Coghlan can put the question of third level grants to him.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd called for another debate on the rail safety report.  There will be a debate on this matter early in the next session.  I will make whatever time is required available for this debate. The Senator can also avail of Private Members' time to debate the matter.  There was a lengthy and contentious debate on this matter last week.  Many Senators are extremely anxious to make progress in this matter as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Senator McDonagh asked me to pass on his request to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to see what plans the Minister has to celebrate 100 years of local government.  I assure the House that there will be a one day debate in this House to celebrate 100 years of local government.  I will ask the Minister what are his plans to celebrate this momentous occasion.</P>

    <Title>State Property Bill, 1998: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill proposes to amend the State Property Act, 1954, so as to remove reference to the National Stud Farm from the First Schedule to the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is of a technical nature and is designed to address current circumstances which were unforeseen when the National Stud Act, 1945, was enacted by the Oireachtas.  That statute <Col N="625" /> vested the National Stud Farm in the Minister for Agriculture and Food and, while it did not prohibit the sale of any part of the National Stud Farm, it did not contain any provisions providing for the sale of such land.</P>
    <P>Section 10 of the State Property Act, 1954, provides a general power to a Minister of State, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to sell, exchange, make a grant gratuitously or lease any State land for the time being vested in that Minister. However, the first subsection of section 10 of the Act provides that this power shall not be exercisable in respect of the State land mentioned in the First Schedule to the Act.  Among the properties listed in the First Schedule is the National Stud Farm.</P>
    <P>The issue of the power to sell part of the National Stud Farm has been brought to a head by the ongoing work on a motorway to bypass Kildare town, which many southern Senators will appreciate.  The motorway will go through the lands of the National Stud Farm.  The part of the National Stud Farm required for the motorway, amounting to 17 hectares, has been acquired by Kildare County Council by way of a compulsory purchase order.  A further 22 hectares of the National Stud Farm will be severed by the motorway from the main stud farm and will no longer be useful for the purposes of the National Stud.</P>
    <P>The State Property Act, 1954, also includes general provisions regarding the leasing of State property; thus when it is amended it will confer on the Minister for Agriculture and Food the power to lease the National Stud Farm or any part of it.  More restrictive provisions regarding leasing are contained in section 7 of the National Stud Act, 1945.  Since the Minister for Agriculture and Food will have a general power to sell or lease under section 10 of the State Property Act, I consider that the retention of section 7 of the National Stud Act, 1945, would be inappropriate and the Bill includes a provision repealing it.</P>
    <P>Anyone who travels to the south through Kildare and Monasterevan will be well aware of the need for the Kildare town bypass.  My main concern regarding it was to ensure as little disruption to the National Stud as possible.  It would have been ideal if the bypass could have also bypassed the National Stud but I have been assured by Kildare County Council that there was no other feasible route.  In the circumstances I am pleased with the measures which are being taken to ensure that the environment in which the National Stud operates will be maintained.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in the context of the amending legislation to reflect on the origin, history and character of the National Stud.  During the past 100 years, since its inception as a stud, Tully has been the nursery of so many world famous racehorses that its name is almost a household word, synonymous with all that is best in the thoroughbred industry.  Shortly before the start of this century a Colonel William Hall-Walker acquired possession of Tully for the purpose of training his <Col N="626" /> horses there.  However, it was soon realised that its resources were more suited to the breeding and rearing of thoroughbreds.  Some time during 1915 the colonel decided that, in view of the difficulties caused by World War I and increasing age, he would give up his interest in the stud.  He decided to offer the bloodstock at Tully as a gift to the nation to form a National Stud.  A condition of this gift of bloodstock to the nation was that the Government should purchase his interest in the Tully estate at valuation.  This interest consisted of the freehold to about 195 acres and a judicial tenancy in respect of the remaining 674 acres.</P>
    <P>In 1922 the Irish Government pressed its claim on the British Government for possession of Tully.  Negotiations continued between representatives of the two Governments for over 21 years, until the British Government finally agreed to hand over its interest in the National Stud Farm. In January 1944, the Irish Government decided to establish a National Stud at Tully and approved the preparation of legislation to form a company to take possession of Tully for the purpose of operating a National Stud.  The National Stud Act was passed by the Oireachtas in August 1945, and thus the Irish National Stud Company Limited was formed.</P>
    <P>Returning to the present, it would be remiss of me not to mention the valuable work done by another occupant of the National Stud Farm, namely, the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education.  Since its inception 25 years ago RACE has trained in the region of 450 students who have gone on to work with top Irish trainers and breeders.  Indeed, many have gone on to earn distinction in racing in England, France, USA, Germany, India and Japan.  Some have been highly successful in their chosen careers and a significant number of RACE graduates have gone on to the top of their profession.  Among these are Shane Kelly, Johnny Murtagh, Conor O'Dwyer, David Casey, Jimmy Quinn and Robert Winston to name but a few.  Recently, as the Leas-Chathaoirleach is aware, Robert Winston had two winners in Wincanton and I am delighted to see this young man from Finglas coming from the Dublin light horse brigade into this area. Even where trainees do not make it as jockeys the majority of them continue to work in the industry in a variety of responsible roles.</P>
    <P>The debate on this Bill presents the House with the opportunity of reviewing the state of the horseracing industry, particularly from the point of view of the breeder.  It will be realised from the account I have given that there is a great tradition at Tully which must be maintained and perpetuated. I and my colleagues in Government are committed to the future development of the horse racing industry and in particular to the continued existence of the National Stud.  This support manifests itself in a concrete fashion through the direct funding to the Irish Horseracing Authority, the operation of the National Stud by the State on behalf of the industry and the taxation system.  Next year we will contribute almost £15 <Col N="627" /> million to the Irish Horseracing Authority, a considerable increase over the current figure.  Since 1994 much capital has been injected into the National Stud Company to restore it to profitability and to ensure it continues to provide top quality stallions for the use of Irish breeders.</P>
    <P>It is universally accepted that the structure of thoroughbred breeding in Ireland is unique to this country.  On the one hand, there is a relatively small number of specialised stud farms with large numbers of mares and stallions and, on the other, there is a substantial number of farmer breeders.  Most of them have one or two mares producing foals for flat or national hunt racing. While the last few years have been satisfactory for these breeders they had come through a difficult period with very little financial reward from the marketplace.  Their involvement, however, is one of the strengths and stabilisers of the thoroughbred breeding sector.  They combine a passionate interest in horse breeding with a more traditional farm enterprise, such as cattle or tillage.</P>
    <P>These breeders must be responsive to the message coming from the marketplace in recent years. With no support or safety net system in place it is vital to concentrate scarce resources on the production of quality stock which will bring long-term benefits. Overall production is tending to increase and returns for 1997 show that thoroughbred foal registrations increased by 574 on 1996 and stood at 7,130.  In view of our reliance on exports, the tax treatment of stallion fee income has been one of the major factors in ensuring that Irish breeders have access to world class stallions.  The Revenue authorities have agreed on principles to be applied in respect of valuation of registered thoroughbred brood mares.  This matter had been a worry for many breeders and I am pleased that it has been resolved.  Breeders have been patient, often waiting year after year for a decent price for a yearling or foal.</P>
    <P>The last two years, however, were a time of cheer for them with significant increases in yearling prices.  Yearlings at Goff's commanded an average price of just over £33,000 last year as opposed to almost £21,000 in 1996.  Average yearling prices at Tattersalls remained at the 1996 average of almost £7,600.</P>
    <P>To the Irish, horse racing is not simply a sport, it is a way of life and it is not surprising that as such the horse features large in our history, place names and literature.  Its economic importance is significant and has been recognised in the support it obtains from Government.</P>
    <P>However, in recent years horse racing suffered badly from under-investment and competition from other leisure sports.  Nowadays people are not prepared to put up with second class facilities and services.  The sport of horse racing has a significant job on hand to attract newcomers, male and female, young and old, from all walks of life to this sport.  For my own part I have always loved <Col N="628" /> horse racing It is a very exciting sport and I am satisfied that the potential is there for significant growth provided the facilities are upgraded and the sport is marketed properly.  I have been most impressed with the work of the Irish Horseracing Authority since it was established in 1994.  In 1996 it produced its strategic plan for the development of the Irish thoroughbred racing industry up to the year 2001.  The plan deals comprehensively with all aspects of the industry, from how the industry is administered to how the difficulties in areas like racecourse development, betting, prize money and marketing should be tackled.  It is an ambitious plan which has already got a good kickstart with the opening of the new racecourse at Mallow in County Cork, the new stands in Clonmel and the investment planned for Limerick Junction racecourse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Mallow is not in my constituency.  Probably the most important element of the plan was the establishment of the capital development fund.  It will see the investment of a total of up to £42 million in Irish racecourses over a relatively short period.  This initiative represents a key turning point for the sector and I am confident it will ensure its ability to expand and develop in a planned manner.</P>
      <P>The National Stud has done much for the national breeding industry in training young people in all the proper requirements of getting mares in foal and learning when those mares will foal.  Young graduates of the National Stud have gone all over the world.  A large number of the students there are from foreign countries.</P>
      <P>This morning I was in Fettercairn dealing with what one might call the lesser sector of the horse industry, though one that is vital to Dublin city's culture and heritage.  It was said there that the Germans have often admitted that they have the horses and the people, but they do not have the love and natural feeling for the horse that Irish people have.  The National Stud, which has been developed by the Government, embodies all of that.  I am proud, indeed, any time I pass there, to read the words &ldquo;Groighe Náisiúnta na hÉireann&rdquo; over it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  I am particularly pleased that he is present because I know for a long time of his commitment to and interest in the horse industry and indeed his family's involvement in it.  This is a highly technical Bill and Fine Gael has no problem with it.  We have no complaints about the proposal and I have not heard anyone saying that it should not go through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have visited the National Stud on a number of occasions and have found it to be a fascinating and interesting place.  For an enterprise so dependent on space, it is unfortunate that the stud is losing approximately 100 acres between the severed <Col N="629" /> portion and the land for dual carriageway. We have no problem with the proposed measures.  The last thing one would do when dealing with any type of livestock, particularly, bloodstock, would be to haul them under a dual carriageway.</P>
    <P>The severed land is now State property and I assume it will fetch a fair price.  Is it a sensible proposition to commit the moneys realised from the sale to the stud?  I am sure there are many uses to which the stud could put the money, given its varied range of activities.  On the occasion I visited the stud, space was at an absolute premium. When mares from outside the country are brought to be covered by stallions at the stud, they have to stay for several weeks.  I have not spoken to the management there but it would be very serious if, in future, it was unable to purchase land adjacent to the stud that came up for sale.  There is no reason the proceeds of the sale should not be diverted back into the stud.</P>
    <P>The stud is run by an enlightened and intelligent group of people who know their industry backwards.  I fully subscribe to the Minister of State's view that it is a valuable national asset, particularly as a tourist attraction.  On any day that one visits the stud, there is a huge shortage of parking facilities as people from all over the world and, indeed, Ireland arrive.  In recent times more younger people and students have visited to see what is on offer.  There are also attractions, such as the Japanese Gardens, for people who do not have an interest in horses.</P>
    <P>I am not <i>au fait</i> with the manner in which the legislation will operate once it is passed in this House but I hope it will clearly state that if the severed land is sold, the funds realised from the sale will be reinvested in the stud and its various activities so that the plans for the stud can be implemented.  I am sure all Members agree. However, I am not sure whether the severed land is currently in use.  If not, will it be in use until a decision is made?  One should not allow 50 acres of good land to lie idle and I am sure the Minister of State agrees.</P>
    <P>However, I am aware of the importance of the bypass.  As one who travels that road regularly, I know that a bypass is as essential around Kildare town as it is around many other towns on the Dublin-Cork road.  One could be forgiven for thinking that Ireland is a world leader in the thoroughbred and horse racing industry.  Stallions and mares from all over the world were in the stud when I visited it last year.  A large number of people are employed in the stud which is an industry in its own right.  I am not involved in the horse racing industry to any great extent, but there is no better sport.  It might not be as good or as exciting as Tipperary playing and beating Cork or Limerick in a Munster final, as the Minister of State knows and has enjoyed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Many people enjoy the sport of racing and the standard we have become used to in Ireland.  We need only look at the cards at the various racecourses.  Last Sunday at Fairyhouse the card produced some of the finest racing we have ever seen.</P>
      <P>It has come to my notice that many people, particularly in rural constituencies, cannot travel to such racecourses as Fairyhouse or Leopards-town, particularly on a Sunday.  Betting offices are not open on Sunday.  This is an important point.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that they are not.  I know one in South Tipperary because the proprietor asked me in recent weeks if he could have his license extended to a Sunday.  I doubt if the Minister of State is correct in that. Ordinary punters like to have a flutter but are unable to attend race meetings on a Sunday.  We should consider allowing betting offices to be open on Sunday.</P>
      <P>The Minster of State touched on race tracks. While I realise there is huge investment in various tracks throughout the country, I must refer to my own county.  The Minister of State opened a stand and extra facilities in Clonmel; they are very welcome. However, closer to my home in west Tipperary there is great need for major investment in the old Limerick Junction which is now Tipperary racecourse.  There is widespread concern in that community for one of the oldest racecourses in the country.  Some of the best racing in the world took place in the old Limerick Junction.  There is need for funding there.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to introduce this necessary Bill.  I compliment him on his interest in Irish horse racing.  I meet him at many race meetings, especially at the races in his county of Tipperary.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this enabling legislation. This Bill seeks to expand and improve our national infrastructure.  Should we persist with the development in hand?  In such a development should we ensure other considerations associated <Col N="631" /> with natural surroundings or places of national interest are prioritised above the most efficient and effective mechanism of putting new infrastructure in place?</P>
      <P>The necessity for this Bill is to ensure the bypass in Kildare goes into operation.  As the Minister said, anyone heading to the south or south-west must pass through Kildare and it is a bottleneck. Work is currently under way on the motorway to bypass the town and the need for it is overwhelming. The traffic plays havoc for residents and business people, and if the town is to develop the sooner the bypass is completed, the better. However, the further development of the bypass will divide the National Stud, which contributes enormously to our growing equestrian industry through its breeding, training and educational facilities.  Kildare County Council has already acquired some of the land in the National Stud compound for the purpose of developing the motorway.  As a result, the stud has been carved up and the area of severed land is no longer suitable for its purposes.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food had no power to sell or lease the land under current legislation, hence the need for this Bill.  I am sure the Minister often passes through Kildare town.  It is on my way home but on Friday evenings I usually take a detour through Abbeyleix, which is much longer but quicker.</P>
      <P>During its last 100 years, since its inception as a stud, Tully has been the nursery of so many famous race horses that it is a household name, synonymous with all that is best in thoroughbreds.  Shortly before the beginning of this century, Colonel William Hall-Walker acquired possession of Tully to train his horses there.  It was soon realised that its resources were more suited to the breeding, training and rearing of thoroughbreds, and it was developed as such until now; it is one of the best equipped studs in the world.  The first few years of the century were spent acquiring a collection of foundation mares which were to become of almost priceless value.  During the first 16 years of its existence, Tully produced the winners of English classics and other great races.  It was laid out as a model stud with every convenience; many boxes of the latest design were erected, paddocks prepared and fenced, an indoor riding school built, and there were 12 completely enclosed bolt paddocks, each with its own adjoining box.  These are still an unique feature of Tully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1915 Colonel Hall-Walker decided that, due to the difficulties caused by the First World War and increasing age, he would give up his interest in the stud.  He offered the bloodstock as a gift to the nation, which then was the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to form a national stud.  A condition of this gift was that the Government of the United Kingdom should purchase Colonel Hall-Walker's interest in the Tully estate at valuation, which consisted of a freehold of 195 acres and a judicial tenancy in respect of the remaining 674 acres, which was subject to the <Col N="632" /> payment of a rent of £813.6s.8d. per annum to the landlord, Colonel Aylmer.</P>
    <P>In January 1944, the Irish Government decided to establish a national stud at Tully and approved the preparation of legislation to form a company to which possession of Tully could be handed over in due course.  The National Stud Act was passed by the Oireachtas in August 1945, and thus the Irish National Stud Company Limited was formed.  That company has done good work for the Irish race horse industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also mentioned the great work of the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education and a number of the great jockeys who were trained there and who are famous all over the world.  It is right to mention and commend the centre's great work.</P>
    <P>The Irish Racing Authority has also done great work.  I compliment the authority on its investments in the racing industry, particularly the racecourse in Mallow.  I frequent this course occasionally and it is a credit to the investment made by the authority.  Necessary comfort is now provided to patrons.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said he had the pleasure of opening a new stand in Clonmel recently.  I am delighted to note the interest in Limerick Junction, a race course I frequent, and an investment in it should be made.  I must not forget my native Limerick. A new race course is being built at Green Park and will open shortly.  I hope the Minister of State will have the pleasure of opening it.  He will be most welcome.  The Bill is necessary and I am sure it will find favour with the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, and the Bill.  I recognise the need for the legislation and I support it.  The genesis of the Bill and the origin of the National Stud were outlined by the Minister.  Senator Kiely also referred to the role of Colonel Hall-Walker in giving his bloodstock to the country.  I suspect the reason the land was excluded in the original State Property Act, 1954, and could not be sold was that it was a bequest to the nation.  It would have been inappropriate for the nation to dispose of the land.  However, in the current circumstances, it is entirely appropriate that this power should be vested in the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  Times have moved on and the need for the Bill arises from the construction of the Kildare bypass.</P>
      <P>Although there was a different Administration in 1915, it was remarkable that Colonel Hall-Walker gave his bloodstock to the nation.  I will not repeat the figures about acreage, but the tenancy of £813 a year was a good sum at the time considering what a single bullock made, although prices were inflated significantly during the First World War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody who travels through Kildare and people living in the area are aware of the need for a bypass.  I and my colleagues on Kildare County Council realised the need for a motorway. However, an aspect arising from the construction <Col N="633" /> of the bypass should be brought to the Minister's attention.  This relates to the huge resource of the National Stud and particularly the Japanese Gardens which attract approximately 100,000 visitors a year.  When the motorway is constructed, this resource will be, to a degree, severed from the town of Kildare.</P>
    <P>Kildare is a heritage town.  It has an old cathedral and it is also the seat of St. Brigid.  It is most important that a connection is made between the National Stud and the town to ensure that visitors attracted to the stud and the Japanese Gardens are also attracted to the town.  This should be borne in mind.  When the motorway was proposed, there was an active local campaign for the construction of two half interchanges at each end of the town rather than a single diamond interchange in the middle which would divert traffic away from the town and towards the stud.  I was in favour of the two half interchanges and an amount of professional opinion supported that view.  However, that is in the past.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is disappointing.  I attended the public inquiry which considered the need for the route of the bypass over several days.  It is unfortunate that the bypass cuts through the National Stud; two other routes were considered but it was eventually decided that the National Stud route was the correct one.  All the routes would have impinged on the stud to one degree or another. The matter was fully considered at the inquiry; at the stage I attended, the inquiry was considering the potential deleterious effects of the route on Pollardstown Fen, a natural resource of international quality.  The issue was fully teased out and debated but at the end of the process, when everything had been agreed, certain people surfaced with queries which they are bringing to Brussels.  I would have thought it appropriate to raise concerns and make recommendations at the inquiry. The Office of Public Works did that comprehensively and the matter was adjudicated on.  I do not think the issue should be reopened at this stage and I believe attempts to do so are mischievous.</P>
    <P>The matter of the Kildare draft development plan arises in regard to what should happen to the lands.  The Army barracks in Kildare is also being disposed of.  These are two important pieces of State land and some consideration must be given to their future.  It would certainly be my desire that the National Stud land, which is located between the main road and the motorway and therefore of considerable value, remain in public ownership.  It would be a resource for the wider community, if not to the stud itself.</P>
    <P>The value of the National Stud was referred to. It is a huge local and national resource and acts as a flagship for the entire breeding industry which is crucially important to the economy of the area and the country.  The stud has a long tradition of breeding and excellence which I hope will continue into the future.  I was pleased to read Minister Walsh's statement to the Dáil in which he outlined his and the Government's commitment to the stud's continued <Col N="634" /> existence as certain queries were raised in the past about its future.  The National Stud makes an extremely favourable impression on international visitors and is an enormously valuable resource.  The management of the stud &mdash; John Clarke, his predecessor, Michael Osborne and the board under the chairmanship of David Shubotham and Chryss O'Reilly &mdash; deserves enormous credit for turning an unprofitable enterprise into a profitable one.  I recall being quite critical of the stud in an earlier debate in this House.  In 1997, its surplus totalled £1.25 million and it had a trading profit in the region of £660,000.  The Japanese Gardens alone contribute between £150,000 to £160,000 to those profits.  The stud is a very significant local industry employing more than 100 people.</P>
    <P>I have heard it said that slow horses, fast women and fattening cattle were the road to ruin. I share two of those three things with the National Stud.  I do not know if they have any experience of the third, but I have not.  The stud has a tremendous record on breeding.  Desert Prince, which won the 2,000 Guineas, was purchased by the stud this year and proceeded to win the Prix de Moulin and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot.  I believe the horse cost the stud approximately £4 million but I am sure it is worth in the region of £8 million.  This is a high risk business which requires a great deal of capital.  Legislation was introduced to allow the stud access to increased capital but it is essential that any money which might arise from the disposal of lands be reinvested in the stud, either in the purchase of additional stock or assets.  I think we are also very fortunate that we have had a sire of the quality of Indian Ridge.  The Coffey family is to be commended for the fact that they stud the sire at the National Stud Farm.  There are plenty of examples like this.</P>
    <P>The National Stud Farm also has a duty to serve the smaller people within the industry, the vast majority of whom have only one or two mares or a stallion and a few mares.  Anyone with one or two mares should have access to studs at the National Stud Farm for a reasonable price.  It should serve a national function, recognise that fact and service the industry.</P>
    <P>I would like to point out that the horse racing industry is more than an industry and a sport, it is also an entertainment.  It has taken the industry a long time to realise that it is in the entertainment business and that if it is to attract people to racecourses in increasing numbers &mdash; there has been a decline in numbers in recent years &mdash; it has to provide the type of facilities and ambience which are attractive.  Thankfully, the Irish Horseracing Authority has done a very good job of this with the support of the Government.  The Minister of State mentioned the two racecourses in his province but we have also seen improvements at Naas, the Curragh and Punchestown, a magnificent facility.  These improvements are attracting more people back to racecourses.  There was £42 million available in the capital development fund <Col N="635" /> and it has had a beneficial effect.  I appeal to the Minister of State to do what he can to ensure that the small owner who sends his or her animal to Kilbeggan, Clonmel or Thurles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Unfortunately, that did not happen to me when I attended a race meeting in Thurles as a horse owner.  There is an onus on the industry to look after horse owners.</P>

      <P>There is a risk attendant to what the National Stud Farm is doing; it does it very well.  The Kildare people are also very proud of the Japanese Gardens.  We look forward to the opening of St. Fiachra's Gardens for the millennium. The National Stud Farm is a flagship of excellence. The county is very proud of it and we hope it will receive the support and the funding it requires to do its job in the future.</P>
      <P>I wish to endorse what has been said about the Racing Apprenticeship Centre of Education.  Mr. Stan Cosgrave founded RACE and he deserves a lot of credit.  I hope some of the land that is being released is made available to RACE to ensure it can carry on its activities and provide the sort of people that the Minister of State mentioned in his presentation.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister of State was present at a function where a portrait of Imperial Call was on display last Saturday.  The trainer was also in attendance.  Horse racing is very important to west Cork but that has nothing to do with this technical amendment.  I support this amendment because the construction of a road and the smooth movement of traffic depends on its acceptance.  The National Stud Farm is of great importance to the nation.  Can the Minister of State explain how the loss of almost 100 acres will affect the National Stud Farm?  It has to impede substantially on its ongoing activities.</P>
      <P>We all recognise the importance of that facet of life here.  It has been mentioned that horse breeding is an important part Irish life and of rural life.  The Minister of State already mentioned that it is part of the farming scene because it fits in well with cattle and tillage farming.  Can he tell me to what extent is the National Stud Farm effective?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not a contentious Bill and there is no point debating it for very long.  I welcome the fact <Col N="636" /> that the Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, initiated the development of the Mallow racecourse.  Despite difficulties at the time he ensured that it got off to a good start, is doing very well and has been very successful.</P>
    <P>The National Stud Farm provides ongoing training for young people and allows them to be involved in the rearing and breeding of horses.  It is very important that it is allowed to develop and that it continues to do so.</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned that horse racing is a way of life for many people.  We enjoy going to race meetings and making an occasional bet but it also provides healthy outdoor entertainment.  I welcome this Bill and it deserves all our support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Bill which proposes to amend the State Properties Act, 1954, by removing reference to the National Stud Farm in the First Schedule of the Act.  While of a technical nature, the passage of this Bill is essential to allow the Minister to sell part of the National Stud Farm for ongoing work on a motorway to bypass Kildare town.  The motorway will pass through the lands of the National Stud Farm.  Kildare County Council has acquired 16.58 hectares for the motorway by compulsory order.  A further 21.66 hectares will be severed by the motorway from the main stud farm and will no longer be of any use to the National Stud Farm.  The future use for these lands must receive very careful consideration from the Minister and the local community. Above all the Minister must have every option available to him, including the powers to sell if this is the most desirable option.</P>
      <P>The National Stud Farm is one of our great national institutions with a great history of success to its credit.  It has produced many famous race horses.  I regret any disruption to the farm but anyone who has travelled south will know how much we need a bypass at Kildare town.  I am satisfied that this is the most feasible route and that the environment of the National Stud Farm will be protected.</P>
      <P>During the past 100 years Tully has been a great nursery for many wonderful race horses.  It has served us all well in a period of great change worldwide.  The commitment by the Government to the horse racing and breeding industry is enormous. I compliment the Minister of State in that regard.  This year the Government increased funding to the Irish Horseracing Authority to £10 million, an increase of £1.5 million over the 1997 figures.  The authority has done great work since its establishment in 1994.  All involved must be complimented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed so positively to this debate on the National Stud, including its background and history. Everybody spoke well about the performance of the stud and the way it is run.  It is a national asset and makes a major contribution to the thoroughbred breeding industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="637" /> It is indicative of the dynamism of the National Stud that it is one of the first State bodies to devise a distinctive project to celebrate the millennium, St. Fiachra's Garden.  The tradition established by St. Fiachra goes back to the sixth century.  One of the great avenues of Paris is called after him and one of the auxiliary bishops of Dublin who taught me is called Fiachra.</P>
    <P>St. Fiachra's Garden will be a fascinating addition to the Japanese Gardens, the visitor's centre and the museum at the stud.  I will advise the stud manager, Mr. John Clarke, of the compliments paid to him and his staff in the House.</P>
    <P>Senator Tom Hayes recommended that the proceeds from the sale of the land be ploughed back into the stud.  I am sympathetic to this point of view but a basic principle of the Department of Finance, who acts as our mentor in this area, is that State receipts go to the Exchequer for reallocation rather than be earmarked for a specific purpose.  The State has been generous to this area in recent years and has invested substantial capital in the stud for the purpose of purchasing high class stallions.  As Senator Dardis said, Desert Prince was one of them.  The fruits of this investment are now evident with the return of the stud to profitability.  I never believed it was out of profitability given that it has been of such benefit to the State and to the smaller breeders around the country.  Indeed, I am confident that if the need arises in the future it will not be found wanting for funds.</P>
    <P>Senator Hayes also referred to the need to fund Limerick Junction racecourse.  I empathise with the Senator, but under the 1994 Act, responsibility for the development of the racecourse has been vested with the Irish Horseracing Authority. The Senator will know of my involvement with the authority and my regular patronage of the racecourse on days when the Whip will allow me to attend.  I have no doubt it will not lose out from the generous grants that are available to racecourses, although this rightly depends on the extent of local support.</P>
    <P>One of the great benefits of Limerick Junction racecourse is the fact that pensioners from Dublin can travel by train on their free travel passes and attend the racecourse for a charge of £2 and return to Dublin on the same day.  This represents a different and delightful day out for those who are not racegoers and they can have a little flutter.  I have enjoyed many a train trip with people from Dublin who had never been to a racecourse.  The great advantage of having a racecourse near a train station is that visitors can enjoy a few drinks.</P>
    <P>Senator Dardis and others asked why the National Stud was excluded from the State Property Act.  In considering the Bill it is probably one of the first questions that springs to mind.  It is not recorded why the power to sell the stud farms was not included in the original Act of 1945, nor why it was excluded from the State Property Act, 1954.  So far as I can ascertain, the most plausible reason for this omission is mundane.</P>
    <P>Colonel Hall-Walker's gift to the nation was the bloodstock not the land.  A condition of his <Col N="638" /> gift was that the Crown purchase his interest in the Tully stud at valuation.  However, the Curragh did not enjoy the freehold of the entire farm at Tully.  Some 670 acres were held on and expired through judicial tenancy from Colonel Richard Michael Aylmer.  When the National Stud Act was enacted in 1945, Colonel Aylmer was still the landlord of the majority of the stud farm.  The colonel continued to enjoy that position until 1958 when the State bought out his interest in the property.  When the State Property Act was enacted in 1954, the Minister for Agriculture was in no position to sell the National Stud Farm lands because he did not enjoy the freehold.  Now that the Minister for Agriculture and Food enjoys the freehold I am sure Senators will agree there is no reason the farm should continue to be excluded from the protection and provision of the State Property Act.</P>
    <P>Senator Rory Kiely referred to the new racecourse in County Limerick.  Limerick race course was an excellent facility but, unfortunately, due to flooding and non-drainability it was not practical, especially on a wet Christmas when many three day events were destroyed.  However, the south-west and south-east is national hunt country where people enjoy seeing horses go over fences, run and gallop at the same time and undertake two and three mile journeys.  It is the sport of the ordinary working men.  While flat racing is more for the enjoyment of the few that own so many, in the national hunt so many own a few.  This is the way forward and I hope more syndicates will be formed to enjoy horses.  I hope Members of the House will become involved at this level.</P>

      <P>Some of us are already involved in syndicates.  Perhaps others may do so to ensure that those who breed horses can enjoy the support not only of your words but your money.</P>
      <P>Senator Dardis referred to the land involved serving the interests of Kildare town.  This is primarily a matter for the local authority.  I have no doubt that the best interests of the town and its surrounds will be catered for in the final decision. One of the better suggestions was that, given the escalation in house prices, the land should be used to address housing needs, especially for young people living in Dublin.  I believe in co-operative housing to address difficulties in this area and I see no reason a co-operative venture could not be started to enable people live in the town.  It is for the local authority to decide what it wishes to do with the lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Callanan referred to the loss of almost 100 acres by the National Stud.  I am advised on good authority that this is not a problem.  While the original farm &mdash; 800 acres &mdash; does not amount to nearly as much as the Senator's, Maddenstown Farm comprises a further 120 acres.  While this is not big farming in the Senator's terminology, it represents a huge farm to those of us who are small holders.  Years ago one of the ushers was <Col N="639" /> asked by Neil Blaney to dig his garden.  He looked at it and said &ldquo;It is not a garden he has, it is a farm&rdquo;.  Everything is relative.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Senators for their contributions to the debate.  I welcome their encouragement for the work being done by the National Stud.  This will continue, not just in horse breeding but in the training of young managers for stud farms throughout the world.  That is why we are the top nation in stud farm ownership with the biggest stud farms.  Government taxation has allowed for that.  As Senator Dardis said, it is a risk industry. A horse was bought a number of years ago for $35 million and found to be totally infertile.  That is why some of the stud fees are tax free.</P>
    <P>I am particularly proud of RACE and the young lads in Dublin.  This morning I was in Fettercairn and Tallaght and found the kids to be most interested.  They are far better off with horses.  They will not prove themselves academically but they have a genuine love for horses.  We can get through to those kids through horses.  RACE is providing a training system for them, it will be their university. The most successful jockeys are not academics, they are young people who apply themselves to the love of horses, people like Mick Kinnane or Johnny Murtagh, neither of whom had any formal education.  Young Winston was riding horses in Finglas five years ago and is now riding winners in England, making good money and a name for himself. This Bill is about developing the horse industry and the love which we have for horses.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to respond to a concern expressed on Committee Stage that the educational needs of refugees and similar groups should be acknowledged in the Bill.  I am advised by the Attorney General's office that this is the most appropriate formulation. As a result of this amendment, amendment No. 15 is not necessary.  We have used the phrase &ldquo;having regard to the choices of their parents;&rdquo;. That covers all the groups referred to.</P>

      <P>As I said on Committee Stage, people from other cultures are settling in this country and we have a responsibility to cater for their needs.  Other countries do it, why not Ireland?  In London there are various schools to cater for these people.  The Bill had no provision for this area until now.  It is important that responsibility for this area should fall on the State rather than on schools which would not have the resources to deal with it.  I accept that there are some <i>ad hoc</i> cases but stronger provision must be made and the situation must be structured in light of current events.  In many cases there is a major <Col N="641" /> linguistic and cultural barrier which can lead to educational problems.  I asked the Minister to outline the plans for a legislative framework to deal with the needs of minority groups and he has responded in a satisfactory manner.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 5 and 6, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) The Minister may direct each local authority to establish an education welfare committee with such number of education welfare officers as may be prescribed, to co-ordinate the statutory and other agencies concerned with the welfare of children in their functional area.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="642" /> I hope the Minister will take on board this amendment.  Local authorities have an educational responsibility in a number of areas.  They are responsible for the vocational education committees, school attendance in some areas and school meals.  Perhaps the Minister might use his influence with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to ensure the forthcoming legislation on local government specifies areas where local authorities could be more proactive than heretofore.  Responsibility for the welfare of children should be devolved to local authorities or taken from them and given to the Department of Education and Science.  In the absence of structures, the Minister should take advantage of what is already in place and try to develop the remit of local authorities in this area.  I am concentrating on educational welfare matters because, by and large, local authorities deal with welfare aspects such as school meals, vocational education committees and school attendance.  I know the Minister will deal with some of these matters in the school attendance Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of statutory and voluntary agencies could be brought together under the remit of the local authorities.  This is already taking place in Dublin where there are five integrated plans.  An essential part of these plans is the educational aspect.  Where there are black spots in city or rural areas, the Minister should consider how local authorities could develop the housing, maintenance and business needs of these areas.  They could also deliver an education service where education facilities might be required.  The local authority should be in a position to provide a local educational structure.  While my amendment specifically refers to educational welfare, I consider it in terms of what could be done if an initiative was forthcoming from the Ministers for Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">

      <P>I support the amendment.  The local authority has a role to play because we all aspire to the integration of travellers into the community.  In the case of Galway VEC, Galway County Council provided a building, FÁS developed it and the VEC took over the running of it as a training centre.  The three-tier partnership proved extremely successful in getting the local authority involved with the VEC, FÁS and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is all about partnership and I understand where Senator Costello is coming from.  It would be helpful if the Minister would accept the amendment because local authorities have a part to play.  This would be advantageous to everyone involved in partnership programmes in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to direct local authorities to establish committees. That is a matter for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  I may consult with him about the issues raised by Senators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The school attendance Bill will cover the area of welfare officers and so on.  It will also deal with the establishment of an education welfare board. This will be a national body and will have welfare officers throughout the country.</P>
    <P>In line with Senator McDonagh's remarks, I will promote partnership between local authorities and education bodies.  This is taking place at present in area partnerships whereby local authorities, vocational education committees and other interest groups work together for the regeneration of areas in respect of employment initiatives and so on.  Invariably, education ranks centre stage in such partnerships and many of these partnerships have education sub-committees.  This type of co-ordination is welcome, focused and area-based.  It often relates to areas that are designated as economically disadvantaged and having high unemployment figures.  I am impressed with the degree of co-ordination taking place between all the statutory and voluntary agencies in area-partnership areas.</P>
    <P>Section 7(1)(c) provides for the co-ordination of education and support services and section 7(4)(a)(ii) refers to services provided by other State agencies and more generally in the State. Provisions are also included in section 33(j).  I do not propose to establish another layer of planning co-ordination.  The Minister is being given powers to activate co-ordination.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister's views on this matter.  I can see where both Senators are coming from.  I am aware that local authorities are involved in education matters. This should come under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. All of us, including the Departments of Education and Science and the Environment and Local Government, are guilty of a lack of co-ordination in this regard.</P>
      <P>While I support the Minister on this, I empathise with the Senators.  The thrust of what they are saying is good and worthwhile.  However, I hope it will come from the Department of the Environment and Local Government and, as the Minister said, under the partnerships.  Once we can approach it from the right direction it will not matter.  The Department has too large a role in that area and I would prefer to see it coming from the other end. I listened to the Minister but I felt that was not the appropriate way to go with that concept.</P>

      <P>I thought the Minister might take this amendment on board, given that section 9(m) states that schools shall &ldquo;establish and maintain an admissions policy which provides for maximum accessibility to the school&rdquo;.  How can a school provide for maximum accessibility if it has an entrance examination?  Such an examination is a hurdle which must be overcome and has tended in the past, according to well recorded evidence, to be discriminatory.  Certain schools insist on this admissions policy and will continue to do so.  The Minister cannot guarantee maximum accessibility if he is going to allow admissions to be based on entrance examinations.  He should take this amendment on board, which would indicate he is allowing every school to operate on a non-discriminatory basis where every student, irrespective of aptitude, has access to an education in the school of their choice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed this on Committee Stage when I made the point that we do not propose for the legislation to set out in detail the admission policies of schools.  The Bill is an enabling framework within which the existing diversity of education provision in this country can operate.  Schools have different admission policies and entrance methods.  It would not be possible, in legislation of this kind, to state specific admission policies for all the different kinds of schools which exist.  I do not agree with the principle of an entrance examination but the vast majority of schools do not have examinations which determine the entrance of students to the school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only issue which tends to act as an obstacle to access to education in certain areas is the population of a given area and the availability of places in a given school in such an area.  Existing second level schools in certain areas of Dublin, <Col N="645" /> Cork and Galway, where the population is booming, are finding it difficult to provide places and there is a huge demand for certain schools.  These schools do not have entrance examinations.</P>
    <P>Enrolments in some second level schools in rural Ireland have been declining steadily, so there are no difficulties there in terms of gaining access.  The only difficulty I perceive is in some areas of urban Ireland where the population is on the increase.</P>
    <P>Entrance examinations are a hobby horse. Some private, fee paying schools, which are recognised schools, have entrance examinations, but not everyone wants to go to those schools either.  These examinations were held long before I came along.  One must take cognisance of what is in the system because we cannot change it overnight. We are endeavouring to create a legislative framework which allows the situation to grow and evolve over time, and which takes due cognisance of the rights of the various patrons and partners in education.</P>
    <P>A fundamental point about the Irish education system is that is it essentially still State aided rather than State controlled.  We do not own all the schools in Ireland and we never did, which has an important implication for legislation.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to state in the Bill that the functions of the inspector shall include ensuring &ldquo;that the needs of people with disabilities involved in or seeking access to the education system are addressed&rdquo; and &ldquo;that the needs of the educationally disadvantaged are addressed&rdquo;.  How will &ldquo;inspector&rdquo; be defined?  Is the Minister happy he will have available to him the type of people who can define what is needed to ensure the needs of people with disabilities are properly catered for by the right type of inspector?  In other words, Departments other than the Department of Education and Science might have a better structure set up for this, such as the Department of Health and Children.  The sad part of this is that we are admitting we are not able to say we are solidly on top of the problems of those with disabilities.  Is the Minister happy that the right type of people will be appointed, or that the right type of people exist within the teaching system?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Under this legislation, there is strong recognition that we will appoint inspectors who have expertise in relation to children with special needs.  However, there will have to be closer co-ordination with the health services in terms of assessments and so on.  I am satisfied that we can appoint the right people, which is what we have to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify his comment that in principle he is not in favour of entrance examinations?  We are either discriminatory or not.  He either accepts that entrance examinations are good or bad: they are not neutral. They exist to specifically select students and in the past the practice has been that selection has not been for the best reasons but rather to select people a school wants.  A school might have a certain cache, reputation and ethos which is not the characteristic ethos we have been talking about in terms of the good things which make it up.  I do not understand how, on the one hand, the Minister says in principle he is not in favour of entrance examinations while, on the other, he says that introduction of something as discriminatory as entrance examinations can be left to the patron or the board of management.</P>
      <P>Entrance examinations exist to discriminate against a particular type of student.  How can such a level of discretion be left to a patron if the entrance examinations are not good in themselves? What purpose do entrance examinations serve?  I know a sprinkling of schools throughout Dublin city which insist on entrance examinations, not for the purpose of to see if pupils can pass an aptitude or to put them in the most appropriate classes but to determine who does and does not get a place in the school.  This is the only reason entrance examinations exist.  If the Minister is satisfied that the only function of entrance examinations is purely to allocate pupils to classes on an aptitude basis, then there is no problem.  However, aptitude testing can take place subsequent to enrolment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Aptitude tests or tests which endeavour to find out the various levels of students entering a school can take place either before or after enrolment.  A case can be made to have them before enrolment so that assessments are available to teachers.</P>
      <P>We are dealing with something which is part and parcel of the education system.  Many years ago the Department issued a circular discouraging entrance examinations which had a significant impact.  We are now dealing with legislation and we must decide whether to legally oblige every school not to have entrance examinations.  We cannot legally do this; if we could we would have to dismantle certain systems and ways of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could take the example of fee paying schools which are recognised by the Department. For four years the previous Government included provisions in this regard in its Programme for Government but did not even attempt to implement it.  I am not making a political point in this regard &mdash; perhaps that Government saw existing realities.  However, no attempt was made to discontinue the practice of fee paying schools. The direct cost to the Exchequer if we were to do this would be £5 million.  It could also be argued <Col N="647" /> that doing so would be killing a certain tradition which people pursue for whatever reason.  The difference between Ireland and other countries is that we have a diversity in almost every town, with different types of second level schools, thereby providing for students across the board. Personally I do not see the value or need for fee paying schools.  However, they exist and people pay fees to attend them.  This is where the majority of entrance examinations exist.</P>
    <P>According to most admission policies which we have examined, entrance to a school depends on whether one's parents were past pupils, whether one's brothers or sisters are attending the school and whether one is living in the parish or attended the primary school which is a feeder school to the secondary school.  These tend to be the main criteria which determine entrance to second level schools.  However, despite these criteria, there can still be difficulties in areas of high urban growth.</P>
    <P>We took a decision in terms of the legislation not to be too prescriptive in terms of including in the Bill the detailed admission policies of schools, as somebody else could ask why, being the son or daughter of a past pupil, gives precedence over somebody who is living in the parish where the school is located.</P>

      <P>It is, but should we include a provision in the Bill saying it should not happen? Somebody could equally say that inclusion of such a provision is discrimination while somebody else could say they consider a particular provision in a school's admission policy to be discriminatory.  We took the wise view that we cannot be prescriptive in legislating for every detail in terms of schools' admission policies.  However, we do work with schools and change policy, practices, etc., outside the legislative process on an ongoing basis.  We also introduce new curricular programmes which have an impact on participation, etc.  I do not think it is a huge issue on the ground.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(3) The functions of the Chief Inspector shall include&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) to manage and co-ordinate the activities of Inspectors so as to maximise output,</P>
      <P>(b) to assist and support Inspectors in the discharge of their functions,</P>

    <P>(f) to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities involved in or seeking access to the education system are addressed, and</P>
    <P>(g) to ensure that the needs of the educationally disadvantaged are addressed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not intend rehearsing everything that was said in regards to this amendment on Committee Stage.  I am trying to give the chief inspector some overriding and leadership function in terms of the rest of the inspectorate.  While here and there there are references to the chief inspector in relation to examinations, there is no coherent role for him or her.  I know the Minister will say this is what is intended, that the inspectorate will work collectively and that all inspectors, including the chief inspector, are equal.  I do not know why he is called the chief inspector if we are to strictly operate on the basis of collectivity &mdash; it is <i>primis inter pares.</i>  There should be some description of the leadership role of the chief inspector and I am suggesting it be in terms of his or her function to manage and co-ordinate the activities of inspectors so as to maximise output, assist and support the inspectorate and take direction and give advice to the Minister.  A chief inspector should have a level of responsibility given to them without separating him or her from the other inspectors who make up the inspectorate in the Department.  All inspectors would have access to the Minister as he requires.  It is important that legislation indicates who is responsible if a person is given responsibility and a salary which is commensurate with it and I think that should be indicated in this Bill.</P>

Section (e) says &ldquo;to prepare and present to the Minister by November 1st each year, an annual report on the Inspectorate and the Minister shall, with or without amendment, lay the Annual Report of the Chief Inspector before both Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;. The very constructive point contained in the amendment is that if we have a chief inspector, responsibility should lie with him.  Senator Costello has made a very strong point that if he is paid enough, he could be responsible to the Minister and he would also ensure the needs of people with disabilities who are seeking access to the education system are addressed.  We have an opportunity here to protect these people but the sad part is that there is a general impression in the Bill that we are talking about the education system and people who are disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> I acknowledge there is strong recognition of the 20 per cent of people who are left behind; I know that better than anyone else.  However, I am worried about giving responsibility to a chief inspector, a matter I debated with the Minister on Committee Stage.  Is there any chance of promoting the idea of having one chief inspector responsible for the disabled?  If a chief inspector was responsible for this area it would be an advantage for the disabled rather than those who are educationally disadvantaged. Those who are educationally disadvantaged make up one group and, for many groups in the primary area, opportunities are not opening up but if we had one chief inspector who reported to the Minister on this matter it would consolidate this area.  There is an opportunity here that can be availed of.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept the broad amendment as I said on Committee Stage. The inspectorate and chief inspectorate are integral parts of the overall team in the Department of Education and Science.  It would be wrong to create a situation where one separates the chief inspector from the remainder of the Department, which would be the inevitable result of adopting this amendment.  That would not be a good development.</P>
      <P>The chief inspector enjoys the rank of assistant secretary in the Department, although the Public Service Management Act will define the respective roles and responsibilities of staff within the Department.  The chief inspector and inspectors are doing a good job, particularly in the school evaluation project as well as with other developments, such as the psychological service; the chief inspector has developed an initiative on the latter project with me.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator Cregan's point, there is a special education section in the Department.  I strengthened that recently when I added additional staff and we are amalgamating it into one special unit responsible for children with special needs throughout the system.  We have inspectors who have particular expertise, interest and commitment to children with special needs who co-ordinate the various activities for the Department and the Minister.  That is the position at the moment.</P>

      <P>I do not see what point the Minister is making here.  We are not suggesting the separation of the chief inspector from the rest of the inspectorate.  The chief inspector is, by virtue of being chief inspector, in a position of responsibility which carries authority and duties.  The rest of the inspectorate also have duties as outlined in the legislation.  Giving a leadership and co-ordinating role to the chief inspector is surely inherent in the job description.  To say that he or she will provide an annual report to the Minister and deal with the needs of people with disabilities and educational disadvantage only reflects what we are saying about other areas.  That is also the responsibility of the school, the board of management and the Minister.  Why should we not make the chief inspector and the inspectorate responsible in the same fashion?  I think it is not right to refer to the chief inspector as having a responsibility in the examinations area and then not to refer to his or her responsibilities in a much more important area of leadership of the inspectorate. I do not see how the Minister is saying that my amendment is trying to drive a wedge between the chief inspector and the rest of the inspectorate. I am trying to glue them together and to ensure that the chief inspector has his or her leadership role determined in the context of the collectivity of the responsibilities of the inspectorate.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 18:</P>
      <P>In page 16, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(iv) evaluate the policies and strategies for the correction of educational disadvantage;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes the inspectorate be involved in evaluating &ldquo;the policies and strategies for the correction of educational disadvantage&rdquo;. Educational disadvantage has not received adequate recognition or treatment in this legislation. The Minister so far has rejected all my amendments in this area on the basis that there is a miscellaneous section dealing with the establishment of an educational disadvantage committee. We all know what can happen when educational disadvantage committees or any other committees are established.  They will report but there is no guarantee recommendations in the report will be implemented.  There is nothing in the section that pressurises or makes it compulsory or mandatory for the Minister to implement the report.  I would prefer if there was a provision in the Bill which would place an onus on the school, the Minister, the inspectorate and the board of management to provide policies and strategies for the correction of educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>Now that the Leader of the House has kindly agreed to a debate on literacy and educational disadvantage next Thursday, we will discover just how serious it is and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who recently produced a report on the Green Paper on adult education, will also see how extensive is our problem of educational disadvantage.  As his report states, if we continue as we are, it will be 2015 before we reach the average of our OECD counterparts, not to mention our European Union counterparts, in terms of educational levels throughout the community.</P>
      <P>We are severely handicapped in the upper secondary levels; we are well down the scale.  We need interventionist policies and strategies.  I am disappointed the Minister has not agreed to take this on board.  I do not accept that a miscellaneous subheading establishing a committee to deal with educational disadvantage is the answer to our problem.  Responsibilities must be placed on each person and unit involved in the delivery of education to deal with and address areas where there is educational disadvantage.</P>
      <P>We all know it exists in pockets and blackspots in urban areas, and to some extent in rural areas. In particular in large urban areas we need special measures to address this problem.  Our work force requires it.  We will soon find we have a labour shortage and we need people with skills and training. We particularly need to have measures, policies, strategies and structures as a safety net for youngsters falling out of the education system so we can bring them back on board and deal with them.  That is the reason I am suggesting we put an onus on the units of the education system to provide those policies and strategies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to restate the point Senator Costello made strongly about the special needs of particular students.  There are blackspots and, given the current structure and the Bill, there is obviously a recognition of the 20 per cent of students who do not make it through the primary sector.  Section 13 covers the inspectorate and I am worried about why we are not assessing and stressing the effectiveness of the inspectorate, particularly its effectiveness in particular areas of primary education.  Senator Costello made this point strongly.  There is no reason we cannot emphasise that more strongly in this section.</P>
      <P>On the proposed amendment to insert &ldquo;evaluate the policies and strategies for the correction of educational disadvantage&rdquo;, &ldquo;educational disadvantage&rdquo; is very broad.  I asked the Minister, Deputy Martin, earlier why he is not defining a particular inspectorate for a particular area.  He replied that he is in the process of establishing a section for the disadvantaged in the primary sector. If that is being done, why is it not stated in the Bill that there must be recognition for blackspots?</P>
      <P>While on the subject of blackspots I wish to mention the disabled.  We are insulting the disabled by saying they should be in the education sector at all.  We do not consider them as people who deserve defined education but they have a constitutional right to it.  The Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that we had not recognised that until then.  I know the Minister is now committed to saying that we are recognising it but we are not recognising it strongly enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We could amend this section by giving a chief inspector responsibility for the disadvantaged <Col N="653" /> handicapped people as opposed to educationally disadvantaged people.  Reference is made to &ldquo;individual students who have a disability or other special education needs&rdquo;.  The definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; does not cover a profoundly handicapped person who has a constitutional right to education and is not getting it.  I wish to make this point very strongly.</P>
    <P>We could protect them by giving a chief inspector the sole responsibility for the handicapped in the primary sector and ensure he or she reports back to the Minister.  The Minister can then come before the Houses of the Oireachtas with the report stating what is or is not happening and what he is or is not happy about.  I would appreciate if we gave a particular inspector responsibility for this deprived education sector for the disabled. Should the chief inspectorate not have responsibility for this area?  He or she does not need to have sole responsibility.  Some people may not think this is a massive problem but it has been a serious matter for the disabled because they received no education.  We should give the chief inspectorate responsibility for these people because they are entitled to receive their constitutional rights.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 18 concerns the evaluation of policies and strategies for the correction of educational disadvantage.  On Committee Stage we spoke at length about the new committee which would identify and correct this problem.  It would not make sense to insert an amendment at this point because section 32 goes into detail on the matter; it states that one of the committee's roles will be to assess the implementation and effectiveness of any programmes of education which have been devised in respect of individual students who have a disability or other special education needs.  That covers it and I have no doubt educational disadvantage will be tackled.  The Minister has made a strong commitment to dealing with this area in conjunction with special education needs in section 13(3).  I am sure he empathises with the points raised.  I know where Senator Cregan's heart lies on this matter, and we must ensure special educational needs are met.  I am happy the Minister will do so.  The inspectorate will be integrated and will be able to assess psychological and other needs.</P>

      <P>I am not a rubber stamp for anyone, as Senator Costello knows.  Local schools inspectors have a number of functions &mdash; we could not have one or a number of local inspectors specifically mandated to deal with educational disadvantage, important though it may <Col N="654" /> be.  Section 13(2), which deals with the inspectorate, puts an obligation on the Minister when appointing inspectors to include persons who hold qualifications as psychologists or who have other expertise, such as in the education of students with special educational needs.  That is new and, as far as I know, it is the first time a legal obligation has been put on the Minister to include people with such expertise when appointing inspectors.</P>
      <P>As to the amendment, anyone looking at the Bill or the report of these debates would know the Government is committed to tackling educational disadvantage.  For the first time in the history of the State there is specific legislative provision, in section 32, for a committee on educational disadvantage. Such a provision was absent from the Bill published in 1997 by the Senator's Administration. I am confident the committee would play an important role in advising on policy to tackle this issue, particularly because the Minister has specifically provided that up to half the members of the committee will be appointed from nominees of voluntary or other bodies working in the area.  Also, under section 12, the Minister may provide additional money to recognised schools having regard to the level of educational disadvantage of their students.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister, Deputy Martin has taken a number of initiatives to address educational disadvantage, including the eight to 15 year old initiative and the abolition of examination fees for medical card holders.  Other measures he has initiated which will be particularly relevant to those facing educational disadvantage include his proposed education and welfare legislation, which will tackle school attendance not through sanctions but through positive intervention.  Because the Minister is convinced of the need to focus on educational disadvantage, he has made provision in section 32 for a committee on the subject.</P>
      <P>I therefore do not think it necessary to accept this amendment because the evaluation process Senator Costello has in mind will be a matter for the committee &mdash; a mechanism will be put in place to monitor the Government's performance in this area and it will issue regular reports.  I think that is the best way to do it.  One can give the inspectorate a role in this regard but the best way to keep the Government on track and to put in place a constant monitoring mechanism is the measure proposed in section 32.  Time will prove it the most effective approach.</P>

      <P>In page 18, line 31, to delete &ldquo;, except in the case of a school established or maintained by vocational education committee,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="655" /> I would like the Minister's views on including the vocational education sector because the Bill does not apply to that sector and he is reviewing the 1930 Act to make provision for it on a further extended statutory basis.  Amendment No. 20 would require regulations to make provision for parents and teachers on all vocational education committees.  It has been requested by the TUI that each VEC should have full partnership on the board of management and advisory committees, and the parents and teaching staff should be represented.  Less than 50 per cent of vocational education committees have such representation, and it makes a mockery of an education system if we propose a partnership of all the interests involved and all those concerned, particularly the parents and teaching staff, without giving them a forum in which their views can be expressed.  The danger is that the 1930 Act is unlikely to be reviewed until before the local elections next year, so it would be appropriate for the Minister to indicate in this legislation how he wants the vocational education committees to be composed, and that should include parental and staff representation.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 are similar and the Minister's amendment, No. 21, has taken on board most of what is in my amendment &mdash; directions are included as to what is an appropriate gender balance, and I am happy with that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">

      <P>I second amendment No. 19. It is incumbent on the Minister to make a statement on the future legislation with regard to vocational education committees because I foresee that problems will arise.  To date, the Minister said that the legislation relating to vocational education committees will not be in place before the next local elections and current members will be re-elected <i>en bloc</i> as heretofore.  A number of months later, certain members of the vocational education committees will be asked to resign and they will be replaced by other people.  This will cause much disharmony and tension.</P>
      <P>Everybody recognises the enormous contribution the VEC sector has made to education since 1930.  When the new VEC structure is in place, people who are elected at next year's local elections and appointed to vocational education committees should retain their positions.  I support the move to appoint parents and teachers to vocational education committees.  I hope they will be brought on committees in addition to the people appointed next June if the new legislation is not in place by then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, who has responsibility for adult education, is in the House.  It is important that people involved in the adult education sector and on adult education boards have a place at the table in relation to vocational education committees.  I am sure this area will be debated at a later date.  I commend the Minister of State on his Green Paper.  I attended the Aontas discussion on it.  It is incumbent <Col N="656" /> on the Minister of State who has direct responsibility for this area to ensure at Cabinet level that adult education providers and organisers and those involved in adult education boards have a place at the table at VEC level.  They have been left out up to now and the Minister of State has a responsibility to ensure that they are included in the future.</P>
    <P>This is most important because this is the fastest growing sector in education.  It is getting larger every day and the Minister of State's remit is also growing.  I commend him on his work to date and he would do a great service to the system if he ensured that adult education was represented on vocational education committees.  I ask him to make a clear statement on this matter because many people involved in vocational education committees, the IVEA and adult education boards want to know where the vocational education committees stand with regard to this Bill and what type of vocational education committees will be established next June.  A statement would clear up many of the current suggestions and rumours.</P>
    <P>I second the amendments tabled by Senator Costello and I look forward to the Minister of State's clarification on this important issue.  I appeal to him to ensure that adult education is represented on VEC boards when they are established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from the vocational sector and I have great empathy with the points made by Senator McDonagh in relation to the role of vocational education committees.  It is important that the Minister of State makes a statement on this matter because adult education representatives should be part of the new committees. However, that is a matter for another day.  It is not part of this debate.  I hope the legislation to amend the 1930 Act in relation to the vocational sector will come on stream before June, but the issues raised by the Senators are a matter for that debate.  The amendments are a little premature.</P>
      <P>I have great difficulty with amendments such as amendment No. 22 which states that in making appointments to the board, the patron shall ensure a gender balance of at least 40 per cent of each gender.  It is a great concept but I am aware from interview boards that one must chase around trying to find somebody to give the board a gender balance.  It is becoming a nightmare.</P>

Boards should have good people who reflect the terms of reference of the board in an intelligent and proper manner.  There should not be a fixation on the idea that women must be part of boards.  Women who are good will come through the system.  That is our nature.  If such women are part of the vocational education committees, they will come through onto the boards.  There are fine women but I do not support the idea that they should be chased to become part of boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator McDonagh for his kind remarks.  The difficulty which has been brought to my attention is that the providers of adult education are not represented on adult education boards, which are subcommittees of vocational education committees and deal specifically with adult education.  In particular, it has been represented to me that they do not usually include somebody who specifically represents literacy interests.  I wrote to all the vocational education committees and directed them to correct that deficiency.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general shape of the final legislation regarding vocational education committees, I do not know what the position will be before and after the local elections next June.  Regarding the Green Paper, the issue of whether the vocational education committees will still be in control of the adult education system at local level has been left open to debate.  The difficulty is that there are a large number of providers in the adult education area.  The vocational education committees are no longer the only providers; they are not even the main provider now.  We must consider whether this area should be under the aegis of a particular player in the field who is no longer the main player. However, that is a matter for discussion.  We welcome observations from the Opposition parties on the Green Paper.</P>
      <P>In relation to amendment No. 19, as the House is aware VEC schools already have their own distinctive representative management structures. Accordingly, it would not be appropriate to force them to also take on the representative management structures envisaged in the Bill.  It is for this reason also that I do not intend to accept amendment No. 22.  Vocational education committees are not covered by the Bill and the Senators are aware that the Minister intends to publish legislation to amend the VEC Acts in 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the spirit of amendment No. 22.  As Senator Costello said, the substance of it has been taken on board by the Minister in amendment No. 21.  I wish to bring to the attention of the House that it is proposed to amend Government amendment No. 21 by the addition of the following words: &ldquo;and the Minister, before giving any such directions, shall consult with patrons, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers&rdquo;.  This <Col N="658" /> means that before the Minister gives a direction in relation to gender balance, he or she will be obliged to consult those particular groups.  I thank Senator Costello and Deputy O'Shea in the other House for bringing this matter to our attention. The substance of their points is effectively included in the Government amendment No. 21, which I hope the House will agree to.</P>
    <P>The distinctive structure of the vocational education committees is about to be overhauled. There will be radical changes in the VEC system under the new legislation.  We should await amending legislation specifically in regard to vocational education committees.  A question was asked in regard to this issue on the Order of Business in the Dáil recently and I believe it is intended to publish the legislation early in the new year.  A great deal of work has been done in this area and every effort is being made to process the legislation as quickly as possible.</P>

The provision that schools may have their accounts either audited or certified was intended to reduce the financial burden on schools while at the same time retaining a degree of accountability and transparency in the system.  I do not propose to alter the position at this stage.</P>
      <P>The effect of Senator Costello's amendment would be to require schools to certify and audit accounts.  That would impose a financial burden on smaller schools which already have sufficient difficulty finding necessary funding.  I do not think that is the Senator's intention.  The present position is that the accounts have to be audited or certified.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(d) the availability of the school for community use.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am proposing that the availability of schools for community use should be the norm.  There are 3,000 primary schools and 800 or 900 second-level schools throughout the country.  The school buildings are quite large and multi-functional.  The vast majority of schools are not open in the evenings or at weekends.  It is time we emphasised the importance of such community facilities.  That is what the amendment seeks to do.</P>
      <P>The Minister should ensure pressure is brought to bear on school authorities, patrons and boards of management to allow maximum accessibility to school buildings for community use.  The Minister may say the buildings do not belong to him but the Department pays for the vast majority of their capital and current running costs and it pays teachers' salaries.  We have been deficient in failing to emphasise community uses and failing to put mechanisms in place through the Department to ensure school buildings are made available under reasonable circumstances and conditions.</P>

It is important, particularly in the context of impending adult education legislation and lifelong learning, that all schools and community centres be made available for programmes and courses.  As it stands, many schools are available at night for classes and so on.  Senator Costello is seeking to ensure all schools would be available for community use.</P>

      <P>As Senator McDonagh has said, schools are being made available.  I strongly support the spirit of this amendment and I confess that I would be tabling it if I were in Opposition. However, we are advised by the Office of the Attorney General that, prescribing matters relating to such use, such regulations would be very difficult to draft in a manner which would be consistent with the constitutional rights of the school <Col N="661" /> owner because, as Senator Ormonde correctly pointed out, the schools are privately owned even though they are publicly funded.</P>
      <P>It must be borne in mind that the primary purpose for which schools in private ownership have been funded from public funds is to provide education to students enrolled in the school.  To go beyond that could result in what would be regarded as undue interference with the property rights of schools owners.  That is the legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General and we have to adhere to it.</P>
      <P>From a personal point of view, I would prefer to see this done by local agreement because it creates goodwill and harmony in a community rather than by the use of legal machinery and saying that people are entitled to demand the use of a school for one day a week or more because of regulations drafted by the Minister for Education and Science.  That is not the way to win friends and influence people.  My heart is with the amendment but I cannot accept it because I am advised that it could contravene Article 43 of the Constitution which deals with private property.</P>

      <P>These amendments deal with the appeals in relation to a student and a school.  My amendment suggests that when internal procedures are exhausted there should be scope for an independent person to be appointed to see if conciliation can resolve the matter rather than setting up a committee and appointing people to it.  We should, so far as possible, resolve matters amicably by reconciliation rather than by a more formal pattern.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 31 states that &ldquo;the Ombudsman may investigate any actions of the appeals <Col N="662" /> committee under this section&rdquo;.

      <P>This refers to the reason somebody should be removed from the proposed National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. Under paragraph 5(1) to the First Schedule, the Minister &ldquo;may, at any time, remove a member of the council from office.&rdquo; The amendment proposes that the Minister &ldquo;may, at any time, for stated reasons, remove a member of the council from office.&rdquo; It is one thing to provide that removal may take place if the person concerned &ldquo;has committed stated misbehaviour or if his or her removal appears necessary to the Minister for the effective performance by the Council of its functions.&rdquo; However, no criteria are laid down for &ldquo;necessary performance&rdquo; or for what &ldquo;appears necessary&rdquo;.  The Minister accepted a similar provision in previous legislation establishing the new enterprise board.  It is an accepted phrase that would strengthen the legislation.  It would also clarify matters because it would provide for a formal statement of the reasons somebody might be removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 43 seeks to add the words &ldquo;but no member shall serve more than two terms of office&rdquo; at the end of paragraph 4(5) to the First Schedule.  Given that the proposed term of office <Col N="665" /> is five years it is reasonable that a statutory body dealing with education, curriculum development, assessment and such matters is not self-perpetuating but would have a regular turnover of practitioners and competent people.  We should be clear that no sinecure will be established, therefore, two terms of office is adequate in this instance.</P>

      <P>Most recent legislation contains a standard set of clauses of the kind set out here. Any State board to be established shall delete from its membership Members of the Oireachtas. This conflicts with the view of Senator Ormonde that if a member of a board or body is good enough to do the job there is no reason he or she should not be appointed and reappointed.</P>
      <P>Should elected representatives not also be considered fit to be members of an educational body?  As its general secretary, Senator O'Toole is deemed fit to run the INTO, which is not a small body like the proposed National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, yet, this legislation forbids him from membership of the council. That is outrageous.  None of the University Senators, all of whom have a strong educational background, will be allowed sit on an educational body such as the proposed council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a difference between the two Houses of the Oireachtas in this regard.  The Seanad is a vocational body and some of its Members are elected from the Cultural and Educational Panel. If they must adhere to the professional requirements of that panel before they become a Member <Col N="666" /> of this House is it proper for legislation to provide that they cannot practice in an educational forum established by the State under statute?  There is an anomaly here.</P>
    <P>We should not disbar all Members of the Oireachtas in this regard.  It may be more difficult for Members of the Dáil to be appointed to such bodies, although many of its Members are teachers and members of educational professions. Similarly, other Members of the Dáil who are interested in education could also be considered. However, given the vocational nature of the Seanad it is anomalous and contradictory to eliminate Members of that House from membership of bodies such as the proposed National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  Specifically, if they accept a nomination to Seanad Éireann, they must vacate any position they might have.</P>
    <P>Members of the Oireachtas are then grouped with debtors, felons and people who have been in prison.  The people disbarred from membership of this committee make up a mixed bag.  There are several Members of the Oireachtas and of local authorities who have served periods in prison for various reasons.  On one occasion I spent a week in prison so I would be disbarred by this legislation from sitting on the NCCA.  Thankfully I was able to sit on the body before it became a statutory body and found it to be very worthwhile. Now that it has been underpinned with legislation, I would not have much chance of getting on it even though my sentence was subsequently overturned because the legislation does not say that.  It states that &ldquo;anyone who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment by a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo; will be disbarred.  I was released subsequently under <i>habeas corpus</i> but the legislation is not broad enough to consider that.  My colleague, Deputy Gregory, suffered the same judicial embarrassment of spending some time inside and, although he would not be disbarred from continuing as a teacher, he would be disbarred by this legislation from sitting on the NCCA.  I wonder what the situation would be when someone receives a term of imprisonment which is suspended.  Are they disbarred under this legislation?</P>
    <P>We are now entering a situation where it seems to be essential to throw out this mixsome gathering of people who are not allowed to sit on any State body.  That is unsatisfactory, particularly in relation to a matter of education.  We should not disbar Members of Seanad Éireann, many of whom are elected specifically because of their educational expertise.</P>

There are very few people in this State, in the public or private sector, who have to declare the size of their overdraft for the publication of every newspaper and journal.  Discrimination against Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas is not new.  It has existed for some time but is being perpetuated and increased by recent legislative developments.</P>
      <P>I concede the amendments in the names of Senator Costello and his colleagues.  My direction from the Government is that it is traditional practice to keep Members of the Oireachtas off these bodies because the Government of the day would not want to think these bodies had become overtly political, or that people would bring their political viewpoints to bear on the proceedings of these important committees which deal with matters above and beyond party politics.  I assume that is the logic behind this.  It may be that some Government will change that and allow Members of the Oireachtas to sit on those bodies but it will not be this Government.</P>

      <P>The purpose of my amendment is to tease out what is covered by this legislation.  I ask that the broader description be deleted and restricted to what the legislation applies to which is primary and post-primary education.  It does not apply to adult and continuing education and vocational education and training.  The Minister of State knows it is likely he is the person who will introduce legislation to deal with adult and continuing education. Therefore, it is presumptuous of this legislation to state that it provides generally for adult and continuing education.  It does not provide generally, nor does it provide specifically, for adult and continuing education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> The title of the Bill is inaccurate to that extent and I do not see the value of trying to stretch the remit of the Bill beyond the parameters and provisions in the Bill.  The Minister will appreciate that the Bill deals essentially with primary and post-primary education and only in passing mentions adult and continuing education and vocational education and training.  When we sought to amend the Bill to provide for parents and staff in relation to the vocational education committees, we were told that that is for another day, that it will be dealt with when the 1930 VEC legislation is reviewed.  From that point of view, the Title of the Bill is inaccurate.</P>
    <P>It behoves the Minister to get this right and state to what the Bill applies.  The Bill applies to primary and post-primary education and this should be stated in the Bill.  If the Minister wishes, he should include a passing reference to adult and continuing education and vocational education and training but he should not treat it in the same way as primary and post-primary education. The Bill does not refer to all in the same way but the introduction to the Bill gives that impression.  In other words, it is an inaccurate description of the contents of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">

      <P>I second the amendment.  The Minister should accept it.  When issues regarding vocational education and adult education were raised during previous discussions, we were informed that that was for another day, that different legislation would be introduced to deal with vocational education committees and adult education.  This Bill now seems to embrace vocational education and adult education. However, throughout the discussions the Minister kept telling us that that was for another day, that we could not talk about the VEC system, vocational education or adult education because a Green Paper, White Paper and legislation would be introduced to deal with the matter.  The Minister must admit that the Title to the Bill is flawed in the sense that it is all-embracing.  In fairness to all concerned, it is incumbent on him to accept the amendment.  I support Senator Costello's comments and the amendment.</P>

      <P>Senator Costello said that the long Title and the Schedule to the Bill are misleading. If someone wishes to find out what is contained in the Bill, they will not confine themselves to reading the long Title.  Much of what the Senators said is correct.  However, aspects of adult education such as vocational education committees and so on are dealt with in the legislation.  I am advised that because there are references to other sectors, even though specific legislation will be required to deal comprehensively with them, they must be included in the long Title.</P>

      <P>I expressed dissatisfaction throughout the debate that the Bill does not deal adequately with educational disadvantage.  It provides for a sub-committee under a miscellaneous heading but does not provide mechanisms or structures for implementing the findings of that educational committee.  The previous education Bill put in place a regional structure.  This has not been replaced in terms of a local structure or a structure to deal with educational disadvantage.  This is the biggest problem facing the education system.</P>

      <P>On Senator Costello's question, I understand the matter is before the courts currently so I am precluded from comment.  As a result of the passage of this Bill, the education system now has a statutory basis for the first time in our history.  Other legislation is necessary to deal more comprehensively with the vocational education sector and the adult education sector.  However, I think we have made a very sound beginning.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators, particularly the spokespersons &mdash; Senators Costello and McDonagh and Deputies O'Shea and Richard Bruton in the other House &mdash; for their contribution.  They brought not only their expertise and experience to bear on the Bill, but also their very sound common sense.  If one compared the Bill as amended to the Bill as it was initiated, one would find it has changed substantially as a result of the contribution, thought, effort and work of Senators and Deputies, particularly those on the Opposition benches, for which I thank them.  We all owe them a debt of gratitude because it is a better Bill as a result of their contributions.  This is proof positive that our parliamentary system, one of the main functions of which is to scrutinise legislation introduced by the Government, works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and I guarantee him I will be as brief as possible.  I am particularly delighted he is taking this matter because he knows Cappawhite well.</P>
      <P>A request was forwarded to the Department of Education and Science by Cappawhite national school, County Tipperary, for an extension containing classrooms and a general purposes room. There has been a steady increase in the number of pupils attending the school over recent years and, as a result, there has been huge pressure on space in the school.  The school has had to use prefabs and its classrooms are overcrowded, which leads to a very difficult situation for students and teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was contacted by the school's board of management and also by teachers who are very concerned about this situation.  The teachers have made huge efforts.  As the Minister of State knows, Cappawhite is a very nice area and in recent weeks the school won a prize, in a competition <Col N="672" /> on organised by South Tipperary County Council, as one of the tidiest schools in south Tipperary.  They are very proud of that prize. The request for the matter to be raised at this level was made at the presentation of the prizes and I guaranteed them I would raise it.  Given how well the Minister of State knows Cappawhite, I am sure he will respond very positively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. O'Dea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the current position regarding the proposed extension to Cappawhite national school, County Tipperary.  At present, the school has a staffing level of one principal, four assistant teachers and a shared remedial teacher.  The school's enrolment was 149 pupils on 30 September 1997.  My Department has accepted that the current school building requires to be extended and refurbished in order to meet modern educational requirements.  In this regard, I have authorised the commencement of architectural planning of a building project at the school and I informed the school accordingly.  Work has commenced on the planning of the project, which is being designed by the Department's architectural staff.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the project is at sketch scheme stage.  There is a number of stages in the process, including preparation of the planning permission and fire safety application, securing of planning permission, preparation of detailed design drawings, preparation of tender and contract documentation, invitation of tenders, tender evaluation and appointment of a suitable contractor.  Due to the number of steps involved, it is not realistic for me at this early stage of the process to give a timescale for construction. However, I can assure the Senator that every effort will be made to ensure that progress is expedited in consultation with the school management. Due to my great personal knowledge of the area, I will make inquiries on the matter and I will write to Senator Hayes within the next day or two.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to the House.  I am very grateful he has taken the time to respond to this motion, which is somewhat timely in light of the media coverage in recent days of refugee problems.  As I have often said in the House, a clear distinction must be made between illegal immigrants who attempt to illegally enter this country and those who are legitimately seeking political refugee status or are effectively running for their lives from their countries of origin.  It is in that context that I tabled this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a member of the sub-committee on human rights of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I had the privilege in recent weeks of visiting Geneva and meeting the UN High Commissioner <Col N="673" /> for Refugees, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs, Robinson, and many other officials involved in this complex area.  Arising out of those discussions, it came to my attention that a number of EU member states and others are operating what is called a specific resettlement programme.  Those countries are Australia, which takes in 4,000 refugees per year; Canada; Denmark, which is a country of similar size to Ireland and takes in 500 refugees per year; Finland; the Netherlands; New Zealand, which takes in 750 refugees; Norway, which takes in 1,500 refugees; Sweden, which takes in 1,800 refugees; Switzerland, which takes in 50 refugees; and the United States, which &mdash; although it hardly bears comparison in the context of this debate &mdash; takes in 83,000 refugees.  These refugees are taken in under the resettlement programme, according to the criteria laid down by the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of this proposal is what the UNHCR refers to as the &ldquo;20 or more plan&rdquo; for refugees with special medical needs and emergency cases.  This plan is implemented by Denmark and Norway.  Statistics from UNHCR field offices for up to 31 May 1998 show that 12,250 refugees were resettled under UNHCR auspices.  Another 3,100 cases, representing 9,630 persons, have been submitted and are awaiting decisions from resettlement countries.  A further 1,600 cases, representing 4,920 persons, will be submitted or resubmitted by the UNHCR to the relevant member states for resettlement.</P>
    <P>In 1997 more than 380 persons, including dependants, were resettled as women at risk cases.  The fact that another 1,000, including dependants, await decisions from resettlement countries or are under active consideration by the UNHCR gives an idea of the scope of the problem. These special needs refugees, referred by the UNHCR within the limits of special programmes already in existence, generally receive favourable consideration from the participating countries &mdash; what one might term a fast track approach.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR has also appealed to all states which are members of the UN to consider the provision, where relevant, of resettlement opportunities, particularly for refugees with special needs which otherwise cannot be adequately addressed.  The phrase &ldquo;cannot be adequately addressed under current procedures&rdquo; is particularly important in the context of Ireland. Examples of special needs refugees include women, children, unaccompanied or separated minors, those with medical needs, survivors of violence and torture and the elderly.</P>
    <P>Resettlement functions as an urgent protection measure in individual cases and ensures the survival of refugees with special needs in safety and dignity.  The link between resettlement and refugee protection has been recognised in practice both by those states which operate such a programme and the UNHCR.  It is also an important exercise in burden sharing between those states which can do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="674" /> We have an impressive record in human rights and I strongly urge the Government to give particular consideration to how resettlement places may be made available to respond to urgent protection cases.  I particularly request that Ireland provide resettlement opportunities combined with accelerated processing procedures under UNHCR's mandate for refugee women who are in dangerous and precarious situations and also for minors where local solutions are not available and immediate resettlement may be the only practical means to guarantee their protection.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the contribution Ireland has made in the past to resettle victims of human rights violations, for example, the Vietnamese boat people who have successfully integrated into Irish society and who have made a valuable contribution to it.  Bosnian war victims have also been welcomed here.  I am strongly of the opinion that Ireland should adopt a quota system along the lines I have outlined in order to respond immediately to UNHCR requests whenever they arise.</P>
    <P>I also acknowledge the compassionate approach which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, has taken.  I have had personal experience of his compassion and quick response to cases brought to his attention which involved a threat to life if people were returned under certain existing procedures or where there was a genuine need among the people involved.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the House to respond to this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Mooney for raising this important matter.  In keeping with Ireland's long and honourable tradition in the asylum area, my Department accepts applications for refugee status from persons of many different countries of origin.  All applications are processed in accordance with the 1951 Geneva Convention and people entitled to protection are given protection. I do not envisage introducing a quota system to the determination process.  However, I emphasise that people entitled to protection pursuant to the convention are given protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each application is individually examined and it is only after such examination is completed that a decision on its well-foundedness can be taken. All these applications are examined in accordance with the terms of the Dublin Convention to determine if Ireland is the appropriate State to consider the applications.  Following this examination, the applications are considered in accordance with the definition of a refugee as set out in section 2 of the Refugee Act, 1996.  This section defines a refugee as someone who, owing to wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having <Col N="675" /> a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.  An applicant must establish a well-founded fear of persecution and where it is established that such a fear does not exist the application will be rejected and the applicant refused refugee status in the State.</P>
    <P>International experience is that there is an increasing tendency by individuals to intentionally misuse asylum procedures for illegal immigration purposes.  Last year I attended an international conference with almost 40 other Ministers and representatives of international institutions which examined the worldwide problem of illegal immigration.  At that conference I was interested to hear the UNHCR's own representative speak on the necessity to discourage the abuse of asylum procedures.  He said that a number of migrants seeking employment rather than protection from persecution circumvent legal immigration regulations and request asylum. He emphasised, and I agree wholeheartedly with him, that attempts to obtain asylum by people with no valid claim to international protection take advantage of asylum procedures and create serious problems by clogging those procedures. He went on to say that, moreover, such abusive claims have greatly contributed to the confusion between refugees and illegal migrants and in turn reflect negatively on the asylum institution and hence on bona fide refugees.</P>
    <P>The UNHCR also underlined another major concern of states and the UNHCR alike, namely, the phenomenon of asylum seekers who leave countries in which they have found or could have found protection in order to seek asylum elsewhere. Movements of this kind have a destabilising effect on international efforts aimed at finding durable solutions for refugees.</P>
    <P>While recognising that there is a serious problem with abuse of asylum procedures as a means of facilitating illegal immigration, it is nevertheless critically important that we do not prejudge cases, that each application is fully and fairly considered and that each applicant has access to an independent appeals system.  These are the principles by which I am operating and will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>The position of asylum seekers has acquired an increased significance in the Department with the increase in the number of asylum claims in recent years which has challenged the structures in the Department and focused attention on procedures and resources.  In 1993 there were only 91 applications for asylum.  By the end of October this year over 4,000 applications had been recorded. In 1997, prior to this Government taking up office, 22 staff in the Department were assigned to this work.  The staff in the area will shortly be close to 200.  I have also arranged for a refugee <Col N="676" /> legal service to be established which will be independent of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has agreed to provide a comprehensive legal service and legal aid for asylum seekers.  It will assist asylum seekers in exercising their legal rights in all aspects of the Irish asylum procedure.  The new legal service will be based at the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&rdquo; centre at Timberley House, Lower Mount Street, Dublin, and it is my intention that it will be fully operational by the end of February 1999.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer also to a separate issue, that is the suggestion which is made from time to time that we should operate an immigration quota under which a fixed number of people could relocate to Ireland each year to seek employment.  At present, when an employer can show that a particular vacancy cannot be filled by an Irish or other EU national, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will grant them a work permit to employ a third country national.  The person in respect of whom this work permit is issued will be admitted to the State to take up this post.  This is the approach I favour in preference to a quota system, because it responds to proven skills shortages, it is flexible in meeting economic needs as they arise and it avoids the arbitrary element that must of necessity be involved in the setting of quotas.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that the Government recently decided to enter into an informal agreement with the UNHCR which will admit up to ten vulnerable persons and their immediate families on an annual basis as part of the UNHCR's resettlement programme for vulnerable persons.  To give effect to this Government decision on vulnerable persons, an agreement will be drawn up with the UNHCR in early 1999.</P>
    <P>I again thank Senator Mooney for raising this important matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his very comprehensive reply.  I hope that what he referred to in his reply, particularly the work of the Legal Aid Board and the one-stop-shop, which has been called for in this House and elsewhere, will be publicly acknowledged and I wish it well.  As the cliché goes, the devil is in the detail in that having listened attentively and with interest to the Minister's speech, the last paragraph contains the specific request I raised with him.  I am particularly pleased that the Government, through the Minister, has agreed to enter negotiations with the UNHCR and that there will now be a specific quota allocation in place for those who are at risk, be they women, children, elderly people or those subjected to violence through torture or abuse.  This is a watershed.  It is an important and significant development and I praise the Minister for his initiative.  I wish the programme well.</P>
