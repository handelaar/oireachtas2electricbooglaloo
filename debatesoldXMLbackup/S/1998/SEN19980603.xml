      <P>I have notice from Senator O'Meara that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to carry out, as a matter of urgency, a further study and analysis on the effects on inland waterways, and specifically on the eco system of Lough Derg, of the growth of the zebra mussel population.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Norris of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands to make a grant to the De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts to ensure its continuing presence in its current premises in Meeting House Lane, Mary's Abbey, Dublin 7.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider harnessing the celebrity status of our national heroes through radio, television and other media advertisements to encourage adults with poor writing and reading skills to avail of the adult literacy courses provided throughout the country and to consider the introduction of the Book Stand scheme in Ireland following its success in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator O'Meara and Senator Norris and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Mooney may give notice on another day of the matter he wishes to raise.</P>

      <P>The proposed Order of Business is item 1, the Investor Compensation Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage.  There will be 20 minutes for spokespersons and 15 minutes for speakers thereafter.  Senators may share time if that is agreeable.  Item 1 will be interrupted at 6 p.m. for item 16, motion 19, in the name of the Fianna Fáil group, on Objective One status.  That item will conclude no later than 8 p.m. If item 1 has not concluded by 6 p.m., it will be resumed at 8 p.m. and be brought to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>The element of bullying we saw last week is unprecedented.  I say to those opposite that the same thing could be done to them by the same people.  This is an attack on one party at the moment but it could easily be on any other party in the House.  It is a worrying development and we have not seen its kind before.  The question of the dominance of one group and the pervasive effect on the quality of public discussion is a matter which we would like to discuss in the House.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Order of Business. I would like to ask about the Geneva Convention Bill, which has reached Report Stage in the other House.  This Bill concerns our power to ratify the protocols to the Geneva Convention, 1978, which prohibits, among other things, the use of civilian populations as a means of war, which we see happening in Kosova and Sudan.  The Bill was published by the previous Government last May but then there was a hiatus.  The Bill was not presented in the Lower House until May.  In case of an accident, I would be grateful if the Geneva Convention Bill could come as soon as possible to the Seanad because it is extremely important. We signed these protocols but we are not in a position to ratify them.  As the old saying goes, <Col N="987" /> there is many a slip between cup and lip, and there was a slip last year and we do not want another one this year.  I would be grateful if the Bill was introduced in the House before the summer recess.</P>

      <P>On item 12, does the Leader have any information when it will be moved by the Government?  It replicates item 11 on the list of non-Government motions, which I and my colleagues tabled in February.  I would be interested to know what intentions the Government has in that regard.</P>
      <P>In respect of legislation, has the Acting Leader any information so far on proposals which the Government is bringing forward in relation to tribunals of inquiry?  It was most unfortunate that amendments were not accepted which my colleague, Senator O'Meara, had tabled to the Bill we debated recently in the House.  Had they been accepted I do not think the ordinary business of this House would be facing the prospect of further interruption with the necessity of taking further legislation.  The amendments would have enabled the matters which are now the subject of public comment and debate to be referred to the tribunals without further legislation.  I would welcome an assurance from the Acting Leader that the Government will rectify that situation.  I cannot see how the Attorney General was informally consulting with the chairpersons of the tribunals when this House and the Lower House voted against our having the power to refer matters to them.  It is a matter that needs to be clarified in the public interest.  I would welcome a statement from the Acting Leader on the Government's intentions in that regard.</P>

      <P>Last week on the Order of Business I asked the Leader of the House if he would arrange a debate on a critical issue for the people of Gort where flooding has taken place in the last few years.  It is imperative that such a debate should be brought before the House at this time of the year rather than waiting until winter when flooding is liable to recur.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has said that the cost of £40 million involved is too much. If he has an alternative it is only right that the people should hear it.  Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to report his intentions to the House?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise was to a certain extent anticipated by Senator Manning.  Is it intended to have a debate, as I think there should be, on the question of tribunals and the Burke payments?  What interests me specifically at the moment is what has attracted the attention of Senator Manning.  It was absolutely horrifying to read the Independent group's newspapers &mdash; the <i>Sunday Independent</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; over the last few days.  In the <i>Sunday</i><Col N="988" /><i>Independent</i> there was a unanimous chorus of toadying from journalists to the interests, as they perceived them, of their boss.  Not one even mildly critical voice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot debate this matter now.  I allowed some latitude to Senator Manning but it would be wrong of the House to anticipate points which may be made if time is provided for such a debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case I accept your ruling.  If I may say so, I concur also with what I think was the implication of what Senator Manning said: that it illustrates how extraordinarily dangerous it is to allow the control of the media to pass into one pair of hands, however excellent that person may be.</P>
      <P>Does the Government have any further information with regard to item 8 on the list of non-Government motions, which deals with the question of East Timor?  The Leader, Senator Cassidy, indicated that this matter would be taken fairly soon.  Now is an appropriate time, bearing in mind the internal collapse of the Indonesian regime.  We in Ireland have a role to play in attempting to ensure that recognition of the incoming regime is not finally consolidated until guarantees are given about human rights internally in Indonesia and the holding of a referendum on independence on the island of East Timor.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the earlier comments of Senator Farrell and others pertaining to the establishment of a press council.  Those of us in public life are well aware of the need for the establishment of such a body.</P>
      <P>I recently called for a debate on litter and the Leader indicated he would be favourably disposed to granting it.  Now that we are in the early part of the tourism season I urge that such a debate be held sooner rather than later as the need for it is obvious.</P>

      <P>I want to comment on the refugee crisis and the conditions in which people are travelling to Ireland, particularly from France; the toilet facilities were described on the radio.  In excess of 5,000 people are awaiting processing at the moment.  This is a huge problem about which Members do not have sufficient information.  I would be very grateful if the Department of Foreign Affairs could provide an update on the actual numbers involved and their status either as refugees or asylum seekers.  We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand on this issue.</P>

      <P>What are the Government's intentions in regard to the obvious need for amending legislation on tribunals of inquiry which has arisen out of the farcical situation created by legislation passed in this House only a few weeks ago?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on the call for a debate on the possible establishment of a press council.  Although I sometimes disagree with the way politicians are treated by the media, I would not like the message to go out from this House that there is a cosy consensus on this issue.  It seems there is a tendency for some people &mdash; I am not attributing this motive to Senator Manning &mdash; to shoot the messenger.  The Fianna Fáil Party is subjected to more bile in the media than Senator Manning's party.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>In regard to comments made by Senator Manning and others, I would welcome a debate on the establishment of a press council, press dominance and the role of the media.  From the point of view of good democratic debate, it is very unhealthy that any one group of newspapers should dominate the media to the extent witnessed in Ireland.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate events in the Dáil later today but, were it considered appropriate to amend the scope of the Flood tribunal, legislation would be required and perhaps it would be appropriate to debate this matter under the scope of such legislation.  If that cannot be done, we could table a motion on the matter.  In the event that it is considered appropriate to extend the scope of the Flood Tribunal, the Bill will come before the House and these matters will be debated then.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry raised the Geneva Conventions (Amendment) Bill.  That Bill is due to conclude in the Dáil on 18 June.  We hope that it will come before us as quickly as possible thereafter, preferably before the end of the session because, as the Senator says, it is an urgent matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Coogan mentioned the flooding in Galway.  This was given extensive coverage in the last Seanad and is a serious matter for the people concerned.  It should be debated by way of Private Member's Business or raised on the <Col N="990" /> Adjournment.  If that is not possible it may be debated more widely in the House.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Norris' remarks concerning East Timor.  The transition which is taking place in Indonesia provides a window of opportunity to ensure human rights in East Timor are vindicated and that self determination can be advanced.  I note the motion on the Order Paper in the name of the Senator and his colleagues and I hope to make time for this important matter.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn commented on the problem of littering.  In the newspapers this morning there were reports that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy D. Wallace, has some proposals related to this area.  When he makes those proposals he will want to come before the House to explain them.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge is correct that there is an appalling amount of human misery involved in the passage of refugees into the country.  Applications for asylum should be expedited as quickly as possible.  It is a matter for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I will ask the Minister to come before the House to discuss this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill which I am introducing today in this House does four things.  First, it provides for compensation for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries, including Stock Exchange member firms and banks which provide investment services to customers.  Second, it ensures that investors will be entitled to compensation equivalent to 20,000 ECU, which is worth about £15,500 at present, or 90 per cent of the amount lost, whichever is the lesser.  Third, it implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  Fourth, it provides for amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, the Insurance Act, 1989, and the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The Investor Compensation Bill marks a further significant step in the development of the regulatory framework for the financial sector in this country.  The past ten years have seen the emergence of a substantial body of legislation in this area.  At the beginning of that period, the banks and insurance companies were effectively the only regulated entities in the financial sector. In the case of banks, in particular, the primary concern was prudential, the main objective being to ensure that the failure of one bank did not endanger the banking system as a whole.  Further legislation in the late 1980s extended regulation to financial institutions such as the building societies.  Again, the primary concern was prudential, although it was also necessary to comply with EU legislation in the area, designed to bring about a single market in financial services.</P>
      <P>More recently, a modern system of regulation has been extended to the retail financial sector, notably through the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, and the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  The extension of regulation to the retail sector was necessitated in part by EU legislation, but also because there was a clear need to ensure that the sector was properly supervised.  As a result, while the Stock Exchange and Investment Intermediaries Acts transposed the Investment Services Directive, the Investment Intermediaries Act in particular went far beyond what was required by the directive, introducing regulation to the wider retail investment sector, with the exception of insurance intermediaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of the House will no doubt be aware that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has announced that she proposes to introduce legislation which will bring insurance intermediaries into regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, with the Central Bank as the supervisory authority.  The purpose of regulation is twofold, to protect investors and to promote confidence in the financial system. There have been a number of cases in recent years where investors have lost money, in some cases substantial amounts, through the default of intermediaries to whom they entrusted their savings. Let us be clear about one thing: no regulatory system can guarantee that a regulated entity will not fail.  What we can do is put in place a <Col N="992" /> system of regulation which is comparable with the best standards internationally and this is what we have done.  Now it is time to look at the question of compensation for investors who lose money because an investment intermediary is unable to meet its liabilities.</P>
    <P>Compensation is of course desirable but it comes at a cost: in addition to the cost of compensation itself, there will inevitably be administrative overheads to be paid for and there will also be the cost of verifying investors' claims for compensation. Not everyone is agreed that compensation is a good thing.  Those opposed to compensation base their view on the principle of <i>caveat emptor</i> which suggests that investors should bear all the risks associated with investment themselves, including the risk that the intermediary will defraud them.  Those who advocate that view believe that it is up to investors themselves to take the necessary precautions when picking an intermediary and entrusting their funds to that person.  However, the Government takes the view that the stronger argument is that individual investors are not generally well equipped to make an informed assessment of the risk that the investment intermediary to whom he or she proposes to give money will fail.  In addition, people make mistakes: it can be easy with the benefit of hindsight to criticise people for believing promises of higher than normal returns on their investments, but in many cases the motive for believing the promises is not so much greed as a lack of the knowledge required to appreciate the risks involved.  A further point is that the provision of a system of investor compensation should help to reduce the systemic risk that a single failure of an investment firm will trigger a wider loss of confidence in the rest of the financial sector.</P>
    <P>Having looked at the broad principles of investor compensation, we now come to the details of what is needed in this Bill.  In the first instance, we must implement the EU Investor Compensation Directive. This is a single market directive intended to ensure that all investment firms which have the so-called &ldquo;passport&rdquo; to sell their services throughout the European Union will be covered by minimum compensation arrangements.  This means that an investor will be able to entrust money to an investment firm located anywhere within the EU knowing that compensation arrangements are in place to safeguard the funds involved.</P>
    <P>The minimum that we are required to do under the directive is to ensure that investor compensation arrangements are in place for the minority of investment firms which are subject to it.  This could broadly be described as the bigger firms, such as stockbrokers, portfolio managers and discretionary investment intermediaries.  Typically these are firms which handle or control investor funds and provide services on a broad range of investment products, such as shares, units in collective investment undertakings and certain types <Col N="993" /> of derivative product.  About 100 firms are potentially subject to the directive at present.</P>
    <P>However, the directive does not cover what might loosely be called the retail end of the market. An example would be an investment firm which is a restricted activity investment product intermediary for the purposes of the Investment Intermediaries Act.  This lengthy description refers to intermediaries who sell packaged investment products such as unit trusts and who are not allowed to handle client funds, apart from taking deposits where they have an appointment in writing from a credit institution to act as a deposit agent.  The directive does not apply to insurance intermediaries.  Therefore, the directive applies only to a minority of investment firms.  However, the Government has taken the opportunity provided by the directive to put in place a comprehensive system of compensation for the entire investment intermediary sector and to extend investor compensation to insurance intermediaries.</P>
    <P>The insurance industry continues to attract significant amounts of investment funds, particularly from private investors through single premium life insurance products.  The Government felt that it would be anomalous to introduce wide-ranging investor compensation arrangements which ignored the insurance sector, particularly when many intermediaries are involved in both insurance and non-insurance investment business. The Bill also extends the compensation arrangements to any general insurance business, such as car and home insurance placed with an insurance agent or broker.  The Investor Compensation Bill will, therefore, cover both the life and non-life activities of insurance intermediaries as well as the business of what I might call &ldquo;pure&rdquo; investment intermediaries.  The existing protections for insurance clients under the Insurance Acts will remain in place.  For example, the provisions ensuring that a client is covered for insurance where the insurance company has invited renewal of a premium or accepted an order once the client has paid the premium to the agent or broker.</P>
    <P>Under the investor compensation directive, clients of investment firms are entitled to minimum compensation of the lesser of 20,000 ECU, that is about £15,500 or 90 per cent of the amount lost, where an investment firm is unable to return funds or securities belonging to those clients.  The Government has decided that this is an appropriate level at which to set the entitlement to investor compensation generally under this legislation. This provides a reasonable amount of compensation while at the same time giving some recognition to the <i>caveat emptor</i> principle.</P>
    <P>The directive also allows member states to limit entitlement to compensation to private investors and smaller companies.  In this context smaller companies are those which meet two of the following three criteria: a balance sheet total of less than 2.5 million ECU (about £2 million); net turnover below 5 million ECU (about £4 million pounds) and less than 50 employees.  The <Col N="994" /> Government takes the view that this is a reasonable approach since the purpose of the directive and this legislation is to protect the small investor. It has decided to limit compensation generally under this legislation to private investors and small companies only.</P>
    <P>I now turn to how investor compensation arrangements will be established.  The Central Bank will be the supervisory authority for investor compensation.  The bank is already the supervisory authority for stockbrokers, credit institutions and investment business firms and is the proposed supervisory authority for insurance intermediaries under legislation being drafted by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of a company called the Investor Compensation Company. The company will oversee compensation arrangements for the majority of investment firms, including insurance intermediaries, with the exception of one group.  Accountants who provide investment services only as an incidental part of their professional activities as accountants can be regulated by their professional body under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, under the overall supervision of the Central Bank. Building on this, the Investor Compensation Bill allows the accountancy bodies to run compensation schemes for their members.  The compensation schemes for accountants will have to provide compensation cover to the standard required under the Bill and will have to be approved by the Central Bank.  This approach is appropriate because the accountants who will be covered by such schemes will not be fully fledged investment firms.</P>
    <P>The Investor Compensation Company will be established by the Central Bank.  It will be a company limited by guarantee and the members of the company will be prescribed by the Minister for Finance, with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The company will have equal numbers of directors representing the financial services sector and representing consumer interests.  The Minister for Finance will be responsible for the appointment of the directors representing industry and consumer interests, again with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Governor of the Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson of the board.  The company will oversee investor compensation arrangements generally, and it will be responsible for paying compensation.  It will decide whether it should maintain a single compensation fund for all investment firms or whether there should be separate compensation funds for different categories of investment firm. It will also decide on the level of contributions to be paid by investment firms.</P>
    <P>That is the broad outline of how investor compensation will be structured.  I now turn to the proposals included in the Bill for the actual payment of compensation.  Compensation will be <Col N="995" /> payable where a client of an investment firm is unable to obtain the return of money or investment instruments from the investment firm.  The Central Bank will first make a determination that an investment firm is unable to repay money or investment instruments.  The company will then invite applications for compensation from clients of the investment firm and will place advertisements in the newspapers inviting applications. Claims will have to be verified and this will be done by the liquidator where one has been appointed by the courts.  Otherwise, the bank can appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to clients of the firm.  Once an investor's claim has been verified, the company must pay compensation within three months.  This period can be extended to six months where the bank agrees.  In the case of non-life insurance, compensation will, within the limits provided for in the Bill, cover the premium paid or the loss suffered by an investor where a claim under an insurance policy arises.  Existing protection for insurance consumers, for example, where an insurance company has invited renewal of an insurance premium, will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Investor compensation will be met by the Investor Compensation Company in the first instance from the contributions paid by investment firms.  I emphasise that the Exchequer will not be involved in funding investor compensation. In the case of compensation claims involving restricted activity investment product intermediaries and insurance intermediaries, the product producers involved will be responsible for some of the funding.  The product producers &mdash; in other words, banks, building societies, collective investment undertakings, insurance companies, etc., who give such intermediaries written appointments to sell their products &mdash; will be required to reimburse the company for compensation payable to clients of such intermediaries where the clients have given money to the intermediary for transmission to an identifiable product producer from whom the intermediary held a written appointment.</P>
    <P>This is the broad outline of what is proposed in relation to investor compensation.  There are, of course, other provisions in the Act designed to flesh out the detail, to transpose specific requirements of the Investor Compensation Directive and so on.  I might mention in particular the provision in the Act relating to solicitors.</P>
    <P>Solicitors are exempt from regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, if they provide only investment services which are incidental to their professional activities.  The Law Society compensation fund covers clients of a solicitor in respect of legal services, including financial services.  However, there was a doubt whether the society's compensation fund would cover financial services which did not arise from the provision of legal services.  Accordingly, the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, is being amended to make it clear that the Law Society compensation <Col N="996" /> fund will provide cover for investment and insurance services provided by solicitors where the solicitor is not covered for such services by compensation arrangements under the Investment Compensation Bill or, in other words, if the solicitor is not contributing to a fund maintained by the Investor Compensation Company.  These provisions can be found in sections 45 to 47 of the Bill.  I should also add that section 2 of the Bill contains a provision exempting certain investment business firms in the International Financial Services Centre from the obligation to participate in investor compensation.  The exemption will only apply to entities which are not subject to the Investor Compensation Directive and which do not provide investment services to domestic investors.</P>
    <P>I am also proposing a substantial number of amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Senators will recall that the Dáil Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy compiled a report on the regulation of investment intermediaries following the collapse of the Taylor group of investment companies in August 1996.  The committee's report recommended a number of amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and many of those recommendations form the basis for the amendments which I am proposing today.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to a description of the provisions of the Bill.  I should, of course, emphasise that I do not propose to comment on each section but rather to highlight for Senators the main features of the Bill and the purpose underlying certain provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill is divided into five Parts.  The first Part deals with general matters.  Part II establishes the Investor Compensation Company Limited which will have an important role in investor compensation, as I will outline shortly, and provides that the accountancy bodies will be able to establish their own compensation arrangements.  Part III provides for the payment of compensation to clients of investment firms.  Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions, including the provision of information to clients of investment firms about compensation and technical sections arising from the terms of the Investment Compensation Directive as well as a number of provisions relating to solicitors.  Part V contains amendments to the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 1 provides for the commencement for the provisions of the Act.  The Minister for Finance will commence provisions of the Act by regulation.  Section 2 sets out the definitions used in the Bill.  As I mentioned earlier, the Bill covers the activities of investment business firms, Stock Exchange member firms, credit institutions and insurance intermediaries.  These are collectively referred to as investment firms.  Section 2 also includes an obligation on solicitors who are restricted activity investment product intermediaries to inform the Central Bank and the Investment Compensation Company Limited of their <Col N="997" /> existence.  The reason for this is that while solicitors are exempt from regulation under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, if they only provide investment services which are incidental to their professional activities, a solicitor who was providing investment services which were not connected with legal services is required to be a contributor to a compensation fund operated by the Investor Compensation Company Limited.</P>
    <P>Section 7 provides for the repeal of certain provisions in the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995, because they will be redundant once the provisions of this legislation are in place.  These include the bonding provisions in section 47 of the Insurance Act, 1989, and section 51 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, as well as section 28, subsection (4), of the Investment Intermediaries Act.  Section 8 designates the bank as the supervisory authority for investor compensation schemes and as the competent authority for the purposes of the EU Investor Compensation Directive.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Bill deals with the administration of investor compensation arrangements, the establishment of the Investor Compensation Company Limited and the approval of compensation schemes for certified persons, which in practice means accountants who provide investment services only as an incidental part of their professional activities.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 to 20 provide for the establishment by the bank of the Investor Compensation Company Limited.  The company will establish funds out of which clients of investment firms will be paid compensation under this legislation and will set the amount of the contributions to be paid by investment firms to those funds.  I have already dealt with how the company will be organised in my opening remarks so I do not need to go into the details again.</P>
    <P>Section 21 requires investment firms to make contributions to the compensation funds maintained by the company.  An investment firm which does not pay its contribution in full on time will be subject to interest payments on the amount not paid.  This section also provides that the company may, when setting the rates of contribution, take account of investment business done by investment firms before the legislation was commenced, in cases where the investment firm is subject to the investor compensation directive.</P>
    <P>The reason for this particular provision is that compensation under the terms of the directive will be retrospective, in the sense that it will cover money and investment instruments given to the investment firm before the commencement of this Act.  A retrospective provision such as this would not normally be acceptable in Irish law; however, our legal advice is that the directive is retrospective in this way.  We are providing accordingly for the payment of compensation on a retrospective basis to the extent that this is required by the directive, in Part III of the Act. <Col N="998" /> The section also allows the bank to impose conditions and requirements on investment firms.</P>
    <P>Section 22 deals with the maintenance of funds by the company.  The section specifies that the company will be responsible for deciding on the contributions to be paid by investment firms and on the amount of the reserves to be maintained in a fund.  The company must consult the bank before deciding on the contributions to be paid, since the bank will be the supervisory authority and will have first hand knowledge of the sector. It is proposed that funding of investor compensation will be prospective &mdash; in other words, that the company will build up reserves in order to meet claims for compensation &mdash; rather than collect contributions to pay claims as they arise.  The company will be required to ensure that it is in a position to pay reasonably foreseeable claims for compensation and must take account of the funding capacity of investment firms when deciding the level of contributions and reserves.</P>
    <P>Section 24 requires the company to have procedures in place to investigate complaints against it.  Section 25 provides for the approval by the bank of investor compensation schemes for certified persons under the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  In practice, this means accountants who provide investment services which are incidental to their professional activity and whose professional body is approved by the Central Bank to oversee the investment activities of its members.  Section 26 allows the bank to apply to the High Court to revoke the approval of a compensation scheme for certified persons.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides for the issue of directions by the bank to investment firms which do not comply with their obligations under the Act. Those obligations primarily relate to contributions, but could also include providing information needed to work out what contribution to compensation the firm should pay.  The bank is empowered to impose restrictions on the investment services provided by an investment firm which does not comply with those obligations. The Second Schedule contains supplementary provisions in relation to a direction by the bank under this section and provides for appeals to the High Court against such a direction.</P>
    <P>Section 28 allows the bank to apply to the High Court, following consultation with the company, to have a direction given by it to an investment firm confirmed under section 27.  If an investment firm continues to fail to comply with its obligations under the Act the bank can move to revoke the authorisation of the investment firm to provide investment services or in the case of an insurance intermediary ensure the intermediary is unable to act as an insurance intermediary on behalf of insurance companies.  It will be an offence for a product producer to do business with an investment firm where the product producer has been informed that the firm has not complied with its obligations under the Act.</P>
    <P>Part III deals with the payment of compensation to clients of investment and insurance <Col N="999" /> intermediaries.  Compensation will be payable in defined circumstances.  There are two possible triggers, one being a court ruling which effectively prevents investors from recovering their funds from an intermediary for the time being.  An example would be where the courts appoint a liquidator to an investment firm.  The second trigger is where the Central Bank forms the view that an intermediary is unable to return client funds or investment instruments.  In that case the bank will make a determination that a firm is unable to meet its obligation.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides that where the bank has made a determination or a court has made a ruling, the company or compensation scheme must inform clients of the investment firm that they have a right to apply for compensation.  Clients must be given at least five months within which to apply for compensation.  However, this period may be extended in individual cases where the bank believes the client is unable for good reason to lodge a claim within the time allowed.</P>
    <P>Section 33 deals with establishing investors' entitlement to compensation.  Obviously, each claim for compensation will have to be clearly established: the mere existence of a receipt showing that a client entrusted funds to an intermediary does not, for example, show that the money was not subsequently returned.  A liquidator appointed to an investment firm by the courts will be required to establish what is owed to investors by the firm as a priority.  If a liquidator has not been appointed, the bank will appoint an administrator to establish what is owed to investors who are claiming compensation.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is a key section in the Bill.  It provides for the payment of compensation to the client once the claim has been established.  The compensation will be paid by the investor compensation company or, in the case of a certified person, which in practice means an accountant, by the compensation scheme of which the accountant is a member.</P>
    <P>Section 35 covers the details of compensation payments.  Compensation must be paid as soon as practical and at latest within three months of the date when the amount lost by a client was established. This period may be extended for a further period not greater than three months with the agreement of the bank.  The compensation scheme will be subrogated to the client of an investment firm in respect of the debt owed by the firm to the client and in respect of any payments from a bond or professional indemnity insurance held by the investment firm.  This means that if there is still money in the investment firm after a client has been compensated by the investor compensation company or compensation scheme, the client will not be entitled to any of it until the company or compensation scheme has recovered what it paid out in compensation. In a sense, compensation can be seen as a down payment on the money owed by the investment firm to the client.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> Part IV contains miscellaneous provisions relating to investor compensation, including technical provisions arising from the investor compensation directive.  Section 41 provides that the bank may require investment firms to hold professional indemnity insurance in respect of investment services they provide.  This will provide additional investor protection where an investment firm, for instance, loses client money through negligence.</P>
    <P>Section 42 provides exemption from liability in damages for the bank, its employees, officers and authorised officers, and the company, its board, officers and employees in carrying out their functions under the Act unless it is shown that an error or omission was in bad faith, and for a disclaimer of warranty in respect of compensation funds and schemes and investment firms arising from their supervision by the bank.  Neither the State, the company nor the bank will be liable arising out of the insolvency or default of performance of a compensation fund or compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>Section 43 sets out the penalties for offences created under the Act.  The maximum penalty will be a fine of £1 million and, in the case of an individual, imprisonment for up to ten years, or both, on conviction on indictment.  On summary conviction, a maximum fine of £1,500 may be imposed and an individual may be sentenced to prison for up to one year.  Sections 44 to 47 deal with the provision of investment and insurance services by solicitors, an aspect of the Bill with which I have already dealt.</P>
    <P>Part V contains a number of amendments to the Insurance Act, 1989, the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  I do not propose to go into every section in detail.  Senators will find all sections are dealt with in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the draft Bill.  I will instead attempt to draw attention to the thinking behind some of the more significant amendments.</P>
    <P>Section 51 inserts a number of amendments in section 2, subsection (1) of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, the definitions section.  The definitions of &ldquo;investment advice&rdquo;, &ldquo;investment business firm&rdquo; and &ldquo;investment instruments&rdquo; are being amended in the light of experience gained in the implementation of the Act.  Section 54 amends section 14 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, to provide that the supervisory authority may impose conditions and requirements on investment business firms which are deemed to be authorised under section 26 of the Act as well as in respect of investment business firms which are authorised under section 10 of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 58 amends provisions in section 26 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, relating to restricted activity investment product intermediaries. It might be useful to recall what is meant by that term.  Restricted intermediaries may only sell products such as unit trusts.  They must not handle client funds, the only exception <Col N="1001" /> being where they have a written appointment as a deposit agent.  Restricted intermediaries are deemed to be authorised on the basis of holding at least one written appointment from a product producer &mdash; in other words, they do not need to be formally authorised by the Central Bank.  As a result of this amendment a person who wishes to start up as a restricted activity investment product intermediary in future will have to be fully authorised by the bank.</P>
    <P>Section 59 inserts a new subsection in section 28 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995. Product producers are required to give a written appointment to any investment business firm through which they sell their products and are required to ensure that the investment business firm complies with the Act.  This element of industry self-regulation is central to the supervisory regime for restricted intermediaries under Part IV of the Act.  The new subsection reinforces this provision by making it an offence for a product producer to deal with an investment business firm without giving an appointment in writing to the firm and without checking that the investment business firm meets the authorisation requirements of the Act.</P>
    <P>Section 60 amends section 31 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, by the insertion of a new subsection which provides that a product producer who withdraws an appointment in writing from an investment product intermediary must publish notice of the withdrawal of the appointment in writing in one or more newspapers circulating in the State.</P>
    <P>Section 63 amends section 52 of the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995.  Section 52 is designed to protect client funds in the hands of an investment business firm when a liquidator is appointed to the firm.  The client funds must be kept in separate accounts and the liquidator will not be entitled to use those funds to pay off creditors of the firm.  However, there may be cases where it is justifiable to use client funds to meet a liquidator's costs because the clients will derive benefit from the actions of the liquidator.  It is now proposed to allow such client funds to be used to meet the costs of a liquidator of an investment business firm where the liquidator carries out functions under the Investment Intermediaries Act or under the Investor Compensation Act or distributes the client money and investment instruments, where the firm has no assets from which those costs can be paid.  The High Court will have to approve any such use of client funds.</P>
    <P>Sections 69 to 81 amend various sections of the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  The Investment Intermediaries Act and the Stock Exchange Act contain virtually identical provisions for authorisation and supervision of Stock Exchange member firms and investment business firms.  I am, accordingly, proposing these amendments to the Stock Exchange Act to maintain consistency between the two pieces of legislation.  I do not propose to bring the House through the Stock Exchange Act amendments individually.  The text of the Investor <Col N="1002" /> Compensation Directive is included as the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>I hope this legislation will not be called upon to do what it provides for, that is, to pay compensation to clients of a failed investment or insurance intermediary.  Realistically, however, that is a forlorn hope.  Human nature will always be there and so we are unlikely to achieve the perfect world.  The least we can do is try to minimise the number of defaults and to ensure that, where they occur, there is some alleviation of the hurt and misery that can result from them.</P>
    <P>The provision of compensation to investors where an investment firm fails to meet its liabilities to its clients is another important step in putting in place a regulatory system for financial intermediaries and an essential element in protecting investors.  The presence of investor compensation arrangements will play an important role in promoting confidence in the investment intermediary sector.  This will, in turn, benefit the financial sector as a whole.</P>
    <P>This Bill gives an important role in the operation of investor compensation to the investment services industry and to investors.  I am confident that they will discharge that role efficiently and well.  We have consulted widely in the preparation of this Bill with the financial services industry and with consumer interests and I thank all who contributed to the development of this legislation.  I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive overview of this Bill which is overdue. There is no doubt it sets out highly desirable goals and objectives.  It seeks to provide compensation for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries where they default to the value of 20,000 ECUs, which is worth approximately £15,500 at present, or 90 per cent of the amount lost.  It implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive and it provides for amendments to the Investment Intermediaries Act, 1995, and the Stock Exchange Act, 1995.  It is accepted that the Minister and his Department have consulted widely with the financial services industry and consumer interests in the preparation of the Bill. It is a well thought out measure, although its flaws may only become apparent in time.  I welcome its introduction because of the protection it will offer to investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would prefer if the compensation was more than £15,500 or 90 per cent of the amount lost. However, it is accepted that investors should absorb some of the loss and the Minister referred to the <i>caveat emptor</i> principle.  It is important that members of the public take all due precautions when deciding where to invest and that they consult wisely before investing their funds.  The &ldquo;buyer beware&rdquo; principle must also apply in these cases.  Insurance agents and brokers have a huge responsibility to their clients who place so much trust in them.  Unfortunately, we have seen <Col N="1003" /> this confidence shattered on a number of occasions in our recent history.</P>
    <P>I agree with the proposal to extend compensation to failures in non-life businesses.  It would be invidious to discriminate between clients on the basis of life and non-life businesses.  Unfortunately not all companies are so kind when dealing with agents.  I know it does not come within the ambit of this Bill but there should be recourse for agents who have conducted business with non-life companies, particularly over a period of time, and whose agencies have been cancelled without due reason in some instances.</P>
    <P>I welcome the protection given to smaller investors in particular and I note that professional investors and financial institutions will be excluded.  I was puzzled when I saw that professional investors were included.  I conjured up an image of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, at the races and him being described as an astute professional investor.  I will discuss that point further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>There were not many people at the races in Tramore last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is logical that the Central Bank is the supervisory authority given that it is already responsible for banks, building societies, stock brokers and investment firms.  The day to day policing and selection of firms for inspections will be important.  The strict and proper maintenance of clients' accounts is vital.  I often wonder how so many things have gone awry in individual cases in the past given the supervisory role of the Central Bank in the day to day operation of firms.  I wish the Central Bank well in its supervisory role. The mechanics of the day to day policing will be an important element in this regard.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the establishment of the Investor Compensation Company.  I note that membership will be drawn equally from the industry and from consumer interests and that the Governor of the Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson.  I am slightly confused about this because the explanatory memorandum states that the Governor will have one appointment, but the Minister seemed to suggest that he will appoint the chairperson and deputy chairperson.  Perhaps he could clarify that in his reply.  I note the Minister will appoint members to the board with the approval of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. However, the number of appointments is not specified.  How will a decision be made on the number of appointments?  Perhaps the Minister might also clarify that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All investment firms will be obliged to contribute to the compensation fund but no decision has been made on how much or on what basis each firm will contribute.  The company must make that decision.  Perhaps on Committee Stage we could discuss the distinction which must be made between producers, agents and brokers and how <Col N="1004" /> much each company will contribute annually to the fund.  An opt-out is allowed for accountancy bodies on the basis that they supervise their members in cases where services are incidental to their practices.  I am sure they have nice little earners regardless of the incidentality.  It is important any arrangements as regards accountancy bodies and solicitors are subject to the approval of the Central Bank.  Importantly, the bank will have to approve the number of funds set up by the company. Will the bank have a say as regards the company's decisions on contributions from the investment firms?</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned restricted intermediaries. Are these the people we commonly regard as tied agents?  The Minister said these people will be limited to dealing in unit trusts.  Does he not mean the wider scope of managed funds?  I am somewhat confused and it is a matter which I would like him to address further in his response. In the case of tied agents dealing with one product producer only &mdash; where somebody in the life business, pensions or investment, is selling the products of one company only &mdash; it is proper that the parent company is solely responsible, particularly where there is a written appointment. Obviously, that would be the case if the person is a tied agent for that business.</P>
    <P>The amendments to the Investment Intermediaries and Stock Exchange Acts contained in the Bill are worthwhile coming as they do from recommendations made by the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, which examined the regulation of investment intermediaries following the collapse of the Taylor group of investment companies.  It is accepted that these are tightening up measures in the light of the experience gained in implementing the Investment Intermediaries Act and are, therefore, worthwhile.  Overall, the Bill is welcome as further necessary consumer protection legislation. We all accept Ireland compares well in its regulation of the financial services sector despite the few spectacular failures we witnessed in recent years.  The Bill is a further welcome measure of comfort to investors should an intermediary defraud them.  I wish the Minister well in piloting this Bill speedily through both Houses.  I will leave anything else I have to say until Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on this important consumer protection legislation.  This is welcome legislation which offers protection to small investors and it is not only appropriate but is possibly overdue, as has been said.  The four main provisions of the Bill are clear, necessary and, to some extent, simple. It provides for compensation for clients of investment and insurance intermediaries where the intermediary is unable to return money or investment instruments belonging to the client.  In the past we have seen the fall-out where intermediaries have been unable to provide compensation. The amount of compensation will be the lesser of <Col N="1005" /> 20,000 ECUs, about £15,000, or 90 per cent of the sum lost.</P>
      <P>The third provision implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  The second and third provisions are interlinked.  This country has an excellent record of implementing EU directives. We often hear that, to some extent, the EU imposes much on this country and that sometimes we are too willing to implement directives.  On balance, however, EU directives are in the interests of the consumer and the citizens of Europe and, in most cases, I welcome such directives.</P>
      <P>The fourth provision includes a number of amendments to the Investment Intermediaries and the Stock Exchanges Acts.  Obviously, it is vitally important we dovetail what we are now enacting into existing legislation.  The Investor Compensation Bill, 1998, provides for the compensation of clients of investment and insurance intermediaries where the intermediary is unable to return money or investment instruments belonging to the client.  The amount of compensation is 20,000 ECUs, about £15,000, or 90 per cent of the sum lost, the amount that must be put in place under EU Investor Compensation Directives which this Bill implements.</P>
      <P>The Minister consulted widely with the financial services industry and consumer interests when preparing this vitally important Bill. Recently, we debated irregularities in the clearing banks and some of us complained about what we considered to be the supervisory role of the Central Bank.  I have been critical of the limited supervision by the Central Bank at committees and in the House.  It appeared the Central Bank did not have any interest in the account holder, a person other than a shareholder who has dealings with a bank, or that aspect of banking.  The clearing banks cannot operate if they do not have an interest.  The brief of the Central Bank, which is the licensing authority, should extend a little further than protecting the shareholder.  I made that clear in a number of recent statements in this House and at committees.  This legislation will be overseen by the Central Bank.</P>
      <P>This Bill means the client will be able to claim compensation if the intermediary is unable to return money or investment instruments belonging to them.  The Minister is going beyond the requirements of the Investment Compensation Directive which will apply only to investment firms such as stock brokers and discretionary investment managers.  I compliment him on that important initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also included insurance agents and brokers in investment compensation because a considerable amount of investment business is done through the single premium life insurance products.  A large number of intermediaries do both investment and insurance business.  It would be wrong for some and not other clients to be compensated if an intermediary, doing both investment and insurance business, failed.  The Bill does not propose to limit compensation to <Col N="1006" /> the life insurance business and it will also be payable in respect of non-life insurance business.  It would be invidious to discriminate between clients on the basis of life and non-life business. That is an important and welcome distinction in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill limits entitlement to compensation to private investors and small companies.  Professional investors and financial institutions, for example, will not be entitled to claim compensation. The intention is to concentrate resources on protecting the small investor.  This is the kernel of the Bill and I compliment the Minister of State for bringing forward legislation to protect small investors.</P>
    <P>I have done some research and have looked at some recent headlines dealing with what happened to small investors.  One headline in 1996 read: &ldquo;Inquiry focuses on funds handled by the Taylor group&rdquo;.  In that report we saw investigations into separate accounts to the value of almost £1 million.  According to another headline in October 1996 it was established that at least £2.5 million was missing.  In November 1996 the same company was involved when it was reported that investors were out of pocket by £2.52 million. The report stated that all unsecured creditors were likely to receive a small fraction of what they were owed.  The company's estimated deficiency was £270,000.</P>
    <P>Another headline in August 1996 stated that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul lost £185,000 it had invested with the same group.  This was money that had been earmarked for an indoor play centre in a home which the society uses for summer holidays for less well off children from the greater Dublin area, yet there was no protection. I do not have to overemphasise the necessity for this legislation and one might say that in some cases it was overdue.</P>
    <P>Another headline at the time stated &ldquo;Liquidator to pursue Mr. Taylor and his wife&rdquo;.  In that situation people were trying to get some pence from the pounds they had invested.  Another headline in December 1996 stated that a court had appointed a liquidator to the same firm.  The report stated:</P>
    <P>The High Court today was told that almost £750,000 had been misappropriated by the Taylor associated financial services.  Counsel for the liquidator said that the investigation by the liquidator [I think Mr. McSweeney was his name] had found that approximately £704,183 had been directly misappropriated from the company, and approximately £40,497 had been misappropriated on encashment.</P>
    <P>This is the type of activity we have had to deal with up to now.  It brought the whole area of investment companies into disrepute particularly where small investors were trying to advance themselves by investing their money.  These are the obstacles, dangers and pitfalls they had to deal with.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Earlier this year there was a US hearing of ill-fated investments concerning a 13-year RUC investigation into the collapse of an international investment company registered in Gibraltar and run by a Greek-born financier, Mr. Ross.  This is what undermines people who intend to invest.  In April 1998 it was reported that the RUC sought the extradition of the financier and the US court ordered his extradition at a later stage.</P>
    <P>To some extent we have a history of people in this country losing their savings due to the collapse of investment companies.  When that happens we have an obligation to protect small investors. The Minister of State has not been idle in dealing with this matter.  He has come forward with proposals and the necessary legislation and he is to be complimented for doing so.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank will be the supervisory authority for investor compensation.  The Central Bank is already the supervisory authority for banks, buildings societies, stockbrokers and investment business firms.  I have already referred to this point in recent debates and I felt that authority was to some extent one sided and only looked after shareholders.  When the full report of investigations into recent bank scandals is available I hope that if amending legislation is required, the Minister of State will contemplate it.  We need to have confidence in banking, including the financial institutions, insurance companies and all financial dealings in this State and on a European basis.</P>
    <P>Some organisational structures will be required to oversee and administer investor compensation. The Bill provides for the establishment of an investor compensation company limited by guarantee and I welcome that.  Its purpose will be to ensure that satisfactory investor compensation arrangements are in place.  The board of the company will have equal members or directors representing the financial services industry and consumer interests.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has taken a major step forward as regards that matter.  So often in the past, when legislation was being enacted, the establishment was protected but that is not the case here.  In fact, the Minister of State has given equal opportunity and status to both the financial service industry and consumer interests.  The latter interests are so important.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Director of Consumer Affairs, Mr. Fagan.  He is an outstanding public servant in the way he has dealt with many of the issues he has been confronted with in recent times.  He has the ability to see that even further authority should be granted to him in certain situations. I hope that in future the Government will give whatever extra powers are needed in the interests of consumer affairs to that highly respected and highly motivated public servant.  I have no hesitation in complimenting him in the House.</P>
    <P>I understand that the appointment of the board will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance <Col N="1008" /> with the agreement of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This is a twofold situation because there is an interlinking between both Departments in this area.  I am pleased that will be the case and I welcome it. The Central Bank will appoint the chairperson and the deputy chairperson.  That is the way it should happen.</P>
    <P>The company will maintain compensation funds and all investment firms will be obliged to contribute to those funds, with the exception of the accountancy industry.  The importance of this legislation is that it does not represent a cost to the Exchequer.  So often people call for legislation to deal with some matter but the citizen is left to pick up the tab.  However, I do not think citizens should pick up the tab in respect of the financial services industry.  To some extent, charges will be passed down to those who are directly involved in that industry, but there should not be a general charge on the Exchequer or the taxpayers.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has excluded that possibility.</P>
    <P>In the Minister of State's reply to Second Stage, he might elaborate further on the fact that the accountancy industry is excluded. I do not fully understand the relevance of what is intended by that but there must be some good reason for it.  In addition to maintaining the compensation fund, the company will have two other important roles. It will decide on the number of different compensations funds which will exist, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, and it will decide on the size of contributions investment firms will have to pay.  I expect some mechanism will be put in place to achieve that; will it be carried out by order or will the company itself set limits?  Will the Minister have any direct input in this?  It is important to note that no charge will be levied on the Exchequer and that the industry itself will bear the costs.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a major piece of consumer protection legislation.  Ireland's regulatory environment for financial services compares well with the highest international standards in this area.  I have outlined some serious cases in order to highlight the need for legislation of this kind and to ensure that such situations do not arise in the future. Ireland now boasts an investment compensation regime which ensures investors have the comfort of knowing they will not lose everything if an intermediary defrauds them.  This legislation will be welcomed by small investors throughout the country and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which is an important piece of consumer protection legislation. Great distress has been caused to small investors in the kind of cases outlined by Senator Finneran.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that when the Bill is being publicised, its provisions should not be overly hyped as we are only really introducing the minimum amount of compensation which the European <Col N="1009" /> directive obliges us to.  Directive 97/9 on investment and competition schemes, outlined in the Third Schedule, states that the harmonised minimum level of compensation shall be 20,000 ECUs for each investor.</P>
    <P>I presume that most of those who invest in intermediaries rather than parent companies do not do so for avaricious reasons but because they have very little knowledge of financial transactions. It would be very unfortunate if the passing of this Bill somehow conveyed the idea that if one's money was invested through an intermediary, it was completely protected.  People must still be extremely careful about whom they invest with.  Senator Finneran referred to the Taylor debacle and the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul's investment of £185,000.  Under this legislation, only 9 per cent of that investment would have been recouped.  Investors should be made aware that only small amounts of money are being guaranteed under this legislation.  I recall a case where people invested money from the sale of one house with an intermediary prior to purchasing another and lost it all.  It is very important that the provisions of the Bill are widely publicised and that people are made aware they will only recoup quite a small sum in regard to investments of £100,000 or more.  It is a pity this legislation was not introduced at the same time as the Investment Intermediaries Act in 1995 but it is welcome at this stage.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the so-called product producers, the title accorded to major financial institutions, are not required to keep a closer watch on their intermediaries or are not required to vet their integrity prior to issuing them with written permission to sell their products.  Large financial institutions should be obliged to regulate those working as agents on their behalf and should not be allowed to let them loose on the market place with very little supervision.  I would have a great deal of sympathy for any investor who, for example, invested a sum of £100,000, made the cheque out to the major product producer, felt it was merely passing through the agent's hands and subsequently discovered they were only covered for a sum of £15,000.  Senator Coghlan made a good point when he said that if a product producer was only dealing with one intermediary, the product producer should have greater liability for the actions of that intermediary.  Would it be possible to amend the Bill to confer greater liability on product producers?  I would feel quite protected if I made out a cheque to a major financial institution.</P>
    <P>I fully understand the necessity to impose a ceiling on the amount of compensation which can be paid but it is important that people are warned from the outset that they will only be able to recoup a percentage of their investment and that this is the case even if the cheque is made out to a major financial institution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that new legislation is being introduced in regard to insurance intermediaries who seem to have operated in a most unregulated <Col N="1010" /> manner for some time and I also welcome the fact that insurance intermediaries are covered by this Bill to some extent.  I raised my concerns about the independence of the Office of the Insurance Ombudsman and the fact that it seemed to have little control over insurance intermediaries on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>I am not quite clear about the role which the Director of Consumer Affairs will play as I did not think he would have any when I read the Bill. The Director is to be complimented on doing an excellent job and I hope he will continue to prosper in his role.  I have never been able to understand why the Director of Consumer Affairs is attached to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment which I would almost regard as being the antithesis of the consumer.  It might be better if Ireland followed the model which operates in other countries where those in charge of consumer affairs are attached to a Department such as the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Consumers' Association of Ireland also does a good job on behalf of Irish consumers.  The association receives no financial support whatsoever from the Government and it would be helpful if some funding could be provided to it.  Consumer affairs are enormously important.  A number of major financial institutions have wielded a great deal of power in this country for a long time and anything which can be done to protect their consumers is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is important that any intermediary which is supposed to arbitrate on behalf of consumers involved with large insurance companies or banks be independent.  Consumers' interests are to the fore in this Bill because the Minister said that half of the directors of the company will be consumers. I welcome that.  How will investors know which intermediaries are involved?  Will there be a brand name so that people will know they are participating in the scheme or will people still be in a position to trade even if they are not participating?</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Bill that the liquidator will have to go to the High Court before costs can taken from the clients' funds.  There were reports detailing how the liquidators' costs rose enormously and a great deal of clients' funds were taken in some recent liquidations.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned the Central Bank. The Central Bank has more power than it would appear.  I thought they were in control of everything, yet when it comes to the crunch the Central Bank seems to be able to walk away from the situation.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Bill numerous regulatory bodies are mentioned, for solicitors, stock exchanges, insurance intermediaries.  Has anyone thought that we might have a single regulatory body?  It could even involve the Central Bank.  I am not a financial expert so perhaps there are reasons why we should not have this, but it would mean that in the event of a problem we would have a single focus at which we could look rather <Col N="1011" /> than going to all these different bodies regulating various interests.  Is it not possible to have one financial regulatory body so we could look toward that if there was a problem with any of these subsidiary groupings?</P>
    <P>The Minister said he hoped that this Bill would not have to be used.  I agree that with human nature as it is, that is a forlorn hope.  We are likely to have to use the facilities of this Bill all too frequently. I welcome the Bill and look forward to discussing it on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">

      <P>The Investor Compensation Bill sets out to do four things.  It provides for the compensation of clients of various financial institutions which provide investment services to customers; it sets out the amount of compensation which may be paid; it implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive and it provides for amendments to a number of other Acts.</P>
      <P>While this Bill is of a technical nature, it marks a major step in the development of the regulatory framework for the financial sector in this State.  It is an essential step in the process which will allow Ireland to continue to grow and develop in global economic terms.</P>
      <P>In national terms, Irish culture is changing.  Not long ago many people would have shied away from holding shares.  The perception was that shares were for the rich or were owned by professional bankers, doctors and solicitors.  It is not so now.  Since the flotation of the Irish Permanent Building Society and the Norwich Union Insurance Company many ordinary people have joined this group which was previously perceived as elitist.  We look forward now to the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and the First National Building Society.  These new stock issues will create another large group of new shareholders and investors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To support my view of the changing culture of Irish investors, I noticed the publication by a major financial institution of a new book aimed at the ordinary investor with as little as £3,000 to invest.  Investors in this category rely on the Government and State to protect them by providing an adequate regulatory framework.  This framework will give them the confidence to make use of their hard earned savings in a profitable way.  The days when a small or medium sized investor can let his or her money sit in a deposit account and enjoy large growth of the funds are over.  To make money on investments now, investors will be faced with decisions about where, how much and how long to invest.  When faced with these decisions many people feel inferior to the investors giving them advice.  They feel uncomfortable when the people giving the advice start to talk about shares and equities, it is not their everyday language.  They do not question too deeply, trusting these important people rather than upsetting them by asking questions.  Irish <Col N="1012" /> investors are entitled to whatever protection the State can give them.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated, the Government takes the view that individual investors may not be equipped with the necessary knowledge to appreciate the risks involved and may make decisions based on glossy, inappropriate brochures. It is easy to say with hindsight that anyone who believed those promises was foolish.  Perhaps it was foolish, but the fools were trusting.  This Government is committed to providing a framework which allows ordinary people the confidence and security of knowing there is a system of investor compensation.</P>
    <P>This system will help to reduce the risk that the failure of a single investment firm will trigger a wider loss of confidence in the rest of the financial sector.  We can see how volatile this confidence is when something goes wrong in that sector, as instanced by the allegations in the banking sector.</P>
    <P>This Bill implements the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  During the recent debate on the Amsterdam Treaty many people questioned the benefit of EU directives.  This directive ensures that all investment firms which have a licence to sell their services throughout the EU will be covered by minimum compensation arrangements. An investor may, therefore, invest his or her money with an investment company anywhere in the EU in the security that compensation arrangements are in place to safeguard the funds involved.</P>
    <P>This Government has taken the opportunity while introducing the legislation to implement this directive to put in place a fully comprehensive system of compensation for the entire investment intermediary sector, including insurance intermediaries.  The Bill sets out the amount of money which may be paid in compensation &mdash; 20,000 ECU or 90 per cent of the amount lost, whichever is the lesser.  This is a fair amount for both parties.  As the purpose of this legislation is to protect the small investor, it is appropriate that compensation is generally limited to private investors and small companies.  The definition of a small company is clearly laid out and I commend the Minister and his officials on this clarity.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows for the setting up of a company called the Investor Compensation Company.  This company will be established by the Central Bank and is similar in concept to bonded travel companies and to the insurance fund which is in place to compensate drivers whose vehicles are damaged or who are injured by uninsured drivers. Many people have been able to enjoy their holidays abroad even though the travel company with whom they booked had gone into liquidation. Many other people have been able to receive appropriate compensation through the insurance fund when they have suffered at the hands of uninsured drivers.</P>
    <P>Earlier, my colleague, Senator Finneran, mentioned many cases in which investors lost considerable sums through the appalling and fraudulent <Col N="1013" /> behaviour of unscrupulous individuals.  From now on compensation will be payable where Mrs. Murphy, a client of Joe Bloggs Ltd., an investment company, is unable to obtain the return of her money from Joe Bloggs Ltd.  The procedure is simple and clear.  First, the Central Bank will determine whether or not Joe Bloggs Ltd. can replace the money invested.  Second, it will invite applications from other clients, claims will be verified and then, within three months or a possible extended six months, the company must pay compensation.  From where will this money come?  Not from the taxpayer, we are happy to say.  This money will be paid in the first instance by contributions from the investment firms. There are no funding implications for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As has been stated already, this is a fine piece of consumer protection legislation.  The Government and the Minister have acted in a proactive and decisive manner in putting forward this legislation. I commend him and give this Bill my full support.  We have a regulatory environment for the financial services sector which bears comparison with the highest standards internationally. We will now have an investor compensation regime which ensures that investors have the comfort of knowing that they will not lose everything if an intermediary defrauds on them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cregan Mr. Cregan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cregan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, and the Minister is welcome to the House.</P>
      <P>I note with interest that at long last consideration is being given to the small investor. However, it must be said also that for far too long no recognition was given to investors generally by people who were taking their money.  These people were unscrupulous.</P>
      <P>I want to make a few points about the way in which we are going about this matter of consumer compensation.  First and foremost, the taxpayer will not pay for this and that is only right and proper.  However, the relevant committee and the nominees of this company must be asked how they will assess how much must be paid by each investor?  Who will pay to build up the fund? Obviously, it will be the investors.  In reply to Second Stage, will the Minister state if all the people who are involved with investment companies will pay for this?  I cannot see the investor paying for it alone.  What percentage of people in Ireland are investing directly with investors in stocks and shares or with other financial institutions?</P>
      <P>I have been involved with financial institutions for a long time one way or another as a small business person and I see how they operate. Recently we saw the way banks can operate and the authority the Government has to question the way banks can implement their charges.  There was a serious question mark over particular banks in the past few months.  It did not create a happy atmosphere among people who have had long time involvement with banks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1014" /> Anybody investing in Ireland or the EU generally will be covered under this legislation up to 90 per cent of a loss of a certain amount.  However, as Senator Henry stated, we would not want to give the impression that one is covered totally and I am not saying one should be covered for the full amount.</P>
    <P>Who are the watchdogs?  There is an impression that the Central Bank has dominance over all the banks and makes sure the financial institutions work well; but over the past few months the Governor of the Central Bank did not give the impression that the Central Bank was able to answer for what was happening in the financial institutions.  Is the Central Bank dominant? Is it the watchdog?  The Governor gave the impression to us that the Central Bank could not dictate.</P>
    <P>What type of structure will we set up, particularly under section 17, which relates to the nomination of the members of the company?  We would want to be careful about this.  The Bill states that the Central Bank must nominate the chairman and the vice-chairman.  Why?  Are we really saying that the Central Bank was that good on previous occasions in regard to what was happening in the banks?  Are we saying that there was a good watchdog in place in regard to what was happening to the customer, the person who was paying the piper?  I do not think so.</P>
    <P>We certainly are not doing ourselves any credit here.  I am not putting the blame on one person or another, but we are in a situation where we cannot put the blame on any individual or group. Nobody is resigning, that is my point.  I remember that nobody resigned when there was a problem with a section of AIB some years ago and it cost the State about £250 million.  I think we are still paying from it in tax.  Nobody resigned at that time.</P>
    <P>I will not stand up and agree with everything. Who will be the real watchdogs?  I would appreciate it if we, the people, were involved in the company rather than the Governor of the Central Bank.  I do not know who is the Governor and I do not want to, but I expected more of the Central Bank in regard to the problems in the banks in the past few months and we did not get it.  The general impression among the public is that there is and was no watchdog here.  We deserve better than that.</P>
    <P>This Bill will protect the investor, in particular the small investor.  We are protecting them because of an EU directive, is that not the case? We must implement it.  But are we really putting in place a proper system of supervision?</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the rate of interest in our small society.  Why would I not be?  Like many others, I paid high interest rates through the banks for many a day?  The financial institutions in Ireland do exceptionally well in comparison to the number of people who are investing and I congratulate them.  Perhaps they are doing exceptionally well because there is no proper watchdog <Col N="1015" /> for the person who is paying the few bob.  Overcharging in banks went on for far too long.</P>
    <P>The economy is buoyant.  Interest rates are dropping.  The ordinary person like me is performing better because interest rates are lower. There was a time when we were paying between 21 per cent and 23 per cent for money.  Was there a watchdog at that time to ask why we were paying so much?  The only reason for the buoyant economy is the fact that Ireland is joining the euro.  At the same time that this is happening, interest rates are low in Europe generally.  I welcome the further drop in interest rates of between 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent before this year is out, but the banks would not forecast that unless they were getting the impression that banks from other countries will be competing against them. That is why I ask is it wise that the chairman and vice-chairman of the Investor Compensation Company should be nominated by the Central Bank?  Should financial people be involved at all in this company?  Would it not be better if the Ministers for Finance or Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that they wished to appoint people who were not involved in finance and who would take a different view?  People involved in finance will always protect others involved in finance, just as someone in the GAA will protect another person in that organisation.  It would be better if those involved had no association with the Central Bank or any other bank.  Look at how well credit unions work.  Who are these organisations run by?  They are not run by financial wizards but by ordinary people who give a fantastic service, no thanks to the banks.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that all banks are the same. However, when the chips are down they look after themselves.  There is no long term examination taking place.  Some time ago Senator Lanigan spoke about the performance of pension funds.  There is serious concern as to whether pension schemes people invested in over the years are giving a proper return.  Who is questioning this?  Will this company do so?  Is there any watchdog or association involved with the banks, the Government or on behalf of the people watching the returns on investments?  No, we allow these people to do what they like when they like.  No one is answerable.  The Central Bank does not and never did want to take an interest in this issue and never asks any questions.</P>
    <P>Local post offices and State banks offer a 40 per cent return over five years.  No insurance company will give such a commitment.  Why are we not promoting our own institutions more?  We do not need a watchdog over the post office as it is a local office in any town and village.  People ask whether their money is better off in a credit union or some other financial institution.  Where are the watchdogs?  Will this company be such a watchdog?  No, it will only look after the investors.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that investors should not be covered.  However, we are all aware of how <Col N="1016" /> stocks and shares are performing.  I am glad to see Irish companies doing so well and offering very good returns, none more so than the banks. AIB shares have risen from £6 to £14 in 18 months.  Bank of Ireland has gone from £9 to £17 in 14 months.  That is some profit and some investment.  The post office will not offer such a profit.  However, who can buy shares in the banks?  Can the ordinary person buy shares in the banks or in companies such as Greencore or Kerrygold? I am not saying that people cannot get these shares.  However, the impression is that they are very difficult to buy.  Do certain financial institutions, organisations and people have sole access to these shares?  Is there an opportunity for the ordinary person to buy them?  Will the Investor Compensation Company ensure that the ordinary person is covered as regards investments? Will they get the same opportunity as the financial institutions?</P>
    <P>The Central Bank has not proven anything to me.  At times I am baffled as to what it does.  It rightly tells us that we need to watch our inflation rate and consumer price index.  It also rightly expresses concern when there is overspending.  It can tell Governments when to tighten spending but it cannot tells us when banks are doing things we do not know about.  The Central Bank is involved with all the banks and we should not be giving it even more authority.</P>
    <P>I am not worried because the Minister will be on top of the situation.  However, what of the funds invested with Mr. Taylor or Finbar Ross who is being prosecuted in America?  He comes from my area of Cork.  I know his family but I did not know him.  The protection offered to an ordinary person is very questionable when one considers what someone like that can do.  How can the Minister or we as Members of this House tell people they should invest?  I want to see people investing in our companies.  I want them to have the opportunity to assist companies such as Jurys and other hotels move forward.  Kerrygold is a perfect example of what can happen. Look at what creameries have done for farmers, investors and shareholders.  These companies better these people and their families and I welcome that.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should appoint people to this company who are not associated with finance. Financial people can tie others up in knots and give the impression that they are right.  They are not always right.  They are there for their own benefit.  Look at the profits of the banks.  They are not going to tell people how to go about it. We should use banks as an example and do the same for ourselves.  We should be promoting our post offices and credit unions and giving people an opportunity to invest locally so that they can make their own profits.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It is necessary to protect investors and to provide a framework of support from institutions which invest their moneys in the best interests of clients and <Col N="1017" /> companies.  This Bill sets out a fundamental structure within the investment sector under the control of the Central Bank.  The Investor Compensation Company will provide funding to support investors who incur loses up to about £15,000.</P>
      <P>I am involved in investments and I welcome the thrust and purpose of the Bill.  However, there is a downside to the Bill.  I concur with much of Senator Cregan's comments on the management of the company.  In general, financial institutions such as banks and insurance companies have served the country well.  However, their main priority is their own interest and the profits and success of their shareholders.  Rather than the State having to support this new company, there should be a strong consumer element in the appointment of the board to protect consumers and the public interest.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State has made the argument that those who invest in financial businesses should do so at their own risk.  However, from what I have seen in financial institutions, there is as I said, a downside to this Bill.  Insurance companies are abandoning many of their agencies in the country because of all the legislation and regulations covering investment and bonding. Many people who have served these companies are being made redundant.  Other investment companies and agencies will suffer in the long-term because of these regulations which contract rather than expand the market.  People in small towns will suffer as a result of this additional regulation.  While it serves the purpose of aiding the investor, something we are duty bound to do, there will be a downside in the form of a substantial curtailment in the services provided in many small towns and villages.</P>
      <P>I believe that the companies which appoint as agents people who do wrong in the financial services sector should be responsible for compensating the people affected by their actions.  Financial houses or insurance intermediaries which appoint people who breach the trust placed in them should bear the brunt of compensation.  Ordinary taxpayers or investors should not be held liable; it is the responsibility of those who appoint the people.  Regulation of the area of granting agencies has been very loose in the past ten years.  In a comparison with motor insurance, all motorists bear the cost of bad drivers who are still driving despite having been involved in serious accidents costing hundreds of thousands of pounds. Although people may have been killed or been put off the road, these people are still driving and no one seems to bear responsibility in the long-term. That is why I do not like the idea of everyone being responsible for other's actions.  It is part of the exercise of placing responsibility on everyone for the misdemeanours of others who never seem to be responsible for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is necessary because it offers people compensation.  However, if financial houses are placing people in positions of responsibility, there should be mechanisms to protect the public and ensure money is properly handled, invested and <Col N="1018" /> documented so that this method of compensation does not have to be used because of people's money being misused.  I welcome the Bill in principle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Cullen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. Senators obviously studied the matter in detail and I appreciate that.  They understood the importance of the Bill and its central place in the package of financial services legislation in this country which compares well with best practice anywhere in the world.  The Investor Compensation Bill is another addition to that range of legislation.</P>
      <P>A number of points were made by Senators and I will try to deal with them as best I can and as they arose.  Senator Coghlan was first to speak and made a number of points.  I wish to confirm that the Governor of the Central Bank will appoint both the chairperson and the deputy chairperson of the board of the Investor Compensation Company.  He also asked about the number of directors to be appointed to the company and he is correct that the number has not yet been decided.  However, it is envisaged that there would not be a large number.  We have not specified a number because it may be necessary to appoint additional directors in future and we wish to leave our options open.  Senator Cregan had much to say on this area at the conclusion of his contribution and I listened with interest to what he had to say because there was much sense in it. Much of it is not concerned specifically with this Bill but there was much to it as a general dissertation on people's questions.</P>
      <P>With regard to the board, there is an emphasis in the Bill that the board will be strongly weighted in favour of the consumer.  That is an important point and is fundamental in the context of this legislation, unlike other Bills.  This legislation has arisen out of a great deal of discussion with a broad range of parties involved in this area.  It is the small investor and not the big institutions with whom we are concerned in the context of this legislation and that is why the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Director of Consumer Affairs have roles.</P>
      <P>A question was asked about how the level of contributions to be made by investment companies can be set down in legislation.  That is not specified in the Bill for good reasons.  It will be up to the board of the Investor Compensation Company to decide because it would not be satisfactory to try to set down in legislation a formula for contributions.  The amount to be collected may vary from year to year.  If large amounts in compensation were paid out in one year, it might be necessary to increase the levy the next year to rebuild reserves.</P>

    <P>There may not be one simple formula which can be applied to all investment firms because there are different forms of operations.  Since compensation will only be paid to private investors in small companies, the number of private <Col N="1019" /> clients on an investment firm's books should give a good estimate of the exposure the firm represents for the compensation fund.  The contribution to the fund would therefore be the number of eligible investors multiplied by an appropriate number of pounds.</P>
    <P>However, it may be that that will not give a good measure for all firms.  It may apply to some but it may not be possible to do it for others.  In addition, it may be desirable to allow for exceptions as they emerge.  An example would be a new firm or one which intends to expand rapidly into a new market.  Some other measure would have to be used for them.  On the other hand, it may turn out to be unduly complicated to reckon the number of private clients for each firm.  It might be more cost effective to use other measures, such as the number of representatives employed by a firm or its overall turnover.  A range of options are available and I am confident the Investor Compensation Company will be able to examine these issues and devise a formula capable of dealing with the questions raised and with the setting of the level of compensation.  It was for those reasons that it was not considered appropriate to specify such a formula in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Product producers will not be required to make contributions to investor compensation funds maintained by the Investor Compensation Company. However, if a restricted intermediary defaults, the product producer which gave written appointments to that intermediary will have to reimburse the company for compensation payable to investors where it can be proved that the money lost was given to the intermediary to be transmitted to an identifiable product producer.</P>
    <P>Senator Coghlan asked if restricted intermediaries were the same as tied agents.  A restricted intermediary is allowed to do only certain types of investment business.  He or she may not handle cash, except when he or she has a written appointment as a deposit agent and he or she may only do business with financial institutions which give him or her a written appointment.</P>
    <P>Senator Finneran mentioned the relationship between the Central Bank and the bank's customers. The bank's primary role, as I said in a earlier debate, is a prudential one concerned with the integrity of the financial system.  However, as Senators will be aware, a working group established by the Minister for Finance and chaired by an officer of the Department of Finance is examining the question of the relationship between banks and consumers and the roles of both the Central Bank and the Director of Consumer Affairs in this area both in law and in practice. This also relates to some of the questions asked by Senator Cregan.  The Director of Consumer Affairs is also involved with this group, which met no later than this morning.  Its report will be available within the next few weeks.  Arising out of other issues, this process has been urgently set in train.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1020" /> I confirm to Senators Coghlan and Finneran and perhaps others that the accountancy bodies must have the approval of the Central Bank for any investor compensation they put in place.  I would not agree that there is an opt-out for accountancy bodies or that accountants are excluded from investor compensation.  They certainly are not.  Any compensation scheme for accountants will have to pay compensation to clients of accountants in exactly the same way as the Investor Compensation Company.</P>
    <P>Some Members commented on the amount of compensation provided for under the Bill.  It would, of course, be possible to put in place compensation arrangements which would act as a complete safety net for all investors ensuring that all investors would be fully compensated in all cases where they lost out in dealings with an intermediary.  However, not only would such an approach be likely to be extremely costly, it would also remove any incentive for an investor to act responsibly in relation to investment decisions.  A balance needs to be struck between the principle of <i>caveat emptor,</i> which I spoke about earlier, and the need to protect those investors who are least well placed to bear losses and to encourage investors, generally, to approach their investment decisions very carefully.  As I have already said, the Government believes the present Bill strikes the appropriate balance between the two.  Our intention should be to protect the small investor.  I can readily accept that there are people who are far from well off and far from being professional investors who will have more than £15,500 to invest &mdash; perhaps from redundancy payments or legacies &mdash; but experience in other countries suggests that about 80 per cent of claims for compensation are for less than £20,000.  I stress that this refers to claims for compensation and not to the total amount of a person's investment.  This would seem to suggest that investors do not necessarily lose everything when an intermediary defaults.</P>
    <P>We must also be satisfied that the system of compensation we put in place has a reasonable chance of operating successfully.  There is no question of the Exchequer funding investor compensation. Not only would that be wrong in principle &mdash; transferring tax revenue from the general population to those who have money to invest &mdash; it could also be in breach of European law relating to aids to industry.  Under the Bill the cost of compensation will have to be borne by the financial services sector.  In practice that will mean that some, at least, of the cost of compensation will be transferred back to investors because it will represent an additional cost for intermediaries in running their businesses.  Therefore, we must be careful to ensure that the cost of compensation does not increase the underlying cost of investments unduly.  Investor compensation is, in effect, a form of insurance protection.  It is impossible to gauge at this stage what level of funding will be required and what level investors will be prepared to bear.  Our objective must be to put in <Col N="1021" /> place a system of compensation that will work and that will have time to get established.  The higher the level of compensation required by law the greater the likelihood that there will be problems in getting the schemes established.</P>
    <P>We already provide for compensation of 20,000 ECU under the deposit guarantee regulations which implemented the EU Deposit Guarantee Directive.  The Government has decided not to avail of a transitional provision available under the Investment Compensation Directive which allows compensation to be set at 15,000 ECU or 90 per cent of the amount lost until 1999.  In other words, we are implementing the full directive, which I think is the correct approach.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances the Government is satisfied that the compensation levels provided for in the Bill are both prudent and adequate.  In addition, while the amount in question effectively is the minimum prescribed in the EU directive, the coverage goes beyond what the directive requires.  We are doing substantially more than implementing the bare directive.  I appreciated the comments of many Senators in this regard.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry mentioned the issue of a single regulator.  This is an interesting concept.  With the proposed transfer of responsibility for insurance intermediaries to the Central Bank we are coming very close to the Central Bank being just that. There is a committee examining this area and they may shed some light on this question.</P>
    <P>Senators Henry, Finneran and others wondered if product producers should have more responsibility for the intermediaries they appoint. Under the Investment Intermediaries Act, product producers are obliged to check that the intermediaries to whom they give a written appointment comply with the terms of the Act.  That obligation is being reinforced by section 59 of the Act which will make it an offence for a product producer to accept business from an intermediary unless he has given that intermediary a written appointment.  In addition, product producers will have to fund any compensation paid to the clients of one of their intermediaries where it can be established that the money lost was intended for a particular product producer.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked me to explain how investors will know intermediaries who are participating in the investor compensation scheme.  The Senator will be glad to hear that the compensation provisions under the Bill will cover financial intermediaries generally, stock brokers, insurance agents and brokers, investment business firms, credit institutions doing investment business and accountants who provide any form of investment services on an incidental basis.  The one exception is certain investment business firms in the International Financial Services Centre, which I referred to earlier, who are not subject to the compensation directive and who do not provide services to domestic investors.</P>
    <P>I must add one thing.  People will not be able to claim compensation if they give money to somebody who is not authorised by the Central <Col N="1022" /> Bank to provide investment services or to somebody who is not an insurance agent or a broker. There is an onus on any person making an investment to ensure the veracity of the company or individual with whom they are dealing.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>Senator Cregan raised a number of points.  I have already made some reference to the Central Bank as a supervisory authority.  May I add some observations?  Section 8 designates the bank as the supervisory authority for investor compensation schemes and as the competent authority for the purposes of the EU Investor Compensation Directive.  The bank is already the supervisory authority for all the entities covered by this legislation apart from insurance intermediaries. As I indicated earlier, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment recently announced that she is preparing legislation to make the bank the supervisory authority for insurance intermediaries.  It is therefore logical that the bank, as the regulator for the majority of investment firms, should supervise investor compensation. More legislation will be introduced which will deal with previous dissatisfaction, or perceived dissatisfaction, because of certain issues.  The committee will also conclude its review in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>Under the Investor Compensation Directive we must have a supervisory authority for investor compensation.  That authority must be the one which is responsible for regulating investment firms subject to the directive, which in our case is the Central Bank.</P>
    <P>There is no argument about the principle that whoever regulates investment firms should also supervise investor compensation.  The regulator will be best placed to move against an investment firm which gets into trouble.  There will be consumer representatives on the board.  The Minister is keen that we get that mixture right from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I hope I dealt with most of the points raised by Senators.  There will be a further opportunity to discuss this Bill on Committee Stage.  I thank Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House for the debate which is of extreme importance, particularly to those areas which in the past have been left slightly behind.  In my contribution I will describe these areas, namely, the Border regions, Counties Galway, Roscommon, Leitrim and Donegal and the midlands, as &ldquo;the region&rdquo;. I have grouped these areas and will describe them as &ldquo;the region&rdquo; because the facts I have ascertained in relation to how well they have done in comparison with other areas indicate they have lagged well behind.  This is not an attempt at begrudgery in the context of other areas which have benefited to a greater degree than those in the region.  I say well done to areas such as Dublin which have done so well.  The problem is that other areas have not done so well for reasons which are manifold.  For example, we can talk about the base in these areas before entering the EU.  The western regions always had a lower base than the eastern regions, something which has traditionally remained the same.  It could be said that, <i>per capita,</i> the western region benefited to the same degree as those areas which have done extremely well.  However, the truth is that while statistics do not lie, it could be said that liars use statistics as the <i>per capita</i> figures for the region &mdash; the Border counties and Counties Galway and Roscommon &mdash; include farming grants.  The benefits are not accruing to industrial development or the creation of infrastructure.</P>
      <P>The other reason they have lagged behind, apart from the manifold traditional reasons, is that successive Governments have failed to invest to a greater degree in the areas which have been deprived.  We are talking about a region which constitutes 40 per cent of the total area of Ireland. In the programme running from 1994 to 2000, expenditure in the region as a percentage of expenditure nationally amounted to only 5 per cent on national primary routes, 15 per cent on national roads, 1 per cent on rail with £40 million being spent on the service between Athlone and Westport, 20 per cent on new water and sanitary services, 11 per cent on water and sanitary services currently under construction and only 1 per cent on new IDA jobs for Counties Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim for 1997.  The figures speak for themselves and indicate something of extreme importance to people living in this area, namely, that the old concept of industry creating infrastructure no longer stands.  It is now the other way around.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I was an industrialist who wanted to establish in the west the first thing I would do is examine the infrastructure, including road, rail, electronic infrastructure, etc.  I would also examine the grants and tax concessions available in the west in comparison to, for example, the Highlands and islands of Scotland, a separate region by definition and in the understanding of the EU.  If the benefits were similar I would look at the infrastructure. If the infrastructure did not exist I would not attempt to establish myself in the west. We must create the infrastructure in terms of <Col N="1024" /> national primary routes, rail and water services because by doing so, we will encourage further development.</P>
    <P>Regional development is a matter of national importance.  At no time in the history of the State has there been such disparity between the success of one region and the failure of another.  It is worth underlining the figures published by the Central Statistics Office for GDP by region in 1994-5, although I am sure they have already been raised with the Minister.  Using the base of 100 for the country &mdash; comparison with the EU base shows the figures for the regions in a worse light &mdash; the figure for the Border region was 81.3 in 1994 and 77.2 in 1995; in Dublin and the mid-east the figure was 120 in 1994 and 121 in 1995; the figure for the west was 89.9 in 1994 and 70 for 1995.  These figures speak for themselves and indicate the need for a structural programme for regional development which divides the country. I know the Minister will say it is better for the country to remain a single region and that as such we will benefit more.  I do not disagree provided Objective One status goes to the areas that have been left behind and that the other areas get the benefit based on a lower amount over time until such time as they do not need it.</P>
    <P>The west regional authority for the west will meet tomorrow in University College, Galway, to discuss these issues.  Had this taken place last week I might have had time to distil some of the wonderful work they have done to indicate the disparity between the regions and the push-pull effect which indicates over-heating economically on the east coast.  This becomes self-perpetuating because it encourages more people to live in these regions.  The announcement today of the provision of 2,200 jobs on the east coast indicates the point I am making whereby people are encouraged to leave the underdeveloped regions to go to regions that are overdeveloped.</P>
    <P>The western regional authority carried out an analysis of the strengths for the development of infrastructure in the western region.  It found the area has considerable natural resources.  These include: extensive areas of scenic coastline, landscape with considerable tourism potential, sea and fresh water resources suitable for aquaculture and proximity to rich fishing grounds, extensive areas of peat land, climatic and soil conditions suited to forestry and an abundance of water for water-use industry.  Another strength is the development of infrastructure and facilities including an extensive road network, rail access to key points within the region and two airport facilities, an urban centre and dynamic growth poll around Galway city, third level institutions such as University College, Galway, and GMIT with significant potential for education, training and research, strong cultural traditions, a modern industry export section with specialisation in growth sectors, a good human resource potential based on a young and adaptable workforce with a good general education and a high participation in higher education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1025" /> These are the strengths that should encourage development.  However, there are also many weaknesses in these areas.  There is a poor standard of infrastructure, road networks of high inefficiency, a rail network based on old rolling stock with a need for huge investment and substandard tracks, a limited waste disposal capacity, especially for agricultural and municipal waste, limited airport facilities and services, no major seaport despite proximity to the ocean with great possibility for export orientation.  There is a lack of computer and technical skills, domination of small agricultural holdings, a sparse and imbalanced population, population decline and high outward migration in the region.</P>
    <P>The peripheral location of the region leads to problems of accessibility and competitiveness. When I sought the facts in connection with this matter I was inundated with detailed information. I am unable to touch upon all the details but the facts speak for themselves.  We must develop infrastructure in these areas and I believe that giving Objective One status to the Border and western regions will create employment.  According to the Commission on the West, there is potential for the employment of 15,000 people in this region if these infrastructures are put in place.  In order to achieve this the area must be designated as a single region.  The highlands and islands of Scotland have benefited by being defined as a region.  This will be prevented for political reasons only.  Given the opportunity, we can explain and justify our position to Commissioner Wulf-Mathies.  The decision lies entirely with the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister here this evening.  I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  This is of particular importance to the western and Border regions.</P>
      <P>It is not just recently there has been a debate on Objective One status.  It has been on top of every agenda for the last 18 months as to whether we go in as one whole unit or are divided into regions.  By and large the public is unaware what Objective One status means.  No one seems to know what Objective One in transition means other than the gradual phasing out of money.  It also appears that EU Commissioners hold varying views on the matter with some suggesting it would be unwise for the country to be divided into regions while Commissioner Wulf-Mathies appears open to this idea.  From a European perspective the image we have as a nation is one of a thriving country.  There is no doubt Ireland has benefited greatly from European funding over the past number of years.  As Senator Coogan rightly mentioned, our infrastructure, particularly in Dublin, has improved vastly.  We are constantly being reminded in the newspapers that we have the fastest growing economy in Europe. However, coming from the Border region, this is where I believe the problem begins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> It is all very well for EU Commissioners to decide Ireland should stand as a whole unit in accepting Objective One status in transition.  This was secured by the Taoiseach during preliminary meetings before Christmas.  This decision will potentially sound the death knell for rural Ireland.  I do not wish to act as the poor relation but I will be parochial and mention Counties Monaghan and Cavan.  We are all aware of the drain from rural Ireland to urban areas in recent years.  Traditionally, Cavan and Monaghan have been farming-based counties.  Unfortunately, we are not blessed with the same soil as in the south of the country where there are a number of large tillage farmers.  Cavan and Monaghan are totally dependent on dairy farming and livestock and derive the biggest income from milk production. However, due to increased expenditure in improving equipment and hygiene, a number of small farmers have had to lease their quotas or become involved in intensive farming, particularly in the mushroom and poultry industry.  In 1978 there were 4,000 dairy farmers in County Monaghan; in 1997 the figure had decreased to 1,300.  The majority of farms range from 15 to 40 acres.  It has become impossible for a large proportion of farmers to survive without some form of off-farm employment.  A problem for more and more farmers in this area is under-employment. This damages the confidence and morale of farmers.</P>
    <P>Like all small farmers, we have become totally dependent on the cheque in the post.  In the west and the Border counties GDP <i>per capita</i> is well below the European average of 75 per cent and the average of between 110 and 112 per cent in other parts of the country.  It is essential that the Border counties and the west retain their Objective One status because without it the incomes of small farmers will be eroded.  They are already being driven away from rural areas.  It is not a bad reflection of the farmers in my area that they are dependent on the cheque in the post.  There is a strong work ethic in that area where many individuals have started their own enterprises over the past 30 years but if we are to survive in rural Ireland, it is essential that our Objective One status is maintained.</P>
    <P>The recent Council for the West report shows that EU funds are not equally distributed.  Three-quarters of the funds have been spent in one-half of the State, while one quarter is spent in the underdeveloped half which includes the west and the Border region.  We all know Ireland as a whole will not meet the criteria for Objective One status but the Border areas and the west will be entitled to it until 2006 if they are divided into regions.</P>
    <P>The Border area also has other problems particularly in relation to Northern Ireland.  As a result of the troubles in the North over the past number of years, grant aid has been pumped into it by the British Government.  This means that potential industries opt to go to Northern Ireland where grant aid is available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1027" /> Over the past number of years all computer related industries have been located beside third level colleges along the east coast.  As a result, the Border region and the west have been neglected. Despite all the investment in Ireland in recent years, there is no doubt that counties such as Monaghan and Cavan have not benefited to the same extent as other counties.  We are grateful for funding such as that provided through the IFI, INTERREG and Leader.</P>
    <P>As discussions continue on retaining our Objective One status, we should go back to our roots and realise that rural Ireland is as important as our large urban areas.  We need large industries but we must also ensure that one half of the country is not left behind.  We are supposed to be living in a classless society.  The west and the Border region want a level playing field because they want to receive the same benefits as everyone else.  People living north of the N4 and west of the Shannon are entitled to the same benefits as those living south of the N4 and east of the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>In a statement the Taoiseach made when he was Leader of the Opposition in March 1997 he said:</P>
      <P>With regard to Structural Funds post-1999, or more probably post-2000, given the time-lag in all EU payments, we will have to look seriously at regional structures, if we are to continue to benefit.  Reform is going to be forced on us with regard to over-centralisation, which is worse than in any other developed country.  The West, the Border Region, and the Midlands in particular might still be able to benefit from Objective 1 Status, if Ireland ceased to be treated as a single region.  The next Government are simply going to have to take this issue seriously, if we are not to suffer a major reduction in Structural Funds, particularly in areas where they are still much needed, and where the work of improving infrastructure must go on.  More regional responsibility would in any case improve the dynamism of the Irish economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>In a declaration to the Council for the West in September 1997 the Progressive Democrats stated:</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats accept that the present pattern of economic development in Ireland is unbalanced.  Rapid development has placed excessive pressure on essential services in Dublin, while at the same time the population is falling in the West and North West. The Progressive Democrats are committed to the concept of balanced regional development, and the Party is currently examining various policy options for the best way of achieving this.  We strongly support the retention of objective one status for the West of Ireland and for other under-developed regions of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1028" /> The programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>Objective One Status will be sought for the West of Ireland, the Border Regions and all other rural areas that are suffering from population decline for the post 1999 period.</P>
    <P>This debate highlights the need to retain our Objective One status to the year 2006, the period for the next round of Structural Funds.  Despite all the pious pronouncements a year ago by the partners in Government, I am not satisfied that the Government is committed to a policy of regionalisation &mdash; in other words, adopting a policy so that we benefit as much as possible from EU regional funding.  I am satisfied that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, a Deputy for a Dublin constituency, are not committed to a special Objective One status for the west and north-west regions which are in decline.  I am also satisfied that the Minister for Finance is not committed to a policy which would give greater priority to the western regions under the new round of Structural Funds because I heard him expound his views at a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs when he was in Opposition.  If those three key players are not committed to it, it will not happen.</P>
    <P>Members of this House, particularly those from regions which are suffering decline, should put their foot down and insist that we adopt a proper policy of regionalisation.  There must also be a proper policy of regional administration because the EU will not give funding to the west unless there is a proper administrative structure there.</P>
    <P>We would not have succeeded in obtaining Objective One status in the period 1994 to 1999 were it not for the poor income and performance of the western and north western region.  In 1994 the rest of the country had reached the EU average of 75 per cent, which would have excluded it. The country was lucky, although the west was not, that incomes were low enough in the west to drag down the national average income to just below the threshold.  As a result, the country continued to qualify for Objective One status, as it had under the first regime between 1989 and 1994.</P>
    <P>What was galling for people like me who live in the west and come to this city each week was that while the west and the poorer regions ensured we qualified for the 75 per cent grant &mdash; and, in some cases, 85 per cent &mdash; for major infrastructural projects like road improvements and so on from 1994 onwards most of it was spent close to Dublin in building the new radial roads which enter the capital city.  All of this work needed to be done but the Exchequer should have borne a greater portion of the burden for such work.</P>
    <P>Mr. Jacques Delors spoke about solidarity, cohesion and the need for people in all regions of the Community to have a sense of cohesion with the better off parts.  He was a man of vision and knew the experiment which he pushed &mdash; greater integration within the Community &mdash; would not work unless everyone had a sense of belonging <Col N="1029" /> and fair play about the way the Community spread its resources.  In Ireland we found there was not fair play in the way resources were spread because the more favoured regions got the greatest amount of the money made available. The capital city needed a completely new road system because various Governments had for generations neglected that type of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>When the bonanza of transfers came we found we were spending it in regions which had already reached and were above the average income of the Community while peripheral regions in Counties Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim hardly got a shilling.  People flew from these areas in droves and we have plenty of official statistics and figures to prove that.  Between 1991 and 1995 and as far back as 1986, areas were emptied of population. For example, 9 per cent of the people in the Castlerea, County Roscommon, area disappeared between 1991 and 1995.  They moved to the capital, the United Kingdom and perhaps some of the young people went to the Continent. The people, the most important resource, disappeared because these regions got nothing from the EU regional funds, which was unfair.</P>
    <P>That is why we try to make the point as eloquently as possible that we cannot accept such a situation again.  This time the Government must not talk about Objective One status in transition, which will last about two years, and then about moving on to Objective Two status.  The peripheral and declining regions will get little for the rest of the regime until 2006.  The Government must decide that these regions, which are easy to point out and where the average income is well below that of the EU, must be submitted for Objective One status for the years 2000-6.  Only by doing that will we ensure that grants received will be ring-fenced for those areas and will we have a hope of pulling ourselves up by our boot straps and have some chance of participating in the better economic life which membership of the EU offers us.  I am sorry I do not have a little longer to expound on the other salient points I wished to make.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and am sure if he stays here long enough he will get a full tour of the country by those making contributions on Objective One status.  We will hear from Members from the east, south, cross-Border regions and the west.  I would like to speak about Structural and Cohesion funds, which we have received for some time, and where the money has been spent.  Much of the money has been invested wisely and the Government should be complimented on that.  During the earlier years of Structural Funding, however, some of the money was not invested as well as I would have liked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be parochial and speak about my county since it has been omitted from the western region.  Into what category does it fit?  I am sure the Minister is concerned about west Cork and into which category it fits.  Is it in the south or west?  When I was at school I thought the <Col N="1030" /> west stretched westward from County Donegal to west Cork.  Some people believe the west extends as far south as Galway.</P>

      <P>During the last Government Deputy Donal Carey became a Minister of State and all of a sudden County Clare was included in the west but part of west Cork and County Kerry were excluded.  We were left out in the wilderness.</P>
      <P>Last week a Member spoke about national secondary routes and said there were more miles of such routes in his county than in any other.  That is not true because County Kerry has the largest proportion, 17 per cent, of national secondary routes and has received a pittance over the years. We received grants in the region of £0.5 million over the past ten years for the main artery into north Kerry from the port of Foynes to Tarbert, Listowel and Tralee.  When I brought the matter to the Minister's attention, we received more money for the route this year than in the past ten years.  I compliment him on that.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the Minister on the money spent on the primary route into County Kerry from west Limerick to Abbeyfeale, Killarney and Cork.  That money was badly needed because that route was the main gateway to the tourism part of the county and to our airport.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to my area, north Kerry, which is in the west and about which we have forgotten. The population has declined by 0.3 per cent over the past two censuses.  Employment has been forgotten and no industry has located in the region for the past 15 to 20 years.  Migration is rampant as people must travel all over the country to get work.  Immigration has been rampant for the past 30 to 50 years.  Regions will have to be selected and, naturally, everyone will try to fight their corner to get as much money as possible.  Objective One status will have to be maintained for parts of the country.  I would hate if a case was made for the west which excluded parts of Kerry and west Cork.</P>
      <P>There is a discrepancy in relation to the regions.  The regions around Cork city are associated with it, thus depriving west Cork and Kerry of their status.  The same applies to the midwest region in which Limerick city and Shannon Airport are located.  I would like to highlight the fact that Shannon Airport is now the third airport, although it was the main one.  Cork Airport is ahead of it and I compliment the Cork people on that.  Something will have to be done in that region as far as the airport is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to infrastructure, including the rail infrastructure.  The McKenzie report on national transport infrastructure was adopted by the Fine Gael-Labour coalition Government in 1994.  At that time some Deputies wanted to close down the railway from Tralee to Mallow.  They wanted to put a main line from Limerick to Dublin. <Col N="1031" /> Looking back, it might have been as well to close the Tralee-Mallow line at that time since people are not using it because it is dangerous.  In recent years there have been three serious accidents on that line and it is only luck that no one was killed.  We asked various Ministers, including Deputy Dukes and Deputy O'Rourke, for extra funding to improve that stretch of line but we were told that only a small amount of money was available.</P>
    <P>If the west, or any rural area, is to be developed one must first put a proper transport infrastructure in place.  If that is not done one cannot expect to have proper development in such areas. Investment seems to be concentrated in centres of population.  The west can appear remote from the rest of Europe while the eastern side is more accessible to trade.  Trying to get around the south and south west coasts to the west may take longer, but the transport issue will have to be looked at in depth.</P>
    <P>People have been speaking about the Shannon estuary for years, saying that it could be a second Rotterdam and a hive of industry but no real development has taken place there.  Even though it is the deepest port in western Europe it has not been properly utilised.  Hopefully, the course of history will be changed in the next few days.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to maintain Objective One for various areas.  We will have to do everything in our power to achieve that, even though people say we now have 92 per cent of the European wealth average.  That may be so for parts of the country but not others.</P>
    <P>I have been seeking a regional water scheme in my own area.  In 1991 Kerry County Council applied for a group water scheme for Astee, which was famous for moving statues at one time. Some 400 households in that area have no water supplies.  We thought we would obtain a water scheme under the EU Cohesion and Structural Funds but it never came.  It would cost in the region of £3 million to put a reservoir in place there.  We will have to examine these projects in future if we are to develop the regions.  We will have to obtain money to upgrade our secondary and primary road network.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on the amount of money he allocated to County Kerry this year.  I am pleased with the amount involved.  For the first time ever we received proper funding and as a result we can see some meaningful work being done on the roads.  Extra road funding is needed for a county as large as Kerry which has 2,500 miles of county roads.  It will take until 2005 to put those roads back into a reasonable shape.  It is a long time to ask people to wait for proper roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, who is well used to rural areas and knows the problems of the people there.  A previous speaker said they had met the EU Commissioner in the North of Ireland recently and that she was very sympathetic to granting Objective One status to <Col N="1032" /> cross-Border areas.  I implore Ministers and EU Commissioners to put the west of Ireland in its rightful place for funding and to inlcude County Kerry.  West Cork should also be included in the west.</P>
    <P>The south west region is out on a limb and, while everyone goes to Kerry on holidays, the local population in north Kerry has declined according to the last two censuses.  Only 15 children attended a first holy communion ceremony recently in my own village, an area that was blossoming and blooming in years gone by.  The falling population will affect our schools.  Investment in infrastructure is required to keep the west alive and to create jobs for local people.  Those who think the west finishes in Galway should wake up and include parts of Limerick, Kerry and west Cork also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have rarely seen a motion in this House which is so implausible and riddled with contradictions.  The first thing to say is that, collectively, the country has become rich, but many people are amazed by that.  They do not know why the country has become rich because they have not seen any of the rewards and they have not examined the matter closely.  When one takes the average figures the country appears to have become rich.  However, the country has now managed to break a new record.  It already has one of the highest levels of child poverty in the EU, yet cannot afford to do anything about it even though it has become rich, and we now have the most unequal distribution of income in the entire OECD.  This makes it easy to understand why most people do not believe they have experienced the new found affluence.</P>
      <P>Nearly 35 per cent of the entire income of the State goes to the top 10 per cent of income earners. Before taxation 0.29 per cent of State income goes to the bottom 10 per cent.  The people who have made all this money do not live in the areas that most require investment.  They do not live in rural areas or deprived urban areas. They live in certain areas of the big cities and a couple of the big towns.  The rest of those who have made all this money are concentrated on the east coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Members of this House or the Lower House want to start talking about regional development they should first look at the fact that we have an appallingly unequal distribution of income which is worse than that of the Third World.  Just last week, for instance, I saw figures which showed that Jamaica, an impoverished Third World country, is less unequal than Ireland.  If we are going to do anything about seeking a redistribution of resources from the centre of Europe to this country or parts of it, we had better put our money where our mouth is and begin to redistribute the existing resources within the country from those who have done so well out of the last ten years to those who have seen nothing of it, yet have carried the burden of the negative side in terms of insecurity of work.  Otherwise, we are crying <Col N="1033" /> crocodile tears while at the same time celebrating the vulgar affluence of the 10 per cent in this country who have done so well.</P>
    <P>They were, incidentally, shamefully and spectacularly rewarded by this Government in the last budget.  It was the most socially unjust and economically irresponsible budget of the last ten years and was described by the Conference of Religious in Ireland as the worst budget in ten years.  That was a polite understatement, probably because they are better Christians than I am and did not want to use any stronger language.</P>
    <P>This kind of aspirational motion does not address the problems that exist in the regions that Senator Kiely and everyone else talked about. We could deal with them ourselves if we had the political guts to do so.  However, we have gone on a rampage of rewarding the already rich at the expense of the already poor which has left rural Ireland, many parts of our cities and our educational system &mdash; particularly primary education, before Senator O'Toole says so &mdash; in an appallingly under resourced state.  At the same time we go off to Brussels with our hand out asking for more money.  We believe in redistributing the resources of the German taxpayer but we do not believe in redistributing the resources of the Irish taxpayer.  In Ireland taxes are given back to the rich whereas Germans are expected to tax the rich so that we can continue to live in the style to which we have become accustomed.  That is a fundamental contradiction which runs contrary to the entire redistributive philosophy of regional funding.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stood in this House recently and spoke about the benefits of low taxes and his lack of belief in the principle of redistribution. If the Minister for Finance does not believe in redistribution within the State we, as a society, have a damn cheek going to Brussels asking it to redistribute in our direction.  That is what this Government has done.  We do not believe in the very principles by which we expect Europe to operate.</P>
    <P>There are no regions in Ireland.  Regions are areas which have a legal and political existence of their own, preferably defined under Constitution. There are no regional governments in this country either; we have emasculated county councils, even more emasculated urban councils and town commissioners who are totally lacking in virility. We will not get recognition for sub-regions in this country until we are prepared to put a regional government structure in place which would be independent of central Government and would have the capacity and right to be represented in Brussels.  We have all manner of quasi-nominated and indirectly elected bodies but no one body represents regions of the country which are in need of funding.  If regions which were in need of funding had independent political representation, such a fuss would be made about the unevenness of the distribution of resources that considerable embarrassment would be caused to the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> Gaeltacht areas are represented by Údarás na Gaeltachta but successive Governments, encouraged by the Department of Finance, were so frightened by the idea of the people of the Gaeltacht having control over their own affairs that they ensured the majority of Údarás na Gaeltachta members were nominated.  The Government will not even allow the people of the Gaeltacht to elect their own representatives.  Údarás na Gaeltachta is not allowed to deal with issues such as tourism because the Government is terrifyingly obsessed by centralism.</P>
    <P>If one is not going to allow any form of serious devolution of power to the regions, there is no way one can hope to persuade Brussels to recognise those regions.  Eurocrats, in spite of all their limitations, operate according to a certain logic.  If regions are alleged to exist, Brussels wants them identified, defined in law and given independent powers to make decisions about themselves.  We must move away from the ridiculous situation where every single decision about expenditure must be referred to the Government Department from which funding is forthcoming which, in turn, is obliged to refer it to that centre of all power, the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The power which the Department of Finance claims for itself over other Government Departments is, in my view, quite unconstitutional.  The notion that the Minister for Finance is the boss of any other Minister runs contrary to the notion of collective responsibility where all Ministers are equal.  Given that the Department of Finance has such an obsession with controlling the expenditure of every other Government Department, how will it allow a regional authority in the deprived parts of Connacht or Munster to have the sort of autonomy which Brussels would expect?  I am quite convinced that the Department would happily forego Objective One status rather than concede to direct regional negotiations with Brussels as such negotiations would take the power out of the Department's hands.</P>
    <P>In spite of its alleged free market convictions, the Department of Finance is the last surviving bastion of Stalinism in its espousal of the belief that the centre knows what is good for everybody. It believes the centre knows what is good for remote areas such as rural west Cork and the Inishowen peninsula.  Although it does not admit to knowing what is best for everyone and, in spite of the fact that it believes in consultation, the Department of Finance claims the right to supervise and veto every significant decision about public expenditure in this State.  Because of that centralisation of power there is no possibility of Ireland setting up a regional structure which would be acceptable in Brussels.  We lack credibility because we want redistribution from Brussels but do not believe in practising it here.  We want regions identified on the basis of their poverty but refuse to recognise those regions in any serious legal fashion.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of Members of this House are eloquent about the need for resources to be <Col N="1035" /> directed at particular areas, yet the entire House walked into an exercise in centralisation the likes of which Europe has never seen before, namely, the European Central Bank.  When the European Central Bank decides to flex its muscles that will do infinitely more harm to this country's economic wellbeing than a reduction in Regional Funds would ever do.  The day the bank decides to raise interest rates because Europe is growing very fast at the centre, even though Ireland may be in recession, will be the day we will discover the joys of centralism to be very short-lived.  The benefits of economic and monetary union will also be short-lived if such a level of unaccountable centralism is allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>Having created unaccountable centralism in the Department of Finance, we are now creating equally unaccountable, but more powerful, centralism in the European Central Bank.  Anyone who attended the meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs today will have heard the Governor of the Central Bank admit that neither he nor the European Central Bank are politically accountable any more.  The banks are governing without any political direction at all.  If our own public policy on redistribution and regionalisation was consistent with what we expect from Brussels, we might stand some chance of being accorded Objective One status.  However, I believe the Department of Finance, which does not believe in public expenditure in the first instance, would be quite happy to let us lose out in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a great deal about the western region in Senators' contributions.  With developments occurring in the west and the east, the midlands tends to lose out heavily.  The rapid growth in the Irish economy in recent years has resulted in significant reductions in disparity between certain regions in Ireland.  However, the imbalances which continue to exist are a source of concern, particularly in the midlands and my home county of Offaly.  The future of any region lies with its people.  Population growth in the midland region has stagnated over the last ten years with few exceptions.  There was a population decline in excess of 2.4 per cent in the 1986-91 period.  In the 1991-6 census the national average population growth was almost 3 per cent but population growth in the midland region was one third of that.</P>
      <P>Those depressing figures mask an even more disturbing story.  With one exception, all rural districts in my county showed a population decline.  In the period 1986-91 net emigration was in excess of 10 per cent while nationally the figure was 7.5 per cent.  Most of those people were of working age, one third of them in the 20 to 25 year age group. Not only did these people leave, they took the reproductive capacity with them causing further weakening of the population structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1036" /> The labour force in my county, 22,000 people, consisted of those gainfully employed and those actively seeking employment.  It is predicted that the size of the labour force will expand over the next five years.  Currently the region has an unemployment rate of 15 per cent.  When the next sum of money for development is allocated the aim should be the reduction of our employment figures to the national average.</P>
    <P>The midland region is an agricultural area. There has been a huge drop in the numbers employed in agriculture due to CAP reform and ambitious job creation targets must be set if we want to keep abreast of other regions.  The economy of the region suffers from potentially fatal structural problems.  There is a much higher than average dependency on agriculture based employment.  In County Offaly 20 per cent of the workforce are employed in agriculture as against a national average of 10 per cent and the average economic farm size is much smaller than the national average.  Beef farming plays a significant role in county farm enterprises and this sector has been weakened by the BSE crisis.</P>
    <P>There have been major employment losses in County Offaly over the past ten years.  The region was dependent on Bord na Móna and the ESB for employment.  In the period 1983-93 the number employed by Bord na Móna has fallen from 2,200 to less than 700.  That type of job loss in a midland county would be equivalent to the loss of 30,000 in the Dublin region.  Many of the jobs lost in the midlands region were part-time.  Small farmers who kept family holdings intact have suffered. That is why the region should retain Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The region has no major road infrastructure and loses as a result.  In the past we were divided between the mid-west and midlands-east.  Thankfully now there is a separate midland region and we will be in a position to benefit from funding for the entire midland region.  We lost out the last time.  The motorway from Dublin to Enfield is a major development but the midlands would benefit greatly if funding was made available to develop the road from Enfield to Edenderry, giving access to the county and encouraging tourism.</P>
    <P>According to Dr. FitzGerald, the CSO figures for 1994-7 indicated that the midland region might be the only region to meet Objective One status criteria.  We hope the rest of Ireland will receive funding but the midland region must get its fair share.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>Much has been said and written in the past few months about Objective One status and the need for it in the west, north-west and midlands.  The Government should come clean and tells us that Objective One status is unattainable for the reasons outlined by Senator Brendan Ryan.  Commissioner Wulf-Mathies told us that we have not got the political and geographic regional structure, with its own powers and budget, which would qualify us for Objective One <Col N="1037" /> status.  That fact is not being sufficiently well aired.</P>
      <P>Objective One status is being discussed at every cross-roads in the west but it is a futile discussion. The State will not qualify for Objective One status due to the increase in its wealth over the past few years.  The disparity of that increase has been referred to by other Senators in this debate.  It is time to put the facts before the people.  They will then know what they are discussing and what they are trying to achieve.  I blame successive Governments for not being in a position to avail of Objective One status on a regional basis.  This move was heralded some years ago by Europe when it directed that we set up regional authorities.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan referred to everything.  He referred to urban councils and county councils, but he did not refer to the regional authorities, which, if they were structured properly, should be in a position now to avail of Objective One status on a regional basis.  However, as we all know, setting up the regional authorities was a cosmetic exercise to comply with the European directive. They were never given teeth; they never had any power.  None of the six could build a hen house let alone do anything substantial in terms of budget and capital expenditure.  That issue was funked by different Governments in the past five or six years.  The regional authorities were set up by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1991, as far as I can remember, but they had no political structure. It is too late at this juncture to implement anything so that we will be in a position to retain Objective One status on a regional basis.</P>
      <P>The position is serious.  The Government is not stating the exact position.  It is giving the impression that it is going down two roads, Objective One status in transition for the whole country or Objective One, and we could end up in a <i>cul de sac.</i>  At present we do not know what is being negotiated but from what we can gather from Europe, Objective One status, as at present constituted, is not possible and that is the bottom line.</P>
      <P>Where do we go from here?  There is an obligation on the Government to ensure that, if it achieves Objective One status in transition, we, in the west, the midlands and the peripheral areas, which are so disadvantaged and in which the disparity of income and wealth is so great in relation to the other parts of the country, should get a concrete commitment that the weight of that money would be spread in those peripheral regions.  I know that getting a commitment from a Government prior to getting money is rare, but on this occasion we have a special case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the peripheral regions have a special case to make for the Structural Funds which will be coming from Europe because of this disparity. For example, the population of Dublin has increased by 47 per cent in the past 35 years; the west lost 110,000 people in the same period.  That is a major disparity but nothing is being done to address it.  I believe that if Objective One status <Col N="1038" /> is not secured, this trend will continue.  Some 46,000 jobs were created in Dublin over the past four years.  In 1996 only 152 jobs were created in west Connacht, County Clare and County Donegal but, 12,525 overseas jobs were created in Dublin alone in 1996.  The DART subsidy amounts to £15 million per year whereas they are threatening to close the Limerick-Claremorris railway line to save £250,000.</P>
    <P>There was a project to create a deep sea port in Killala Bay but the first thing we got was a letter from the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands expressing concern at the possibility of disturbing birds in the region. The project would create up to 1,000 jobs in that area at a cost of about £14 million.  About £50 million has been approved for the Dublin docklands, a project which progressed quickly.  The Western Commission was set but it has still to receive a penny; we have been waiting a year for £2 million.  Even the legislation allowing that money to be put into circulation has not been introduced.  Those are the facts which are causing widespread concern in my area, along the west coast and in the midlands.</P>
    <P>I could list other disparities.  In my area, County Mayo, there are still 10,000 people unemployed. Despite the Celtic tiger, the number unemployed only dropped by about 800 in the past year.  That is not progress; that is regression, and it is continuing.  About 1,000 people leave County Mayo every year and nothing is being done to halt that or to redress the situation.  We should be told exactly where we are going and what we will get.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Ryan is a wonder to behold when he is in full flight, as he was when I heard scraps of his speech on the monitor earlier, but what surprises me is that his rhetoric does not accord with the facts, to which I always thought he paid cognisance.  He spoke about reductions in rates of personal taxation and the people who have benefited from that.  It is true that this Government increased the old age pension in the most recent budget by a greater amount than any Government in recent years and that the increases in other social welfare payments were well above the level of inflation.  However, it is not true to say that the Government has no concern for, and ignores, people who are less well off.  That is plainly not the case.  This Government, indeed any Government, has an obligation to its less well off citizens and that obligation is taken seriously by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing which must be stated clearly is that it is a matter for national celebration that we are at the stage where it would be considered that Ireland no longer qualifies for Objective One status.  When Ireland joined the Common Market on 1 January 1973, nobody would have expected the national wealth would grow to the point where Ireland could bear favourable comparison with countries on mainland Europe.  At that time Ireland was so far behind that it would have been <Col N="1039" /> regarded as almost impossible to close the gap. That achievement is a matter of congratulations to the people who have worked so hard in the intervening years to bring us up to that level of wealth and, indeed, to the budgetary measures and prudence of successive Governments, of whatever political complexion.  It is something to be celebrated and to be proud of in Europe.</P>
    <P>It might be suggested that the Structural Funds were one of the key elements in achieving that status but that is not the case.  The Structural Funds contribute, as far as my information is concerned, about 1.5 per cent to the growth in the economy at present and it is predicted that the level of growth could reach 8 per cent this year. Therefore, quite a small proportion of the growth in the economy is derived from the Structural Funds.  That needs to be put in context.</P>
    <P>There is an overwhelming degree of special pleading.  We can all make a case.  I can make a case for County Kildare.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, could make a case for areas in his constituency which are extremely disadvantaged, and are as disadvantaged as any area in the west, but it also must be said that there are areas in his constituency which are well off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no case for County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>We can get rapidly to the stage of saying that this village or that townland should be treated as an Objective One area and the one beside it should not.  We could get to the point we had for the disadvantaged areas where boundaries were drawn almost through farms and one qualified and another did not.  That is logic of it. I agree that although the country has exceeded the level of wealth required to qualify for Objective One status, a substantially large region which is below that level should be considered for special treatment.  However, I agree with Senator Ryan that it is a matter of centralisation.  For the purposes of the disbursement of EU funds we are regarded as a single region.  Our task is to have that increased from one region to two or more regions.  That will not be easy and one of the reasons is that we do not have regional government. We have regional authorities but we do not have a system of regional government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a member of a regional authority and we have a role in the submissions made for Structural Funds.  We are currently preparing our submissions for the next round of funds.  A group of worthy consultants is being paid £60,000 by the regional authority to produce a report, and fair play to them.  However, this is a cosmetic and optical exercise because the decisions are not made at regional level but at central Government level by the Department of Finance which decides which projects will be submitted to Brussels. The regions can submit worthy projects none of which might be considered for inclusion in the Structural Funds.  It is somewhat implausible of <Col N="1040" /> us to suggest to Brussels that there should be sub-regional treatment when we do not have the sort of regional government evident in several mainland European countries.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the number of people leaving Mayo and the land.  It is true that something of the order of one family per day is leaving the land.  However, what is also true and not often referred to in these statistics is that many of these are older people who are dying.  We should be clear about the statistics &mdash; rural decline has been evident for many years and cannot be denied. The ESRI can confirm some of the losses from agriculture.  It is the one disadvantaged sector and this is borne out by the statistics.  The ESRI quarterly reports show that on almost any measurement of wealth, agriculture is falling behind while the rest of the economy is moving forward in terms of numbers employed, output, exports and contributions to GNP and GDP.  Structural Funds have a role in terms of measures such as the farm retirement scheme, the farmyard pollution scheme and some of the structural measures available but there is scope for more progress in this area.</P>
    <P>Another issue is the technical means by which we qualify or do not qualify for Objective One status.  That depends on the measurement.  If one takes GDP or GNP one comes up with different answers.  What would lead one to exclude the country on one measurement would lead one to include it on another.  There is a case to be made to Europe on this issue.</P>
    <P>The other case to be made to Europe is that we are extremely successful in the use of funds. At a recent meeting I attended in Brussels, President Santer referred to Ireland and Portugal as the two outstanding examples of how the funds were properly used and we should not be victimised for this.  This has to be borne in mind in the negotiations.</P>
    <P>If one was to use special pleading, west Kildare would fall into the category.  It is the same as Offaly from a regional point of view in terms of the population structure, the dependency on Bord na Móna and the decline which has taken place.  We can come down to an ultimate degree in special pleading.  The better the infrastructure of radial routes into the city the more the population will be dragged from these areas towards the centre.  This has happened all over Europe and there is no reason to suspect it will not happen here.</P>
    <P>I applaud the efforts to reach a sub-regional system whereby the less well off regions can be included.  We also need to look at the issue of a single region comprising some of the counties across the Border.  There would be a great degree of goodwill in Brussels towards looking at a single region which takes in the west and, perhaps, Derry and Fermanagh.  In the present circumstances and as part of the peace process there would be goodwill towards considering such a sub-region.</P>

      <P>I am not a county councillor and I do not have any vested interest in any areas of the country.  However, I hope I have a vested interest in the general development of the country. A lot of nonsense has been spoken in this debate.  What Senators want &mdash; that is, Objective One status for individual regions &mdash; is not going to happen.  Senator Dardis finally said this from the Government side.  Senator Caffrey said it was time people were told the truth and Senator Ryan made this very clear.</P>
      <P>We have been through this issue before with the current Structural Funds when the strongest possible case was made to give Objective One status to one part of the United Kingdom, namely, Northern Ireland.  That proposal was supported and proposed by all the parties in Northern Ireland and by the Government of the Republic but it failed.  There is not the remotest possibility of individual regions of this State being given Objective One status.  It cannot and will not happen.</P>
      <P>That is not to say that the strong arguments made by both sides should not be examined.  We have neglected those areas despite what Senator Dardis said.  I do not want to reopen the debate on the budget but its effects could continue for many years.  It could undermine the possibility of another national programme because of the perception that the less well-off did not get a fair deal in this year's budget.  That perception is the reality whether it is correct or not.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, has an abiding interest is communications.  What Ireland has going for it is that it is the only complete island state in the EU.  That is putting it simply; and I acknowledge the position of Northern Ireland.  However, we are the ones for whom it is most costly to communicate with those living in the heart of Europe.  That is a major factor in our development.  While we may not be able to obtain Objective One status, we can make a strong case for being in a special position for improving our infrastructure.</P>
      <P>This debate has focused on individual people and groups.  Objective One status and the issues attaching to it cannot be directed at individuals. This is one of the problems already experienced by people on this island and the reason they have not shared in the wealth.  We should be focusing on those issues which can be addressed.  The outstanding issue which is causing the greatest urbanisation in rural Ireland is communications. Roads, railways, airports and ports are all ignored.  Anyone who has tried to drive a truckload of fish from Killybegs or Dingle to European markets can testify to this.  Any student who has tried to commute from the west to the east weekly or daily can tell us about it.  Anyone trying to sell a car having travelled the roads of rural Ireland knows about it.  Earlier, I raised the issue of Arklow port with the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  It repeatedly silts up, thus reducing its effectiveness as a fishing port at a time when it is on a major European route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> We should try to open up rural Ireland. Senator Ryan was correct in the points he made. Those parts of the island which have low levels of income per head of population have been ignored.  I read recently of the difference between the treatment by the UK Government of islands off the west coast of Scotland and the treatment by the Irish Government of islands off the west coast of Ireland.  The latter are barely able to survive. There is a belief, particularly in Dublin, that the beauty of the west should be maintained as if it were a museum piece which people can visit during their summer holidays instead of allowing the people there to develop and to have the best of facilities.</P>
    <P>We have forgotten the size of the country.  The distance between Dublin and Achill Island is 170 to 180 miles which is less than a two hour journey in terms of rail travel.  My colleague, the General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers in England, lives further from his office, to which he commutes daily, than I would be if I lived in my home town of Dingle.  We have not come to terms with such facts.  Rural Ireland begins to be denuded when people finish their leaving certificate. Students in Ballina or Castlebar, for example, should be able to leave their homes at the reasonable hour of 7 a.m., stroll to the railway station, arrive in their colleges in Dublin in less than two hours, and be ready for their first lecture at 9.30 a.m. They should also be able to take the 6 p.m. train home in the evening.  The problem is that people leave rural Ireland, make new sets of friends away from home and do not return. Others will not settle in rural areas because the local school, the post office or the Garda station is closed.  Couples will not buy, build or move into a house in rural areas and the erosion of the population and culture of a village begins.</P>
    <P>As regards agriculture, we have been dishonest with farmers in that it has never been pointed out to them what is meant by a viable holding.  I would like the Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, to address this point because every time I have raised it, it has never been addressed.  Why is it that support for farming is based on acreage, animal herd size or some measure which ensures bigger farmers receive greater support?  The same people who complain about people being forced out of agriculture never mention supporting farmers so that they will have a viable income to which they are entitled.  Instead, they ensure the continuance of a system of support which means the person with 1,200 acres receives 1,000 times more than the person with 120 acres.  We have been dishonest and unfair in our approach to the support of agriculture.  We have not supported and have never focused on keeping people in farming and it is experiences of this kind which have led to this debate on Objective One status.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Economist</i> this week, there is an interesting article on the responsibilities of rich and wealthy people, how these have changed over the course of the century, particularly in the United States, how such people should recognise <Col N="1043" /> that they have a commitment to the community and how they believe they have become wealthy through their ingenuity when it is often because the system is structured to support them in becoming so.  Perhaps that is what we should examine in this discussion on Objective One status.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion on the retention of Objective One status for certain regions of the country in the forthcoming EU funding negotiations.  It is important the six Border counties, Monaghan, Cavan, Louth, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, along with the west, are considered for Objective One status.  I agree whole-heartedly with Senator Dardis who said that the entire country will probably not receive such status in the forthcoming negotiations.</P>
      <P>The country has prospered over the past few years as the Celtic tiger has spread and the economy has become one of the most successful in Europe.  However, certain regions and sectors still have many problems, despite people's best efforts, and they must develop considerably to match the more prosperous areas of the country. If Ireland is not developed equally in all areas, major divisions in wealth distribution will be a problem in future.  I urge the Government to ensure that Objective One status is retained for the Border area and the west.</P>
      <P>Development in the Border region has been greatly hindered by the troubles in Northern Ireland over the past 30 years with few cross-Border initiatives until recently.  The British-Irish Agreement and the massive yes vote last Friday week, in tandem with the planned structures, should give the region great hope for the future. However, Objective One status must be available as one of the measures to assist this development because the region has considerable catching up to do with the rest of the country in economic and social terms.</P>
      <P>The current round of Structural Funds has produced great developments throughout the country with the improvement in infrastructure, etc. The practical benefits are to be seen in every town and village where there have been much needed improvements in all services.  The distribution of the current round of Structural Funds has been questioned by many because the main population centres seem to have received a larger share of the funds with rural areas only receiving a small share.</P>
      <P>If the numbers leaving rural Ireland are to be halted, urgent attention must be paid to the west and the Border region.  I urge the Government to ensure Objective One status is retained for these areas.  I hope the Minister of State conveys that message to the Government because it is very important.  Everyone in the House, if asked, would agree the areas are entitled to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire. Unlike Senator O'Toole I believe there is reason <Col N="1044" /> to hope that Northern Ireland will be afforded Objective One status.  In that case the adjacent southern counties will be included.  There is therefore a legitimate expectation that the remaining counties of Connacht and County Clare would be granted the same status.  The Government's application for Objective One status will be a matter of life and death for the economy of the west.  If the Government does not adopt a policy of regionalisation the infrastructure of the west will fall behind the rest of the country, jobs will be lost, fewer new jobs will be created and the population will decline.  The decision which the Government is about to take is the most important of the next two decades in determining how the region will develop.  It is a life and death decision for the economy of the west.  It is vital that the Government opts for regionalisation.  We are one of the few countries in Europe which does not have a regional policy.  If we do not adopt such a policy the west will fall even further behind.</P>
      <P>Over the last two years the population of the west has declined by 4 per cent.  The Government's decision will chart the future of the western region.  Living in the heartland of the west, I see the huge backlog of water and sewerage schemes and essential roadworks which cannot go ahead because of lack of capital.  In County Galway there is a six year waiting list for local improvement schemes on roads leading to houses and farms.  This is typical of the situation in all western counties.</P>
      <P>We all rejoice as peace descends on our island. We speak of the huge tourism potential and the interflow of traffic between North and South.  It is strange, therefore, that the N63, the road from Galway to Belfast, which is the main route from the west to the North, is still a national secondary route.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government must re-examine this question and upgrade the Galway-Roscommon-Belfast road to a national primary road so that it can qualify for funding which will bring it up to an acceptable standard.  The road is narrow, winding and dangerous.  Many people have been killed in accidents on it.  The state of this road is an indication of the neglect of this region over many years. The days of saying &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo; or even &ldquo;to hell with Connacht&rdquo; are long gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate has not progressed much beyond the unsupported assertion that more European funding will be forthcoming if the country applies as a single region.  In order to progress the debate and to identify the steps which need to be taken to maximise our expectations of continuing European funds it is essential that those proposing the continuation of the practice of applying as one region produce figures to support that strategy. The west is crying out for help.  Our future is in the Government's hands.  The Government has declared its commitment to support the west.  If the leaders of Government adhere to that commitment they must opt for regionalisation. Ireland as a whole cannot qualify for Objective <Col N="1045" /> One status after 1999 due to the great success of the economy.  We qualified in 1994 only because of the low GDP levels in the west and the Border counties which pulled the national GDP down below 75 per cent of the European average.  As Ireland's GDP is now more than 100 per cent of the EU average the question of securing Objective One status for the whole country does not arise.  Objective One status is granted to regions and not to countries.  Ireland is divided into eight regions.  The whole of Ireland has benefited from the disadvantage of the west.  It is time the Government responded in a positive manner to the west of Ireland.</P>

      <P>I apologise for my absence at the beginnig of the debate this evening.  I was present for the full debate last week.  Such is the level of interest in European affairs among Senators that I have no doubt the debate could take place over three weeks.  During my time in this House I felt the Seanad could be the guardian and watch dog of much that goes on in Europe.  Delivering information about Europe into the public arena and debating issues of great importance would provide an independent role for this House.  I am glad to see that my belief and confidence in that role has been borne out by this debate.  I compliment the Senators who have contributed.  A great depth of knowledge was displayed on a range of issues.</P>
      <P>I dealt last week with the question of regionalisation.  The Government is pursuing without question, and is committed to, achieving the best possible scenario for Ireland from 2000-6. That is sacrosanct and is in the interest of the people.</P>
      <P>The regionalisation of weaker regions is possible and has been discussed with the Commission. It is important to understand that Ireland cannot unilaterally declare a new regionalisation policy &mdash; it is not within our remit and will have to be decided by the Commission.  We are looking at a way to achieve the best results for Ireland, including the weaker regions which are easily identifiable from the programmes in which we have taken part over the years.  Irrespective of the outcome, it is the Government's intention to ensure the weaker regions as they are defined at present are taken care of in 2000-6 so that development will take place on a range of levels.  This will ensure a level playing field throughout the country. The Government is committed to that and whatever the final outcome, it will be the best result for Ireland and the regions about which many Senators spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has not ruled out the pursuit of regionalisation and the matter is receiving detailed consideration.  It has been raised in discussions <Col N="1046" /> with the European Commission at both ministerial and official level and the Government will make a decision at the appropriate time. Commissioner Wulf-Mathies made it clear she will not support a regionalisation approach without sufficient regional administration.</P>
    <P>The Government strategy is to obtain the best possible deal which maximises the available benefits for Ireland.  The Government will strive to ensure that whatever approach ia adopted it will be the best, whether it is the single region approach we are used to or the regionalisation approach.  We want to address three key issues &mdash; our substantial infrastructural backlog, our outstanding human resources problem and the development needs of those parts of the country identified as still lagging behind.</P>
    <P>The regional authorities are preparing valuable information for the presentation of our reports and the conclusion of our deliberations in this area.  I emphasise to the authorities that they should complete that process which is vital in determining all the elements which must be put together.  There is a timeframe for that process and I would like to see the detail.  I am confident the regional authorities will do that.</P>
    <P>There are many Senators sitting on regional authorities who have an important voice in those fora.  They should express their strongly held views and ensure that if they are not present their colleagues make the key points about their regions and identify the key objectives &mdash; infrastructural and human resource based &mdash; which should be included in the submissions from the various regions.  I thank Senators for participating in the debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank everybody who contributed to this debate.  Some Senators attempted to misrepresent the motion.  I did not mention a specific county in the motion but rather the areas which met the criteria.  I was conscious that there may be areas in the inner cities of Dublin, Limerick or Cork which meet the criteria and this motion encompassed that fact.  While we know that large sections of the west, the Border counties and the midlands meet the criteria and are under 75 per cent of the average EU earnings, investigation by the regional authorities may show there are other pockets to which this applies.</P>
      <P>I was taken aback by the academic and simplistic approach of some of the Independent Senators.  Dustin on the DART to Dingle was referred to, as was the DART to Ballina.  I wonder if it is realistic to make such references in this debate.  I disagree that all regions, including the west and the poorer areas are excluded.  The Government reduced tax from 35 per cent to 24 per cent in the pound; the last Government reduced it by 1 per cent and it is proposed to reduce the higher rate to 42 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan said that unless we have a regional structure we cannot get Objective One status in certain areas.  This was proved incorrect <Col N="1047" /> in the case of Liverpool, which qualified for Objective One status in the last round of EU funding even though it does not have a regional authority.  That is a basis for negotiation and should be taken into consideration on the next occasion.</P>
    <P>The political will is needed to ensure certain areas get Objective One status.  There may be officials in the Department of Finance who are not interested in looking at regional status because, during less important debates in this House, more officials from the Department of Finance were present; this is not a criticism of the Minister of State.  There are officials in that Department who wish to pursue a one region scenario.  A good political debate is beginning which may change their minds.</P>
    <P>This is a golden opportunity to raise the areas under the 75 per cent average to equal status with the rest of the country between the years 2000 and 2006.  This must be looked at by the Department of Finance and there is a political movement which will push that point of view forward in the next few weeks.  The Department should be conscious of the unanimous support in this House for a regional approach to Objective One status for the regions which meet the criteria.  I hope the Department and those advising the Minister and the Government will recognise the decision of this House and the growing debate.</P>
    <P>Without the availability of proper figures we do not accept lightly that one region status is best for this country.  It has shortfalls for certain areas. Up to 40 per cent of this country is under the 75 per cent criteria and deserves the support of the Department of Finance so that the first card played in Europe ensures it gets Objective One status for the period 2000-6.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly important matter and I thank the Minister for his interest in it.  I am raising the issue of the rapid and intense growth of the zebra mussel pest, particularly in Lough Derg and the waterways of north Tipperary. I am seriously concerned by the effects it is having on fisheries and tourism and its potential implications for domestic water supplies.  I call on the Minister to act now and to put a plan of action in place to stop the damage being caused by the growth of the pest in Lough Derg, the waterways of north Tipperary and the rest of the country.  This afternoon I was informed by Dan <Col N="1048" /> Minchen of the Marine Institute, one of the country's experts on this issue, that the zebra mussel has turned up on Lough Key.  This is further evidence of the rapid growth of this pest and its ability of travel.</P>
      <P>The pest is only in Ireland for two years but its growth has been intense.  It is already causing major concern to anglers, boat owners, fishermen and environmentalists in the area I represent and in the Lough Derg region in general.  It poses a serious threat to the public water supply.  Many thousands of these mussels have already been found this year at the Coolbaun water treatment works on the lake shore north of Dromineer.  The Minister may recall that this treatment works was installed a number of years ago to deal with a serious domestic water situation which presented itself in Nenagh.  There is evidence that pipes are not only obstructed by mussels but that water for human consumption can be tainted by them and the waste left in their wake.</P>
      <P>We need to know more about the pest and act before it does more damage to our water supply and our tourism industry.  I hope the Minister will outline his plans for action in this regard.</P>
      <P>The ecosystem of Lough Derg has already been affected by the mussel and we can expect more changes of an intense nature.  Ironically, the mussel thrives where there is eutrophication, which is a problem in Lough Derg.  Because of the strong growth of the mussel it is already carpeting the floor of the lake making the water clearer and leading to greater weed and algae growth.  The waste left by the mussel is affecting the food chain of the fish population and, possibly, will directly effect the fish population in the future.</P>
      <P>Studies of the effect of the zebra mussel on the ecosystem of the great lakes of North America show how its arrival has altered the food chain of those lakes, depriving it of energy and nutrients which support small plants and animals which in turn serve as a food base for young fish.  The entire fish stock of these lakes has been placed in jeopardy and there is a real possibility that the same could happen in Lough Derg and any lake or waterway invaded by the pest.</P>
      <P>The zebra mussel can also block pipes, including outflow pipes, and cause severe damage to water systems.  Boats moored on Lough Derg, if not carefully monitored, can suffer engine damage due to the encrustation of these mussels, something which I believe has already happened. A boat moving from Lough Derg can, unless carefully cleaned, bring the pest elsewhere.  I know advice is being given to boat owners, etc., but more careful monitoring and action is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fisheries research centre has told me that the level of zebra mussel growth in Lough Derg is intense.  Only recently the mussel turned up in Lough Key, suggesting its ability to travel is quite considerable.  A small amount of weed on the bottom of a boat can contain the larvae of many thousands of zebra mussels with serious implications <Col N="1049" /> for our fisheries nationwide.  The implications of the unchecked growth of the mussel are very serious.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the problem, and I know the Minister does not either.  The implications are extremely serious for our fishing and tourism industries and for our domestic water supply.  I hope the Minister will tell the House of his plans for dealing with the problem and of the provision of necessary funding to conduct ongoing detailed research into it.  It is not sufficient to rely on what has happened in other countries.  The water systems of the country are potentially unique and the manner in which the mussel is thriving and growing at such a rate is potentially a unique scientific and marine phenomenon.  In this context the problem needs careful and extensive research, which must be carried out rapidly.  The zebra mussel will not go away.  I do not consider, and I am sure the Minister does not consider, it a welcome visitor to the shores of our lakes and waterways.  I look forward to the Minister's response to this urgent matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods) Michael J. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources (Dr. Woods)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important matter and I am pleased to advise the Seanad that I established a scientific steering group last year to investigate and tackle all aspects of the zebra mussel phenomenon.  I was concerned about it when I first learned of it and was anxious that something should be done as a matter of urgency. The group is led by the Marine Institute. Although the zebra mussel was first reported in Ireland in 1997 the Marine Institute informed me that the species was probably introduced during or before 1994.  It is particularly prevalent in Lough Derg and around Limerick city, where it is suspected that it first became established. Scientists believe the mussel was introduced through either boats being brought into the catchment or in ballast water from shipping in Limerick Docks.</P>
      <P>The steering committee has produced a number of informal reports which are helping in the action being taken throughout the country.  It also published a report in February 1998 &mdash; I see the Senator has a copy of it.  The authors of that report are Dan Minchen and Chris Moriarty, who chairs the scientific steering group, two of the leading experts in the field.</P>
      <P>When the presence of the zebra mussel was definitely confirmed I asked the Marine Institute to establish a steering group to develop a co-ordinated strategy involving all relevant agencies and organisations.  From the outset my policy approach to the problem has been that rigorous survey and analysis of constantly updated information on the distribution and impact of the species will enable us to predict the likely progress and effect of the mussel on our ecosystem.  Real time data and analysis will inform management strategies in dealing with the phenomenon.  This is the task which I set the zebra mussel steering group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1050" /> The steering group has already carried out extensive surveys on the distribution of the species. The group, together with experts from University College, Galway, has also been examining the impact to date of the zebra mussel on Irish ecosystems.  All relevant agencies are also working with the zebra mussel steering group, including the central and regional fisheries boards, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and my Department.</P>
    <P>The zebra mussel can foul a wide array of structures, including water supply pipes.  The species has been found attached to lock gates, sluice gates, waterpipes and hulls of vessels.  Obviously their presence is a serious concern to amenity and industry and for local authorities.  The scientists have been able to map the distribution of the mussel in our waterways and monitoring measures are in place.</P>
    <P>I can reassure the House in one sense, namely, that the zebra mussel has been present in the UK and Europe for over 170 years and I am advised that there are no records of serious damage in the UK or continental Europe caused by the species. Based on the European experience, therefore, it is possible that the zebra mussel will cause no fundamental problems in Irish ecosystems.  No serious economic damage caused by the zebra mussel has been reported in this country to date nor has any ecological damage become apparent.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to confirm that the findings of the steering group surveys have already formed the basis of management strategies to deal with the species.  An action plan has been prepared and is being implemented.  This initiative covers information dissemination, monitoring of locations of the zebra mussel and other non-native species, scientific assessment of long-term ecological impact and advice on appropriate control measures.  Information leaflets have been prepared and circulated widely to a targeted readership, including boat owners and fishermen, with the specific focus of controlling the spread of the species.  I appreciate the Senator's point in that regard.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to outline and acknowledge the very valuable work being undertaken by the zebra mussel steering group. My intention is that the steering group will continue to coordinate and drive the analysis and data collection on the spread of the mussel, underpinned by ongoing research and survey work as well as management and control strategies.</P>
    <P>I have tasked the steering group to intensify its work programme during 1998.  This will entail expanded survey work on inland waters while ensuring the focus of research will be on assessment of the potential impact of the species on the Irish ecosystem.  I assure the Senator that the steering group will continue its investigation and assessment of the impact of the species in Lough Derg as part of its intensified work programme. <Col N="1051" /> Other areas are being highlighted because of the analysis being carried out.  It is important to begin the process of rooting it out.  This is very difficult, as Senators will appreciate.  However, there is an action plan and a steering group set up and we will continue to take action in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important matter, a request for assistance by the De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts.  I am sure the Minister knows that Dame Ninette de Valois is a most distinguished Irishwoman from Baltyboys House in Blessington.  She is one of the great figures of twentieth century dance, along with some other Irish people like the late Anton Dolin.  I saw her on television not so long ago.  She will be 100 years old this month, so this is the month to do something for her.  She was wonderfully interesting, but scathing about the Irish.  She said &ldquo;We tried.  I did as much as I could to encourage dance&rdquo;&mdash; she spoke about Joan Denise Moriarty in Cork &mdash;&ldquo;but I am not bothered with them anymore because they will not do anything for us. They do not care.  They are wasting the talent.&rdquo; This is the problem.  We have shown in the past that in this important cultural area we have wasted the talent.  It reminds me a little of the food industry.  We always knew in this country that we had the most wonderful raw material but we did not seem to have the skill to develop it. Thanks to institutions such as Cathal Brugha Street we are now able to do something about this.  It is the same with dancing.  We have a natural talent for dance as was shown in &ldquo;River Dance&rdquo; and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The De Valois Centre has a board which includes distinguished people such as Alan Stanford, actor and theatre director; Joanna Banks, a professional dancer and teacher; Michael Conaghan, alderman of this city; Bernard Ryan, a quantity surveyor and Maeve Clegg, a company secretary.  They moved from Digges Lane in 1995 to a warehouse factory building in the market area of Mary's Abbey, which is a very historic area of Dublin.  The one time warehouse has been transformed into De Valois House with fully equipped studios and office space.  I have been there on a tour and it is absolutely marvellous.  It is charged with excitement, energy and interest, but like many old buildings &mdash; I remember because I was the first person into Temple Bar to develop an old loft &mdash; one of the principal problems is that of fire escapes.  They must provide a fire escape in order to receive proper recognition and be safe to continue their work.  They have a phased budget.  Phase 1 can be completed for £57,200 and phase 2 for £177,200.  These are not enormous sums of money, particularly when put in context.  When Michael D. Higgins became Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht his budget was £10 million.  By the time he left office it was £21 million and it is now £26 million.  There <Col N="1052" /> is some leverage here.  If one looks at the glorious story of the Wexford Opera, which started off in similar circumstances, and the way in which it has grown and blossomed, something should be done for dance.</P>
    <P>Dance was never mentioned in the various Bills that passed through this House and the Lower House.  Now, at least, we have a dance officer in the Arts Council.  But what is the point in having a dance officer if there are no facilities through which dance can be taught, particularly with an important group such as this?  They applied for grants from the Arts Council and were turned down.  There was a further meeting and they were given a grant retrospectively and unconditionally of £10,000.  Then the Arts Council tried to make it conditional on the board stating that at the time the board were fully satisfied with the fire precautions. Of course, they could not do that.  It seemed like a Catch 22 rule to prevent the grant being given.  In other words, they were saying &ldquo;We know you are in dire straits financially, but if you do £200,000's worth of work we will give you £10,000.&rdquo; That is not a businesslike proposition. When one considers that the centre received no proper funding, the matter must be seen in that perspective.</P>
    <P>It is also worth pointing out that they have a good relationship with their landlord.  He is happy to have them there and he has promised them a long-term lease under favourable cheap conditions in order to encourage them.  If a private landlord can do that, surely the State can match such vision and providence?</P>
    <P>I do not have time to list the many activities which take place there.  The following hold rehearsals there: Cois Céim, Irish Modern Dance Theatre, independent choreographer Ms Liz Roche, Diana Richardson's up and coming tap company, Tapestry and large and small theatre companies, such as the Gate, Olympia, Druid, Bickerstaffe, Gaiety, Barabbas &mdash; the company, Royal Court Theatre and Second Age.  The Professional Dancers Association starts its classes in the morning in the De Valois studio and the College of Dance holds its classes upstairs.  Six days a week the Russian Ballet Centre is with them. The weekends are no less hectic with the Dublin Theatre Arts School booked in for the full year each Saturday.  Evening classes of flamenco, ballet, tap, jazz, belly dancing, salsa, African and contemporary dance and drama are also available.</P>
    <P>There is a tremendous bond with the local community. It has continued its association with the Catholic Youth Council based on Arran Quay which holds its evening dance classes there with promising young dancer, Mr. Kevin Murphy, as tutor.  The De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts also has facilities for full-time professional training at the highest level.  The college's two year foundation course provides training for students wishing to pursue careers as professional dancers.  Students are accepted by audition only and undergo comprehensive training <Col N="1053" /> in classical ballet, contemporary dance, jazz, tap, anatomy and vocal studies.  Ms Joanna Banks, a distinguished woman whom I have had the pleasure of meeting, is the principal of the college.  To foster true talent, scholarship places are possible for students unable to meet the fees or obtain funding.  Dance training is not funded by the Department of Education and Science.</P>
    <P>The aims and objectives are to provide and maintain a centre for dance and the performing arts in a fully equipped and permanent premises, supported by experienced professional staff; the centre is to cater for the immediate needs of professional dance and theatre companies and community groups; to make the performing arts in all forms truly accessible to all; to foster theatre and dance and encourage interest and participation by the community with the provision of affordable quality facilities and resources in a convenient location; to make available quality facilities to groups working with small budgets that otherwise would not be in a position to afford quality rehearsal space; to continue to provide an amenity to the local area and community and to foster training of excellence in Ireland for the professional performers of the future.</P>
    <P>The centre wants funding because there is such a huge demand for studio space and the situation has greatly worsened with the demolition of Digges Lane and the Multi Media Centre.  It must make the premises safe in its own interests as well as the interests of everyone else.  It is in the heart of the harp project and provides an enhancement for the entire area.  It has security of tenure and a benevolent landlord.  The premises has a wonderful Bohemian quality which one gets in the lofts of New York and around Temple Bar.  The activities bring life into that part of the city.  Many people who go there would not have any other reason for so doing.  We should do our best to value this wonderful work.</P>
    <P>The total number of courses is 27 and studio hours per week are 132 hours and 25 minutes. Some 25 people are sustained by the centre with this as their main income, while it is a source of additional income for 73 others.  The number of students is 663.  This is a considerable venture which has existed without central funding.  I hope the Minister will be able to indicate that some degree of funding will be made available or that the centre is pointed in the right direction so it can get funding.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would agree that it would be a tragedy if the talent of the raw material of wonderful young people and their innate capacity to dance was extinguished for the want of a mere few thousand pounds when we have an expanding economy and more money in the arts than ever before.  I recognise that the great institutions, such as the Abbey Theatre, Gate Theatre and the Dublin Grand Opera Society, get massive funding, but there should be some crumbs from the table of the feast of arts to give a small amount to such a wonderful group. In the centenary year of one of our most distinguished <Col N="1054" /> citizens, it would be a fitting tribute if we were able to indicate that there would be some movement in this area.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist seo a thógáil.  Ba mhaith liom freisin an deis seo a ghlacadh le chomhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Dame de Valois as ucht 100 bliain a shlánú.  Go maire sí a nuacht.</P>
      <P>This motion refers to the De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts, named after the world renowned Irish born ballerina, Dame Ninette de Valois.  Dame de Valois will celebrate her 100th birthday on 6 June and I would like to avail of this public occasion to extend the warmest congratulations on behalf of the Government and the people on this special event.</P>
      <P>From her debut as a principal dancer in 1914 until her retirement in 1961, Dame de Valois travelled the world performing in many of its great theatres.  In the early part of her career she worked with some of the great figures of 20th century culture, people like herself who had a vision and transformed the arts completely in a period of the most extraordinary creativity and innovation.</P>
      <P>The Senator will be aware that the body charged with the promotion and funding of the arts in this country is An Chomhairle Ealaíon or the Arts Council.  My role and that of my Department is the formulation of policy and the provision of funding through the cultural development incentives scheme for the development of capital arts and culture projects throughout the country.  The CDIS, or cultural development incentives scheme, which is financed through a combination of Exchequer and Structural Funding under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, was designed to assist the four main categories of the visual and performing arts &mdash; arts centres, museums, theatres and galleries.</P>
      <P>No application has ever been submitted to my Department for funding in respect of the De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts under the cultural development incentives scheme.  If the centre's management is considering submitting an application at this stage, I will not be in a position to give it consideration for some time as funding, which was available under the CDIS, has been fully allocated to a total of 39 projects around the country.  I will be seeking to secure further funding for the development of additional capital arts and cultural projects in the period post-1999, but the level of funding that will be available to me for such projects will not be known for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said earlier, the Arts Council is the body charged with the promotion and funding of the arts.  I am sure the Senator understands that the Arts Council is independent of the Department in terms of its day to day operation.  I understand that the council provided funding in 1996 to allow <Col N="1055" /> the De Valois Centre for Dance and the Performing Arts to secure a portable floor, mirrors and other material, such as sound equipment, to allow it to begin operating in its current premises. The Arts Council is autonomous of my Department but I suggest that, if the centre requires funding for a specific project at this stage, an application should be made to the council which can be adjudicated on by the council in the normal way.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the Arts Council that it decided at its March meeting to allocate a sum of £1 million over a period of five years for the development of a state of the art dance building in Dublin.  I understand that discussions are ongoing with Dublin Corporation about a site and a funding package to enable this project to become a reality in, I hope, 2001.  Given the Senator's interest in the area of dance, I know this is a project he will welcome and support.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Seanadóir as ucht an cheist seo a thógáil.  Tá spéis faoi leith ag an Aire, an Teachta de Valera, i gceist an damhsa mar atá tógtha ag an Seanadóir agus is féidir leis bheith cinnte go mbeidh tacaíocht go ginearálta le fáil le haghaidh damhsa an fad a mbeidh sí ina hAire.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom cúpla focal a rá.  I am grateful to the Minister, particularly for his wonderful introduction about Dame Ninette de Valois, but I am bitterly disappointed we did not get anything.  I am aware of the funding for the dance centre by 2001 but that is three years away. The life of a dancer is terribly short and, in the meantime, there will be nothing.  I am also aware of the Arts Council.  I dealt with some of the people involved in it because I was involved in Temple Bar long before any of them heard of it. They made similar mistakes in Temple Bar where, instead of growing organically the good things which were there in the arts, they insisted on their own grandiose schemes.  I know the Arts Council is independent but I hope a copy of this debate will be sent to it and that a word will be dropped in the right place.  We cannot celebrate the centenary of Dame Ninette de Valois simply with rhetoric, however wonderful and justified, and allow this marvellous artistic endeavour to stifle on the basis of the old proverb which the Minister and I know well, live horse and you will get grass.</P>
