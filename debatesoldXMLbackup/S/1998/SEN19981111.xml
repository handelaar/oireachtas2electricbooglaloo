      <P>I have notice from Senator Ridge that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes or raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the issue of the non-availability of health insurance coverage for non-medical card holders for psychological services.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator O'Meara of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to institute a ban on detergents containing phosphates in the catchment area of the River Shannon, which are causing massive deterioration in water quality in Lough Derg due to phosphate run-off from phosphates contained in household detergents.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Henry of the following matter:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and <Col N="2" /> Children to take note of the report of the National Rehabilitation Board research department on respite care facilities and the paucity of these facilities.</P>
    <P>I have also received notice from Senator Gallagher of the following matter:</P>
    <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to address the funding crisis in the health services which is leading to widespread closures of hospital wards.</P>
    <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment.  I have selected the matters raised by Senator Ridge and Senator O'Meara and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.  Senator Henry and Senator Gallagher may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</P>

      <P>I have notice of a matter of concern from Senator Caffrey under Standing Order 30.  It will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="3" /> The deteriorating economic situation in parts of the west and north west of Ireland, especially in County Mayo, and the need to bring industry into these disadvantaged areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is items 1 and 12, motion 29.  Item 1, Second Stage to be taken today with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes. Members may share time.  Item 12, motion 29, to be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. and item 1 to resume thereafter if not already concluded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed. I draw the attention of the House to the great symbolic importance of what is happening today at Messines where the President of Ireland, the Queen of the England and the King of the Belgians are standing together to honour the memory of 50,000 Irishmen who died in the Great War.  It is important that this House stand symbolically with the President in memory of those Irish people who have, to great extent, been airbrushed out of Irish history.  Will the Leader make an hour available tomorrow for statements on this subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I return to the question of the Shannon River Council Bill and propose an alternative approach.  The Government is not prepared to bring forward this legislation but there are strongly held views on the matter on both sides of the House.  The Leader has a progress report on the question in his possession. Will he consider putting that report down as an item for discussion in conjunction with the recent report on phosphates in the Shannon and a further report on pollution which was published last week?  These are matters of concern to all Members and would provide material for a full discussion prior to the introduction of legislation.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that the Shannon River Council Bill is brought forward and I know that Members on both sides are equally determined.  The Minister has fobbed off his party and I do not understand why the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party do not take control of this matter and pass a motion calling for the introduction of the Bill.  This would save the repeated embarrassment which is in no one's interest.  Senators on the Government side are just as concerned about the Shannon as I and they should express that concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning that the House should acknowledge the commemoration that is taking place at this time in Messines and honour the 50,000 from both sides of Ireland who died in the First World War. Many of those fought, not for king and country <Col N="4" /> but for the freedom of small nations, as did many who took part in the Easter Rising of 1916.  It is important, in the spirit of reconciliation, that both traditions are honoured and the memory of those who fought courageously and the many who died are respected and honoured appropriately.</P>
      <P>Yesterday in Dáil Éireann the Taoiseach seemed to go back on the agreed policy of giving extra powers to the Committee of Public Accounts to investigate the AIB offshore accounts and did not suggest an alternative legislative approach.  Will the Leader clarify the matter for the Seanad in view of the wide ranging debate we held on this issue last week?  What is the Government's current position?  During last week's debate Senators spoke about the need for urgency and effective action in relation to offshore accounts.</P>
      <P>Last week my colleague, Senator Gallagher, asked for a debate on the health services.  Can the Leader indicate when it might take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cathaoirleach and other Members will agree that it is most important, on this the eleventh day of the eleventh month, to formally commemorate the 80th anniversary of the ending of the Great War.  In doing so we should remember the 50,000 Irish people who perished in the unimaginable slaughter.  I agree with Senator Manning's suggestion of allocating a short time tomorrow to remember these events.</P>
      <P>For too long an essential and important part of our history has been forgotten and, to use Senator Manning's phrase, airbrushed from history.  That is wrong.  It is particularly unfortunate that many of the survivors and their families did not live long enough to receive the recognition they deserved.  For a long time they were forced to commemorate the war in silence. I am from a garrison town and many of the town's inhabitants served in the First World War.  The war was commemorated in the town during the history of this State by parades to various churches.  At some stage, however, these commemorations were deemed undesirable. These people should be remembered, not forgotten.</P>
      <P>We should also express our solidarity with the President.  It is a mark of our maturity as a sovereign nation that the President can stand beside Queen Elizabeth at Messines this afternoon and commemorate the Irish dead.  The only unfortunate aspect is that the Irish Army band was not at the Menin Gate at Ypres last evening.  The end of the war has been commemorated there every evening for the past 70 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Senator O'Toole, I would welcome a debate on the Shannon.  However, it would be desirable to broaden its scope.  Other waterways, including some of the great western lakes, are seriously polluted and it would be useful to <Col N="5" /> discuss the issue in its broadest context and not confine it to the Shannon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endorse the initiative proposed by Senator Manning.  Indeed, I would go further and propose that at the conclusion of today's business Members of the Seanad should stand.  It is coincidental that the events taking place in Messines Ridge are happening as we speak.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning spoke about the soldiers being airbrushed out of history.  There is even greater symbolism in the President's presence on Messines Ridge.  One of the sad aspects of the last 80 years is how the Northern Unionists, a minority on this island, monopolised the memory of the bravery of all Irish soldiers.  Today, the South has reclaimed the gallantry and heroism of that time&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning sought a debate on this matter.  That request might be granted and I am reluctant to allow the debate to be pre-empted on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made a specific proposal relating to today's business.  I hope the Leader will give it serious consideration.  I apologise for the short notice but I assumed there would be some type of commemorative procedure in the House today.  In its absence there should be at least a symbolic stand in memory of the Irish people, from North and South, who died.</P>
      <P>Laurence Binyon's lines are appropriate:</P>
      <P>They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:</P>
      <P>Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.</P>
      <P>At the going down of the sun and in the morning</P>
      <P>We will remember them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier this year the Seanad discussed the 1996 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals and the Minister promised that the subsequent report would be published more rapidly.  The Leader, with his usual efficiency, has ensured that the report was published this week. Therefore, I ask if we could debate the 1997 report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals in Government time as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Senators in mentioning Armistice Day.  It is appropriate that it is given albeit belated recognition.  I compliment those Irish tradesmen from the midlands who provided the wonderful stone monuments.  One of them, John Reynolds, who is known well to us, has been a stonemason in the Athlone/Roscommon area for the past number of years and has worked for the local authorities <Col N="6" /> there.  I understand that this monument is a credit to the craftsmanship of those people.</P>
      <P>With regard to what Senator Henry said, I have long supported the call for debates on mental health and I have been consistent in that, whether my party was in Government.  It is with alarm that I read today that the Eastern Health Board is paying close to £1 million for private rented accommodation for 25 patients.  This is extraordinary.  The debate on mental health needs to be broadened and I would ask the Leader to do that.  To pay £1 million these days when there are conflicts in health boards about funding, against a backdrop of closing almost 2,000 beds in the service, does not make sense.  It is time questions were asked.  A debate here on mental health, mental treatment, the facilities being provided and expenditure is long overdue.</P>
      <P>Today, for the first time in a long time, there was a request for a statement under Standing Order 30.  I may have been the last person to table such a question.  I tabled five such questions about two years ago.  My understanding of that particular Standing Order was that one would receive a written reply some time later.  Almost two years have elapsed and I still have not received a written reply.  The reason that Standing Order is not being used is that it is not being responded to by the Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Finneran for raising that matter.  There will be a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges this afternoon where we will discuss that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  As regards the other business, the extended use of that Standing Order could be helpful in this House because it would shorten the Order of Business if there was a rapid response from Ministers.  The Leader should make arrangements with Departments to facilitate this.  I welcome the involvement of the committee in that matter and I look forward to hearing its deliberations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come before the House to explain why he has persistently refused to move a supplementary budget for the Western Health Board considering the grave needs in Galway Regional Hospital, where 45 nurses have been let go, beds are not in use and wards have been closed?  The Minister has refused persistently to move a simple £1 million supplementary budget.  In fact, he has stated that he is not allowed to do so.  I ask that he come before the House and explain why he is not and if he would give due consideration to the patients who are being left in corridors and who cannot be admitted to the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of Senators Manning, Mooney and <Col N="7" /> Finneran and others who have spoken on a matter raised by Senator Manning.</P>
      <P>In relation to the psychiatric services, it is some years since planning for the future in the psychiatric services was introduced as a policy and it has been continued by successive Governments.  This House should debate that particular aspect of the service provided to people with psychiatric illnesses.  Perhaps it would be opportune now for this House to invite the Minister to attend a debate on this matter.</P>
      <P>Since I came into this House numerous Senators have called for action on St. Ita's in Portrane.  It would be remiss of me and Members of this House not to offer warm congratulations to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, for the huge allocation of money to St. Ita's, Portrane.  I also congratulate the staff who have provided a great service under adverse conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaddyBurke" hpid="Mr. Burke Mr. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Coogan's call for the Minister for Health and Children to come into this House to discuss the funding of health boards as a matter of priority.  Senator Coogan referred to the Western Health Board.  However, it is not only Galway but the whole western region which is deprived of medical facilities.  It is outrageous that the Minister is ignoring this issue. I ask the Leader to request the Minister to come into this House as a matter of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Senator should draft his own legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange a debate in the House on the drugs culture in rural Ireland.  Because of the increased allocation of funding to larger urban areas, a number of drug dealers are moving to smaller urban and rural areas.  A debate would allow us to exchange ideas on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to comment on the ongoing Fruit of the Loom saga.  It appears there are a number of inconsistencies in the statements made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment about job losses.  Last night's television programme highlighted the fact that she briefed the Minister for Tourism, Sport and Recreation and Deputy Keaveney about this matter; however, she did not include Senator McGowan or Senator Bonner.</P>
      <P>The Government announced to much fanfare the £30 per ewe scheme to reduce the number of sheep grazing on our mountains.  However, that scheme has run into trouble in Brussels.  Perhaps the Leader could comment on how we can alleviate the hardship suffered by sheep farmers and reduce sheep numbers.</P>
      <P>I ask the Leader to comment on the inadequate Government response to the rail safety report which seriously compromises passenger safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this session began I have asked for an urgent debate on foreign affairs issues.  We have seen in recent weeks the biggest natural disaster ever.  The problems which will be endured by the people of Honduras and Nicaragua must be faced up to by the western world.  I would like Fruit of the Loom to make a huge contribution towards alleviating the poverty in that area because it and other manufacturers employed approximately 80,000 of these people as low paid workers.  Some of them are dead but others have nowhere to live.</P>
      <P>I also ask for a debate on a war which might erupt in Iraq and which will be of no benefit to anyone.  There is no point blaming one side or the other for the fact the people of Iraq are dying as both are to blame.  Children are so malnourished, they have no immune system and they get every disease possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House should debate this matter and it should ask President Clinton and the Security Council to try to resolve the problems in Iraq in a peaceful manner.  If a peaceful solution is not found, the people of Iraq and neighbouring Jordan will suffer.  Oil wells are the only targets in Iraq that the US can bomb and if it bombs them, the price of oil might rise which would be of benefit to the western world but it would not benefit the people in the region.  I request an urgent debate on this matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the shortage of speech therapists throughout the country, particularly in the North-Eastern Health Board region?  Will he inform the Minister that a child aged three with a serious speech impediment whose parents hold a medical card is obliged to wait 20 months to see a speech therapist?  That is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with congratulations to the President for her initiative in unveiling the monument to the war dead.  In the spirit which prevails after the British-Irish Agreement and in light of the Duke of Edinburgh's visit and a possible visit by Her Majesty the Queen, will the Leader convey to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that perhaps the time is right for Ireland to receive an apology from the Government of the United Kingdom for that country's treatment of the Irish people during the Famine?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need the Senator's assistance, I am happy to be guided by the Leader.  Many of the issues raised on the Order of Business could be dealt with under a parliamentary question system.  Perhaps it is time to reconsider the introduction of such a system.</P>
      <P>I support other Members' comments about the President's representation of the country today which is very important.  I congratulate the media on the sensitive way it has portrayed personal and public issues relating to the Great War.</P>
      <P>Would it be possible to again request that the House engage in a reasoned discussion about the British nuclear industry and its proposals to expand its operations on the west coast of the UK?  Last week I outlined the format I wish the Leader to consider for such a debate so that there could be a proper two-way discussion of the issues.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader make time available to debate the Government's undermining of Partnership 2000?  It is time that matter was debated.  Many important issues are being discussed by committees of the Houses.  However, we must ensure that this Chamber continues to be seen to be a relevant forum where the most important issues are debated, not passed on to committees however effective they may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with tributes to the men who died in the First World War.  Many years ago a monument known as the &ldquo;war memorial&rdquo; was built in my hometown in County Sligo and people paraded to it each year. I am glad that President McAleese is representing Ireland in Belgium today.  It is obvious that, regardless of what is stated in the media, she is intent on building bridges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Leader convey to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; who, in turn, should convey it to the Garda <Col N="10" /> Commissioner &mdash; the fact it emerged in the High Court yesterday that a family was recently taken into custody, held in a cell for a long period and that one of the children present was not permitted to visit the bathroom but was obliged to urinate in a corner of the cell?  It is unthinkable that this should happen in a civilised society.  If one heard of it happening in Saudi Arabia, one might not be surprised.</P>
    <P>I heard on the radio of four doctors coming out of a club in this city who were held for questioning.  No charges were pressed but they were treated in an inhumane way.  No one should be treated like that in any part of the world.  I ask that this is brought to the attention of the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána to ensure we never hear of anything like it happening in Ireland again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the request made in the last session for a debate on health issues.  No Minister should hide behind legislation which does not prevent the introduction of a Supplementary Estimate to the Dáil for consideration.  Even if legislation was needed, it should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  If emergency legislation can be introduced at a day's notice to save Larry Goodman, it can be introduced on an emergency basis to save our hospitals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment to come into the House to discuss regionalisation and regional development. I also take this opportunity to express my concern for the workers in Fruit of the Loom.  I did not have to be briefed as I was one of those selected to go to the headquarters of the company.  We saw the danger signs four years ago.  Because there is litigation pending against Bill Farrelly and other directors of Fruit of the Loom in America, it would not be wise for me to continue to discuss the serious problems in the company. Over the last few years, however, we have been told by the IDA and other agencies that we are not too badly off, we have Fruit of the Loom.  It does not look as if Fruit of the Loom will provide jobs in the future so I would welcome the Minister to the House for a debate on regionalisation.  There are some in this House who shed crocodile tears when this debate is mentioned.  They have two policies &mdash; one for the rural areas and one for Dublin and other urban areas, depending on where they are from.</P>

      <P>Senators Manning, Costello, Dardis, Mooney, Finneran, Glynn, Haughey and Avril Doyle requested that we set aside a short period for statements on the Great War.  I have given this serious consideration and will allocate time for it on the Order of Business tomorrow morning.  I thank all the Senators for their <Col N="11" /> contributions.

      <P>Senators Costello, O'Toole and Dardis all expressed concerned about various forms of pollution.

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob) Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road Bill is about raising standards generally in all matters concerning the transport of dangerous goods internationally by Irish carriers and on Irish roads.  I have no doubt the House will agree that it is imperative that we reach and maintain the highest standards in this area.  The unprecedented economic growth we have achieved over the past number of years has inevitably led to a significant increase in road freight movements.  Needless to say, there has also been an increase in road movements of dangerous substances with, of course, movements involving petroleum tankers comprising the vast bulk of such dangerous goods.  It is incumbent upon us, therefore, to have in place the best possible rules for transport of dangerous goods and have a framework for ensuring that the most recent rules can be implemented without delay.</P>
      <P>It is not sufficient however, to have the highest standards in place.  We must also work to ensure that those involved have proper and adequate training and that there is adequate enforcement. I will touch on both of these topics later.</P>
      <P>I would like at this point to explain the main aspects of the Bill.  The primary aim of the Bill is to put in place enabling powers for the making of regulations which will first, allow Ireland to accede to the European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road known as the ADR; second, bring into Irish law the European Union Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road; and third, bring into Irish law the European Union Directive 95/50/EC on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road &mdash; the ADR &mdash; was drawn up in Geneva in 1957 and came into force in 1968.  There are 33 signatories to the ADR and Ireland is the only member state of the European Union that is not a contracting party.  The agreement contains two detailed technical annexes that set out the circumstances under which dangerous goods may be transported by road across international frontiers.  It is an international agreement and deals only with international transport of <Col N="13" /> dangerous goods by road.  In practice Irish carriers who transport dangerous goods internationally comply with the detailed provisions of the ADR at present.  Therefore, accession to the ADR will not result in significant changes in practice for these operators.  It will, however, make compliance simpler by providing the necessary type approval and vehicle certification facilities here in Ireland.  It is time, nevertheless, that we acceded to this agreement which will put Irish haulage concerns on an equal footing with hauliers from other contracting parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill is largely enabling and will result in the making of one comprehensive and detailed set of regulations.  The technical details associated with the carriage of dangerous goods by road are complex and are necessarily updated on a regular basis.  I believe it is more appropriate in the circumstances that the detailed rules relating to the carriage of dangerous goods be set down in regulations.  These regulations when taken together with the annexes to the ADR will be a vital reference point for all involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road.  Consignors, consignees, transport operators and drivers will have available to them clear instructions as to the requirements and their statutory responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I would like now to describe in more detail each of the three principal elements with which this Bill deals.  The first element is the European agreement concerning the international carriage of goods by road.  The agreement itself is quite short and relatively simple.  It consists of 17 articles that define the scope and method of operation of the agreement.  Article 1 defines the terms used in the agreement.  A key article is article 2 which effectively paves the way for the carriage of dangerous goods by road between the territories of the contracting parties.</P>
    <P>Article 3 states that annexes A and B to the agreement form an integral part thereof.  Annex A specifies the dangerous goods that are permitted to be carried internationally by road and the conditions to be complied with in such carriage, including packaging and labelling requirements.  It also specifies goods that are prohibited from such carriage.  Annex B specifies conditions as regards the construction, use, testing and approval of transport equipment intended for use in the carriage of dangerous goods by road and the training and certification of drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>Article 4 allows contracting parties to regulate or prohibit, for reasons other than safety during carriage, the entry of dangerous goods into their territory.  It also provides for circumstances where contracting parties, by virtue of bilateral or multilateral agreements with other contracting parties, can allow the carriage of certain prohibited dangerous goods under special conditions.</P>
    <P>Article 5 provides transport operations under <Col N="14" /> this agreement remain subject to national and international regulations applicable in general to road traffic, international road transport and international trade.</P>
    <P>Articles 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the ADR are housekeeping articles related to such matters as accession, the effective date of the agreement, ceasing to become a contracting party and territories of contracting parties.</P>
    <P>Articles 11 and 12 are concerned with the procedure for settlement of a dispute between two or more contracting parties concerning the interpretation or application of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 13 deals with the procedure for reviewing the text of the agreement itself while Article 14 is concerned with the procedure for the amendment of the annexes to this agreement. Articles 15, 16 and 17 deal with the protocols of signature and ratification of the agreement.  The real substance of the ADR is contained in the annexes to which I referred earlier.  The annexes specify the technical requirements that must be met when transporting dangerous goods internationally by road.  Annex A to the agreement lists the dangerous goods that may be carried and deals with the classification of those goods, packaging, labelling and documentary requirements.  These issues are of concern to the consignor of the load.  Annex B deals with the vehicle and tank construction requirements and the rules for operation that are the responsibility of the carrier, the operator and the driver of the vehicle.</P>
    <P>The system of classification of dangerous goods under ADR is drawn from the recommendations on the transport of dangerous goods, drawn up by the United Nations Economic and Social Council's committee of experts.  This system is designed to apply worldwide to all transport modes.  Dangerous goods are divided into nine different classes according to the main type of danger they could present in transport, for example, explosion or toxicity.  Annex A classifies dangerous goods as follows: class 1, explosive substances and articles; class 2, gases; class 3, flammable liquids; class 4, flammable solids, substances liable to spontaneous combustion and substances that, in contact with water, emit flammable gases; class 5, oxidising substances and organic peroxides; class 6, toxic and infectious substances; class 7, radioactive material; class 8, corrosive substances and class 9, miscellaneous dangerous substances and articles.  The technical annexes lay down detailed and comprehensive requirements for each of the nine classes of dangerous goods.</P>
    <P>The movement of dangerous goods is in some special cases exempt from the rules of the ADR, for example, where the goods are being carried by a private individual for their own use, inside machines for their operational function, in limited quantities by an enterprise in support of its main activity, such as deliveries by a construction firm <Col N="15" /> to a building site, and in emergency service or recovery vehicles.</P>
    <P>If part of an ADR journey comes under other international rules such as the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code for a sea crossing, or the ICAO technical instructions for air transport, those rules additionally apply and replace the equivalent ADR rules for that part of the journey.  This is particularly relevant for multi-modal operations.  If an ADR journey precedes and follows carriage by sea or air, the goods shall be accepted for carriage under ADR even if the packages and containers are labelled in accordance with the sea or air mode rather than with the ADR.</P>
    <P>The second instrument for which the Bill makes provision is the European Directive 94/55/EC of 21 November 1994 on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road.  The purpose of this directive is to apply the detailed and comprehensive rules contained in the annexes to the ADR to national transport of dangerous goods by road.  Thus, all transport of dangerous goods entering the State, leaving the State for an international destination or on a journey from point A to point B within the State is comprehended by these rules.  The stringent international rules for the transport of dangerous goods between countries will apply to domestic transport of dangerous goods under the new regime.  This directive was introduced in the interest of safety, uniformity and free trading across the European Union.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the fact that the ADR as an international agreement cannot always be adapted to national transport conditions and requirements, the directive contains a number of articles that provide for the granting of derogations from the full requirements of the ADr. The derogation facility in the directive has been availed of by Ireland in a number of instances where local conditions merited such.  It must be stressed, however, that these derogations apply only to domestic transport and not international journeys. These derogations were sought in order to ensure, as far as possible, that the economic impact on the sector would not be excessive, but do not in any way compromise safety.</P>
    <P>Other derogations negotiated include reference temperatures that determine the shell thicknesses of LPG tanks suited to our climatic conditions have been accepted &mdash; thicker shells are required in hotter regions of southern Europe &mdash; and a derogation relating to the transport of explosives that allows for the continued security arrangements associated with such transport. Ireland has also negotiated derogations to cover the transport of ammonium nitrate fertiliser, dispensing gases carried on the same vehicle as beverages, transport of low level radioactive material to hospitals and transport of clinical waste.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="16" /> The final element of the package concerns Directive 95/50/EC on uniform procedures and levels of enforcement relating to the checking of compliance with Directive 94/55/EC.  The main purpose of Directive 95/50/EC is to ensure that member states carry out checks on a representative number of dangerous goods journeys in the State.  First, the directive aims to harmonise the quality of checks across the member states.  For example, checks must ascertain if the correct documentation is carried in the vehicle, if the goods transported are permitted under the regulations and, if so, that they are transported in the correct containers or packages, that the equipment is in proper working order and is free from leaks or faults. Second, the directive has a quantitative element in that it requires that a representative proportion of consignments of dangerous goods transported by road be subject to checks.</P>
    <P>I assure Senators that the legislation being enacted does not mean the carriage of dangerous goods by road in Ireland at present does not meet high standards.  A range of statutory instruments made by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment pursuant to the Dangerous Substance Acts, 1972 and 1979, already cover the conveyance of all dangerous substances with the exception of class 1 &mdash; explosives and class 7 &mdash; radioactive material.  These regulations are administered and enforced by the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health.  The carriage of explosives is covered under by-laws and rules made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the Explosives Act, 1875, and are administered and enforced by the explosives inspectorate of that Department. The transport of radioactive materials is covered by an order made by the Minister for Public Enterprise under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, and administered and enforced by the inspectorate of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The Government has sanctioned the recruitment of four additional inspectors by the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, each of whom will be devoted to this work.  These inspectors will be fully qualified and properly trained for the task, and will maintain the highest professional standards, as do inspectors currently employed in this area.  I am sure Senators will agree that adequate consideration has been given to the vital task of enforcement in this specialised area.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased to confirm that training and certification of drivers of vehicles carrying dangerous goods have been in place in Ireland since 1992.  Further, by virtue of a statutory instrument introduced in 1997, the more rigorous requirements of the ADR specification for driver training are in place.  A number of people providing driver training courses have been approved by the Health and Safety Authority and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Under the regulations, my Department <Col N="17" /> arranges for the examination of drivers as soon as possible after they have completed the course. The examination consists of a written and oral test set by the Health and Safety Authority. Approximately 5,000 Irish drivers have the necessary certificate at this stage, which has ensured the uninterrupted transport of dangerous goods by road.</P>
    <P>I wish to highlight certain provisions in the Bill. Under section 17 the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is empowered to make regulations from time to time for the purpose of specifying the requirements concerning the carriage of dangerous goods by road as they evolve. The Bill proposes that the Minister would make the necessary regulations while the Minister promoting the Bill would be the Minister for Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>The ADR was drawn up in 1957 and came into force in 1968.  In the absence of steps to ratify the ADR elsewhere, the drafting of the necessary legislation was carried out by the old Department of Transport as accession to the ADR would have been of assistance to Irish hauliers engaged in international haulage of dangerous goods by road. In endeavouring to bring forward the necessary legislation and have the ADR ratified in Ireland, my Department always intended to transfer responsibility back to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment where responsibility properly lies.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has overall responsibility for the Health and Safety Authority which will be the principal enforcement body and which will also enforce regulations for the handling and storing of dangerous goods generally.  It is thought that it would be confusing for the public and industry if responsibility for the handling and storing of dangerous goods lay with one Minister while responsibility for their transport lay with another.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has for some time been initiating and enforcing legislation for the transport of dangerous goods by road.  This legislation takes the form of regulations made under the Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979.</P>
    <P>I am happy to say that considerable work has already been done on the necessary regulations, which the Minister is enabled to make pursuant to section 17 of the Bill.  Preparation of the regulations is proceeding apace through the work of an interdepartmental committee that has representatives from a number of Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>The bodies represented on this committee are the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Public Enterprise, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and the National Standards Authority of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The regulations have the very important value <Col N="18" /> of bringing all the elements associated with the carriage of dangerous goods by road together in one document or set of statutory regulations. These regulations when read in conjunction with the annexes to the ADR will be invaluable to industry, haulage concerns and drivers alike.  For the first time it will bring together in one place the laws and technical requirements necessary to inform persons engaged in the transport of all dangerous substances including explosives and radioactive materials.</P>
    <P>A significant element of the legislative framework is the need to ensure that comprehensive and representative numbers of checks are carried out and that breaches are dealt with in a non-discriminatory fashion that is prompted by the requirements of Directive 95/50/EC of 6 October 1995 on uniform procedures for checks on the transport of dangerous goods by road.  Accordingly, it is necessary to provide for adequate sanction against both national and international hauliers. The Bill breaks new ground to the extent that there is an effort to put in place measures that would bring out of State carriers to book if the requirements of ADR are ignored or flouted while carrying dangerous goods within the State.</P>
    <P>It is my firm opinion that the combined effect of sections 9 and 18 of the Bill is an appropriate response and meets fully our obligations under the directive.  Apart from that, particularly in the matter of carriage of dangerous goods by road, there is a need for us legislators to face up to the fact that there is an urgent need to make out of state carriers amenable to the law when operating in the State.  This has been achieved in this Bill for matters relating to the carriage of dangerous goods by road.  This will give a clear signal that strict adherence to the law is necessary by all those involved in such carriage be they from within or outside the State.</P>
    <P>Section 9 is designed to ensure breaches of the Act or regulations made thereunder can be prosecuted against out of state carriers in the course of a journey carrying dangerous goods within the State.  This is achieved by arresting any driver whom a garda has reason to believe is committing or has committed an offence and in the opinion of the garda has not given a satisfactory address for service of summons.</P>
    <P>The Bill defines what constitutes a satisfactory address as an address at which the person will be for a sufficient length of time for it to be possible to serve that person with a summons or an address of some other specified person who will accept a summons on the first person's behalf.  In such cases the address of a firm of solicitors in the State which undertakes to accept summons on behalf of the driver will satisfy this provision. The section is similar to a provision in the United Kingdom Police and Criminal Evidence Act, 1984, that is used extensively by UK police authorities to deal with out of state hauliers in breach of road traffic and road transport legislation in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="19" /> In the case of a driver of a vehicle being arrested under this section the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, as amended by section 3 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1997, come into effect.  The procedure is as follows: the arrested driver is brought to the nearest Garda station; he is brought as soon as practicable before the District Court district in which the person has been arrested or he is released on bail to appear at the next appropriate sitting of the District Court; bail can be set by the station sergeant in accordance with section 31 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967; bail can be in the form of recognizance or a sum of money, and it is lodged in the relevant District Court to the court clerk; if the driver fails to appear before the court at the appointed time an application can be made under the relevant District Court rule to estreat the recognizance or to forfeit the sum of money.</P>
    <P>Another initiative in this area is the proposal in section 18 to introduce on the spot fines in respect of offences under the regulations made pursuant to section 17 of the Act.  This section is an enabling one and it will be a matter for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to prescribe the class of offences that will be dealt with under this section.</P>
    <P>An inspector, who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person is committing an offence under the regulations may issue a notice to that person stating the following: the person is alleged to have committed the offence, the person may make a payment of £150 without delay to the inspector and a prosecution will not be pursued if the payment is made to the inspector without delay.  This provision is significantly different from the existing on the spot fines as we know them.  The current system is an invitation to pay a certain amount of money within 21 days and if payment is made no prosecution will ensue.  The system proposed here is an invitation to pay a sum of £150 without delay to an enforcing inspector. If the driver refuses to pay and does not have a satisfactory address for service of summons the provisions of section 9 can come into play.  If the driver has a satisfactory address for summons and does not pay the fine he can be prosecuted in the normal way.</P>
    <P>The fine is currently set at £150; however, the Minister may vary this amount by regulations at any time in order to take account of inflation or if it is felt that a fine set at this level is not enough of a deterrent or that the offences being committed demand greater fines.  Flexibility is provided in the Bill as to the currencies and the methods of payment that will be acceptable.</P>
    <P>I hope Senators will agree that the Bill is comprehensive legislation which will enable Ireland to accede to its international obligations in this important area and put in place the necessary rules and systems which will ensure safety in the carriage of dangerous goods on our roads.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>On behalf of my party I welcome the legislation.  I understand that we are the only country of 33 that has not yet introduced this type of legislation, but we are now regularising our position <i>vis-a-vis</i> Europe and that is very important.  As the Minister of State said, one of the big issues is the number of out of state carriers coming through our country.  We must ensure that the regulations apply to them as they do to domestic carriers.</P>
      <P>The transport of dangerous goods by rail is a major issue that we should address, although it is not within the scope of this Bill.  During the debate on this legislation in the Dáil a number of people said we should encourage the transport of dangerous goods by rail instead of by road.  It is quite clear that our present road network is unable to cope with current levels of traffic. Therefore, the transport of dangerous goods by road is an increasing risk given the national gridlock patterns in Dublin and other cities.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the report we will be discussing tomorrow on the state of the rail system, we should have a positive policy of encouraging the transport of dangerous goods by rail.  We should make every effort and provide every incentive to bring that about.</P>
      <P>One of the problems facing the transport of goods at present is the excess speed of many vehicles.  Reading through the Second Stage debate in the Dáil, it is interesting to note that Deputies from Counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth contributed a lot.  I am from County Louth where there is a major problem with carriers coming through Northern Ireland into the South and driving at excessive speeds.  It is significant that 60 per cent of road traffic accidents in County Louth involve drivers from outside the State.  I do not have the statistical breakdown as to whether they are lorries or cars, but there is a major difficulty posed by speeding vehicles, including lorries, coming across the Border into Counties Louth, Cavan and Monaghan.</P>
      <P>The debate in the Dáil reflected the fact, which I want to reflect here also, that our national road network system is very poor.  We are doing well economically but our transport system is very far behind.  I welcome the Bill's provisions to introduce specific training for drivers as well as to have inspectors who will examine whether transport meets the necessary requirements.  This is a positive approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In common with my colleagues, I drive throughout the country looking for votes, among other things, but I have rarely come across a garda stopping lorries to check them.  Such routine investigative activity is very rare.  We need proper transport police who would look at all <Col N="21" /> transport issues, including speeding.  We do not have a sufficient number of gardaí dealing with transport in general and speeding in particular.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I had the privilege of driving in France where every large commercial vehicle must display the maximum speed at which it is allowed to travel.  The figure, displayed on the rear of such vehicles, is clear to everyone.  We do not have that system here, although the capacity of speeding lorries to cause serious injury is so much greater than cars because of their greater size.  We need to increase the policing of lorries carrying dangerous and other goods.  Even simple things such as inadequate rear reflectors can pose a danger.</P>
    <P>While lorry drivers in the South are no angels, I often notice that many lorries from Northern Ireland do not even have number plates.  Senators should look at lorries the next time they are in traffic and they will be surprised by this fact. There is much laxity in our system but the legislation will introduce greater vigilance and accountability from the commercial sector.</P>
    <P>The famous tachograph concerns me.  We have all read about it and have seen it featured in television programmes relating to transport.  What degree of investigation is there into the abuse of the tachograph by lorry drivers?  I believe they are not checked often enough.  We must re-examine the enforcement of legislation relating to the number of hours during which people are legally allowed to drive lorries.</P>
    <P>The reality is that driving a commercial vehicle these days is a business.  Many lorry drivers are self-employed and are under fierce commercial pressure.  Unfortunately, some of them cut corners. We must take a hard look at the pressures on such commercial operators.  We should endeavour to give the upper hand to those who are not cowboys &mdash; and I stress that most of them are not cowboys &mdash; and we can do so by being vigilant and implementing the legislation to make sure we get the best deal for the public.</P>
    <P>Another question that arises is the transport of dangerous goods through urban areas and transport corridors to Dublin, Drogheda and other ports.  We must designate areas through which lorries are not allowed.  A town in County Monaghan, possibly Carrickmacross, does not allow lorries through certain streets of the town although those streets are wide enough.  We must designate areas, particularly in towns, through which transporters of dangerous goods are not permitted.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the legislation is concerned with raising standards.  It must also be concerned with enforcing these high standards and making sure they are adhered to.  The public must be protected from the dangers of the substances which are being transported on our roads.</P>
    <P>I wonder how ready our emergency services are to deal with a traffic accident involving dangerous substances.  I welcome the fact that the <Col N="22" /> Bill includes a cross-reference of the bodies involved in framing this legislation and in its enforcement.  There must be liaison among local authority services, such as the fire service, and they must be provided with the latest technology to ensure they can deal with accidents involving dangerous goods.  Our emergency services receive excellent training for such eventualities but they must be given the necessary equipment even if their local authority cannot afford to provide it.</P>
    <P>Senators will be aware that local authority estimates will be coming up for discussion shortly and every item, including the fire service, will be examined carefully.  The local authority of which I am a member has a policy of voting the funds necessary for whatever is required by the county fire officer.  In this area we must err on the side of generosity.  Our health boards and hospitals have national and regional emergency plans and they must be constantly fine tuned.</P>
    <P>More attention needs to be paid to certain areas of safety but I welcome the Bill and the fact that we are regularising our status in relation to our European partners.  Vigilance is the price of safety and we cannot be vigilant enough.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that out of state hauliers who, for long have thumbed their noses at our authorities, are now being taken on.  It is time to give a clear signal to hauliers who drive through our State showing reckless disregard for our laws that they will be dealt with effectively.</P>
      <P>I agree that the state of our roads gives cause for concern.  Much money has been invested in our roads infrastructure in recent years but they are still not adequate for the level of commercial activity in the country.  This adds to the hazards caused by heavy duty vehicles.</P>
      <P>I was reassured to hear the Minister say that derogations are never applied in a manner which would compromise safety.  However, the question of derogations must be examined more closely.  I wonder why derogations exist at all, even for the domestic traveller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill introduces the legislative framework to enable Ireland to become a contracting party to the ADR, the European agreement on the international carriage of dangerous goods by road.  It gives the framework for bringing into <Col N="23" /> Irish law two important European Union directives; the Minister of State has referred to the details of those directives.</P>
    <P>The Bill is concerned with public safety on our roads.  The manner in which trucks are operated gives great cause for concern.  For example, trucks, both domestic and foreign, travel at excessive speeds.  I am convinced that a systematic survey would show that most truck drivers break the speed limits.  This is particularly hazardous when the trucks concerned are carrying dangerous substances.  We are all aware of the increase in the number of road accidents.  The combination of speed, dangerous driving and the presence of dangerous substances constitutes an enormous danger.  One of the objectives of legislation of this sort must be to ensure that heavy goods vehicles, particularly when they carry dangerous substances, are subject to very strict speed limits which must be rigorously enforced. The enforcement authorities should be visible at all times on all routes used by such vehicles.  This will ensure that the law is complied with and the safety standards to which we aspire are achieved.</P>
    <P>The question of signage has been referred to. In my experience signage on large lorries is inadequate and in some cases completely absent.  It is often not possible for other road users to know of the potential hazards to which they are being subjected and it is important that they are aware of them.  If a vehicle is carrying inflammable, toxic, explosive or other dangerous substances, other road users should be cautioned by the signage on the vehicle.  In the event of an unfortunate accident or if the lorry gets into difficulties, other road users would be cautioned by the signage as to the desirable evasive action they should take. If there is no signage, such evasive action will not be possible.</P>
    <P>Another problem which I have encountered on numerous occasions is the incidence of heavy duty goods vehicles travelling in convoy.  This is becoming a common feature on our roads, as I discovered on my frequent trips to the west and south.  For reasons best known to themselves, lorry drivers appear to enjoy travelling in convoys probably because they do not have to contend with other road users.  Other road users cannot cope when confronted with a convoy of two, three and often four lorries which sometimes travel at speeds in excess of the local speed limit. Such convoys prevent them from passing the lorries, as they would do if they encountered them singly.  This type of practice must be condemned and enforcement of the rules must be rigorous.  I hope the Minister of State will tackle this problem.</P>
    <P>Members have talked about the fruits of the economic boom.  However, we have also seen the negative consequences.  My constituency and neighbouring constituencies in north Dublin have, thankfully, experienced an enormous boom in industrial parks and estates.  From Howth <Col N="24" /> through Coolock, Finglas and Cabra to Blanchardstown, a plethora of industrial estates have developed while existing estates have expanded greatly.  The area forms the hinterland of Dublin Airport and Dublin port.  Consequently, there is a huge increase in commercial heavy duty traffic.</P>
    <P>The traffic traverses densely populated areas. This causes great concern about the potential risks for residents in those communities.  Fear and concern have frequently been expressed about trucks, obviously with signage, carrying dangerous substances to and from the port, the airport and the industrial estates, many of which are the location of chemical industries.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, serious action must be taken to ensure emergency plans are in place.  The need for such plans was mentioned earlier.  They are necessary for rural towns and villages as well as city suburbs.  However, given the density of population in Dublin and its traffic gridlock, the number of heavy goods vehicles on streets adjacent to residential areas poses additional risks of far greater dimension than would normally be the case.  It is extremely important to ensure that emergency services, on both a national and local basis, be in place to deal with a potential catastrophe.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation goes to great lengths to revise its procedures annually.  I was delighted to hear Senator O'Dowd say that the fire officers in his area err on the side of generosity.  I would like to think that is also the case in my area.  No single local authority could have the type of resources each year that would be necessary to deal with a potential catastrophe.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome.  Its objective is to improve the quality and standards of public safety.  It also brings Irish law into line with that of other European jurisdictions within the ADr. However, the quality, effectiveness and success of the legislation and its consequent regulations depend on the standards of policing and enforcement and the quality and calibre of the inspectors.  It also depends on the standard of training for heavy goods vehicle drivers.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said there are more than 5,000 such drivers in Ireland and pointed out that the standards for certification increased during the years from 1992 to 1997.  That is reassuring but there is still public concern about the calibre of some drivers.  Most of them are decent, hardworking, genuine, committed and enthusiastic people but a certain number act in a manner which does not conform to the high standards to which we aspire.  The quality and standards of heavy goods vehicle drivers should be reviewed annually.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the inspectors employed to police the regulations should have a multidisciplinary capacity.  The comprehensive provisions in this legislation will be flouted even under the eye of an individual if he or she does not have a wide range of expertise and the necessary qualifications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnieCaffrey" hpid="Mr. Caffrey Mr. Caffrey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it contributes to road safety and the reduction of the carnage on the roads.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzgerald said the Minister is dealing with the problem expeditiously.  There is a perception that when legislation is introduced to comply with an EU directive it means we are dealing with a problem.  Unfortunately, we are not.  As other Senators have pointed out, the problem is enforcement.  If the Minister of State had said that, in addition to the Bill, the Government would recruit another 1,000 gardaí to enforce the law on the road, he would be dealing with the problem.  There is a plethora of legislation on numerous topics but there is virtually no enforcement of it.</P>
      <P>Some Members drive from rural areas to the Seanad twice a week.  On our journeys we encounter all types of non-compliance with the rules of the road.  It must be said that for every motorist who is caught, there are probably another 50 offenders who are not caught.  That is not good enough.  No legislation will change that unless the level of enforcement is increased.  The Government will have to tackle that problem.</P>
      <P>I live in an area through which the most dangerous known substance was transported safely for 20 years.  Acrylonitrile was transported by Iarnród Éireann without serious incident from Dublin to Killala for 20 years to the Asahi chemical plant, which unfortunately closed down one year ago with the loss of 120 jobs.  There were a few minor incidents but, by and large, there were no serious incidents.  This bears out the argument made by Senator O'Dowd and others that we must concentrate more on transporting dangerous goods by rail.  The line from Ballina, Westport and Athlone is probably used only two or three hours out of 24.  There are railway lines lying idle and unused for 90 per cent of the time while the gridlock on the roads continues to increase every week.</P>
      <P>The economic boom, which is especially significant on the east coast and to which Senator Fitzgerald referred, is contributing to this.  I note his remark that there are many industrial estates on the east coast.  If some of them were located in the west, it would relieve much of the gridlock in Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Caffrey</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a help but it will not solve the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other question about increasing the level of road transportation is the damage it does to the roads.  The infrastructure is not in place to take the increasing volume of traffic on the roads. If one travels from Ballina or Westport to Strokestown or further north, the roads are not capable of even taking two articulated trucks passing simultaneously. One must be careful because the <Col N="26" /> road is so narrow.  That leads to more accidents on the roads.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is drafting amendments to the Bill he may consider this.  It is virtually impossible to pass heavy articulated trucks on a wet day because they spray vapour and water right across the road and even into the fields on the far side of the road and visibility is reduced to a minimum &mdash; in many instances it may be reduced to a few feet.  There should be some mechanism which would prevent this happening on public roads.</P>
    <P>It is virtually impossible to pass two articulated trucks on a very wet day; however, one would possibly have no need to pass them because they would be exceeding the speed limit.  As Senator O'Dowd stated, with regard to the level of compliance, many truck drivers are conscientious and helpful on the road.  Unfortunately, as in every profession there are a few who are not contributing anything to road safety or to improving the standard of driving on the roads.  Those drivers must be brought before the courts.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the fines are increased in the Bill.  If the fines are substantial, we may achieve a level of enforcement which heretofore has not been achieved because the Judiciary can play an important role in this.  I have noticed recently, especially in offences for speeding, that the level of fines has increased substantially.  Disqualification for six months is now the norm.  This is contributing to a reduction in speeding on the roads.  I am sure everyone has noticed that many motorists are not exceeding the speed limits; that is to be commended.</P>
    <P>As I said, the problem is not a lack of legislation but of enforcement.  If the Government cannot recruit more gardaí, there should be a traffic corps to police the roads to reduce the level of tragic and fatal accidents; we are at the higher level of the European table in this regard. This is no recommendation for a country like Ireland.  The Government is making a stab at tackling this problem but until the level of Garda recruits is increased, the existing manpower will not make a significant dent in it.  Only last week when returning from Leinster House I passed an articulated truck which had no rear lights.  As it happened, I had not travelled 200 yards when I reached a Garda checkpoint, he was one of those who got caught.  However, not enough of these drivers are being caught to reduce the level of accidents.</P>
    <P>As I said, the amendment I would like to see to the Bill would provide for the installation of some mechanism on all articulated vehicles to prevent this spray and vapour from spreading over top of passing motors and reducing visibility. That would be a worthwhile amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I could say I agree with everything which has been said by everybody else and sit down but we are not as economical with words in this House that I would do that.  On behalf of my party, I welcome this Bill.  We are incorporating <Col N="27" /> into Irish law two EU directives, one of 1994 and one of 1995.  It is high time we did this.  Particularly in matters of public safety, we should never drag our feet in putting in place the best available and most up to date legislation possible.  In addition, we should provide the best available procedures and manpower to ensure that the legislation is enforced.</P>
      <P>There are two points which I wish to emphasise. As a sophisticated nation of educated people we ought to be sending a high percentage of dangerous goods, which are currently being transported on the roads, by rail.  Maybe the political opportunity to do that is beginning to present itself now, although the railways have undergone a quarter of a century of neglect.  In many cases this was studied, official, active neglect.  I detect in this Government a willingness to redress that situation and to make new and substantial investment in upgrading the railroads.  In that context, a new opportunity now presents itself to advance the case for switching from roads to railways a substantial percentage of the volume of dangerous goods which day after day are carried on the roads.  Our railroads are the proper way to transport these goods.  As Senator Caffrey said, their track record in transporting highly dangerous goods from Asahi to Dublin port was second to none.  That should put paid to any doubts about the suitability of railroads.  This type of traffic should be designated, if at all possible.  to run on railroads.</P>
      <P>Many dangerous substances are taken from their source to another location for disposal.  We should try to minimise that practice.  New industries, particularly those in the pharmaceutical and health care sectors in Cork harbour, generate a certain amount of toxic waste.  The Environmental Protection Agency and our legislation require them to reduce the amount of toxic or dangerous substances at source so that they are not carried from one place to another.  We should work towards disposing of such material on site.  The technology is available to do that.  The Government should try to find ways to at least reduce the volume of dangerous goods on our roads.</P>
      <P>We have talked about the carelessness and casualness of many drivers.  We have been lucky that there have been so few serious accidents as a result of the carriage of dangerous goods. However, we cannot look fortune in the face forever. Despite the fact we spend millions of pounds on our roads, they are less safe than they were 20 years ago.  The number of fatal road accidents is testament to that.  It is critically important that we enact this legislation as quickly as possible and that we police it thoroughly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Liam Fitzgerald said we should have a dedicated core of transport inspectors with a multidisciplinary brief to police this type of law. Should we establish an inspectorate to inspect the contents of vehicles which carry dangerous substances and to assess the roadworthiness of the <Col N="28" /> vehicles as well as the suitability and capability of the drivers?</P>
    <P>A number of vehicles which transport dangerous substances are not up to standard.  They do not have proper lights and it is often difficult to read their licence numbers.  They stay on the road even when there is a hard shoulder and people take their lives in their hands when trying to overtake them.  If an inspectorate is established, it must have a broad brief to ensure that vehicles are of the highest standard.  It is also important that vehicles are checked and monitored at regular intervals.</P>
    <P>Other substances, such as slurry and building materials, may not be dangerous but they are environmentally unacceptable.  Senator O'Dowd spoke about lorries which carry such substances through the streets of our towns.  I have seen lorries filled with slurry and building materials travel through the streets of Cork.  Many of these have liquid dripping from them which leaves a residue on the main street.  That is not acceptable.  It shows contempt for the people who live and trade in our towns and villages.  We should tighten our regulations, regardless of the type of goods being transported.  I hope these matters will be dealt with in the context of this legislation.  I endorse the emphasis put on the importance of enforcing and policing this law.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that bypasses have been built around a number of towns and cities, there is still a huge volume of heavy traffic through our streets.  I attended a meeting of Cork Corporation last Monday night where I asked the city engineer and the city manager to carry out an audit of the heavy container traffic travelling through the city's streets so that when the Lee tunnel is opened, which is the last section of our ring road structure, it will be directed on to the ring road which is fit to take such traffic.  If drivers of heavy vehicles continue to travel through our city streets after ring roads, tunnels and connecting viaducts are built at huge cost, local authorities must devise by-laws to penalise them.</P>
    <P>I support the legislation and I look forward to its speedy enactment.  I hope it will add to the safety of all road users.  I also hope that, in time, more of this type of traffic will be moved to our railroads and that our roads will become more pleasant for road users.</P>

      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire go dtí an Seanad arís.  Molaim é as ucht an iarracht a rinne sé chun a Bhille um Iompar Earraí Contúirteacha de Bhóthar, 1998, a chur ós chomhair Tithe an Oireachtais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important technical Bill.  The explanatory memorandum highlights the fact that the ADR, which is the European agreement on the carriage of dangerous substances, was initiated in Geneva in 1957 and came into force in 1968.  We cannot be accused of rushing to accept the provisions of the ADR given that we are joining 30 years after its inception.  The Minister of State deserves to be complimented on <Col N="29" /> bringing the Bill before the House and ensuring that Ireland will become a contracting party to the ADR.</P>
    <P>As previous speakers stated, recent economic growth has given rise to a greater volume of hazardous goods being carried on our roads.  For that reason it is imperative that the regulations be enacted and adhered to.  To some extent, the Bill is overdue but it is welcome nonetheless.  The Irish Road Haulage Association, which, for some time, has been seeking to have the various regulations brought together into a composite Bill to provide a comprehensive way to regulate the system, is satisfied with the legislation.  Given that radioactive materials, clinical waste and other toxic and acidic substances are carried on our roads, it is imperative to ensure that effective regulations are put in place and that people comply with those regulations.</P>
    <P>Senator Caffrey and others spoke eloquently on the enforcement aspect of the legislation. There is a need to provide gardaí with training and a broad enforcement remit.  A person involved in the haulage industry with whom I spoke earlier today stated that the law enforcement agencies usually only come under pressure with regard to accidents caused by speeding and drink driving.  However, it is essential that the other provisions in our regulations which must be policed from the point of view of safety are not forgotten.  To date, one would have been conscious that these types of regulations are better policed in continental countries.  It is to be hoped that the legislation, which is good, comprehensive and necessary, will meet with a commensurate response from the law enforcement agencies.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Bill and the regulations which stands out is the fact that many Departments and agencies are involved in this area.  For example, local government is responsible for initiating emergency plans where accidents occur. Under the legislation, many Departments and agencies &mdash; the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; will be in a position to appoint inspectors.  It strikes me that there is a weakness in the system in that the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which is responsible for introducing a great deal of legislation dealing with transport in general and road infrastructure in particular, does not hold a remit in this area.  As stated in previous debates on road improvements, etc., perhaps there is a role for local government in enforcing the provisions in legislation relevant to its area of responsibility.  Local government plays an effective role in this regard in other countries, particularly the United States; perhaps my proposal could be considered in a future review of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Quill referred to the need to transport hazardous products by rail.  I agree that this should happen where appropriate but I question <Col N="30" /> the safety of transporting these products by rail given the recent report on the state of the rail network.  However, the concept is probably correct. Given that accidents can happen on the railways in much the same way as they occur on our roads, to what extent does the Bill exert an influence over the rail network?  None, as far as I am aware.  How then can we hope to regulate the carriage of hazardous goods by rail and is there a need to draft legislation in that regard?</P>
    <P>Since many hazardous goods are exported or imported through our ports it is important to ensure that good and effective safety procedures are put in place at our ports.  It is also important to ensure adherence to the rules governing consignments of hazardous goods.  In that context, it is vital that adequate safety precautions are put in place by ferry operators and adhered to on their ships, which, in addition to passengers, carry large amounts of hazardous goods.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the inspectors will have powers similar to those granted under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the provisions of which have been effectively implemented.  It is important that the legislation be proactively enforced.  I have no criticism of the legislation but I query whether hazardous goods should be carried by rail and I would like to know the nature of the precautions and procedures which will apply in that regard.  The Bill will cover the requirements of any reasonable person interested in safety in this area.  However, we must ensure that its enforcement procedures are effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this legislation.  It is sad that it was not introduced heretofore because Ireland will be the last of the contracting parties to sign the European agreement on the carriage of dangerous goods by road into legislation.  That is ironic because, out of all the countries in the European Union, Ireland and Great Britain probably have the greatest need for the legislation because they are island nations and goods must be carried on vehicles by road, transferred to ships and transferred to vehicles again when they reach mainland Europe.  While the regulations relating to the carriage of dangerous goods are already in operation in Europe, they are not in operation in our domestic jurisdiction. Thankfully this legislation will address that anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that uniform procedures, regulations and supervisory mechanisms covering the transport of dangerous goods are put in place. More than any other European country, Ireland requires a uniform set of standard procedures which are certified, policed and enforced.  The road infrastructure in this country is far inferior to those of our European Union neighbours. There are large trucks transporting goods of every nature, many of them dangerous, on those roads and, as a result of the poor quality of the road network, there is a greater danger of accidents involving the spillage of dangerous <Col N="31" /> material.  The number of vehicles carrying petrol to petrol stations located in small villages and at the sides of very bad roads is an area where particular care is needed.  There is a danger of the infrastructure not being adequate to support those vehicles and a danger of accidents taking place with consequent damage.</P>
    <P>There is no access to Dublin port without passing through residential areas.  Every carrier coming by road to the port must go through the heart of Dublin.  Goods can be transported on the M50 for part of the way but must come in via Whitehall, Drumcondra, Fairview and East Wall. All these areas are built up.  Goods coming along the quays pass residential areas on both sides. There is also an enormous number of commuters and pedestrians at all times of the day and night.</P>
    <P>Anyone travelling through Dublin is as likely to see a large haulage vehicle stuck in the traffic at peak hours as a commuter vehicle.  We should consider regulating the timing and scheduling of vehicles carrying dangerous goods on the streets of a major city like Dublin.  Is there any valid reason for petrol lorries travelling the city at peak times?  There should be a ban on certain vehicles, including articulated vehicles, using the streets of the city between certain hours when there are huge numbers of pedestrians and a high volume of commuter traffic.  A prohibition should be introduced which prevents vehicles of this nature travelling through residential or built up areas at certain times.  We could negotiate those times with the fire brigade, Garda and local authorities &mdash; the services which would be on call if there was a spillage or serious accident.  Is there any valid reason the local authorities in Dublin, which get together to regulate other matters, should not get together with the other bodies to regulate times and schedules for dangerous products to be brought through the capital city?</P>
    <P>We need this legislation so that all dangerous goods are properly classified, packaged and inspected, and are in proper vehicles which are of an age which ensures they can be carried in safety with the minimum danger.  We have an equal responsibility to ensure they are carried at the times when they can do least harm, certainly until such time as we have a port relief tunnel enabling vehicles to go directly to Dublin port without traversing residential areas.  That, however, will not be for another five years. Interim measures are necessary to facilitate the haulage industry.</P>
    <P>Most drugs have been brought into the State in commuter vehicles or long distance haulage vehicles.  We have no idea of the quantities of drugs which are being imported.  It would seem that the vehicles least likely to be inspected are those which are labelled as carrying dangerous materials.  The strength and uniformity of labelling could result in a degree of laxity on the part of the port authorities and Garda in relation to inspection.  When regulations are put in place and inspectors appointed to monitor compliance with <Col N="32" /> them, it should be done in consultation with the excise officers of the Port and Docks Police and the Garda.  They have a broader remit in relation to what comes through the ports.  A situation might arise where the authorities would say that something is clearly labelled as a dangerous contaminant and let it pass through.  That would not assist our intentions.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes a derogation for a number of items in relation to certain prohibited goods.  Why should there be a derogation for the transport of clinical waste?  It can be extremely dangerous.  It often contains low level radioactive material.  I thought we would have emphasised that as not being subject to derogation.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  I am glad the transport of dangerous goods will be subject to stringent regulations, as in other European countries and that there will be proper training, certification, labelling, classification and packaging.  I am also glad there will be an inspection process and sanctions will be introduced and imposed.  I hope the legislation will contribute considerably to health and safety on the roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus roimh an Aire.  This Bill will bring into Irish law EU Directive 94/55/EC.  I pay tribute to truck drivers and haulage contractors who for the past 20 years, without this legislation, have carried dangerous substances without any problems. I only remember one incident in Edgeworthstown when a lorry carrying butane gas had to brake violently.  The gas escaped and ignited in a house which burnt down.</P>
      <P>I remember when Asahi located to Killala and the self-proclaimed experts said that the environment around Killala Bay and Enniscrone would be destroyed.  They said tourism would come to a standstill, that Ballina railway station would be blown up and that the road from Ballina to Killala would become such a traffic hazard it would be denuded of population.  Twenty years on, Asahi came and went and gave a great number of people employment.  Killala Bay was cleaner when it left than when before it came, tourism multiplied a thousandfold and there was not one accident of any kind.  We heard nothing from the self-proclaimed experts who went to ground.  They bombarded Mayo and Sligo County Councils and said a terrible atrocity would be imposed on people and it had to be stopped or it would ruin us.  Asahi brought employment, money and prosperity to the area and it is sad that it has gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Truck drivers keep the industrial wheels of this country turning.  They got a great deal of bad press recently which was not justified.  They are the most considerate drivers on the road.  They always watch their mirrors and pull in to the hard shoulder to let traffic pass.  We are too harsh on truck drivers.  Under another directive they will only be allowed drive for eight hours at a time. In Ireland, a truck driver driving for eight hours is lucky to cover 180 to 200 miles.  Driving in <Col N="33" /> England or on the Continent, one can cover from 350 to 400 miles in the same time.  I recently drove from Cornwall to Pembroke.  I averaged almost 60 miles per hour and I never exceeded the speed limit.  I bypassed every town and only left the motorway for the last 20 miles.  One can cruise for 70 to 75 miles per hour continuously. However, here one can do 80 miles per hour, yet ten miles down the road one is travelling at ten or 20 miles per hour.  There is no flow of traffic.</P>
    <P>We are introducing directives but we have not built proper roads.  This is not the fault of this Government or the previous one.  It is the fault of the self-proclaimed experts and the objectors who will not allow roads to be built.  We are enforcing directives to the letter of the law yet we are not comparing like with like.  Many truck drivers are giving up their jobs because they cannot take the hassle.  If we do not have truck drivers or haulage contractors many industries will close.  They transport goods during long and unsocial hours and are excellent, highly qualified and highly skilled.  The £150 fine proposed in this legislation is too much &mdash; £100 is enough.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to maintain trucks perfectly.  A truck is really only a tractor pulling different trailers continuously.  This involves a great deal of plugging in and out of connections and results in cables being broken.  It is easy for this to happen. I was a truck driver for a while when I was two handed and I know all about it.  It is not easy maintaining lights, etc.  There has been a big improvement in the quality of bulbs in the last 30 or 40 years.  However, a car driver can check their lights and before they reach Lucan a brake light can go.  That is 1,000 times more likely to happen to a truck.</P>
    <P>It is too easy to attack truck drivers.  Directives must be implemented.  More by-passes would help trucks move more quickly through traffic.  I agree with Senator Costello that deliveries should be made early in the morning or late in the evening after the rush hour.  I often see trucks backing into laneways around the city.  The drivers are great men and often back big trucks into a space in one lock.  I recently saw a young lady driving a truck and her ability amazed me.  She hopped into a 40 tonne truck and drove down a narrow laneway watching her two mirrors.  We are not providing services for truck drivers to comply with EC regulations.</P>
    <P>We should use our railways more.  CIE is responsible for a decline in the transportation of goods by rail.  For 20 years I worked for a firm that had all its goods delivered by rail.  If something that should have been delivered to Ballina was left at Ballymote, one could spend three days phoning railway stations to find out where it was. CIE became very careless when it had a monopoly. The same thing happened when it had a monopoly on road transport.  It was very careless and lost a lot of business.  Private transport would have not been successful if CIE had done its job efficiently.  It is much more efficient now but for a number of years it abused its monopoly.  The <Col N="34" /> railways started to decline because people stopped travelling and sending goods by rail. Trucks delivered more quickly and as a result our railways deteriorated.  I am glad the Government is actively working on and investing in this.</P>
    <P>I hope the line from Dublin to Mullingar and Sligo will be upgraded in the near future.  It is a very important line as is the one to Ballina and Westport.  If those lines were improved much transport could be taken off the roads and put on a fast and efficient rail system.  It is a much more efficient system and I would like the railways to be improved as soon as possible to help take that type of traffic off the road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their thoughtful, helpful and useful contributions.  The technicalities associated with the European agreement on the international carriage of dangerous goods by road, the ADR, and the two associated European directives are complex and difficult.  For this reason I am all the more appreciative of the helpful and excellent contributions from Senators.</P>
      <P>As the technicalities of carrying dangerous goods by road are so complex, they are necessarily updated on a regular basis.  This Bill is largely enabling.  It is important that this proposed legislative framework be put in place as soon as possible and the Bill is a vital first step towards achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>In my opening statement I mentioned the Bill will enable comprehensive and detailed regulations to be put in place.  These regulations, together with the annexes to the ADR, will be a vital reference point for all involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road.  The Bill and the regulations will ensure that all those involved in the carriage of dangerous goods by road, be they consignors, operators or drivers, will have available to them clear instructions on requirements and statutory obligations.</P>
      <P>A number of Senators made excellent contributions, including Senators O'Dowd, Caffrey, Quill, Walsh, Costello and Farrell.  I took note of some very important and pertinent points they made and I will endeavour to address them.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd referred to out of state hauliers. He welcomed the measure as did Senator Fitzgerald.  Senator O'Dowd indicated this is a problem in his constituency because of its geographic location.  This is one provision with which I am particularly enamoured and I wanted to stitch it into the Bill.  Senator Fitzgerald made this point very strongly.  He will be glad to know that this measure will also be included in the forthcoming Road Transport Bill.  It is very welcome and Irish hauliers deserve it because, as has been said, they have been abused in this area in that out of state hauliers were getting away scot free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd welcomed driver training and talked about the tachograph and the enforcement of these rules.  Tachograph rules are enforced by <Col N="35" /> the Garda and transport officers in my Department. The transport officers focus on the education of drivers and operators.  They visit premises to check on tachograph charts and there are ongoing road checks.  A few months ago, a purge was ordered.  For example, the Department took part in operation Lifesaver.  Department inspectors, transport officers and the Garda carry out ongoing road checks.  I agree this must be continued and the practice must be enhanced.</P>
    <P>Senator Farrell and others mentioned aspirations to switch to rail wherever possible.  Of course it would be desirable to switch the transport of commodities such as dangerous goods to rail and get them off the roads.  Senators Caffrey and Farrell mentioned Asahi.  It is a typical example of how our rail service dealt with a potentially hazardous substance from Dublin to Killala.</P>
    <P>I can relate to other such substances which were carried by rail over the years and to this day. Prior to joining politics I worked in this area.  For most of my working life I worked as distribution manager for the largest chemical company in Ireland, Nítrogin Éireann Teoranta.  One of the products we transported was ammonia from the Marina Point plant in Cork to the Arklow plant. That continues to this day and CIE have a magnificent record in this regard.  I congratulate CIE and its employees on that.</P>
    <P>Ammonia is potentially a hugely hazardous commodity.  If there was a derailment or a leakage we would need to evacuate towns or villages. This example demonstrates the desirability of switching from road to rail.  In an ideal world that would be done.  However there are problems of practicality due to the flexibility road gives in terms of quantity, the scale of a customer's requirements and getting from A to B. For example, the route from Dublin port to Asahi was tailormade for that mode of transport, as was the route from a plant in Cork to a plant in Arklow for the transport of ammonia.  However, I am thinking of other commodities which came under my control in those years, such as sulphuric acid and nitric acid.  Smaller requirements by customers, the inflexibility of access at receiving points and so on would force the carriage of these goods by road rather than the less flexible but more desirable and safe method of carriage by rail.  We should endeavour to address the aspiration to transport dangerous goods by rail rather than by road whenever possible.</P>
    <P>Senators spoke about the need to try to avoid transporting dangerous goods through built up areas.  Senator Costello mentioned confining the movement of such traffic to certain times of the day or night.  This could be looked at by the appropriate authorities because it makes good sense.  Tacograph enforcement was mentioned.</P>
    <P>The carriage of dangerous goods by rail was raised by a number of speakers.  There is a separate <Col N="36" /> convention which deals with the transport of dangerous goods by rail.  RID, as distinct from ADR, is one element of the convention concerning international carriage by rail &mdash; COTIF. Ireland is a contracting party to COTIF as are all member states.  RID sets out the minimum standards for the safe packaging and transport of various dangerous goods by rail.  Rail safety will be debated next week and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, will deal with the matter comprehensively.  EU Council directives relating to rail and rail safety are yet to be transposed into Irish law.  These directives will be used as standards to deal with national and international transport of dangerous goods by rail within the EU.  It is convenient for the EU to use RID regulations as all the member states are party to the COTIF convention.  A statutory instrument to transpose the directives into Irish law is currently being drafted and it is expected this will be signed early in 1999.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Dowd and others raised the issue of road traffic enforcement.  The primary responsibility for road traffic enforcement rightly rests with the Garda Síochána.  The Garda have traffic corps throughout the country to ensure the day-to-day enforcement of road traffic legislation governing private cars and heavy goods vehicles.  As Senators mentioned, road traffic accidents are a major problem.  I sometimes think there was an inbuilt safety factor in our potholes; there are still some potholes around the Wicklow mountains. The big improvements in the quality of our roads and cars seem to have had the devastating effect of fatal accidents.  The gardaí have made great strides in trying to reverse these appalling trends.</P>
    <P>During 1996 a review was carried out within the Garda Síochána by personnel from their organisational and development unit into the structures and functions of the traffic section. This report established a number of important factors, including the fact that traffic policing is an essential public service.  The report stated that the importance of the traffic function within the realm of policing is evident.</P>
    <P>Developments such as a 50 per cent increase in road mileage between 1978 and 1993 and a 30 per cent increase in the number of vehicles between 1985 and 1994 have culminated in serious problems of congestion and pollution and a danger to human life on Irish roads.  There is an onus is on all of us to improve the situation in the context of dangerous goods being carried by road.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald was concerned about driver training.  I assure the Senator that driver training is comprehensive and has been taking place for some time.  These training courses teach drivers the necessary requirements concerning handling, loading, unloading, documentation, equipment marking, emergency procedures and protective clothing.  Drivers who are successful in the examination receive the relevant certificate.  There is a requirement that drivers attend a refresher course every five years to ensure that they remain fully trained and <i>au fait</i> with up-to-date developments <Col N="37" /> regarding the carriage of dangerous goods.  This process will continue under the proposed new regulations to be put in place following the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald mentioned derogations. Derogations are included to deal with established transport practices which have obtained in this country for some years.  For example, reference temperatures that determine the shell thicknesses of LPG tanks suited to our climatic conditions have been accepted.  Thicker shells are required in hotter regions of Southern Europe.  There is a derogation relating to the transport of explosives that allows for the continued security arrangements associated with such transport here. Ireland has also negotiated derogations to cover the transport of ammonium nitrate fertiliser &mdash; I can understand the practical reasons for this given the explosive qualities of this product &mdash; and dispensing gases carried on the same vehicle as beverages.  In other words, the Guinness lorry carrying the kegs of our favourite brew are for practical reasons deemed to be allowed to carry the gas used to pour that product.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello mentioned clinical waste and the fact that some of this waste could come under the radioactive category.  This derogation refers to the type of packaging used.  The practice here and in the UK is to use plastic sacks approved by the United Nations.  The ADR requires rigid containers and packaging.  Under this derogation, we can continue to use plastic sacks for the next five years when presumably we will have to comply with the ADR.</P>
    <P>The measures regarding out of state carriers are something everyone has welcomed.  The Bill breaks new ground in that it is an effort to implement measures to bring out of state carriers to book.  To some extent Directive 95/50/EC places an onus on us as a member state to ensure a comprehensive and representative number of checks are carried out and that breaches of regulations are dealt with in a non-discriminatory fashion.  While it has given impetus for action in this area, there was already a determination to find a suitable formula to achieve this.  The previous Government was endeavouring to deal with the matter in the Road Transport Bill which it produced in early 1997.  It was deemed by the then Attorney General to be very difficult to deal with but since then, we have succeeded in finding suitable wording.  I am sure all are pleased about that.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators for their invaluable contributions and for teasing out Second Stage.  With the passing of the Bill, we will have in place the three blocks necessary to ensure a safe environment surrounding the carriage of dangerous goods by road &mdash; the statutory provisions with which we are dealing today, training and enforcement.</P>

    <Title>National Road Needs Study: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann welcomes the National Road Needs Study published by the NRA as an important blueprint for the future; and requests the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>The House debated the relationship between road accidents and the road infrastructure a few weeks ago.  I welcome the National Roads Authority's report.  It provides a blueprint for discussion and planning for the future.  Through its seminars at regional level the NRA has stimulated much debate on the proposals in the study.</P>
      <P>A more focused approach to road improvement is long overdue.  Criticism can be levelled at our past failure to have sufficient forward planning. The report covers the period 1998-2019 but I wonder if that period is sufficiently long.  I advocate planning the road infrastructure to the middle or the end of the next century &mdash; we should adopt a 50 to 60 year perspective.  If that were done we would arrive at a road network commensurate with the requirements of a modern economy.</P>
      <P>It is important for a trading country such as ours that we have a distribution system which is sufficient and cost effective.  Many of our roads bear witness to a lack of investment over many decades.  This is a pity because the payback to the economy from road investment is significant. About 16 or 17 years ago when the Naas dual carriageway was built economists estimated that it would give a 15 per cent return per annum to the economy.</P>
      <P>At that time I was vice president of the Irish Road Hauliers Association and at various meetings with the then Minister for the Environment we articulated the need for an accelerated programme of motorway and dual carriageway construction. Had impetus been put into the programme at that stage we would have motorways or dual carriageways between our major centres today.  Such investment would bring benefits to the economy and would also have a beneficial effect in terms of road accidents.  We should accelerate the programme outlined in the NRA's study.  However, I wonder how realistic this call will be given the current position on regionalisation and that much of the country will probably be in transition in the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant contribution made by the European Union to the road network must be acknowledged. However, I will be critical and argue that more should have been done and that it was in <Col N="39" /> the early 1980s that we lost out.  I recall speaking with representatives of the EU Commission whom we had invited to speak at road seminars along with Ministers.  They pointed out that they were prompting the Government to come forward with progressive plans to improve the road infrastructure.  Unfortunately, such investment did not occur on the necessary scale.  It is regrettable that much of the significant Government borrowing at that period was channelled into current expenditure rather than into a capital programme which would have paid back the economy.</P>
    <P>This study is a framework which is likely to be reshaped.  It is an important starting point but it should be underpinned by the necessary funding to activate any of its proposals or amended proposals. There will be a need for more innovation in sourcing investment in our road infrastructure, particularly the national roads.  In the past two years the Minister has made significantly improved contributions to county roads which were in need of repair and improvement. However, we must bear in mind that at least 90 per cent of passenger and goods vehicles use the national roads.  Those arteries must be improved and maintained.</P>
    <P>Last week the House discussed traffic congestion in Dublin, the need for investment in Luas and bus corridors and the need to bring about a culture shift away from private cars to public transport.  There must be an integrated plan to take account of regional roads and the convergence of traffic on the cities.  Many of our towns that have not been bypassed are still the source of significant delays at certain times of the day and at particular times of the year.  The cost of transport is significant and most of it is imported. Vehicles, spare parts and fuel are all major components of road transport, which are imported. Therefore, it makes good economic sense, apart from the necessity to the economy, to make sure we get the best return from and use of the vehicles as cost effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>While we talk about an integrated plan, we must look at our cities and the bottlenecks around the country.  That is already happening but it needs to be accelerated.  We must also examine the rail network which is an integral part of our transportation system.  Because of the size of the country there will always be a difficulty in transferring any significant volume of freight or passengers on to our rail network.  However, any shift will be contingent upon good rolling stock and investment in the railways.  An overall strategy plan needs to be developed.  It is probably fair to say that many of the reports which are now coming to Government, and much of the focus by various Ministers, are going in that direction.</P>
    <P>Private sources of financing for road development should be examined much more enthusiastically than heretofore.  We have some prime examples of it in the Eastlink and Westlink <Col N="40" /> bridges, both of which have made a major contribution to traffic flows both in and around Dublin.</P>
    <P>Such private financing could be made at a more indepth level.  Many of our pension funds are seeking investment opportunities and they take a long-term view of such projects.  There are also many tax breaks for investment in business expansion schemes and holiday homes.  Is there scope to refocus some of the investment into road infrastructure and other public services such as drainage and sewerage?</P>
    <P>Roads is one area where we can copy what has occurred in other countries.  We should examine foreign models of practice to see how they could apply to our needs.  Demographic changes in society and a significant increase in traffic will give rise to a need for more and better roads. Within the next ten years there will be a 60 per cent increase in car registrations and if there is not a commensurate improvement in the road network the current gridlock will appear insignificant.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for a concentrated effort in this area.  The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and the Minister of State, Deputy Dan Wallace, deserve credit for the increased concentration of investment which will be made next year, compared to this year.  I understand that the Book of Estimates shows an 18 per cent increase in spending on national road improvements, which is welcome. We need that kind of emphasis and I hope it will continue at a faster pace than in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to second the motion.  This is an ongoing debate.  Not long ago we had another debate relating to the National Roads Authority concerning speeding and alcohol abuse on the roads.  This new study is a guideline to the future conceptualisation of our road network and how we will deal with that infrastructure.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the national road needs study but, as devil's advocate, I was looking for anything that had been forecast concerning the current gridlock and the lack of infrastructure.  In discussing the period from 2000 to 2019 we are pushing the issue into the future so the debate will be based on car ownership and usage, population, income groups and the quality of life.  It is difficult to talk about a blueprint for the future of our roads when I want to know the current blueprint of the National Roads Authority.  This report relates to the future and I accept that because we need to know where we are going. Everyone accepts that the east coast, from Dublin southwards, is gridlocked from early morning until evening.  The west coast does not seem to have as many problems, although perhaps it does. Senator Coogan may be able to inform me what it is like driving from Galway to Dublin. However, on the east coast one must add at least one and a half hours to one's journey because of traffic congestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I read through the national road needs study very quickly.  It mentioned that the greatest population <Col N="41" /> growth was occurring on the east coast, but it did not say how that growth could be coped with in future.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's views about the density of population on the east coast and how best the road network could span out over the rest of the country.  I have been trying to figure that out, having read the report in a short space of time.</P>
    <P>The environmental impact reflects how we live. At present, the quality of life is being disrupted because car ownership has increased at such a rate.  We need quality bus corridors, although the Minister of State may say that has nothing to do with the National Roads Authority.  Can we isolate ourselves in this study?  I do not see any reference to local authority involvement in this report.  How did the report's authors compile all their information?</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority's guidelines are often taken as gospel by local authorities, but it should be the other way around.  County engineers and other local authority personnel are the real feeders of information.  We should be able to discern future trends from them as they have their fingers on the pulse.  An integrated and more co-ordinated approach is required, although I did not find one in this document.  I would like to know how the National Roads Authority operates <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Department of the Environment and Local Government.  We need to have a multiplicity of views on this issue.  Can the National Roads Authority bring us up to date on where we will be regarding local infrastructure over the next 12 months rather than over the next 20 years?  It comes down to local concentration because we all live in our own little worlds.  The National Roads Authority must listen to the views of people from every area, from Dublin, Wexford, Galway and Cork and compile a study when it realises the extent of the problem nationally.  How can we solve this problem?  Can we encourage people to change their travel habits and abandon cars in favour of public transport? The National Roads Authority must broaden its range of interests to include the problem of traffic and transport in general.  The country cannot accommodate a further increase in car numbers.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the National Roads Authority on its future planning but it will not succeed unless the central role of local authorities in transport and infrastructural planning is recognised. I welcome the report, I congratulate the National Roads Authority on an excellent piece of research and I realise the Minister has his finger on the pulse of the problem.  However, I would like to see local authorities playing a more central role in solving this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to debate this document with the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Wallace.  We have examined related topics several times during the last two weeks.  Last week we discussed the problem of Dublin's traffic and the week before <Col N="42" /> we discussed the subject of road accidents.  On one of those occasions I mentioned the NRA and I was interested to hear Senator Ormonde this evening reiterate so much of what I said then. Perhaps she should join us on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The National Roads Authority is not responsible to anyone.  I doubt if it is even responsible to the Minister or consults him when drawing up its frameworks.  I happened to learn of the existence of this document, the national road needs study, some weeks ago but it has not been circulated to Members of the House.  The NRA appears not to consider it necessary to circulate this document to Senators.  The study should also be circulated to local authorities.  If that were done there would be uproar from members of local authorities who would ask the question I have just asked.  How does the National Roads Authority prioritise road development projects? The list of priorities contains serious gaps and includes emphases with which many local authority members would not agree.  A local authority in the west would place emphasis on different roads from those mentioned in this study.</P>
      <P>If this framework is to be adhered to in the future it will impinge on everyone in the country. For that reason it is important that we debate it. The plan will impinge on car drivers and on manufacturers who must transport goods.  I am sure the projected facts and figures in the study are as accurate as possible.  It is frightening to realise that in 25 years' time the number of private cars and trucks in the country will have doubled.  As Senator Walsh said, we should have been tackling this problem 30 years ago.  Infrastructure is of critical importance in our economy but its development has focused on the Dublin area to too great an extent.  All goods are exported through the port of Dublin.  The west and other peripheral areas have a much lower rate of economic growth than the east coast.  If infrastructural development does not take place in the west the focus will continue to be on Dublin. If I were an industrialist I would not establish a business in the west.  The time it takes to drive from Galway to the port of Dublin is prohibitive and sensible manufacturers would locate near the port through which they export.</P>
      <P>We must consider long-term projects such as the building of a new city and the necessary infrastructure for such a city.  The cost of infrastructural development set out in the study is frightening. For the next 35 years a sum of £6,139 million will be needed for road development.  Where will this money come from when EU structural funds diminish?  The Exchequer cannot provide it.  Solutions such as private financing and toll roads are politically difficult but it may be necessary for Governments to adopt these unpopular measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A previous speaker mentioned the question of regional policy.  I looked at some of the maps in the NRA study and asked some colleagues for their opinions on proposals for various areas of <Col N="43" /> the country.  I am sorry the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is not here because I note that proposed developments in his constituency are included in the first five year plan.  Some proposals for the west coast are planned for 20 or 25 years in the future.  It will be a long time before the west has an adequate infrastructure.  Údarás na Gaeltachta is building factories in the west.  I would not be enthusiastic about setting up an industry in the west because the necessary infrastructure does not exist there. Galway County Council and Galway Corporation asked a previous Minister if the NRA could upgrade the road from Galway through Furbo and Spiddal to a national primary route.  This would have ensured funding would be provided to improve and maintain the road so that people who have industries in the area could move goods and equipment more quickly.  Instead we have a boreen that grew into a country road and from that into a secondary road.  The study contains no plan to improve this road which is also of critical importance for tourism.</P>
    <P>While we are waiting for the recommendations of this study to be implemented we must develop a public transport system which will persuade people to take buses or trains rather than travel by car.  If we do not have a satisfactory public transport system we must provide adequate roads.  When I first came to Dublin in my father's car it took three hours.  Now, on our marvellously improved roads, it takes three and a half hours.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister.  I also welcome the opportunity to debate this issue but in my view the study is merely pie in the sky.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, who is unable to be in the House tonight.  He is in Buenos Aires attending the ministerial conference on climate change and the follow-up to the Kyoto Protocol.</P>
      <P>The motion before the House provides a welcome opportunity to debate an important issue, the state of the national road network and plans for its future development.  Everybody agrees that a safe and efficient national road network is a key ingredient for economic success and for enhanced levels of personal mobility.</P>
      <P>While a good start was made in earlier years, it was only in 1989 &mdash; less than ten years ago &mdash; that a concerted effort began to provide Ireland with the national road network necessary to support our aspirations for economic and social development. That year marked the start of a period of increased EU and Exchequer resources for roads and other transport infrastructure, to be applied through the mechanism of multi-annual investment programmes &mdash; the Operational Programme on Peripherality, 1989-1993 and the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="44" /> Much has been and is being achieved within the framework of these investment programmes. Senators will be aware of many parts of the country where the national road network has been improved beyond recognition as a result of investment since 1989.  The bypasses of Portlaoise, Balbriggan and Longford give an idea of the scale of the transformation which has occurred in many areas.  This progress is continuing; for example, bypasses of the Curlews and Arklow and the Lee tunnel in Cork are due for completion and will be open to traffic shortly.</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons, it is particularly appropriate that those responsible for national road planning take stock of where the programme is now and what remains to be done. First, there has been nearly a decade of substantial investment in national roads, a period which of itself calls for a fresh assessment of the programme. Second, it is important that we do the necessary homework to make the best possible use of funding under the next round of EU Structural and Cohesion funding.  Finally, the unprecedented growth in road traffic volumes in recent years, reflecting our economic success, has to be taken into account in the road planning process.</P>
    <P>Against this background the NRA commissioned the national road needs study.  It was presented by the NRA to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government last July. The study was co-financed by the EU as part of the technical assistance programme of the operational programme for transport.  The major conclusion to emerge from the study is that, while much good work has been accomplished, much also remains to be done to bring the national road network up to appropriate standards in all parts of the country.  It is also clear that in the absence of substantial further investment, the situation could deteriorate steadily in the years ahead due to growth in road traffic volumes.</P>
    <P>The study provides a comprehensive assessment of Ireland's infrastructural deficit in terms of national road development.  It puts the cost of proposed works at £6 billion and sets out a strong case for a significant increase in investment in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>As suggested by the motion, the study is an important input to the process leading to a national development plan for the period 2000-2006. The plan will set out the Government's intentions for economic and social development into the new millennium and, in particular, for utilising EU Structural and Cohesion Funds in the period ahead.  In preparing the plan, full account will also be taken by Government of the scope for public/private partnerships in meeting infrastructure needs in the roads and other areas.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of £6 billion may seem daunting at first.  However, while recognising the case for significantly increased investment in the short term, it should also be borne in mind that the study covers a 20 year period up to 2019, with some of the needs arising only as traffic volumes increase.  Moreover, national road investment <Col N="45" /> has, to a large extent, already moved to a new level.  Earlier today, the Minister for Finance announced in the abridged Estimates for Public Services in 1999 a provision of nearly £312 million next year for national road improvement &mdash; an increase of £48 million or over 18 per cent on the 1998 figure.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely that everybody will agree with all the conclusions reached in the study.  In any exercise of this nature, there will always be additional projects which people believe should be carried out or ones which people consider should be carried out at an earlier date than indicated by the analysis.  The study is a needs assessment.  It is not a strategic road investment programme.  It represents the start of a process leading to the next such programme, which will be prepared following Government decisions on the new national development plan and agreement with the European Commission on a new community support framework.</P>
    <P>The study is an important analytical basis for the work on developing the programme that lies ahead.  As part of this process, the study has been presented by the NRA at a series of regional seminars which were attended by Members of the Oireachtas and of regional and local authorities, as well as by local officials and representatives from interested bodies.  These seminars promoted awareness of the study conclusions and provided a forum for an exchange of views on national road development.  The NRA has also indicated that it would welcome written submissions on the study and I urge people to take up this invitation. In addition, tonight's debate is an important further step in a process which, I hope, will lead to the maximum degree of consensus on the strategic approach to be followed in the next national road investment programme.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two issues of great importance in the context of the national road development programme, environmental sustainability and road safety.  In pressing ahead with national road development, full account must be taken of environmental sustainability.  I am particularly pleased, therefore, to see recognition of this in the study.  The environmental implications of road development and transportation generally is a key issue facing many countries, including Ireland.  For this reason, it is vital that road development policy is not looked at in isolation. Through the national development plan and the work leading to it, Ireland's transport development needs will be assessed in an integrated way, taking account of the contribution to be made by all transport modes.</P>
    <P>Equally critically from both the transport and the environment perspectives is the need to develop and implement integrated transport strategies for the major urban areas, again covering all modes including cycling and walking.  Where major road development is required there must be rigorous assessment of its environmental impact and appropriate action taken on foot of the results.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> As we approach the Christmas season, it is right to reflect on the contribution the national road investment programme can make to making roads safer.  The Government's strategy document &ldquo;The Road to Safety&rdquo; proposes action on a number of fronts.  The computerised database which was developed as part of the needs study will allow high accident locations to be identified. The NRA will prioritise these locations for the application of countermeasures.  The measures will, as appropriate, involve safety audits, traffic calming or low cost remedial measures.  In these ways, road safety engineering will be mobilised to help meet the targets in the strategy and reduce the toll of death and injury on our roads.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation to those associated with the study.  It is invaluable as an assessment of where we are in terms of national road development and of where we should aim to be in 20 years time.  The task before us is to develop the strategic investment programme required to make a reality of the long-term vision we all share of a national road network which fully meets the needs of the economy and society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  This is a typical Government party motion in that it welcomes the National Roads Needs Study as an important blueprint for the future and requests the Minister to make a statement. I am obliged to the Minister for his statement. However, this is a blueprint which needs major and drastic amendment.  It is clearly not adequate.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that it is necessary to support our aspirations for economic and social development and I agree.  However, it is clear that the existing provision does not in the slightest support the recent growth.  There has been phenomenal growth but the road network is appalling.  I would go so far as to say that the state of the road network is Ireland's greatest infrastructural shortcoming.</P>
      <P>One has only to look at the increase in the number of cars, to which the Minister referred. There are 145,000 new cars on the roads this year. It is projected that the number of cars on the road next year will grow by 140,000.  I acknowledge that the Minister made reference to Ireland's infrastructural deficit of which there is no doubt.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provision of £312 million next year for national road improvements.  Again, in the context of the £6 billion to which the Minister referred, this is woefully inadequate at a time when there is a surplus, much more of which could more properly be put into roads.  Ireland's greatest infrastructural deficit relates to roads.</P>
      <P>The Minister was kind enough to state it is unlikely everybody will agree with the conclusions reached in the study.  That is a huge understatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have also seen the difficulties which can be caused by the rigorous assessment of projects for their environmental impact.  As I know from experience in County Kerry, that is one of the <Col N="47" /> things which can cause major grief.  County Kerry lost a dual carriageway into Tralee as a result of environmental considerations even though many of us, as lay people, thought that the wood would hardly have been touched.  It was merely to be skirted.</P>
    <P>On 21 October I spoke in the House about some of the major shortcomings in the blueprint. On page 86 of the NRA report there is a reference to future road types.  Looking at the map it is evident that there are major deficiencies in the recommendations contained therein.  In my book, the most glaring of them concerns the much needed western road corridor.  As I stated at the time, the proposed route bypasses County Kerry altogether.  We can imagine how that will hinder the development of the most peripheral region in Ireland.  I stated on that occasion, in the Official Report 21 October 1998, vol.  156, column 1164:</P>
    <P>The South-West Regional Authority has pointed out that the Government could save £80 million if it improved road links between Waterford, Cork and Limerick with an improved road to Tralee.  The NRA wants to upgrade roads between Galway, County Mayo, County Clare and Rosslare via Limerick.  This would inflict a severe blow on County Kerry in terms of tourism and trade losses.</P>
    <P>I stated that NRA was bypassing and cutting off County Kerry altogether.</P>
    <P>Recently we were talking about Objective One status.  We do not know what will be the outcome in that regard.  However, if we are to suffer this double blow, it will be crushing for the people of the deep south-west.  Transport links, as the House will be aware, are vital for getting people to and from the capital and County Kerry is the furthest point.</P>
    <P>County Kerry was designated some years ago as a major centre of tourism growth.  I wonder what is its status given some of the existing proposals because they are not in any way complimentary. County Kerry is being downgraded and degraded.</P>
    <P>That document referred to the road from Killarney to Mallow, which we know well is in need of major upgrading, but such treatment is not recommended.  If I recall correctly, the NRA report stated that it is an existing road not in need of any improvement, which is clearly and blatantly untrue.</P>
    <P>The road from Killarney to Tralee is listed as a national primary road.  However, one can find minor county roads in any part of Britain in a much better state than that 20 mile stretch of what is regarded as a national primary road.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing to note also in what is called the &ldquo;South-West Road Corridor&rdquo; on another map in that report that the road stops at Limerick on one side and Cork on the other.  There is a need for a proper link.  I plead with the NRA to rearrange matters so that the road from Dublin to Limerick would continue as far as Tralee with <Col N="48" /> that status and grade.  Equally, the road from Rosslare to Cork should continue to Killarney at the same grade.  I do not want to be whinging all the time but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As Senator Kiely will be aware, I welcome everything. I welcome that funding but it is seriously inadequate.  Given the level of growth, which is delightful in one sense, we cannot travel if there are no roads.</P>
      <P>With regards to other modes of transport, we must find a way of dealing with many of the goods which are transported in large articulated trucks on totally inadequate roads.  The narrow stretch between Mallow and Kildorrery needs a higher grading than that map affords it.</P>
      <P>I plead that the Minister and his Department to use their influence with the NRA.  This blueprint is totally inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Minister of State and compliment him on his work.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest to many of the contributions and to what Senator Coghlan said about County Kerry, particularly north County Kerry, the line between Killarney and Mallow and that between Killarney and Tralee.  What was the then Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and then Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, doing when they were in Government to improve the situation in my part of the country?  The N69 on my side of the county, from Tralee to Tarbert, Foynes and Limerick, is a secondary route.</P>
      <P>I am disgusted with the NRA report.  It states that no funding will be needed for this road up to 2019 because it is in good condition.  The Tralee, Tarbert and Listowel route, which is the main artery from the ferry of Tarbert and Foynes in Limerick, is in a terrible state.  Funding is needed in that part of the country.  Most funding will be spent on major routes along the east coast, but, we must not forget the west coast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some £6 billion will be spent on our national roads until 2019, yet between 1983 and 1987 the coalition Government borrowed £13 billion for day to day spending.  Where did we go wrong? Everyone wants to spend more money now that we have a budget surplus and good economic management.  The Minister for Finance has an extra £1 billion to spend this year, with which he could do a number of things.  He could use it for <Col N="49" /> public spending, pay off part of the national debt which the coalition Government doubled between 1983 and 1987 or give it to the National Roads Authority or the local authorities to build up our roads infrastructure.  If I was a Minister in this Administration, I would use a significant portion of it to improve our road network, as that is where our future lies.</P>
    <P>There are major traffic jams in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork every morning as people try to get to work.  Cities which are ten times the size of Dublin are able to improve their infrastructure.  Recently I read about a survey, which cost £6 million, on the tunnel which links New Jersey with New York.  Some £3 trillion will have to be spent to alleviate the traffic problems there up to 2006.  The National Roads Authority should study that survey.</P>
    <P>If business people want to get their products to the markets, they will develop the infrastructure along the east coast.  However, if we want to save rural Ireland we must do something along the west coast.  If the new road network along the western seaboard into Limerick and across to Rosslare bypasses Mallow, one portion of the country will be left out of the industrial spectrum. Something must be done about this.  People who want to get their products from one place to another need the shortest possible route.</P>
    <P>While I respect what the National Roads Authority intends to do, it must go back to the drawing board and consider rural Ireland, about which it has forgotten.  The N69 between Limerick, Tarbert, Listowel and Tralee is a secondary route. According to the National Roads Authority, it does not need to be improved.  However, that road is falling apart.  Six or eight months ago I suggested meeting representatives of the National Roads Authority to discuss this issue.  They said the Authority would examine the route again. However, its report states there is no need for it to be upgraded.  The Minister must ask the National Roads Authority to reconsider that decision.</P>
    <P>We need proper infrastructure, particularly if we want to get involved in the European market. There is much talk about dividing the country into two regions.  This is the only island left in the European Union.  It takes us longer to get our products into the market and that must be taken into account in any future submissions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this study which is a good blueprint for the future.  It is welcome that the NRA is taking into consideration the amount of traffic on our roads now and over the next 20 years so that we can build a proper infrastructure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The study recommends that the Monaghan, Carrickmacross and Ardee bypasses on the N2 from Dublin to Derry and Donegal should be included in phase one between 2000 and 2004. However, Castleblayney is marked as &ldquo;backlog&rdquo;, which means there is an immediate need to build that bypass.  We understood that bypass would be the first in the county to be completed in the period <Col N="50" /> between 1994 to 1998.  It is disappointing to discover that it is not even included in phase one of the programme to be carried out between 2000 to 2004.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to take on board the fact that there is an urgent need for a bypass of Monaghan town, Carrickmacross, Ardee and Ashbourne.  Anyone who travels on the existing road &mdash; I do so myself several times every week &mdash; will be aware of the huge build-up of traffic into and out of these towns each morning and evening.  As the new millennium approaches, it is not acceptable that people are obliged to sit in traffic for long periods while trying to drive through these towns. Given that there is no major motorway running into Monaghan and on to Derry, it is important that the Monaghan bypass be built as soon as possible.  As other speakers stated in respect of their areas, such bypasses are urgently required.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State who pointed out that the Minister for Finance announced earlier today that there will be a provision of nearly £312 million in 1999 for national road improvement, an increase of £48 million on the 1998 figure. That is tremendous because £48 million is a substantial sum of money.  The Minister of State and the NRA must be complimented on providing this additional funding for the upkeep and improvement of our roads.  I also compliment the Minister of State on the rapid progress being made on the much needed Cavan bypass.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House for this important debate on the NRA's road needs study.  Given current road needs and the huge volume of traffic using our roads, everyone will admit we are faced with a major and expensive problem.  It would be wrong of me to be over-critical, but I am concerned about the amount of money being spent on improving the road network.  We must consider increasing our spending on roads in light of the huge volume of traffic using them.</P>
      <P>By its nature, road construction is expensive; it consumes vast amounts of financial resources. However, as members of local authorities will point out, the cost of road construction and people's requests for local road improvements are the frequently discussed at council meetings.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State referred to the construction of a number of bypasses.  Everyone has their own parochial request to put forward in that regard and I take this opportunity to raise an issue which is of major concern to the people of south Tipperary.  I refer to the lengthy discussions that have taken place in respect of the Cashel bypass.  Cashel is one of the most historic towns in the country and the number of tourists visiting it in recent years has increased dramatically.  In the past ten years, the numbers visiting the Rock of Cashel have increased from 100,000 to 260,000. A huge backlog of traffic develops in the town each day, particularly during the summer months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="51" /> Consultants were appointed by South Tipperary County Council to determine the suitability of five routes for the construction of a bypass and on Friday last they made their report available to council members.  It is one of the finest reports I have ever read and it greatly impressed everyone who attended the meeting.  It advocates the construction of a bypass to the east of the Rock of Cashel.</P>
    <P>As stated earlier, people in Cashel are concerned about the construction of the bypass and the county council has been criticised for being too slow in proceeding with the project.  However, I am aware that on the first Monday in December the members of the council are prepared to endorse the consultants' report which will then be forwarded to the NRA.  The cost of the project will be approximately £18 million.  I have heard much about the construction of various bypasses and tunnels throughout the country &mdash; all of which are needed &mdash; but I have rarely heard reference to the Cashel bypass at Government or NRA level.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State impress on the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, his officials and the officials in NRA the urgent need to sanction the proposals which will come before them in the coming weeks?  As already stated, there is a great need for a bypass at Cashel.  I am almost certain that, following years of divisiveness, rancour and indecision, South Tipperary County Council will take a unanimous decision to approve the consultants' report.  When that decision is made it is crucial that the NRA provide funding for the bypass.  Another critical part of the report recommends the construction of a link road to connect west Tipperary with Tipperary town, which is one of the most innovative aspects of the proposals that will come before the Department and the NRA.  I plead with the Minister of State to do everything possible to help the people of south Tipperary who have taken a sound decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has come before the House for this important debate, the tentacles of which &mdash; I hope Members will excuse the pun &mdash; are spread across Ireland.  The implementation of the recommendations of the road needs study will have an impact on the social and economic life of communities in every part of the country.  It was suggested that this debate provided an opportunity to have a go at the NRA.  I am sure the Minister and his officials are convinced the opposite is the case.  This is an opportunity to debate an important report which will have a tremendous impact on the State.  It also presents an opportunity to Members on all sides to identify local needs, although it is inevitable that the Government must consider the overall figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The Minister made two important points.  He said the study was a needs assessment, not a strategic road investment programme.  It represents the start of a process.  I hope this report is not written in stone and is open to flexibility as the need arises.  It identifies the backlogs across the State and where immediate concerns exist.  This is such a fast changing society that much of what is written here could be redundant ten years time, and certainly within the lifetime of the next round of Structural Funds.</P>
    <P>Like Senator O'Brien, I also congratulate the Minister and Minister of State, and the political masters in the Customs House on fighting their case so effectively at the Cabinet table.  The Estimates announced today provide for a significant increase of 80 per cent in the roads programme for next year.  No one could call £48 million petty cash.  We await with interest the allocation of this money to the local authorities.  In common with all of my colleagues, I compliment the NRA on its work and not only the current Minister, but those who were in office during the lifetime of the operational programme from 1994-9.  The money has been well spent.  There are local quibbles, but that will always be the case.</P>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge the excellent work which continues to be carried out on the N4, the Dublin to Sligo route.  I single out this route not just because it brings me home much quicker than it used to, but because it is opening up a deprived region.  In the context of the ongoing debate about Objective One status, it is precisely these arguments which are being made by those calling for regionalisation.  Better access opens up a world of economic and social opportunities and no one should begrudge the argument for regionalisation on this basis.  It is not about depriving other parts of the State, it is about equity in the rising economic tide.  It is clear from the needs study that the NRA recognises this in many cases.  I am, however, disappointed that priority has not been given to the completion of the alternative bypass through Roscommon leading to the west, which has been put back to 2010.</P>
    <P>The road works programme was initiated in 1995-6, when local authorities were obliged to present to the Department of the Environment and Local Government a five year road needs assessment for county, secondary and regional roads within their jurisdiction.  If one considers the implementation of that programme from its initiation in 1996, there are few local authorities which would not say they had accelerated this programme, with the help of Government money, to the point where the five year plan will be completed by the end of next year.  They will not only finish on target but perhaps 18 months ahead.  If one correlates that with this needs study, the needs as stated here might be upgraded in the context of ongoing needs assessment.  The N16 from Sligo to the Fermanagh border and on to <Col N="53" /> Larne harbour is included in the last stage of phasing, 2015-19.  This might be reassessed.</P>
    <P>The road network which runs through the spine of the country from Athlone, through Birr and Roscrea, to Horse and Jockey is effectively the main thoroughfare for those from the north travelling to the southern capital.  I am disappointed that priority has not been given to this section of road, with the exception of a piece from Thurles to Horse and Jockey.  I recently travelled on that road and it could do with upgrading.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the issue of integration.  He stated that it is vital that road development policy is not considered in isolation.  Through the national development plan and the work leading up to it, Ireland's transport development needs will be assessed in an integrated way taking full account of the contribution to be made by all transport modes.  In other words, it is vital that we develop our rail network to the same high standard as is proposed for the road network. Perhaps the Minister might consider investment in rail development &mdash; improved rolling stock and the reopening of lines, such as the Sligo to Limerick line, for freight traffic &mdash; in the context of the national development plan which will be put before us in the next 18 months.  Parts of the State are being choked, yet we have an under-used rail network onto which freight could be diverted. That is a separate debate, but it is vital not to lose sight of the fact that we need an integrated programme of investment in our infrastructure which is not simply about roads or rail.  The two must work in tandem or the rest of the State will face the problems which exist in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is no east-west link on the map.  If we are talking about the development of an eastern corridor from Belfast to Rosslare, there is an equal need for an east-west link to access the peripheral regions.  There is no main route between Dundalk and Galway.  The entire county of Leitrim does not appear on the map for the simple reason that it has a very small portion of national primary roads and no national secondary roads.</P>
    <P>I welcome this needs study and acknowledge what the NRA has done to start the ball rolling. I also acknowledge the contribution the Government has made.  I hope we can return to the subject more regularly than once every five years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the opportunity to discuss this issue.  We debated road safety recently, but neglected to mention the needs analysis carried out by the National Roads Authority.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that the road network affects all of us.  It affects how we get to work, how we transport produce to the market and how tourists travel.  It affects farmers, business people and workers.  The road network has a huge impact on economic and social life.  It is the key ingredient in our economic success.  Without investment in this area the economy will cease to grow.  We have seen a change in Irish culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> People are no longer afraid to commute to work for an hour to an hour and a half.  Cars are better, roads are improving and the price of houses in central areas such as Galway, Limerick and Cork is out of the reach of many people.  Developments are going up in places such as Athenry, Castlebar, Headford, Tuam and various satellite towns around Galway.  People are choosing to live further from the city and where they work and they have to commute daily.  This is increasing the amount of traffic on our roads.</P>
    <P>We need to recognise that if we do not ensure the road structure is maintained and improved people will not be able to travel to work.  One example &mdash; and I am being parochial &mdash; is the N84 from Castlebar to Galway.  A huge number of people from Headford, an area which has developed greatly, commute using that road.  It is a national secondary route which needs huge development.  However, it is disappointing to see in the plan that it has not been earmarked for major improvement until 2005-10.  We need to reassess funding to meet the needs of certain locations.  If we want to encourage investment in the regions and peripheral areas we must provide the infrastructure.  As Senator Mooney said, we need regionalisation to ensure we get Structural and Cohesion Funds for the areas which have suffered because greater funding is given to the east.</P>
    <P>This is a plan for the future and is indicative of the way this Government is doing business.  We have strategically reviewed present provisions. We have projected the need of those using the road network and costed and planned for that. Six billion pounds has been set aside for a 20 year programme.  There is also an implementation plan.  The document recognises that plans need to be reviewed.  As we go through the work programme we will see additional needs coming on stream, the changing of criteria and needs and, therefore, the changing of priorities.  Any good plan needs to be constantly evaluated and where necessary changes will have to be made.</P>
    <P>The study shows that much has been done in the past number of years.  However, it also highlights the huge amount that needs to be done.  It is important that investment is made in the western road network.  There is huge economic development in Galway city, county and in Connemara. However, the biggest problem we have is getting our produce from the far end of Connemara through Galway city and on to Dublin.  We need to recognise that this is a barrier to development. This involves interdepartmental agencies working together &mdash; the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment must work with the Department of the Environment and Local Government which must work with the roads section and local authorities so there is a cohesive approach to the development of support for businesses and our economy.</P>
    <P>It is important that the debate encompasses regionalisation.  If there is regionalisation and the parts of the country which need it most get Objective <Col N="55" /> One status, I hope there will be continued Exchequer investment and that the west will not lose out.  That is the fight in front of us if we get Objective One status.</P>
    <P>The report covers road safety.  One of the problems with building better roads is that they are easier to travel on and cars are better and faster. While we are improving road conditions, it is important to look at road safety.  The report has identified the different measures which can be undertaken in that area &mdash; safety audits on roads throughout the country and a computerised database identifying areas of high risk; this is very valuable.  It is important to attack the issue of road safety cohesively and improving road conditions is one way of addressing road safety and reducing the number of deaths on our roads. Road safety is a matter of personal attitude.  We get into a car, we choose to drive at a certain speed, we choose whether to wear a safety belt, and if we have a few drinks, we choose whether to drive.  Until attitudes to road safety change we will not significantly reduce the number of road deaths.  No traffic calming or other countermeasures will affect that.</P>
    <P>It has recently come to my attention that many of these wonderful traffic calming measures introduced outside towns and villages are causing difficulty to traffic carrying wide loads.  One can often see where a signpost has been knocked down or knocked sideways because it has been hit by a wide load.  We need to take that on board.  A traffic calming measure should not impact on the ability of trucks and loads getting from one part of the country to another.</P>
    <P>I welcome the part of the report which deals with the environment.  It is important that, as the country and its culture changes, we recognise that people's concern about the environment is real and valid.  Public consultation should become a reality.  There should be better public consultation at local and national level when it comes to implementing major road improvements.  I welcome the report, the strategic thrust of it and the way we are doing our business &mdash; looking at what needs to be done, assessing it, making a plan and reviewing it as time goes on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty with this report.  Obviously it contains some fine measures and conclusions.  However, I find the exclusion of a southern corridor objectionable.  The western corridor continues to Limerick, Tipperary and on to New Ross.  This report was commissioned by the NRA and funded by the EU.  Any report which excludes the second capital and does not give access to the southern region begs a question. I have told Ministers that I am extremely concerned about the exclusion of the continuation of the road from Limerick to Cork and on to Rosslare.  That would benefit the counties which need it.  Why has this corridor been excluded?  There is no answer in this report.  I ask <Col N="56" /> the Minister of State to convey my concerns and those of others to Government.</P>
      <P>Twenty five per cent of agricultural produce comes from County Cork; it cannot be excluded. We cannot exclude Kerry and Cork which benefit substantially from tourism.  We cannot virtually exclude Limerick because Limerick city is in the eastern part of the county.  It is unfair and unjust. I want to say that clearly.  The south-western regional authority is extremely concerned about this, as am I.</P>
      <P>If one wants to facilitate fair and even development in this country we should have an east-west corridor.  That is not in the report either and I do not know why.  If we are planning for the future, then surely there is sense in the southern link and the continuation of the western corridor and the east-west link.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Wallace back to the House.  He is also from Cork.  I object strenuously to this report because the continuation of the western corridor from Limerick to the southern capital of Cork, the second biggest city in Ireland, is excluded.  That is inexcusable. I hope the Minister of State sees my comments as wishing to benefit the whole southern region.  Excluding that corridor is excluding benefit to the whole southern region.</P>
      <P>There should be an east-west link through the midlands.  The country needs and deserves that.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State.  I have a few comments on the National Road Needs Study.  I represent the west, and the national primary route, the N5, comes out of this very badly.  The majority of the section from Charlestown to the Roscommon border will not be completed for 15 to 20 years.  That is an indictment. We cannot question the basis of the report. It was probably compiled on road traffic counts but does this always justify it?</P>
      <P>I wish to question a number of issues in relation to policies set down by the National Roads Authority.  If the Government decides to regionalise the country where does that leave us in relation to the National Road Needs Study? Will a separate authority have the power to put forward the roads in the study?  Many questions are left unanswered.  Did the National Roads Authority consult the IDA when it was compiling this report?  Did it consult with all the development agencies in all the regions?  I am more than disappointed with the report.  I am not disappointed with the basis of the report; I cannot question the integrity of the people who compiled the report and the basis they used; however I am more than disappointed for my own region with the results of this needs study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to give the Minister of State example of the way the National Roads Authority conducts its business.  Recently during the redistribution of the £114 million for Luas, Castlebar received in excess of £1 million to carry out work on a section of the road on the outskirts of Castlebar.  The <Col N="57" /> National Roads Authority used an estimate carried out by the local authority 14 or 15 years ago. The National Roads Authority specifically stated that the contract had to go to public tender.  Mayo County Council has carried out excellent work with contractors on other national primary routes.  However in this case, a small contract based on an estimate for the job carried out 14 or 15 years ago had to go to public tender.  The amount of money allocated will amount to about one-third of the cost of the job.  I would like to know how it can do this.  The job will cost £3 million pounds to complete, the National Roads Authority is allocating only £1 million and it has to go to public tender.  The contractor will have to tender for £1 million for a job which will cost £3 million.  There will obviously have to be a number of other tenders.  More money will have to be allocated.  It is a very foolish way for the National Roads Authority to distribute its funding.</P>
    <P>All the public representatives in the west are more than disappointed with the results of the National Road Needs Study in relation to the national primary route, the N5.  It is quite serious that work being done on the basis of this needs study will not be carried out on most of this route until after 2015.  This has very serious consequences for our region.  If the country is regionalised how will this affect the report?  Can it be brought forward?  What is the position?  I am sorry to say I am totally against this report.</P>

      <P>I welcome the National Road Needs Study because now at last we know what the NRA intends to do.  It probably should have told us years ago but now at least it is giving us an insight into what they hope to do in the next 20 years.  Senator Burke may not like what he has read but at least it appears that somebody is working and looking forward.</P>
      <P>Coming from a Border region, prior to this it appeared that there were no roads north of the Dublin to Galway route.  I sincerely hope that following from this report the Dublin to Donegal route, the Dublin to Derry route and my area will get our fair share of the cake.  For that reason I hope regionalisation will take place.  Then we will be included.</P>
      <P>In Cavan and Monaghan we have been dependent on heavy traffic industry, particularly in the agri-business of mushrooms, and poultry and in furniture.  We do not have a rail system so we are totally dependent on the road network.  Unless we assist counties such as my own they will be left behind.  The east and midlands have done extremely well.  However, in counties such as my own we have the same unemployment rate as years ago as we are still dependent on the same industries.  The main industries are agri-business and indigenous industries.  If we are to keep up with other counties we need a road network which will bring us from A to B. The important thing is how quickly business can be carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In welcoming this report, I hope areas such as <Col N="58" /> Cavan and Monaghan get their fair share when funds are being allocated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this study is an assessment of the road needs of the country. Senator Coghlan said it is a blueprint which needs some amendment.  The purpose of the debate is to bring influence to bear on Government to make decisions to which we can all subscribe.</P>
      <P>One hopes that the NRA, which is charged with responsibility for implementing policy in relation to road improvements, will ensure that this is done in a cost-effective manner from a transport point of view.  There is a need for lorry parks on the roads given the introduction of the tacograph and EU regulations.  Many transport operators complain that there are no such places for them.  People in Roscrea and Enniscorthy approached the NRA on this issue.  The NRA stated that these parks cannot be provided on national routes but lorry parks need to be provided on national routes which carry most of the heavy traffic.  There is an inconsistency and lack of foresight here.  These types of glitches need to be eradicated from the system.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the N30 between New Ross and Enniscorthy which, according to the report, is to be upgraded to a standard two-lane road. This applies to the section from Clonroche but there is a section from Scarke on the New Ross side of Clonroche which is very deficient.  This means improving a section of road which needs to be improved but bringing all the traffic into a funnel and causing a bottleneck in another area. This would be very hazardous and dangerous. The report contains oversights such as this which I hope will be removed when the plans are finalised.</P>
      <P>The N25 does not figure prominently in the report.  There have been major improvements on parts of the N25.  One would have thought that the completion of the improvement works on the N25 between Wexford and New Ross would also have been included in the plans.</P>
      <P>The N24 which many see as the link from the west to the south-east &mdash; particularly the Europort of Rosslare &mdash; needs further attention.  The standard to which we develop our roads needs to be looked at.  In some instances the vision is much too shortsighted and we are looking at roads which will not be able to accommodate the volume of traffic in the next ten to 20 years.  We should look much further ahead than a 20 year timespan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the road from Dublin to Cork.  I cannot think of any two major cities in any European country that are not joined by a motorway. In Britain and all over Europe one can get from the city straight on to a motorway that will take one to the next major centre of population.  The report seems to suggest that future works be carried out primarily to dual carriageway standard.  I question whether we need more vision in this regard.  Motorways are much safer and more <Col N="59" /> economic.  Good roads are fundamental to an increasingly competitive economy throughout Europe where there is harmonisation of taxation and so on.  In the same way that the arteries in the body circulates the blood which keeps us all functioning, roads are the arteries for transportation in any economy.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to find areas of capital investment that would yield the same return as investment in roads.  At a time when there is a budget surplus it is imperative that we improve our roads, not just for this generation but for future generations.  If we get this right now and the blueprint is correct, it will stand as a monument to forward thinking in the future.  We should look to continental countries which are prime examples in this regard.  My overall criticism of the plan is that it is not sufficiently visionary and will not meet future long-term needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> I welcome the Minister's announcement of an allocation of £312 million in this regard.  This increase of 18 per cent is significant given that inflation is running at 3 per cent.  I hope that when priority is being given to the plan we will not be looking to spend £6 billion in the next 20 years.  I suggest an investment of less than £500 million per year, most of which will have to be funded by the Exchequer.  Under the last roads programme, £1.4 billion was spent on our national roads, £900 million of which was funded by the European Union.  This indicates that a real culture change is required at departmental and Government level to make the necessary significant investment necessary in our roads.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and for his contribution to the debate.  I know he is committed to improvements in this regard and I wish him success.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Matters. - Health Insurance for Psychological Services.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Latin saying <i>mens sana in corpore sano</i> refers to a sound mind in a sound body and it is that matter I seek to address.  Many people with physical symptoms have undiagnosed psychiatric illnesses.  Stress is a causative and exacerbating factor in illnesses as diverse as arthritis, hypertension, cardiac problems, infertility, etc.  However, one can have a medical consultation for the Nutron diet and it is tax deductible but a consultation with a psychologist or counselling therapist must be paid for in full by the patient.</P>
      <P>It is unfair that holders of private medical insurance, whether with BUPA or the VHI, if referred to a psychologist for a consultation must pay the full cost of such services.  The psychological services in Ireland are fully professional and the practitioners generally have a university training to masters level.  I do not refer to psychics or people with limited counselling training, but to those with third level qualifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some health boards provide a service with resident psychologists, therapists and counsellors for medical card holders.  However, those not holding medical cards may not avail of the psychological <Col N="61" /> services without paying in full.  I do not decry the fact that such people are outside the medical card scheme, rather the unfairness of the arrangements.</P>
    <P>A doctor will often prescribe medication for a patient.  However, if an issue of mental health or stress is involved the patient may be referred to a psychiatrist.  In many cases the services of a psychologist would be equally valuable and in some cases even more so.  Society and people have become so busy that nobody is available to listen anymore.  The religious tradition of confession seems to be dying out and, for all its shortcomings, it provided many people with an outlet to express their difficulties to a receptive source.</P>
    <P>If one is referred to a psychiatrist by their doctor medical insurance will cover the consultation but if one is referred to a psychologist one is not covered.  I am aware that there is a good counselling and psychological service available to those suffering from cancer related illnesses and it is to be applauded.</P>
    <P>With regard to BUPA health insurance in particular, full cover for psychological services was introduced for its customers in the UK.  Much has been made of the great service BUPA offers to its Irish customers but I do not understand why there is a discrimination between the Irish and the British subscribers.</P>
    <P>I have taken trouble to research this matter and there is a body of research evidence which shows that a proper psychological service results in reduced medical costs.  It would seem not only fair but desirable if it reduces costs to change the arrangements for medical insurance subscribers. Our European neighbours Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Finland, Italy, the UK and the Netherlands provide that holders of insurance can avail of psychological services, in some cases on an in-patient basis but in many cases on an outpatient basis.  However, no such allowance is made for people in Ireland.</P>
    <P>It does not appear that all citizens are being treated equally in this matter.  It cannot be right to separate mind and body in a healing process, particularly when highly qualified professional services are available.  All citizens should have access to such services.  For once it is the people who have some means who are being excluded rather than those who have none.  I applaud the health boards for their services.  I ask the Minister of State to take my request on board.  It would be a positive step for mental health.  The private health insurers must be taken to task on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey) Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Fahey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Ridge for raising this issue.  By way of introduction, it should be explained that our private health insurance system had its origins in the need to provide protection against the cost of hospitalisation for those who were outside the entitlement to public hospital services.  Private health <Col N="62" /> insurance has developed in this way up to the present time and now covers in excess of 40 per cent of the total population.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand that, in an insurance context, Senator Ridge's motion gives rise to a complex and important range of considerations. It involves issues relating to commercial freedom, financial capacity, customer preference, competition and appropriate legislative intervention.</P>
      <P>There are, of course, significant and obvious implications to the State intervening into the decisions of commercial undertakings as regards what services they can and should cover in a competitive market.  No doubt we would all agree that there would need to be appropriate and compelling public policy reasons for the State to impinge upon the behaviour of individual private commercial bodies or, indeed, an entire market.</P>
      <P>Looking at the broad picture of the legislation and regulation of health insurance business, the corollary to proceeding on the lines of Senator Ridge's motion would require the regulations governing minimum benefit to be extended to cover the services of psychologists.  For the information of Members of the House it should be explained that these regulations require that each health insurance contract must not provide benefits below a prescribed level, referred to as minimum benefit.</P>
      <P>The key rationale for the existence of minimum benefit is to support community rating by requiring insurers to undertake a broad spread of risk in order to reduce the scope for designing products aimed primarily or exclusively at the young and healthy.</P>
      <P>The success of community rating is dependent on inter-generational solidarity.  If insurers are in a position to offer health insurance contracts aimed at low risk groups with lower levels of, or less extensive, cover than is generally available, the degree of inter-generational solidarity within the present health insurance market could be undermined.  In the absence of minimum benefit requirements, it would be open to insurers to design plans specifically to attract younger low risk people.</P>
      <P>At this point, it should be clarified that it is not open to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, under the legislation governing the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to direct it to cover particular classes of service.  The Minister believes this is as it should be, and as the board wishes to have it, by reference to the board's freedom to make its own strategic and commercial judgments about its operations.</P>
      <P>The Department is currently engaged in the preparation of a White Paper on private health insurance which has involved receipt of submissions from and discussions with a large variety of interests.  The Psychological Society of Ireland was among the bodies which presented views in connection with the preparation of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> A number of submissions received on the White Paper called for the enhancement of the minimum benefit requirements under health insurance contracts.  The case was put, in some instances, that interventions of particular kinds, encouraged by the availability of benefits, would actually prove cost effective for insurers in that they would reduce the incidence, duration or frequency and, consequently, the associated high cost, of hospital in-patient stays.</P>
    <P>The Minister has noted these assertions and he is aware that the insured public will always welcome the addition of benefits provided these are not contingent upon increased premiums.  He considers this to be essentially a product development issue and it falls to the promoting interests to convince the insurers of the force and merits of their case.</P>
    <P>Such a dynamic is part of what characterises a free and competitive market.  As has been explained already, the primary rationale for minimum benefit is the support and protection of community rating by limiting the scope for the development of health insurance contracts which are targeted at the young to the exclusion of the elderly.</P>
    <P>There is a question as to whether it would be disproportionate and an undue interference in the commercial freedom of insurers, to include further services under the minimum benefit arrangements.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other providers of health services who would see themselves as having a case, just as legitimate and well-based as psychologists, for inclusion under minimum benefit. Against this, there is the position of insurers to be considered, not simply in the sense of their commercial freedom but also as regards their financial capacity to have liability for additional services, which did not form part of the traditional minimum cover, thrust upon them by dint of regulation.  In addition to the practical matters of financing new benefits, insurers, having regard to customer feedback, need to have scope to move towards addressing what would be most favourably regarded by their customers in the way of enhanced benefits.</P>
    <P>The advisory group on risk equalisation.  which reported to the Minister in April this year, advocated the removal of ancillary health services from the ambit of the existing health insurance regulatory framework.  This is among the matters being considered by the Department in the context of the preparation of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that what I have said on the Minister's behalf will provide an insight into the difficult and important considerations which lie behind Senator Ridge's motion.  The submission of the Psychological Society of Ireland on private health insurance and psychological services will be given the fullest consideration in the context of the preparation of the White Paper.  The aim is to complete work on this in the current year <Col N="64" /> and, subject to Government approval, to publish it shortly thereafter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I wish to raise on the Adjournment concerns the failure of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to institute a ban on the use of phosphates in detergents in the catchment area of the Shannon region, including Lough Derg.  This has occurred despite the fact that prior to the last general election it was stated Fianna Fáil Party policy that this would happen.  Instead, there has been obvious foot dragging on the issue.  I appeal to the Minister to use his powers under the current statute to sign a ministerial order to ban the use of phosphates in detergents in the Shannon catchment area.</P>
      <P>The state of Lough Derg, one of the country's finest lakes, is well known.  It has been polluted largely by phosphates, not only in household detergents but also through the use of agricultural fertilisers.  It is a matter of considerable public concern that Lough Derg's fishing capacity has been reduced by over 50 per cent in the last decade and it is not recovering as was expected.  The level of fishing in the lake is extremely disappointing and the water quality is still seriously affected despite the fact that the Department of the Environment and Local Government is funding a water monitoring programme on the rivers and tributaries feeding into it.</P>
      <P>One the one hand the Department is obviously concerned about the state of the water in Lough Derg and surrounding areas but, on the other, it is failing to do something which would have considerable beneficial effects on water quality.</P>
      <P>I do not need to explain to the House what phosphates do to a lake.  They create a condition known as eutrophication causing massive growth in algae and numerous other plants.  This effectively strangles the lake's wildlife, including fish, by reducing the amount of oxygen in the water. Studies done over the last number of years consistently show that over-feeding of the water by phosphates is causing serious water quality problems. The aim of this motion is the banning of phosphates in detergents in the area of the lake. I support the campaign of a fine local group, Save Our Lough Derg and of other environmental groups who are appealing for such a ban.  I add my voice to theirs in appealing to the Minister to sign the ministerial order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We speak on behalf of a large number of consumers who have put pressure on detergent companies to make greener products.  For example, on the continent the Persil company sell phosphate-free detergent tablets while the tablets sold in this country contain more than 30 per cent phosphates.  This shows that the current voluntary <Col N="65" /> code practised by the Irish Detergent and Allied Products Association is little more than an empty formula.  Indeed, my colleague, former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, stated when he met local groups, including Save Our Lough Derg, in September that he had been mistaken as Minister not to have instituted a ban on the use of phosphates in detergents because he had believed the industry when they told him a voluntary code would be sufficient.  It is clear that a voluntary code is not sufficient and that the commitment from the industry simply is not there.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to help us in our struggle to restore Lough Derg to its former glory, to improve the water quality of the lake and in doing so to improve what is not merely a huge environmental resource in north Tipperary and the surrounding counties but a lake which should be a source of national pride and which should be allowed to live again.  I look forward to the response of the Minister of State and I hope he will tell me that an order in this regard is about to be signed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator O'Meara for raising this matter.  I am pleased to have the opportunity afforded by this Adjournment motion to comment on the position in relation to water quality generally and in particular in the Lough Derg and Lough Ree catchments.</P>
      <P>Members will be aware that a major part of our inland waterways are unpolluted.  For some years, however, there has been an increasing incidence of eutrophication.  Some 28 per cent of our rivers are now slightly or moderately polluted according to the most recent data published by the Environmental Protection Agency.  This is a cause of concern and is being addressed by a comprehensive catchment based strategy to combat eutrophication. Phosphorous has been identified as the primary cause of eutrophication in Irish rivers and lakes.  Phosphorous arises from several sources including sewage effluent, industrial discharges, agriculture and domestic detergents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several actions have been taken at national level as part of the overall strategy to reduce inputs of phosphorous to our waters.  My Department is financing a major investment programme by local authorities to upgrade sewerage networks and waste water treatment facilities throughout the country.  This investment programme is substantially supported by the Cohesion Fund.  A code of good agriculture practice was launched in 1996 to protect waters from pollution.  The code was developed in consultation with the main farming organisations.  Teagasc has revised downward its recommended application rates for phosphorous for grassland. Some 40,000 farmers in REP schemes are complying with nutrient management plans.  Local authorities have been given power to require <Col N="66" /> other farmers to prepare such plans and my Department has issued guidelines to assist local authorities in this regard.  Industrial discharges are the subject of strict licensing and monitoring by the EPA and local authorities.  I expect to conclude an agreement with the detergents industry to reduce further the phosphorous contribution from household detergents.</P>
    <P>In July this year I made regulations to provide a firm statutory support for these measures.  The regulations establish specific targets for the reduction of phosphorous levels in rivers and lakes.  The regulations are the most significant ever made in respect of water quality in Ireland. In general, they provide for the achievement of incremental improvements in water quality over a ten year timeframe.  The more long-term aim will be to achieve satisfactory water quality in all rivers and lakes.  The regulations represent a first and important step towards this goal.</P>
    <P>In addition to these national measures a specific initiative is under way for the catchment areas of Lough Derg and Lough Ree.  The objective is to develop a comprehensive monitoring and management system for these catchments involving participation by all the relevant national and local interests.  This initiative is backed by a £50 million investment programme in sewerage infrastructure in the catchments.</P>
    <P>These measures are beginning to have a positive impact.  The latest estimates show that the annual sales of phosphorous fertiliser nationally has decreased by 30 per cent over the last two years.  In relation to Lough Derg, there are already signs of improved water quality, especially in the lower and middle sections of the lake.  These positive indications are very encouraging. I hope that all the interests concerned will press on with their efforts.  I am fully committed to the implementation of all the measures in the national strategy for which I am responsible.</P>

      <P>I raise this issue in the light of the recent debate on Objective One status and the statement by the Industrial Development Authority that the loss of Objective One status would be a major disadvantage in attracting industry to the disadvantaged areas of the west and mid-west.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The record of the IDA in attracting industry to the west, the north-west and the midlands is deplorable.  The last annual report of the IDA shows clearly that 80 per cent of new jobs were created on the east coast and a minimal number came to the west and mid-west.  In the light of the rapid decline in confidence in farming and in farm incomes, if this policy does not change the culture of rural Ireland will change completely.  For the past number of years, more than 100 farmers <Col N="67" /> have been leaving the land every week.  Small towns in the west and mid-west depended on their rural hinterland for their commercial viability.  Consumer spending in the farming sector has fallen and commercial activity in towns has also dropped.  Unless the focus of the IDA is redirected to the areas of mass disadvantage we will see even greater depopulation in the west of Ireland and the midlands.  I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to influence the direction of the IDA and attempt to fill the industrial vacuum in the region.</P>
    <P>We hear warnings that an overheating economy <Col N="68" /> could be the catalyst which would cause a recession.  There is always a catalyst for a recession and economists claim an overheating economy is one.  In my opinion, underheating in the farm homesteads of Ireland will be the catalyst for the next recession.  The underheating will be the result of the people's inability to heat their homes due to a lack of money.</P>
