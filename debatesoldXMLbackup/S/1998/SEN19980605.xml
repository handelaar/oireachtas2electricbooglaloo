      <P>I have notice from Senator Mooney that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to consider harnessing the celebrity status of our national heroes through radio, television and other media advertisements to encourage adults with poor writing and reading skills to avail of the adult literacy courses provided throughout the country and to consider the introduction of the Bookstart scheme in Ireland following its success in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Ridge of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Public Enterprise to provide additional capital funding to Bus Átha Cliath in order to improve access for the disabled on public transport.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 1, Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1998.  I ask the House's co-operation in taking all Stages. The Bill puts into statutory effect the proposals of the independent commission on constituency boundaries.  No amendments have been tabled.  I propose 15 minutes per speaker.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if all Members are happy with all the contents of the Bill but, given that it is the result of the report of the commission, we will not be challenging it.  We have no difficulty in agreeing to the Order of Business as outlined by the Acting Leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I wish to raise an important matter. It is a serious matter when a former Taoiseach <Col N="1102" /> intervenes in day to day politics.  I wish to draw the attention of the Acting Leader to the remarks made yesterday and reported in today's <i>Examiner</i> of Deputy Reynolds.  Will the Acting Leader provide Government time to discuss this matter? Will the Acting Leader ask the Taoiseach to come to this House, the only House of the Oireachtas sitting today, and first, confirm that Deputy Reynolds did advise him not to appoint Mr. Ray Burke to the Cabinet and, second, confirm that Deputy Reynolds and Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn referred him specifically to files in the Department of Justice dealing with passports for sale?  I want to know the result of that inquiry, if he inquired into it and if it affected his decision. Third, on a related matter, I want the immediate publication of the review carried out by the Government last May into the passports for sale controversy.  The Acting Leader will remember that he referred to this report in his contribution on that debate earlier this year.</P>
    <P>This file is relevant to the allegations made yesterday by Deputy Reynolds and to many aspects of the current controversy.  It is my belief that this file has been suppressed.  It certainly has not been published, as we were told it would be, during that holding debate earlier this year.  The Acting Leader would agree with me that in the interests of the openness and transparency with which all parties &mdash; and his party in particular &mdash; are credited, immediate steps should be taken to publish this report.  I ask that the Order of Business be expanded to invite the Taoiseach to the House as this is the only House sitting and as these matters are of immediate importance.</P>

      <P>I understand the Acting Leader's desire to deal with all Stages of the Bill today, although people outside this House have said they would have liked the constituencies redrawn in a different way.  I do not object to dealing with all Stages of the Bill.  I share Senator Manning's concern about the revelations in today's newspapers and perhaps the Acting Leader can arrange for the Taoiseach to come to the House.</P>

      <P>I do not object to the Government's decision on the euro.  However, it is appropriate that we debate the recent recommendation of the European Parliament that countries joining EMU will be excluded from the allocation of Cohesion Funds.  This is an extraordinary decision which will have serious implications for Ireland.  I ask for an opportunity to debate this issue because this kind of recommendation, after a decision has been made on the euro, is unhelpful. I appreciate the final decision will be made by the Council of Ministers.  However, there are implications if the recommendation is acted upon by the Council.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House to advise us on what steps can be taken to prevent the horrific attacks on old <Col N="1103" /> people, the most recent of which was in Bricin's Park in my constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Manning and Senator Henry for agreeing to the arrangements on item 1.  As regards the Taoiseach's availability to come to the House, it is virtually impossible to arrange that at such short notice given the Taoiseach's programme, notwithstanding the serious nature of these matters.  The House has no control over Deputy Albert Reynolds and any remarks he makes.  In these circumstances it is difficult to agree to Senator Manning's request. I agree with the Senator that the review on the passports scheme should be published.  The scheme was stopped and only outstanding applications will be dealt with.</P>
      <P>Senator Finneran asked for a debate on EMU. The European Communities Bill will be before the House next Thursday and that will be an opportunity to debate this matter in detail.  There will also be an opportunity for debate when we deal with the EMU Bill.</P>
      <P>Senator Kett raised attacks on the elderly.  It is appalling that people have lost their lives as a result of gratuitous violence and robbery.  This concerns everyone and I am sure the Minister would like to come to the House to discuss it. However, in the absence of new legislation, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authorities, notwithstanding the fact that the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has a keen interest and a strong desire to ensure that these attacks stop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the <Col N="1104" /> Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1998, is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the constituencies in respect of which Members are elected to the Dáil.  The constituencies proposed in the Bill are those recommended by the 1998 Constituency Commission, the first established under the Electoral Act, 1997.  The new constituencies will come into force on the next dissolution of the Dáil.  They will not have effect in relation to any by-elections held in the meantime.</P>
      <P>The constitutional requirements in relation to Dáil membership and constituencies are set out in Article 16.  They may be summarised as follows: the number of Members must be fixed from time to time by law; there must be at least one Member for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one for every 20,000; the ratio between the number of Members to be elected for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census must, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country; the Oireachtas must revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years with due regard to changes in distribution of the population &mdash; the legal advice to the previous Government was that the Constitution requires revision of the constituencies whenever a census discloses substantial changes in population; and the number of Members to be returned for any constituency must not be less than three.</P>
      <P>These constitutional provisions were considered by the courts in two cases in 1961 &mdash; the High Court case of John O'Donovan <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961.  In neither of these cases did the courts quantify the precise degree of equality of representation which is required by the Constitution, although the judge in the O'Donovan case appeared to suggest that a departure of about 5 per cent from strict mathematical parity would be acceptable.</P>
      <P>Dealing with the question of equality of representation in the subsequent reference case, the Supreme Court stated that it could not lay down a figure above or below which a variation from the national average is not permitted.  The court stressed that the practical considerations which ought to be taken into account, and the weight that should be attached to them in departing from strict equality of representation, are primarily matters for the Oireachtas and should not be reviewed by the courts unless there is a &ldquo;manifest infringement&rdquo; of the relevant article of the Constitution. The court concluded that the test to be applied is whether the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of Members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> In each revision of constituencies effected between 1961 and 1974 the limit of 5 per cent, suggested in the O'Donovan case, was adhered to.  However, more substantial departures from mathematical equality were provided for in the revisions carried out since 1974, based on the recommendations of independent commissions. The maximum departures in schemes recommended by non-statutory commissions were 7.6 per cent above the national average in the Louth constituency in 1990 and 7.9 per cent below the national average in the constituency of Mayo East in 1983.  The proposed constituencies in the Bill are within these departures.</P>
    <P>Part II of the Electoral Act, 1997, provides that, on publication of the census report, a commission must be established to review the constituencies for Dáil and European elections.  The commission is chaired by a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice and the members are the Ombudsman, the Secretary of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  The Act sets out the commission's terms of reference which, subject to the constitutional requirements, restrict total Dáil membership to the range 164-8.  The commission is required to report to the Chairman of the Dáil within six months of its establishment.  Reports of the commission must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference for Dáil constituencies as set out in section 6 of the Act provide that a constituency commission shall, in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution, have regard to the following: the total number of Members of the Dáil shall be not less than 164 and not more than 168; each constituency shall return three, four or five members; the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable, although this restriction does not extend to city boundaries or the administrative county boundaries in Dublin; each constituency shall be composed of contiguous areas and there shall be regard to geographic considerations including significant physical features and the extent of and density of population in each constituency. Subject to these provisions, the commission shall endeavour to maintain continuity in relation to the arrangement of constituencies.</P>
    <P>Volume 1 of the 1996 census, published in August 1997, showed that two constituencies, namely, Cork North-West and Galway East, have fewer than the constitutional minimum of 20,000 population per Deputy.  In other constituencies the number of persons represented by each Deputy varied significantly from the national average.  The variance from national average representation in Dublin West was almost 16 per cent and in Kildare North was almost 11 per cent. Thus, a revision of Dáil constituencies is now mandatory under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The commission was established by order made on 30 September 1997 and presented its report to the Ceann Comhairle on 26 March 1998.  In a <Col N="1106" /> press release issued to coincide with the publication of the report the commission outlined its overall approach to Dáil constituency review as follows:</P>
    <P>The commission reviewed each constituency, having regard to the overriding constitutional requirements, its terms of reference and the submissions received.  It gave particular attention to constituencies with variances exceeding 5 per cent from the national average representation. Where an adjustment was necessary, the commission examined the available options and recommended arrangements which it considers reasonable and practicable.  No change in the total number of Dáil deputies is recommended.</P>
    <P>The commission's approach to the Dublin area, having regard to its terms of reference, was to formulate coherent constituencies, bounded by readily identifiable physical features, which provide reasonable equality of representation and unite communities as far as practicable.  The commission also endeavoured to match constituency size with the particular circumstances of each locality.</P>
    <P>The commission's report was circulated to every Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure Senators welcome the high standard of presentation of the report which make the proposed boundary changes very clear.  I thank the chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, and the other members for their work. The commission carried out its task in a conscientious and impartial manner and it is right that we should record our appreciation of its report and work.</P>
    <P>The principle of having constituencies drawn up by an independent commission has applied since the first commission was set up by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1977.  Inherent in this approach is an implication that the commission's recommendations will be implemented in their entirety and this is what the Government is now proposing.  Of course, under the Constitution the ultimate responsibility for the revision of Dáil constituencies rests with the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that total Dáil membership will remain at 166 and increases the number of constituencies by one to 42.  There will be 16 three seat constituencies, 12 four seat and 14 five seat constituencies.  There are changes to 21 existing constituencies and the average population per Member ranges from 6.66 per cent above the national average in the Waterford constituency to 7.44 per cent below the national average in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area, the existing allocation of 47 Dáil seats is retained, assigned to 12 constituencies. A new constituency is being created, namely, Dublin Mid-West, and there are boundary changes in all 11 existing constituencies.  The seat allocation in five of the existing constituencies is being altered.  Discounting the new constituency, <Col N="1107" /> there will be a transfer between Dublin constituencies of 97,000 population.</P>
    <P>Outside Dublin, minor territorial changes are being made to ten constituencies, namely, four in Cork and the two constituencies in Counties Kildare, Galway and Limerick.  These changes involve a transfer of 20,200 population.  There is no change in the number of Deputies in any constituency outside Dublin.</P>
    <P>The commission also had the task of reporting on the constituencies for the European Parliament, the next elections for which will be held on Friday, 11 June 1999, the same day on which local elections will be held.  There are no constitutional provisions relating to the formation of European constituencies, but the commission's terms of reference require that there be reasonable equality of representation between constituencies.  In addition, section 15 of the European Parliament Elections Act, 1997, requires that the Minister shall, having considered the report of the constituency commission, submit proposals for a review of European constituencies to the Oireachtas by 1 December 2003 at latest and subsequently at least once every ten years.</P>
    <P>The 1996 census showed that the variances from national average representation in the existing four European constituencies ranged from minus 10.4 per cent in the Leinster constituency to plus 9.44 per cent in the Dublin constituency. In its report the commission indicated that most submissions made to it recommended no change in existing constituencies.  The commission examined alternative arrangements but concluded that &ldquo;no reasonable re-drawing of the constituencies would reduce the existing variances and result in coherent constituencies with which communities could identify&rdquo;.  The commission's recommendation that there be no change in the current formation of the four European constituencies has been accepted by the Government.</P>
    <P>To conclude, it is obvious from the report that the commission strove conscientiously to produce proposals in keeping with the Constitution and its terms of reference.  Where a difficult choice had to be made, the commission marshalled the available options and made an informed and reasoned recommendation.  While others might make a different choice, the commission carried out its appointed task in compliance with the guidelines given it and the Government believes its recommendations should be implemented in full. Accordingly, I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and thank him for his contribution which went into some detail regarding the recommendations of the commission.  The purpose of the Bill is to revise Dáil constituencies in light of the 1996 census of population and to legislate for the recommendations in the report of the constituency commission, the first statutory commission established under Part II of the Electoral Act, 1997. Prior to this five non-statutory commissions <Col N="1108" /> reported on Dáil constituencies.  I thank Mr. Justice Johnson and the members of the commission, including the Clerk of the Seanad, for their report, which is very readable and well presented. I also compliment them on the set of maps provided with the report which is of great assistance.</P>
      <P>Under the Constitution the number of Members of the Dáil must be fixed from time to time by law and the constituencies for which Members are elected must be determined by law and revised by the Oireachtas at least once every 12 years.  This is solely a matter for the Oireachtas.  The function of the commission is an advisory one.  Since the report of the first commission, set up in 1977, successive Governments have accepted the recommendations of commission reports without amendment.  The last commission report recommended that an area in Dún Laoghaire in the constituency of Dublin South be annexed to Dublin South-East.  Now the commission recommends that most of that electoral area be returned to the two respective constituencies. This is unfair to the elected members and to the electorate in general.</P>
      <P>The role of politicians in multi-seat constituencies is becoming more difficult every day.  First, members must compete within their own party; second, they must compete with other parties and, third, they must compete with constituency changes which may be recommended by the commission. Many public representatives who work hard on behalf of their electorate can find that a major part of their constituency has been moved to another constituency.  The commission carried out its functions under the terms of reference given to it by the Government.  However, the terms of reference are subordinate to the relevant constitutional provisions.  Some Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be disappointed with certain aspects of the recommendations of the commission and others will be very happy.  I have no doubt that the commission revised each constituency having regard to the overriding constitutional requirements and its terms of reference. Therefore, I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is fair to say that since the Minister for the Environment and Local Government came into office the Department has been very diligent in bringing forward much legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I join with the Minister and Senator Doyle in complimenting the commission on its report and the professional manner in which it enables people to understand the changes that have been made.  In 1977 Fianna Fáil when in Government decided that this exercise should be carried out on behalf of the Oireachtas by an independent commission.  This may not have been a wise decision given the changes made by the previous Government under a Labour Minister from Minister Dempsey's constituency.  That particular Minister did such a good job that I would have been inclined, as a member of Fianna Fáil, to have allowed the Labour Party continue to <Col N="1109" /> undertake this exercise on our behalf, hopefully with the same result as in 1977.  However, a precedent has been established and it is the prerogative of the Oireachtas to finalise the recommendations of the commission.  The changes in this report reflect the 1996 census and 166 Deputies will be returned following the next election.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very innovative and courageous in tackling the area of multi-seat constituencies. This reform will yield beneficial effects for local government in the future.  Multi-seat constituencies have served us well but given the demands on people there needs to be a radical rethink.  It is unfair in many respects, particularly to Deputies who may find themselves in internal competition and trying to serve a population of perhaps 100,000 people.  The demands are such that it is becoming increasingly more difficult and unattractive for people to participate in the democratic process.  It is very important that democracy is accessible and attractive so that there is competition during election time.  This is when competition is required, not between elections. Many Deputies work until 10 p.m. or midnight in this House and must attend functions and meetings in their constituencies during the weekends. It is becoming a 24-hour day, seven day a week job.  This puts enormous demands on Deputies and given the salary levels it is not seen as a very attractive career.  This is unfair to Deputies and to their families.  Everyone who participates in politics will realise that without the active support and understanding of their families it would not be possible to participate.  This should not be necessary to the extent that it is.</P>
    <P>It is also unfair to constituents because in many instances Deputies find themselves chasing one another into various parishes in their constituencies to hold clinics in order to keep their seats. While this is often criticised in the media, the criticism is totally unrealistic because if public representatives do not participate in this exercise their prospects of being returned to the Oireachtas are much slimmer and, given human nature, everyone endeavours to be successful in their chosen career.  If one wants to be successful in politics, one must participate in what is effectively a political rat race.  I believe this is unfair to constituents because, given the pressure of time and the number of constituents public representatives must serve, the attention to detail and the pursuit of various representations are not followed through as professionally as they might</P>
    <P>I believe constituents would get a much better service if public representatives were serving 20,000 people in a single seat constituency rather than 100,000 people in a multi-seat constituency. It is also inefficient and unfair to the legislative process in that there is limited time and scope available to people to participate in examining and involving themselves fully in the legislative process.  The more interaction there is between Members the better the quality of the legislation and the policies that will be produced.  Deputies <Col N="1110" /> need to be allowed to target their time more towards the legislative and policy area than their representational role and I cannot see that happening unless we move towards single seat constituencies and the transferable vote system.  This will need a degree of party consensus and it is something I would recommend as we move towards a new century and a new millennium.</P>
    <P>This Bill will dictate how the next election is run but we must plan for the future.  I know the Minister has a clear vision where he wants to go regarding national and local politics and I have no doubt he will address himself to every area within his remit.  I look forward to a further debate on this matter in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  As it has nothing to do with me, it would be extremely churlish to criticise it.  I welcome it more than I welcome the Seanad Electoral (Higher Education) Bill, 1998, which suggests changes to the way university Senators are elected.  It is a pity to single out one or two constituencies within the Seanad for electoral reform without looking at the Seanad as a whole.  I would only be too delighted to represent Limerick University, Dublin City University or several institutes of technology. Perhaps we should look at the Seanad as a whole, as the Constituency Commission did, rather than selecting and trying to change parts of it.  I compliment the Clerk for her involvement in the Constituency Commission.</P>
      <P>To show that all politics is local, I would like the House to pay attention to a book launched this week by Professor Michael Laver from Trinity College Dublin called <i>A New Electoral System for Ireland?</i> He carried out a study in association with the All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution.  We have discussed for some time the possibilities of changing our voting arrangements from the single transferable vote to another system.  Senator Walsh outlined some of the problems for people of the same party in multi-seat constituencies who compete with each other.  This book addresses that issue and the Minister discussed it several times.  People do not just compete with party members but with people in the same locality for the voting reasons mentioned by Senator Walsh.  This book quotes from an article written by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 30 November 1997 about changing the single transferable vote system.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>. reality is the multi-seat constituency that forces politicians to expend energies locally rather than nationally; one that means the winning of a medical card for a constituent is more valuable to the politician than any finely-crafted or well-motivated speech in the Dáil . [m]any politicians spend more time going to local funerals than they do preparing for Dáil debates.  This is not because they prefer to do so.  It is because they know better than anyone the meaning of the old phrase &ldquo;all politics is <Col N="1111" /> local&rdquo; . . [I]n Ireland we have institutionalised this core reality into a straitjacket that binds politicians and constituents together. . [W]e need to devise a system that ensures . accountability without enslaving politicians to local, client-bound, pressures.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies who constantly deal with local issues &mdash; one recognises the great difficulties faced by Ministers &mdash; sympathise with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea.</P>
    <P>This book is interesting because it shows how we could easily transfer to the additional member system, such as that in Germany and New Zealand, and still have our transferable vote.  There is a rub, however, for Fianna Fáil.  If we establish single seat constituencies, the people most likely to be elected are members of Fianna Fáil.  They, as well as a few well placed Fine Gael Deputies, would have to do the constituency work.  The list system would bring forward people from Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats and Democratic Left.  If there was strategic voting in the constituencies, the result would be almost the same as it is now.  The only difference would be the loss of the Independent Deputies because it would be extraordinarily difficult for them to make their way up a list.  They would have to form a political party.</P>
    <P>This book should be taken seriously.  Several senior politicians have written about this issue in the past, including Ms Gemma Hussey, Dr. Garret FitzGerald and Mr. John Boland.  It is interesting to note they were all Fine Gael members who would have gained from losing a great deal of constituency work if such a system was put in place.  We must take the report of the constitutional review group seriously when it is published.</P>
    <P>The first past the post system is extremely unfair.  I was interested to note that Professor Laver describes it as having been introduced in a pre-literate age when all one could hope for was that people would put an X on a piece of paper. I look forward to telling some of my colleagues on the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body that this is the basis for their system.  Our system is extraordinarily sophisticated.</P>
    <P>Professor Laver explains in great detail how strategic the voting would have to be in constituencies to get much the same result as we have at present.  He shows how clever we are already at strategic voting and believes the electorate would have little bother in getting a 75 per cent strategic voting level.  It is interesting to note that in the last election in the United Kingdom the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats managed to achieve a satisfactory level of strategic voting. That is one of the important reasons the two parties swept across the board and culled so many Conservative MPs from constituencies where they might have been considered more secure than they were.</P>
    <P>I encourage everyone to read this book because the issues are clearly explained.  There <Col N="1112" /> are huge benefits to be gained for everyone apart from elected members of Fianna Fáil who will have to redouble their efforts in going to funerals. According to the article written by the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last November, an enormous amount of work seems to be done by Deputies and Senators who, despite being elected from panels, regard themselves as representing various constituencies.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Constituency Commission on its work which must have been extraordinarily difficult.  I also commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a straightforward Bill which arises from the report of the Constituency Commission. Like other Senators, I thank the Clerk for her input into this report and subsequent legislation.  The Clerk's office is coming under increasing pressure because of the additional duties imposed on her not only in this context but in relation to referenda.  Just as the Minister and others are overstretched, so also are the staff of the Clerk's office.  They have an immense amount of work to do and additional burdens have been imposed on them without additional resources being allocated.  That should be taken into account by the Minister, the Department of the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>I welcome the people from the North Kildare constituency into the South Kildare constituency. I hope they do the decent thing on the day.  This and other reports have had a strong impact on Kildare.  In the earlier revisions places, such as Kilcullen, Ballymore Eustace and Castledermot in Kildare were included in the Wicklow constituency. It led to major problems from the point of view of the electorate knowing its TDs because at that time only one, Godfrey Timmins, was located west of the hills.  The electorate had difficulty identifying TDs and there was confusion between the local authority areas where TDs, who were very familiar with the Wicklow local authority, had to deal with officials in the Kildare local authority areas with whom they had not built a relationship.  There was the physical difficulty of servicing the area.  Senator Ross and Deputy Jacob used to come to Kilcullen regularly and it was an onerous trek across the hills for them.</P>
      <P>I accept the reality of having to abide by the constitutional imperative and I know the terms of reference say that, as far as possible, county boundaries should not be breached and that physical boundaries should be taken into account. I accept that and would not wish to see it changed.  It is a more comfortable situation even if it is not helpful from a small party's point of view to have the county treated as a whole, to have two separate constituencies in a county and to have the revision maintain that county integrity, as it has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In counties like County Kildare &mdash; I am sure this applies to the Minister's county &mdash; there has been rapid population growth.  The speed with which it will be required to change boundaries in <Col N="1113" /> those constituencies will lead to some difficulties and I do not have an easy prescription as to how it can be dealt with.  Again, we come back to the constitutional imperative placed upon us.  A factor which is somewhat relevant to that argument is the number of Deputies which would be elected.  There have been calls in the past for a smaller parliament and I see certain merit in that. Given the growing number of the committees the Houses operate, it is becoming difficult for Members to service them properly.  It is particularly difficult for small parties.  I am a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the SMI committee, the constitutional review committee, the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Affairs and probably another as well.  I would need to have the capacity for bi-location. It causes problems.  I welcome the creation of the committees and the Select Committees are a good way to deal with legislation, but there is a problem with manpower in terms of servicing them.</P>
    <P>I sought to amend legislation on presidential elections so that the photographs of candidates would be put on ballot papers.  I was told at the time it would lead to a beauty contest and that it was faintly undesirable.  If people do not know what candidates look like by the end of an election, particularly in presidential and European elections, they are probably living on another planet.  The beauty contest aspect does not arise. It is wrong for the so-called shouted vote to be used in the polling station, which I have seen happen. We must accept there is a considerable number of people who have difficulty reading or who are illiterate.  They should not be precluded from the electoral system just as people with any disability should not be precluded.  It should be as all encompassing as possible.  It would be a good idea to put photographs on ballot papers.  When the first South African elections took place not only were photographs put on ballot papers but the party logos were put opposite candidates names.  That is to be commended, particularly given the technology available which would make it easy to do.  It would not be expensive and should be closely examined.</P>
    <P>We also need to look at opening times of polling stations.  In the recent referendum, the polling stations in the North opened at 7 a.m. while ours opened at 8 a.m. Looking at the flow of traffic into Dublin in the morning, people are going to work much earlier than previously.  If I had had to attend the Oireachtas that morning, it would have been very convenient to go to the polling station between 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. and then travel on to Dublin.  It would have been convenient for many people commuting from my area, from Newbridge and other parts of Kildare, to Dublin to go to the polling station at that early hour rather than have to do a day's work, return home and go back out to vote.  It would lead to an increase in the number of people voting and it should be looked at.  I accept there is a financial implication but I am sure it could be overcome. <Col N="1114" /> The turnout for the referenda on the British-Irish Agreement and the Amsterdam Treaty would have been higher had polling stations been open at 7 a.m. Some people turned up at polling stations at 7 a.m. because they had heard about the opening hours in Northern Ireland and assumed the same applied in the South, but it did not.</P>
    <P>Another aspect, which we discussed when debating previous legislation of this nature, is Sunday voting.  It should be allowed under the legislation but it does not necessarily have to happen. It would be nice on a Sunday morning to go to church, to vote and then go to see Kildare beat Dublin in Croke Park.  That would be a perfect day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for provoking Senator Ridge on this matter.</P>
      <P>The objective should be to maximise the turnout, with which I am sure the Minister would agree.  There is a financial implication and some people, albeit a small minority, might object to voting on Sunday.  It happens in many European countries and I do not see why it cannot happen here, if so required.</P>
      <P>Senator Henry referred to Professor Laver's report which was presented to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution during the week. Having looked at the report, I believe the present system is better than that proposed by Professor Laver who proposes the single seat constituency with the single transferable vote and in addition a lists system where parties acquiring more than a certain percentage vote would get seats.  If the threshold was pitched at 5 per cent, the Progressive Democrats would have some difficulties.  One could effectively exclude the Green Party, Democratic Left, the Progressive Democrats and other small parties.  Obviously, if the threshold is at a lower level, there would be representation.</P>
      <P>I am not so sure about the aspect of producing technocrats so to speak from within party ranks who would see themselves purely as legislators.  I fully accept there are pressures put on Ministers, in particular, in trying to service their constituencies, fulfil their legislative duties and the serious obligations imposed on them as Ministers but there is a huge benefit in legislative terms in Members of Parliament being close to the electorate. That is one of the huge strengths of our electoral system.  The point is made that people are regarded as messenger boys or girls and there is a down side to that, particularly in the case of Ministers.  It is a huge strength not only in legislative terms but in electoral terms that there is a close relationship between the electorate and those who represent it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of intra-party competition has been raised and I am not sure it is unhealthy.  I know it is pretty depressing for those who are at the centre of the storm, but competition is no harm. <Col N="1115" /> It leads to people with determination, energy and enthusiasm surfacing through the ranks.  I have some reservations about the list in that if one had the ear of the leader or whatever body will decide on it, whether the national executive or council of a party, it would give one certain advantages. There would be as much competition in that context as in the existing one.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced of the merit of Professor Laver's argument.  It is a reasonable attempt at devising an alternative system but I am not sure it would be desirable.  The conclusion that Fianna Fáil would get all the seats in single seat constituencies is based on the present system.  However, if the electoral system was changed, the system of voting would change.  People would not be happy with that degree of uniformity throughout the country and, as has occasionally happened in England, they would opt for strategic voting. People can be quite clever in how they use their preferences.  There would be more diversity than is suggested by Professor Laver if such an electoral system were introduced.  One need only reflect on the results of recent by-elections to understand how voting patterns can shift in different circumstances.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry spoke about politicians attending funerals and securing medical cards for constituents.  I see nothing wrong in seeking medical cards for constituents or in vindicating their rights to such cards.  It is frequently suggested that people should not have to go to their public representatives, that if they have certain rights those rights should be vindicated without recourse to public representatives.  The reality, however, is that in many circumstances people are not aware of their rights and the public representative is the person whom they perceive as having knowledge of what is available.  There is nothing wrong with that, particularly if the public representative can be of assistance.</P>
    <P>It is true the system leads to competition between public representatives and that there are constituents who will do the tour, as it were, of the clinics but if it results in people getting things to which they are entitled and which they would not get otherwise, there is nothing wrong with it. It is laudable and desirable that there should be ready access to public representatives.  This is a small country and representatives should not live in ivory towers removed from the people.</P>
    <P>Denis Healey, in his autobiography &ldquo;The Time of My Life&rdquo;&mdash; the same title as Gay Byrne's biography &mdash; wrote about how he had served the needs of his constituents in Leeds, a constituency he represented for more than 20 years.  He said he had always returned to the constituency twice a month, a fact which he appeared to regard as exceptional.  However, we are all aware of the probable consequences for Irish public representatives if they only returned to their constituencies twice a month.  They would not profit at the next election.  Nevertheless, Denis Healey had a <Col N="1116" /> successful parliamentary career, which indicates one of the differences between the two countries.</P>
    <P>I commend the legislation and I am sure it will have a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will ignore the taunting comments of my colleague with regard to the ability of the Dublin footballers.  I expect him to eat his words next week.</P>
      <P>The Minister appears to have developed the ability to walk on water, so to speak, because I cannot complain about this legislation or the boundary revision as it affects me.  I wrote to the commission and it is nice to know one's views are heard.  I have represented a split constituency for 13 years on a local authority.  The previous boundaries had unhappy consequences for me and for the people of the greater Clondalkin area. The Minister will be aware that representations were made in this regard by Clondalkin Community Council and Ronanstown Development Centre.</P>
      <P>The greater north Clondalkin area was built about 17 years ago and for those 17 years the area has been separated by a canal, railway and constituency boundary from its hinterland of greater Clondalkin.  Indeed, Clondalkin became the tail end of the greater Dublin South-West constituency because Tallaght was the main population area in that constituency.  It is only proper that there should be an additional constituency in this area.  I do not know when a new three seat constituency was last established but it is nice to be around for the birth of this one.  I hope to see it grow as, in view of the population trends in the area, it is possible that it might be made a four seat constituency in the near future.  I hope I am not presumptious in hoping to be one of the Deputies who will represent the new constituency. However, that is for the electorate to decide.</P>
      <P>I regret that Quarryvale and Palmerstown have been removed from the new mid-west constituency. The commission says it is necessary for the establishment of a new three seat constituency in Dublin West.  It would be geographically perfect if the Naas Road and the Liffey were the constituency boundaries but this is an imperfect world and we must take what we get.  In this instance, we are happy to run with what we have got.</P>
      <P>I support the introduction of voting on Sunday. While it is not in the remit of the Boundaries Commission to decide if politicans' photographs should be put on voting papers, I believe they should be.  Beauty is always in the eye of the beholder and political beauty is something everybody could argue about forever.  That one might not be a Spice Girl or Paul Newman will not matter so long as the party logo is beneath the photograph because people tend to vote for parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent an area where electoral turnout has been as low as 23 per cent so I favour voting on Sundays.  I also support the inclusion of candidates' photographs on ballot papers.  Regrettably, <Col N="1117" /> despite the general improvements in society, there is a serious literacy problem and it is in the interests of the electorate and those who are seeking election that candidates be readily identified on ballot papers.  I do not understand why that cannot be introduced.  Claiming that it would result in a beauty contest is a spurious argument. I never previously heard so many objections to beauty contests.</P>
    <P>I will comment briefly on the proposal for single seat constituencies.  Local authority boundaries are being reviewed and I have discovered that I have the honour of representing 11,000 people in the three seat constituency of Clondalkin. This is due to rapid population growth in the area.  There are 26 members on South Dublin County Council and it might be a valuable exercise to try out the single seat constituency system in that area.  It would probably result in good representation. All systems require change and review and every electoral system in the world could probably be improved.  The introduction of the single seat system in that local authority area might be carried out by way of a study to examine how representative it would be.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for bringing this legislation before the House.  I also congratulate the members of the Boundaries Commission.  The review of constituencies was in excellent hands. Their efficiency and efficacy is reflected in the report and I look forward to the implementation of the new boundaries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister.  He is the busiest Minister I have encountered since I became a public representative and he is a regular visitor to the Seanad.  I compliment him and his staff on the amount of new legislation they have introduced in the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>I also wish to be associated with the complimentary remarks for the Clerk of the Seanad and the Boundaries Commission.  It is proper that an independent body should be responsible for constituency boundary changes and that no political party be able to interfere with or gerrymander such constituencies.</P>
      <P>A number of Members have commented that politicians are messengers instead of full-time legislators.  It is important that a politician be a messenger because in that way he or she meets the constituents and is made aware of their needs. He or she might thus become aware that changes are necessary in certain Departments or regulations. It is the people with problems who bring matters to the surface all the time.  In turn, politicians can bring such matters before the Houses of the Oireachtas and enact legislation or change rules and regulations.  The important aspect is that people who would not otherwise be aware of their entitlements are advised of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remarks were made about the size of constituencies. Five seat constituencies are too large as they put too much pressure on politicians.  Representing a five seat constituency one cannot devote the same amount of time and attention <Col N="1118" /> to the people one represents as in a three seat constituency.  The entire system should be examined and there is much merit in the case to be made for single seat constituencies.  Perhaps that system should be tried out at the next election. In any case, some commission could examine the matter.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that under such a system Fianna Fáil would take power by having complete control of single seat constituencies.  However, one only has to look at the constituencies, for example, in my county, to realise that this will not be the case.  At the last general election Fianna Fáil only won the last seat in North Kerry, which is a three seat constituency.  If single seaters were introduced I cannot see how Fianna Fáil would take all three seats in North Kerry.  I could say the same for West Limerick, South Kerry and practically all the rural constituencies.  It is a different situation in Dublin but that would have to be examined also.</P>
    <P>There is a case for single seat constituencies.  If they were introduced, the elected representative could give much more attention to his constituents as well as devoting more time to being a legislator in the Oireachtas, rather than running around a large constituency attending all the functions and group meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  I will try to deal with the main points raised.  Many of them were not, strictly speaking, about the Bill but it is no harm to discuss these matters now and again.</P>
      <P>The practice of appointing an independent commission to advise on constituency revisions was universally welcomed.  Quite rightly, as Senator Walsh and others said, it was regarded as a great advance on the old unsatisfactory arrangement whereby the Government of the day drew up the proposals, although they did not always have the effect the Minister may have wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1119" /> This system, which is statutorily based, is the product of an agreed process operated by an independent statutory body in accordance with accepted rules.  As was mentioned by Senators, some people will always be unhappy with the proposals that emerge.  Everyone looks to themselves and their own situations when changes of this nature are suggested.  I am sure each and every one of us can sympathise with sitting Members and intending candidates when something unwelcome occurs.  However, we must recognise the reality.</P>
    <P>The Constitution requires that constituencies should be revised periodically.  There has to be equality of representation and those revisions must take account of changes in the distribution of population.  There is also an obligation to tie these changes to the last completed census. Unfortunately, in some cases, subsequent developments cannot be taken into account.  If my calculations are correct, there has been an increase of about 8,000 people on the register of electors in County Meath this year.  When one takes into account that there are probably inaccuracies in the region of 10 per cent in most registers, it is a phenomenal jump.</P>
    <P>When those kinds of changes occur something has to give and somebody will be affected but that is the price we pay for a democratic representational system.  We all agree that the job should be entrusted to a commission and that body has done the job in the way that suits it best. Perhaps a different independent commission would have come up with other changes but we should accept the report.</P>
    <P>As regards the points made concerning the creation of new boundaries for three seater constituencies in Dublin, it was mentioned &mdash; either in the press release or in the report itself &mdash; that the commission was trying to delineate boundaries that would be fairly marked by physical features, as per its terms of reference.  However, it also had an eye to the population changes taking place.  What Senator Ridge said in relation to her area is a moot point: that if the population increases enough, the commission may be in a position the next time to increase the number of seats, rather than shifting boundaries which causes problems for everybody.</P>
    <P>The commission must be commended for producing proposals which are fully in keeping with the Constitution and its terms of reference.  In particular, where difficult choices had to be made, it set out the available options in each case and gave an informed and reasonable recommendation on why it should go in a particular way. That is helpful and gives people the comfort of knowing that, at least, the various options put forward were taken into account.</P>
    <P>A number of Senators referred to the question of photographs on ballot papers and that matter is currently being technically examined in the Department.  A strong wish was expressed in Committee, during the last Dáil, that that should happen.  I do not hold with the argument that this <Col N="1120" /> might be viewed as some kind of beauty contest. A commitment was given by the previous Minister in this regard and I intend to honour that if possible.  If it proves technically feasible, photographs will be included in the European election ballot papers.  The Department is involved in the final stages of the examination of technical and other arrangements which may have to be made and I will inform the House of any developments.</P>
    <P>Statutory periods are outlined for the declaration of European elections and significant advance notice of candidates can be given.  It would not be as difficult to include photographs on a European election ballot paper as it would on a general election one as general elections can be called suddenly and the timeframe between an election being called and polling taking place might not allow that to happen.</P>

      <P>The Department considered polling station opening hours prior to the recent referenda.  However, current legislation stipulates that polling stations shall be open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. I am considering changing that at a future date to facilitate a 7 a.m. start.  It is increasingly evident that people are leaving home for work earlier and that the 8 a.m. opening hour might unfortunately be too late for people <Col N="1121" /> who have to travel to work.  A 7 a.m. start would cause huge difficulties for those who work in polling stations but the public must be facilitated and we should strive to provide the best possible customer service in this regard.  A case might be made for polling stations to close earlier in the evening if they open earlier in the morning.  I foresee some difficulties in opening hours of 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. as they would involve very long days for polling station workers but the suggestion of a 7 a.m. start certainly has merit.</P>
      <P>The question of weekend voting was raised by a number of Senators.  I do not share the popular notion that the level of voting would increase if polling was held at weekends.  The fact that a 58 per cent turnout was recorded for the most important and historic referendum of our lifetime speaks volumes; voting occurred on a Friday in that instance and many people said that would make a huge difference to the turnout.  There are more deep seated reasons people do not turn out to vote in large numbers and I do not think the day of the week on which polling is held is a major factor.  If people consider the facts, they will realise that the day of the week on which poling is held is irrelevant.  The level of turnout appears to be affected by the degree to which the public is engaged by the issues involved.  I was hugely disappointed by the turnout for the recent referenda, particularly in regard to the Northern Agreement.</P>
      <P>There may be some advantages to Sunday voting as it might facilitate electors who would normally be away from home during the week.  It would eliminate school closures and provide a wider choice of voting times as most people do not work on Sundays.  There would also be disadvantages. In the past, strenuous objections were raised by minority churches to Sunday voting, although the Catholic Church did not have any objections to it.  I can find out whether those objections still hold.  Weekends are also popular times for people to go on holidays, attend football matches and so on.  Certain sectors of the workforce, such as those in the transport and hotel industry, are required to work at weekends and Sunday voting would offer no advantages to them.</P>
      <P>Postal voting is now available to a wide range of people whose employment makes it difficult for them to vote and it is also available to students.  It is far easier to secure locations for polling stations during the week than at weekends. This is not a black and white issue but I do not think the day of the week on which polling is held is a huge factor in turnout levels.  I have no great objection to carrying out one experiment in Sunday voting but I would be very reluctant to go against the wishes of any churches on the matter if such objections still exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My views on the electoral system are well known.  Senator Henry referred to three former prominent Fine Gael politicians who have written about this issue which obviously cannot be dealt with under the present Bill.  Multi-member constituencies <Col N="1122" /> and the STV system are both enshrined in our Constitution and constitutional amendments would obviously be required to change that.  Proposals to replace the existing system with single member constituencies and a straight vote have been rejected by the people on two previous occasions.  The first past the post system is profoundly undemocratic and I would not advocate its use.  In the UK one political party remained in power for 18 years.  In that period that party never commanded more than 40 per cent of the vote.  There is a similar system in Canada where the party in Government called an election and returned only two members.  That is not good for democracy.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government states that we want to review the electoral system and the Government has decided that the all party Oireachtas committee should examine the issue.  It is right that this should be examined objectively on an all party basis.  I have an ambition before I leave politics to reform not only local government but also the electoral system for Dáil constituencies.</P>
    <P>Senator Doyle mentioned the inter and intra-party rivalry.  The purpose of any electoral system is to elect a government which is representative of the people and to elect representatives who, once the government is formed, are capable of scrutinising everything that executive does on behalf of the people.  It should also be capable of scrutinising the various non-elected bodies which are established.  That should be the primary role of parliament.  The system which we have currently does not allow parliamentarians to discharge that role fully.  There should be a strong link between the constituents and the elected representative, Deputies should be answerable to a specific electorate.  In the current system, however, the balance is wrong.  The parliamentarian spends 85 per cent of his time dealing with his constituency and 15 per cent of his time doing the job he should be at a national level.  That will remain the case unless we change the electoral system.</P>
    <P>Media criticism of politicians was mentioned. The media cannot have it both ways.  People in the media will argue when a Government displays insufficient scrutiny that the TDs should not be involved in constituency work, but should be ensuring Government actions are scrutinised. When TDs make a reasoned argument, however, that this system does not allow us to do that they say that we do not want to be answerable to the electorate.</P>
    <P>The change to the system considered by Professor Michael Laver would mean a weakening of the strong tie which a TD has to a constituency. There has to be some loss.  Things cannot continue in the same manner after a change to the system.  As Senator Dardis said, it is ineffective to use present perspective to judge what might happen when a system is changed.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry stated that if the system changed Fianna Fáil would win all the seats on a <Col N="1123" /> constituency basis and other parties would come into Parliament on lists.  That argument does not hold water.  The last eight by-elections produced two victories each for Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.  A single seat constituency system would produce results like that.  There would be a mixture of parties within that system.</P>
    <P>In the 1997 general election Fianna Fáil won 12 seats more than it should have according to the proportion of the vote it received.  It received 39 per cent of the vote yet took 12 seats more than the proportion of the vote represents.</P>

The Green Party won five less than it should have and Sinn Féin won three less. Fianna Fáil has, since the foundation of the State and the advent of proportional representation, consistently won greater representation in the Dáil than it should have on all but one occasion. Proportionality does not stand up to scrutiny.</P>
      <P>Only 12 per cent of TDs are women, and the percentage of female Senators is much the same, although they make up 51 per cent of the electorate. No minorities are represented.</P>

I am committed to change in the local government system, the abolition of dual mandates, the separation of local government from national government and greater independence for local government.  That, allied to a change in the electoral system, would bring about total and fundamental change in the democratic institutions in this State.  It would be a change for the better.  I am deeply committed to that and I will continue it for as long as possible.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Senator Doyle, alluded to Dromahair.  I am not sure if Senator Doyle is aware that I represent the Dromahair <Col N="1125" /> electoral area on Leitrim County Council.  While I agree with the general thrust of what he said, I can assure him that in the total electoral area, which stretches for some 20 miles geographically, there are about 4,500 votes.  While the quota of 600 may look small in Dublin terms, there is a great deal of gathering in 600 votes in that geographical area.  I would be delighted to give him a tour of the area some time so that he could get a better view of exactly what we must go through. However, we all agree with his overall point.</P>
      <P>Section 3 states that areas will be finally determined by the Minister.  In the context of the independence of the commission, how flexible is the Minister in intervening in the conclusions or recommendations of the commission?  All Members, not least the Minister, will be aware of a letter signed by a number of party representatives which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday. They are exercised by the commission which, they allege, ignored its terms of reference and did not implement them as it should.  I am not sure if the Minister is aware of the particular letter but it relates to the Dublin South-West constituency, the Naas Road boundary and splitting communities and parishes.  A first reading of the letter suggests to me that the committee did not act within its terms of reference.</P>
      <P>One can extend that to the Longford-Roscommon set up, where there are two counties in separate provinces in which there is no cultural or social intermingling.  As the Minister and members of all parties will be aware, there is no cohesion between the constituency parties in the two counties, which operate as independent republics.  In that context, I am curious to know if the Minister has any flexibility once the report comes before him and under the terms of this Bill as it relates to electoral divisions, parts thereof and townlands thereof.  I ask him to clarify the Minister's powers under this section and address the issues I raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Mooney is really asking about section 3(2), under which a reference to any specified area must be construed by me and anybody else as a reference to that area as constituted on 1 January 1998.  It is what is there and what is known already.  Therefore, any alterations after that date in the name or composition of any area mentioned in the Schedule will not affect the area of the constituency as constituted by the Bill.</P>
      <P>That subsection also gives power to determine if there is any doubt as to the constituency in which an electoral division or townland or any part thereof is situated.  That is a standard provision in case there is a dispute.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of the specific dispute to which the Senator referred and I will certainly have a look at it.  I do not have wide and sweeping powers. That is the short answer to his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the Senator's point about Longford-Roscommon because there was huge controversy about that constituency the last time, but these exercises will never be perfect.  That is what I was <Col N="1126" /> saying in reply to Second Stage.  One will never achieve a perfect solution.  The commission must have regard to the parameters spelled out in the Electoral Act, 1997.  At the end of the day, having regard to all of those plus the submissions, they must make decisions.  In this case, it is clear that while there were minor changes everywhere, the major changes took place in Dublin and the commission decided not to make any major changes elsewhere except those which were absolutely necessary.  The Longford-Roscommon constituency, along with a constituency in Tipperary, generated the most controversy the last time but, on balance, the commission has done a good job and could not do much more to facilitate everybody.</P>

      <P>We are all grateful for the breath of fresh air which the Minister introduced to this debate.  He is the first Minister to grapple with the question of numbers and with the system.  As he said, politicians of previous generations have shied away from it, perhaps because of Fianna Fáil's unsuccessful attempts to change the Constitution. It is a nettle which must be grasped.</P>
      <P>It is reported in this morning's newspapers that our population is projected to rise to 4.4 million by 2026 and we could not possibly sustain the existing electoral system with that population. The Minister mentioned the thinking on the European constituencies and the terms of reference given to the independent commission.  Many Members were surprised that the commission appeared to be providing for more three seat constituencies, especially in Dublin.  Under previous commissions there was tremendous debate about the need to create more four and five seat constituencies because of the proportionality which was allegedly required to ensure a more democratic return by the electorate, but if the present trend continues the largest urban area in the country will consist solely of three seat constituencies. Is this an indication of things to come in that it will make the Minister's job easier &mdash; it is simpler to change from three seat to single seat constituencies, rather than from five seaters to single seaters &mdash; or is there any significance in the commission arriving at this recommendation?</P>

      <P>He could have been suggesting that I had a longer term influence on the commission &mdash; the short answer is that I did not but I know that was not the primary motivation for his question.  As I understand the reasoning <Col N="1127" /> behind the provision for Dublin, as outlined in the report and the press statement, I think the commission wished to establish physical boundaries, in keeping with its terms of reference.  The Senator will note that in the Dublin area the M50 is generally used as a constituency boundary.  I do not think the commission is moving toward providing for three seat constituencies where possible.  I think it made a conscious decision &mdash; it may not have spelled this out but it did advert to it &mdash; to draw constituency lines in areas of Dublin experiencing rapid population growth, such as west Dublin.  This was done on the assumption that after the next census, rather than having to redraw the lines, which is problematic for representatives, communities and parties, it may be possible to change the constituencies from three seaters to four seaters with minimal boundary changes.  The commission was therefore taking a longer term strategic view.</P>
      <P>It is argued that three seaters are less proportional than four seaters or five seaters and some submissions to the Constitutional Review Group argued that the most proportional size for a constituency is a four seater, because five seaters cause distortion by allowing for the election of people who would not normally become representatives. I do not think the commission is working towards providing for three seaters only &mdash; this was a specific set of circumstances involving rapid population growth.</P>
      <P>The Senator's point about the projected population rise to 4.4 million is valid.  There will have to be changes, if not in the electoral system then in the level of representation provided for in the Constitution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for taking this matter.  The first part of my motion is a proposal which may help reduce illiteracy among the adult population; the second part is to encourage a pleasant introduction to reading and writing skills for those about to embark upon the school cycle.  As Senator O'Toole often reminds us, all the evidence from the teaching organisations is that adult literacy should be addressed first at primary school level and, if it were given the necessary resources, many of the difficulties we face would be eliminated or at least reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have one of the highest adult illiteracy rates in the world.  That stark statistic is a surprising contradiction, given the phenomenal growth in the economy, job creation and employment opportunities which are linked to the worldwide perception of Ireland's workforce as young, well educated and available. However, that is the reality.  The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, <Col N="1129" /> Deputy O'Dea, is introducing on an ongoing basis a number of initiatives in this regard.  I raised this matter in the context of assisting his efforts.</P>
    <P>On a visit to America in my other profession as a broadcaster approximately seven to eight years ago, an adult literacy programme inaugurated by the State of Tennessee came to my attention which harnessed the celebrity status of many of the country music stars who live and work in the state, some of whom have become globally famous such as Garth Brooks, to encourage adults with literacy problems to enrol in statewide literacy programmes.  This was done by way of public service announcements or commercials on radio and television, billboard advertisements and employing the full weight of the printed media.  More importantly, however, the state authorities also operated at a much lower level by arranging for celebrities to meet young people in schools.  It is in that area that a pilot project could be developed in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that if Roy Keane, the footballer, Sonia O'Sullivan, the athlete, or Ronan Keating from Boyzone visited a school in one of the most disadvantaged areas of the country &mdash; where the majority of literacy problems arise &mdash; and said that it is &ldquo;cool&rdquo; to read and write, it would have a positive effect.  To be more specific, if Roy Keane stated that he would not have been able to sign a contract if he were not able to read or write the response from young people to their role model would far outweigh the effects of what might loosely be termed as &ldquo;unimaginative&rdquo; and &ldquo;overtly serious&rdquo; promotions of the problem of adult literacy.  A great number of these promotions tend to go over the heads of the people at whom they are aimed.</P>
    <P>I intend no implied criticism of the current policies of the Department in respect of adult literacy problems, I am merely of the opinion that an injection of creativity and imagination into the scheme could bear a more rapid and positive response.  I would be grateful to hear the Minister's response to this suggestion in terms of whether he intends to explore the possibilities to which it would give rise.  The scheme I propose would need to be creative, imaginative and sustained rather than a once-off intervention because adults with literacy problems are not the type of people who can easily make their difficulties known.  These people need encouragement.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Department for its initiatives in this area but there is no doubt that additional resources are required.  I also pay tribute to the VEC sector which, outside Dublin, has the highest success rate in helping to eliminate adult literacy problems.  In that context, I pay particular tribute to the efforts of Áine Bohan, the adult literacy officer, and Donal Scully in County Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The second part of this matter relates to a project initiated in Birmingham in the past two years. The programme is called Bookstart and, according to a recent article in <i>The Guardian</i> it supplies &ldquo;the more than 15,000 babies born in the city with <Col N="1130" /> a book at around the eight-months stage when they are taken along to their local health centres for hearing tests.&rdquo; I understand the authorities in Birmingham have intervened at that stage because it is a good point at which to gain the interest of young mothers visiting health centres with their babies.  The article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The book comes in a bag with some posters and leaflets explaining to parents and carers how essential it is to open a book with their babies every day and get them used to it.</P>
    <P>Evidence from Bookstart's pilot year suggests this early experience with books pays dividends by the time the toddlers start school, according to Professor Barry Wade of Birmingham University's School of Education, who has been assessing it.  Their reading, writing and arithmetic skills are likely to be more advanced than those of children who have not had the same exposure to books in their first year out of the womb.  &ldquo;It shows the huge potential of the early years and it shows just how much children can learn from the company of interested adults,&rdquo; he said.</P>
    <P>Staff at Birmingham's 40 community libraries take the bags along to the health centres to present them to the babies and discuss the philosophy and procedures with their mums, dads and any other carers.</P>
    <P>The article to which I refer further states that, according to scientific evidence, Bookstart babies &ldquo;performed noticeably better than their peers in all categories of the Baseline Assessment&rdquo;, they were &ldquo;often ahead on assessments for speaking and listening, reading and writing and did better on assessments of using and applying maths, number and shapes and measures&rdquo; and &ldquo;were also clearly ahead of other babies not in the scheme in both literacy and numeracy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have essentially provided an overview of the scheme.  I suggest we could tackle the problem of adult literacy by adopting both parts of my proposal, the first of which would be directed towards adults with literacy problems and those from age ten or 11 upwards &mdash; which seems to be the level at which such problems begin &mdash; through harnessing the efforts of celebrities who are role models for people, young and old, and who are always willing to help if asked; the second would be directed at the very young through the establishment of a Bookstart programme.  I will be interested to learn the Minister's views in respect of my proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment and Local Government (Mr. Dempsey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education and Science and the Minister of State at his Department. I was pleased to take this matter in his place because, as Members are aware, I was a member of the teaching profession &mdash; involved in guidance and counselling &mdash; in the past.  Therefore, I am deeply interested in this area.  I thank Senator Mooney for the interesting suggestion contained <Col N="1131" /> in his motion, to which recent developments in the adult literacy service set a context.</P>
      <P>On assuming office last year, the Government was determined to develop adult education services. As a first step, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, was appointed and given responsibility for adult education.  As Senator Mooney indicated, he has introduced a number of initiatives in the general area of adult education, particularly in the development of the literacy service.</P>
      <P>In the past number of years, activists in the area of adult education have expressed, with increasing frequency and intensity, their dissatisfaction with the State's provision for adult education. While everyone acknowledges there were steady annual increases in the funding made available, it was considered totally inadequate in comparison to requirements &mdash; particularly in the area of adult literacy.  Parties closely involved in the delivery of adult education, the vocational education committees and voluntary organisations such as Aontas and the National Adult Literacy Agency, felt that the Department underestimated the extent of the problem.  This view was vindicated last October by the publication of an OECD survey which revealed that approximately 25 per cent of Irish adults aged between 16 and 65 have very low levels of literacy.  Had that figure come from any other organisation I would have seriously questioned it but knowing the record of the OECD it could not be argued with and it underlines the extent of the problem.</P>
      <P>On his appointment, the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, was faced with the task of implementing the commitments made in our election manifesto.  Among those were commitments that we would, in partnership with the National Adult Literacy Agency and other interested parties, formulate and implement a national policy on literacy.  We also accepted the agency's view that the option of becoming literate is a fundamental educational and human right for all adults and that the acquisition of literacy is a social responsibility, not an individual problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the last election the following measures were identified in our manifesto for implementation if all adults were to have access to high quality literacy services.  The adult literacy and community education budget should be increased to a minimum of £4 million so that students would have greater access to increased literacy tuition in appropriate premises with child care provision.  Adequate funding should be provided to meet the needs of the increasing number of students who came forward for help as a result of publicity and recruitment strategies.  The maintenance and continuity of a service which is a fundamental educational right should not be dependent on the goodwill of volunteers alone.  Extra funding must be allocated to decrease the present over-dependence on volunteer literacy workers. There should be a flexible and wide ranging choice of tuition options including small group, individual <Col N="1132" /> help and open learning centres to cater for the diversity of needs among adult literacy students.  Literacy help should be available throughout the year with a full range of tuition including evening provision, daytime provision, weekend courses and full-time and part-time courses.  Assessment and evaluation processes to promote the quality of literacy work and the effectiveness of literacy schemes must be drawn up in consultation with practitioners and students and be guided by the principles and philosophy of adult education.</P>
    <P>These needs were identified and set out in our manifesto.  In the budget statement on 3 December 1997, the 1998 budget for adult literacy was increased by £2 million to £4.065 million, thereby fulfilling the manifesto commitment.  The Minister and his Department are currently examining, in consultation with the interested parties, ways to put this increase to the most effective use. He has, however, decided that it will be used entirely for literacy rather than shared with community education.</P>
    <P>The Government intends to continue to increase the provision for the relief of adult illiteracy as resources permit.  In order to ensure that the commitment to place the adult literacy service at the centre of adult education is implemented nationwide, all vocational education committees have been directed to ensure that local adult literacy interests are adequately represented on their adult education boards.</P>
    <P>The extra provision of £2 million in 1998 will afford such possibilities as extending the period of the literacy courses, recruiting more students, intensifying the courses, engaging more professional literacy staff or undertaking publicity campaigns to encourage people to come to classes who have previously been reluctant to do so.  It is in this context of a national publicity campaign that Senator Mooney suggests the use of national heroes in the media.  The Minister and I believe this is a good idea.  I think we already have precedents in anti-smoking and buy Irish campaigns. Senator Mooney has mentioned that in the State of Tennessee country music stars assist in publicising adult literacy campaigns.</P>
    <P>However, it will probably be some time yet before such publicity campaigns are being organised. Until now the general consensus has been that literacy services are grossly under-funded in comparison to need, and the vocational education committees which administer those services have been unable to cater for all who seek literacy tuition and are able to cater only minimally for those who are enrolled.  Senators will agree that our priority is to ensure that an adequate service is provided for all who seek it.  After that, as Senator Mooney said, the next stage will be the encouragement of the reluctant to avail themselves of the service.  The Minister will consider the Senator's suggesion in that context.</P>
    <P>Our approach to adult literacy involves complementing our campaign with a range of supportive measures aimed at disadvantaged children <Col N="1133" /> at primary and post-primary level to get them to stay on at school as long as possible and so avoid becoming part of tomorrow's adult literacy problem.  These supportive measures include the development of early start centres, the allocation of extra manpower and financial resources to disadvantaged areas, the Breaking the Cycle initiative, the home-school community liaison scheme, curricular adaptations to cater for disadvantaged students, special centres for travellers, the free book scheme and the alleviation of examination fees for necessitous pupils.  In this context, we shall certainly consider Senator Mooney's suggestion about Birmingham's Bookstart scheme in the light of the evidence that this scheme, which involves parents sharing books with very young children, has resulted in a substantial increase in awareness of books, the sharing of books and reading ability.  I will discuss this matter with the Minister for Education and with other colleagues on the Cabinet committee on social inclusion because this is an initiative which would focus on some areas on interest to that committee.</P>
    <P>I conclude by thanking the Seanad for giving me an opportunity to speak on this very important Government priority and by thanking, in particular, Senator Mooney for his constructive suggestions.  All suggestions from any source on the development of the literacy service are very welcome and positive and constructive ones like this particularly so.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his full and comprehensive reply and for the obvious recognition by the Government of the urgency of funding for this area.  It is appropriate that the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is answering this matter because the Bookstart scheme in Birmingham was processed through the library service.</P>
      <P>May I record my appreciation of the Library and particularly of Ms Maedhbh McNamara, senior library assistant, who provided much of the background information on this matter?  The Library is not always given the recognition it deserves.</P>

      <P>I put down this matter on the Adjournment on foot of representations, and more particularly, on foot of the report from the Sandymount school on access by the disabled to public transport.</P>
      <P>Dublin Bus has purchased 60 new double deck buses and there are three single deck buses on the No. 3 route, which travels to Sandymount and takes in the Rehab centre.  The problem is there are not enough suitable buses, only six have been adapted for wheelchair users and there is a lack of funding to purchase more.  Dublin Bus say that even the new fleet of double deck buses cannot be accessed because adapting them would cost too much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> I appreciate there are ongoing studies in Great Britain examining how disabled people can access double deck buses so they can use public transport in the same way as those who are not disabled but realistically, this will take a considerable amount of time.  In the meantime it is discriminatory that we are only importing single deck buses for disabled use.  It is the policy of Dublin Bus to discontinue the use of single deck buses &mdash; there are 200 in operation but only six are adapted.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the remit of Dublin Bus is to serve the greater population of Dublin.  However, this Government is working towards non-exclusion and this service could be improved.  If we cannot allow disabled people access to double deck buses we should try to provide, during the school term, a comprehensive service to specific locations, such as the NRB in Sandymount which disabled students attend regularly.  It is frustrating enough to have difficulty accessing a bus in the first place but it is worse to have to wait so long to get a special bus.</P>
    <P>Access to adapted buses is workable but not entirely suitable.  However, it is difficult for the disabled to use the ticket machine as they cannot reach it to swipe their ticket.  There should be consultation with the disabled before these facilities are designed.  Transport is important in maintaining a normal lifestyle for those with serious mobility problems.</P>
    <P>I appeal for just dues for the disabled and the provision of more low floor single deck buses.  If funding is increased we can purchase double deck buses with low floors which the disabled can access and eventually we will arrive at some form of equity.  I am not well informed on technical matters but Dublin Bus informed me that none of the new purchases will have disabled access, which is unfortunate.  The Minister should translate the lip service paid to the disabled into a meaningful provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Ridge for raising this important and worthy matter. Córas Iompair Éireann receives an annuaI subvention from the Exchequer for the provision of socially necessary services which cannot be provided on a fully commercial basis.  The allocation of the subvention to the individual companies &mdash; Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann &mdash; is currently a matter for the board of CIE.  The total subvention for 1998 is £107.205 million and I am advised that of this amount £7 million will be allocated to Bus Átha Cliath by the CIE board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining the level of subvention to be paid to CIE each year, the Government has to find the right balance between a range of competing demands for scarce Exchequer resources.  On any grounds the resources made available to CIE each year are substantial.  Indeed, the level of commitment shown by successive Governments to CIE is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, <Col N="1135" /> over the past ten years, Exchequer funding has amounted to approximately £1 billion.</P>
    <P>I can assure this House that the Minister for Public Enterprise is committed to ensuring that, within her area of responsibility, service providers accord a high priority to meeting the requirements of people with disabilities.  I should explain, however, that the task of making public transport services accessible to the widest possible range of customers is essentially a matter for transport operators themselves.</P>
    <P>I know that the CIE companies are very much aware of the importance of meeting the requirements of people with mobility impairments as part of their overall efforts to improve service quality standards.  They are conscious of the need to work towards maximising the accessibility and responsiveness of their facilities and services to customers with disabilities according as suitable opportunities and resources allow.</P>
    <P>The Seanad will be aware that, traditionally, vehicles for public transport use were not designed to be accessible by people with disabilities and this is reflected in the type of vehicle generally in use by the CIE bus companies and private transport operators.  It is only relatively recently that fully accessible vehicles, such as low floor buses, have become readily available.  So far they are only available in a single deck version whereas the mainstay of the Bus Átha Cliath fleet is the double deck bus.</P>
    <P>This creates difficulties for Bus Átha Cliath in meeting the needs of mobility impaired people as does the fact that low floor buses are approximately 20 per cent more expensive than similar capacity buses of conventional design.  However the company is aware that improving the accessibility of public transport can lead to tangible benefits for a wide range of its customers, including not only those with disabilities but also the elderly and people with young children.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that there have been positive developments recently with regard to the provision of accessible public transport in the CIE group as a whole.  In the particular case of Bus Átha Cliath, a number of large capacity, fully <Col N="1136" /> accessible, single deck buses of low floor design have been in operation since early this year serving a key cross-city route from Drumcondra to Belfield.  I am happy to say that the acquisition of these buses was partly financed by a grant from the Department.</P>
    <P>The operation of this service will provide valuable experience for the future development of accessible bus services on other key routes.  In addition, the company also provides an accessible minibus service &mdash; known as the Omni-link service &mdash; on the northside of the city.  The Omni-link vehicles were acquired with EU assistance under the Horizon programme and are wheelchair accessible.  The buses operate on a new route and the service is provided for the general public and not simply wheelchair users.  It is popular with elderly customers and parents with buggies.</P>
    <P>More generally I welcome the establishment by the CIE companies of user groups representative of people with disabilities.  The input from these groups should give the companies very valuable assistance in their ongoing programmes of improving the suitability of their services for mobility impaired customers.</P>
    <P>I should also explain that, at present, an interdepartmental task force, under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, is drawing up an action plan for consideration by the Government, based on the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  It is expected that the outcome of that process and the results of the operation of the low floor buses will provide a basis for determining the extent to which additional transport accessibility initiatives can be undertaken in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Senator on raising the matter and I will convey to the Minister the specific matters she raised.</P>
