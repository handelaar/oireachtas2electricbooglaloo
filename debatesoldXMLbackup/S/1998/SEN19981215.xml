      <P>I have notice from Senator Denis Cregan that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Health and Children to outline if he is satisfied with the structure that prevails as regards the appointment of consultants coming from other jurisdictions to take up positions in this jurisdiction; if he is considering implementing stricter guidelines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business for today is items 1, 2 and 3.  Item 1 will be taken at the conclusion of the Order of Business until 4 p.m., with contributions of Senators not to exceed ten minutes.  Item 2, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, will be taken at 4.30 p.m., with the contributions of spokespersons not to exceed 15 minutes and those of other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.  Item 3, Committee Stage, is to be taken at 7 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no difficulty with items 1 and 2 on the Order of Business.  However, item 3, Committee Stage of the National Disability Authority Bill, 1998, has 35 amendments.  This item is to commence at 7 p.m. and one can assume it will take several hours to complete.  I presume there will be a high level of contributions to this Bill because the issue attracts the interest of many Members.  We cannot agree the Order of Business unless we get an assurance that, should the Committee Stage not finish at a reasonable hour &mdash; which I would regard as 9 p.m. &mdash; it will be taken on another day and that there will be no guillotine motion this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> I would like a statement from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the problems which arise as a result of early prisoner releases.  There were three recent tragic car accidents in which people lost their lives and where those responsible were on early release from prison. When the Minister was in Opposition he devoted much of his time to the issue of early prison release and he promised the public over two and half years ago that, if he were the Minister for Justice, there would be zero tolerance of this problem and that prisoners would serve the last minute of their sentences.  However, it appears that early release continues to be a pervasive characteristic of our prison regime, leading to tragedies such as those I outlined.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in the House this afternoon but the agenda does not allow this issue to be raised, as I assume Members will be confined to the matter under discussion.  However, I ask the Leader to arrange for the Minister to make a statement to the House on what policy he has, if any, on early prison release.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader explain his intention in regard to the Order of Business?  I understood we would take Committee and Report Stages.  I agree with Senator Connor that, if, because of the number of amendments, the debate goes beyond the time provisionally allocated, it should be altered.  That is important.</P>
      <P>The question of overseas development aid and the Government's relationship with the IMF has been debated a number of times over the past couple of months.  There appears to be a change of attitude by the Government.  Senator Gallagher made some telling points when the matter was last debated.  What is the Government's position on proposed legislation in this area?</P>
      <P>Since we last met there have been disturbing developments in the financial area.  The <i>Sunday Independent</i> should spend more time investigating this than less important matters.  The NTMA appears to have been left out in the cold.  When it was established a number of years ago the House engaged in a long debate on the importance of the agency and its role in a variety of areas.  The chief executive of the agency has raised serious questions about the relationship between it, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. The work of the agency may be disturbed by non-co-operation by the Central Bank and it appears to be able to compute figures better than the Department of Finance.  For example, it appears that nobody knew about a minor matter of £75 million.  This is a cause of worry to those of us who depend on these bodies to get things right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agency has not been consulted about the sale of Telecom Éireann and other State assets. When the agency was debated in the House it was envisaged it would play a role in this area and it is not good enough for Ministers to say they are not obliged to consult with it.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Finance to clarify the relationship <Col N="1071" /> between the agency, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank?  Those of us with an interest in corporate or financial affairs wish to be informed on these matters.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Connor's point on the National Disability Authority Bill.  There are a number of amendments.  It is important legislation and it would be inappropriate to impose a guillotine.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to attend the House to make a statement on the various allegations in the media about the consultant who performed a high number of hysterectomies after caesarean deliveries? It is important to ensure there are proper procedures in all hospitals.  This matter has raised huge concern.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader also facilitate a debate on homelessness before the recess?  The percentage of homeless people has doubled on most local authority housing lists.  It is expected that when the next audit is completed in 1999, the rate of homelessness will have trebled in Dublin city. Regardless of what is happening between the NTMA and the Central Bank and missing money, not enough is being allocated to house building and housing for the homeless and the needy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the number of attempted child abductions and the concerns expressed by the gardaí and right thinking members of the community, will the Leader arrange a debate as a matter of urgency?  Positive suggestions may be made which will assist the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the gardaí in putting those involved behind bars, where they belong.  There are a number of paedophiles here from the United Kingdom but we have a number of home grown ones as well.  An early debate on this issue would be of benefit.</P>

      <P>Second, I endorse what Senator O'Toole said about the conflict between the NTMA and the Department of Finance, something we all find confusing.  I find it even more confusing that Senator O'Toole seems to be taking sides against public servants.  It is very refreshing that he has seen the light so late in life.</P>

      <P>Third, will the Minister for Health and Children come here to make a statement on the Deloitte &amp; Touche report on the Tallaght hospital.  I gather that he intends to do that in the Dáil this afternoon.  This hospital appears to have been under-funded and that is a matter of immense public concern.  There is public recrimination between the hospital and the Minister which is an unseemly state of affairs.  There has also been some unwanted leaking of this report to the disadvantage of Tallaght hospital.  Will the Leader ask, at the very least, that the Minister gives us the same treatment he is giving the Dáil on the issue of the Tallaght hospital, and that we are entitled to a one or two hour debate on this issue within the next two days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Health and Children the story which was published in yesterday's and today's <i>The Irish Times</i> regarding the number of hysterectomies which were carried out in one of our hospitals, the urgent need to review all these procedures and to ensure there is a second opinion in every case?  This is a key and important point.  A number of women have been informed that the hysterectomies performed after caesarean births may not have been medically necessary.  This is a matter of grave concern to the people involved and all members of health boards and public representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LabhrasOMurchu" hpid="Labhrás Ó Murchú Labhrás Ó Murchú">
      <NameTxt>Labhrás Ó Murchú</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Leader arrange a debate on the ethics of medical science, particularly the areas of questionable experimentation. Some media reports published over the weekend read more like science fiction than a reflection on the real world.  At the moment there are scientists in several parts of the world taking part in an all out race to produce the first cloned human being and there are seven international companies endeavouring to get control of this area.  Significantly, human cloning is illegal in Europe and it is prohibited by federal law in the United States but it is not illegal in every part of the world, for example, the Carribbean.  We should take seriously what was said by a scientific adviser to the British Government last week, that the first cloned human being could be created within the next few months.  One woman may even have been impregnated with a cloned human being.  No matter how small a country we are we should still have a debate on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association is 100 years old but it has been refused a commemorative stamp this year.  I ask the Leader and the House for support and a debate on this issue.  Over 500,000 people here and over one million people worldwide are members of this association.  As I said, this has already been refused by the chief executive officer of An Post.  I ask this House to ensure that the chief executive changes his mind and includes the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association on the <Col N="1073" /> commemorative list.  There was a debate on teenage drinking in this House last week.  Today a Garda review document was circulated to Members pointing out that parents are not adequately instructed on how to deal with the problem of teenage drinking.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association tries to help parents in this regard and it is scandalous that An Post, a semi-State body, has refused to include it in the commemorative list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Farrell.  The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association has rendered this State a noble service.  Regardless of whether one is a pioneer, one is worthy of commemoration by way of this stamp.</P>
      <P>I represent an area where one-third of students drop out of school early.  There are no school attendance officers in the county.  There are large urban areas of Dublin without this service.  I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on truancy and early school leaving as this problem specifically affects the greater urban areas of Dublin.  It is reprehensible that there are no school attendance officers working in this area.  I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to do something about this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to voice my concern regarding taking all Stages of Bills on the one day.  It is planned to take all Stages of two Bills this week. This concern has been raised in the past and it is not a satisfactory way to handle matters.  There was an instance last week where all Stages of a Bill were to be taken on the same day.  The Minister agreed to delay Report Stage until the following day and rethink his views.  We should decide not to take all Stages on one day.  We should give serious consideration to Committee and Report Stages of Bills and not rush legislation through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In light of revelations last weekend regarding the number of registered sex offenders from England living in this country, I ask the Leader to request a progress report on the establishment of a sex offender register.</P>
      <P>On recent reports regarding the high numbers of caesarean sections and hysterectomy operations, it is important to realise that caesarean sections are proceeded with for the benefit of the mother and child.  A long debate on this issue could result in worrying people.  A number of investigations are taking place.  However, if a caesarean section or hysterectomy operation must take place, time is of the essence.  Often there is no time to get a second opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senators who called for a statement on the misuse of caesarean sections and hysterectomy operations.  This is currently the subject of debate in the national media. The absence of a statement on the matter could cause panic.  If more facts on this issue are made available, it would help to clarify the situation for <Col N="1074" /> those people who have been unnecessarily subjected to these operations and it would help to reassure others.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned the Bretton Woods Agreement Bill and our proposed contributions to the IMF and debt relief.  Will the Leader confirm reports in weekend newspapers that the Government has indefinitely shelved this legislation, mainly due to the intervention of Independent Deputies in the Dáil, and that it will not be introduced during this or the next session?</P>
      <P>Item 10, the Protection of Workers (Shops) (No. 2) Bill, 1997, has been on the Order Paper for some time.  I received many complaints this year from shop workers who said that Sunday opening has been extended not alone to the start of November, but even into October.  Preparation time for Christmas has become longer and the hours these workers are required to work without choice on Sundays has become a greater burden on them and their families.  Will the Leader allow time this week to at least debate Second Stage of the Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ó Murchú's call for a debate on human cloning.  Will the Leader extend that debate to include the possibility of introducing legislation on <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation? Ireland is the only country in the developed world which does not have such legislation.  Since I entered this House I asked the Department of Health and Children to introduce it, but no effort has been made in that regard.  People could have surrogate mothers in cottages in the Wicklow hills.  Clinics do not even have to be registered and people can do anything they want in this area.  Senator Ó Murchú is right to point out the serious situation that pertains.  How do we know that cloning could not be developed in Ireland when we do not have legislation in this area?</P>
      <P>As Senator Leonard said regarding caesarean sections, it is important that we are careful not to terrify people about them because women have them every day.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House and explain why he will not allow an update of the legislation covering The Medical Council, which the council has requested, particularly that which covers sick doctors as opposed to bad ones?  This matter could be very rationally debated in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to Senators Connor, O'Toole and Costello, item 3 will start at 7 p.m. As those who have been here for many years know, the last week of any session is always very busy.  I suggest that we examine progress on this item at 10.30 p.m. There is a considerable amount of legislation to be dealt with this week and early next week and I want the co-operation of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Connor expressed concerns about early prison releases and I will pass them on to the Minister.  Senator O'Toole raised concerns about overseas development aid and the Government's <Col N="1075" /> position on it, and I will seek a response from the Minister.  Many Senators called for statements on the National Treasury Management Agency and this will be debated at the first available opportunity.</P>
    <P>Senators Costello, Glynn, Leonard, O'Dowd, Gallagher and Henry called on the Minister for Health and Children to come into the House to discuss the various points raised.  I will be in touch with the Minister immediately after the Order of Business regarding Tallaght Hospital and other health issues.  I will see if he will set aside time to have the matter debated before the weekend.</P>
    <P>Senators Farrell and Ridge called for an urgent debate on the decision by the chief executive officer of An Post not to allow a stamp to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association.  This is a disgrace and I will allow time for a debate on Thursday.  This organisation has done a great deal of good throughout the country.  I was disappointed, to say the least, when this was rejected.  Many Members of the Oireachtas are keen that the anniversary should be commemorated.  The last Sunday in May is the date on which it is due to be celebrated in Croke Park, which was also the venue for the 50th and 75th anniversary celebrations. I will allocate time next Thursday for a debate on the matter and I will invite the Minister to attend.</P>
    <P>Senator Ridge sought an early debate on school attendance and the school leaving age.  I will allocate time for that debate.  Senator Quinn might not realise that the Whips agreed on the arrangements to deal with this Bill.  I agree with his sentiments and I have adhered to them as much as possible within the regulations but the last week of a session is a difficult time not just for the Leader of the House but for the leaders of all groups and the party Whips.  The arrangement to deal with the legislation today has been agreed by the Whips and I thank them for their co-operation.</P>
    <P>Senator Leonard asked if a list of sex offenders has been published.  I will contact the Minister's office and ascertain the position with regard to this serious matter.  Senator Gallagher asked for the up-to-date position with regard to the Bretton Woods (Amendment) Bill.  I understand it will be before the Seanad in February.  I had expected to have it this week but it has been held up in the Dáil.  The Senator also expressed concern about item 10 on the Order Paper.  I fully agree with his sentiments.</P>
    <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Seanad Éireann resolves that sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Criminal Justice (Drug <Col N="1076" /> Trafficking) Act, 1996 (No. 29 of 1996), shall continue in operation for the period ending on the 31st day of December, 2000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Miss M. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>The resolution before the House asks Senators to approve the continuation in operation of those sections of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, which relate essentially to the detention provisions contained in that Act.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Act provides that each of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would cease to be in operation at the expiry of 12 months after the date of its commencement unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that it shall continue in operation.  The Act, including the sections which are the subject of the resolution, was brought into operation with effect from 9 September 1996.  The period of operation of the sections would, therefore, have expired on 8 September 1997 unless appropriate resolutions were passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas before then.</P>
      <P>On the previous occasion, July 1997, when a resolution to continue these sections in operation was debated in this House, the date which had been set for their expiry was 31 December 1998. This was in recognition of the fact that the sections should be kept under periodic review so that the House would have the opportunity to debate their appropriateness in combating drug related crime at suitable intervals.  On this occasion it is proposed to continue them in operation for two years, that is, until 31 December 2000.</P>
      <P>It is important that Members of the Seanad should have the opportunity to re-examine legislative provisions such as these to determine the need to retain them as weapons in the Garda's armoury.  If at any stage it becomes clear that these provisions are no longer necessary, the mechanism is there for them to lapse.  I regret that that time has not yet come and that we must continue to employ the detention provisions of the 1996 Act.</P>
      <P>The effort in recent years to eliminate the menace which drugs pose to our society and to end their corrosive effects has been a concerted one on the part of the law enforcement agencies of the State.  Legislation such as the 1996 Act is only part of the answer.  Other aspects hinge on Garda operations.  In this regard I should mention some recent initiatives, all of which have yielded positive results.</P>
      <P>The Garda National Drugs Unit was established in 1996 with the primary function of targeting major drug traffickers.  In the period January to September 1998, Garda operations and joint operations involving the Garda and the Customs authorities have yielded significant drug seizures with a value of £70 million.  In addition, there have been a number of significant seizures of heroin, amphetamines, cannabis and ecstasy in the Dublin region since September.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1077" /> Operation Dóchas, which began in October 1996, has as a primary objective the making of substantial inroads into the drug problem in the city through the identification of the critical areas requiring action and the development of the necessary Garda resources to implement the operation in these areas.  This strategy operates in all Dublin districts and involves the deployment of in excess of 500 uniformed and plain clothes gardaí.  Uniformed gardaí adopt a high profile through both foot patrols and mobile patrols and work with local communities, community leaders and individual families.  Back-up is provided by specialist mobile units and other units.  This operation has already resulted in an increase in the quantity of drugs seized and an increase in the arrest of those suspected of being involved in drugs.  Since the commencement of Operation Dóchas, up to June 1998, over 21,000 arrests were made and 10,060 persons were charged.  In addition, drugs with a value of £7 million have been seized up to 30 September 1998.  To ensure its effectiveness, Operation Dóchas is subject to ongoing review, as are all Garda operations.  It will continue operating and will be revised as circumstances indicate or require.</P>
    <P>Operation Mainstreet was initiated in April 1997 with the purpose of targeting those persons engaging in the supply of controlled substances, particularly heroin, in city centre areas.  The operation has proved to be very successful, combining efforts from uniformed gardaí, the divisional drugs unit and use of the CCTV system.  This operation is ongoing and has resulted in over 2,000 searches and over 200 arrests up to June 1998 and in the period January to September 1998 seizures of £915,000 worth of controlled substances.</P>
    <P>Operation Cleanstreet which commenced in December 1997 targets on-street heroin dealers in the Dublin area.  Undercover gardaí visit areas where suspected drug dealing is taking place and when approached they buy drugs with marked money from the drug pusher.  When the undercover garda moves away, uniformed gardaí arrest the drug pusher for the purpose of a drug search, take the marked money and whatever other drugs he or she has from the pusher.  When the drug which was purchased has been analysed the pusher is then arrested and charged.  A total of 12 undercover gardaí &mdash; two from each DMA Garda division &mdash; are involved in this operation, co-ordinated by the Garda National Drugs Unit.  To date almost 200 arrests have been made, 101 of which have been made since 10 September 1998.</P>
    <P>These successes are to be applauded.  However, while we must not become complacent and drop our guard in the fight against drug criminality, it is only right that we should keep our response under review.  In this context I want to emphasise that the Government accepts fully that as well as tackling the supply side, comprehensive measures need to be taken also on the demand side.  In this context I would remind the House that a wide range of initiatives are under way in this regard, <Col N="1078" /> many of which arise in the context of the Government's strategy for dealing with social exclusion issues.</P>
    <P>Returning specifically to the resolution before the House and in order to assist Senators regarding the particular sections of the 1996 Act which are the subject of the resolution, it might be beneficial if I outline the contents of those sections. Section 2 of the Act deals with powers of detention and permits the detention of a person suspected of having committed a drug trafficking offence for up to a maximum of seven days.  The first 48 hours of this period may be authorised by a member of the Garda Síochána of specified rank.  Thereafter, authority to detain the person up to the maximum of seven days must be obtained from a judge of the Circuit Court or District Court.  In each case the authorisation may be granted where the court is satisfied that the detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>Section 3 involves an amendment of the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence) Act, 1990, to allow bodily samples to be taken in the case of a person detained under the Act.  Section 4 permits the rearrest of a person previously detained under section 2 who has been released without being charged.  The rearrest may only be made on the authority of a judge and only in cases where new information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána since the person's release. Section 5 applies certain provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, to persons detained under section 2 of the Act, so that, for example, when there are no longer reasonable grounds for suspecting a detained person of having committed an offence he or she must be released.  It also covers such matters as the provision of medical attention, access to a solicitor and the destruction of records where a detained person is not prosecuted or where he or she is acquitted.</P>
    <P>Under section 6, the Minister may make regulations providing for the attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise at, and the participation of such an officer in, the questioning of persons detained under the provisions of the Act.  The position regarding such regulations is that work is proceeding on the preparation of regulations under the section which will be the subject of consultation with the Minister for Finance and the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Act also requires the Minister to prepare a report on the operation of the particular sections covering the period since the previous resolution.  This report is required to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas before a resolution is passed by either House and must cover the period from the date the previous report ends up to a date not more than 21 days before the resolution is moved.  Such a report has already been prepared covering the period from 28 June 1997 to 30 November 1998 and was laid before both Houses last week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> The report, which is based on information received from Garda authorities, shows that the number of persons detained under section 2 during the period in question, that is between 28 June 1997 and 30 November 1998, was 708.  Of these 281 persons were detained for a period not exceeding six hours, which is the initial period of detention permitted under section 2, 272 persons were detained for a period between six hours and 24 hours, 132 for a period between 24 hours and 48 hours, 13 persons for a period between 48 hours and 120 hours and ten for a period between 120 hours and 168 hours.  The number of persons detained under section 2 who were released without charge was 301.  A total of 407 persons were charged following detention under section 2, of whom 105 were convicted.  There are 301 cases still pending before the courts and one case was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have indicated that the provisions of the legislation have proved beneficial to the force in the investigation of drug trafficking offences.  I have no doubt but that they have played their part in the fight against drug trafficking and that their continued operation is essential to the future success of that fight.  I commend the resolution to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, passed by the Houses over two years ago was the strongest anti-crime and anti-drugs legislation ever passed in these Houses in the 80 or so years of their existence.  The draconian nature of the Act cannot be questioned but it was a necessary and proportionate response to the menace of a widespread, powerful, arrogant and evil drug trafficking industry in this country at that time.  The drug barons often flouted their deeds arrogantly in view of the gardaí as they felt that the law was inadequate to deal with them and they knew that they and their advisers could turn the law into an ass if it was used against them.  Their greatest comfort was that there was no political will to strengthen the law to deal with them.  That lack of political will was most in evidence among a series of Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice in the latter half of the 1980 and the early 1990s when drug dealing and trafficking developed to frightening proportions in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In those years Ireland became one of the chief off-loading locations in Europe for drug trafficking from Asia, Central America and Latin America. There grew up a burgeoning drugs trade in practically every town and city in Ireland, and there was a huge outward trade of drugs offloaded to other destinations on the Continent. The first Minister for Justice who made a difference was Deputy Nora Owen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She was the first Minister to show the courage, guts and, above all, imagination to deal with the frightening problem.  In her two and a half years in the Department of Justice she introduced radical and sweeping changes, and the net effect of <Col N="1080" /> those changes, including the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, was to smash the intimidating power of the drug barons and to put many of them behind bars.  That Act was the single piece of legislation most responsible for the progress to date.</P>
    <P>As much more has to be done, we do not oppose the resolution to extend the lifetime of sections 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 to 31 December 2000. However, as open minded legislators we must always be mindful that such draconian provisions are regrettable and should only be upheld as long as they are absolutely necessary. The Minister of State's statistics proved that those provisions are justifiable.  Over 700 people were arrested under the Act, and there was a decline in the number of people detained before additional judicial intervention was required to detain a person any longer.  I would prefer if we were legislating to extend these provisions to 31 December 1999 rather than 2000.  We must keep a close eye on how these figures develop over time, and the House should have the opportunity to look at them every year.  If we find that the number of people being detained under the Act is declining, it would imply that the need to keep these draconian measures is also declining. We should not keep these measures on the Statute Book one day longer than we need to, and that is why there must be close and frequent monitoring.</P>
    <P>I regret the Minister is not present as there are a number of comments I wish to make on his attitude to the Bill.  The Minister frequently conveys the impression that he is more interested in punishment and vengeance than justice.  One must be concerned that someone with such sweeping powers would convey such an impression.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was introduced on Second Stage in the Dáil on 5 March 1996, the Minister, then Opposition spokesperson on Justice, stated:</P>
    <P>An example of the manner in which the Bill has been rendered virtually unworkable can be seen in section 2, the provisions of which are intended to permit the detention of certain suspects for up to seven days.  For reasons presumably known to the Minister and certainly to the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, a decision has been taken to the effect that a detained person must be brought before a court and afforded the opportunity to give and call evidence and make submissions before a period of detention can be extended.  This will render the detention section of the Bill virtually unworkable.</P>
    <P>That was a very serious statement.  At that stage in the Minister's political career, he did not want any judicial intervention in this draconian measure relating to the detention of people for up to seven days.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the gravity of any crime committed, we must never lose sight of the fact that laws governing detention must protect the rights of the detained person.  When the then Minister, <Col N="1081" /> Deputy Owen, introduced this Bill with the several interventions it contained, she was quite right to introduce the provision that continuing detention after a period of three days would have to be at the behest of a judge.  If there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that the person under arrest is the person who committed the crime, we have nothing to fear from judicial intervention.  I seriously hope that any amendment the Minister might make to this legislation would not reflect the views he expressed on 5 March 1996.</P>
    <P>We must be watchful in regard to this kind of legislation.  Such powers of detention only exist in one other area of the corpus of criminal legislation enacted in Ireland over the past 80 years or more, namely, under the special powers legislation. I regret the Minister is not present to respond to the points I made; I do not want to detract from the Ministers of State but they are not really in a position to respond to them.</P>
    <P>One must commend the tremendous progress made in this country in the past two and a half years in the war against drugs.  The success of that battle is directly related to the corpus of legislation introduced in the latter part of 1994, in 1995 and 1996 by the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen.  That is what broke the backs of the drug barons who derived their power through the use of intimidation and high technology and by fully and openly exploiting the weaknesses in the law.  It was frightening and the matter had to be dealt with.  These sweeping measures had to be taken.  I am delighted they have had the intended effect but I look forward to the day when section 2 will be suspended because it has become redundant.</P>
    <P>We will not oppose the extension of these provisions. Although I am aware that we are bound by the original legislation, it is a pity the extension must be for two years rather than one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, to the House.  I understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, is out of the jurisdiction at present.  In response to Senator Connor, I do not consider it appropriate to give accolades to any one Minister or Government.  Drugs have been the greatest scourge on society for the last decade and will probably be so for the next decade.  Whatever the make up of Government it will face the drugs problem, as is evidenced by the need to extend these draconian measures. They are necessary because the punishment must fit the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past 12 months the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and the Department have introduced five Bills in the Seanad.  That is a recognition of the position of this House.  Furthermore, of the body of legislation that has come before the Oireachtas in the past 12 months, almost one-third has come from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The Minister and Minister of State must be complimented on their <Col N="1082" /> great efforts over the past 12 months which have kept me busy.  It is an indication of the seriousness of their approach to their portfolios.</P>
    <P>The sophisticated and callous manner in which the drug barons developed their trade was one of the scourges that faced the country.  In places like west Cork, where there were several drug hauls, I am sure many drugs came in undetected over the past ten or 15 years.  Ireland was used as a gateway to Europe with the drugs being landed in remote areas, such as west Cork, Kerry and Clare.  The busiest shipping lanes in the world pass our south-west coast and I imagine that large amounts of drugs came into the country undetected. Luckily, to some extent, we were used as a stop off point and the drugs were transported to the more lucrative markets in central Europe and the UK.</P>
    <P>There has been a large number of successful detections by the Garda and Customs in the past two to three years.  There are large hauls every year and the message is getting through to international criminals that Ireland is no longer a soft touch for their trade.</P>
    <P>Whatever legislation is brought in the drugs problem will not be solved overnight.  These strong measures should be continued because they work.  However, whether we like it or not, drug use is becoming more common.  When I was growing up soft drugs like cannabis were not heard of in the west.  Nowadays they are filtering through to young people in these areas.</P>
    <P>The fight against drugs must be ongoing because the problem will not just go away. Although we are extending the provisions in the legislation until the end of 2000, it will have to be reviewed again.  Some civil rights activists will say the provisions are too draconian but only just over 1 per cent of persons detained under the legislation were held for the maximum period of 120 to 168 hours, and roughly one-third of those held, 272 people, were released after six hours. Some 301 cases are pending before the courts and there have been 105 convictions.  The follow up legislation introduced earlier this year, where people found in possession of more than £10,000 worth of drugs receive a mandatory sentence of ten years' imprisonment, will have a strong deterrent effect on drug barons who think they can rule the roost.</P>
    <P>Much ground has been covered by the Garda and the Customs and Excise.  I pay credit to previous Ministers of Justice, including Deputy Owen.  The fight against drug barons and the introduction of legislation has been going on for a long time and there is no doubt other legislation will be introduced and updated in the next five years.  I have no difficulty with these measures &mdash; they are harsh but they are necessary &mdash; so I commend the motion to the House and trust the decision will be unanimous.  We need these provisions because in a small way we are winning battles in the war against crime.  The war is not over, it is ongoing, and this motion is essential.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> We have no option but to continue these provisions for the present and the near future.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Connor, I would love to live in a society where these measures would not be necessary. Unfortunately, over the last ten to 15 years, events like the murder of Veronica Guerin showed that drug barons thought they could throw their weight around and get rid of a reporter who got in their way.  They are malicious and criminally insane, and in that regard the motion is essential.  I recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, but I would liked to have seen the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform here.  When this Act was going through the Dáil he rubbished certain sections and said it would be unworkable because of the in-built protections after the first 48 hours of detention; an application must be made, on the word of a Garda chief superintendent, to a Circuit Court or District Court Judge to extend the period for a further three days, and another application to extend it for another two days.  The Minister has been proven wrong in his opposition to that provision. The only legislation he has introduced to contribute to the war on drugs crime was the mandatory ten year sentence for possession of £10,000 worth of any type of drugs, which is definitely unworkable, whereas the Act we introduced in Government has been shown to be workable and the Minister has given us the statistics to prove it.</P>
      <P>At the time this Act was introduced we had a serious problem with drug trafficking, dealing, addiction and abuse.  Almost three-quarters of those ending up in Mountjoy were convicted of drug-related crimes.  What are the current statistics? Have we reduced drug related crime?  It appears there are more drug addicts than there were two years ago; is that because they are now registered or has the position worsened?  There is a lack of adequate data and information about the drug scene, whether in the community or in prisons, and about the number of addicts.</P>
      <P>The picture on hard drugs like heroin is also unclear.  A couple of years ago approximately 80 per cent of drug seizures were of cannabis and amphetamines and only a small percentage were of hard drugs like heroin and cocaine.  No police force can claim to be winning the war against drugs if a majority of seizures are of soft rather than hard drugs.  Again, I would like to know the up to date figures in this area but the Minister has not presented them to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State had been unable to come to grips with this massive problem since 1979, when heroin first appeared in Ireland and people began to go to prison for crimes for which no one had previously been convicted.  The profile of the prison population changed to one in which most prisoners were involved in some way with drug abuse.  The response was to introduce tough legislation to target drug traffickers, not just arresting <Col N="1084" /> drug addicts.  The other important legislation in the package was the Act setting up the Criminal Assets Bureau, which seized the assets of those making a killing, in every sense of the word, from drug pushing.  It was the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, who introduced that Bill, so it was a combined effort of his Department and the then Department of Justice to devise the legislation targeting major drug pushers.</P>
    <P>The third element was the establishment of the Garda drugs unit, with the function of targeting major drug traffickers.  For the first time, the State focused on those in charge of the supply side, who were using others for consumption and sale.  That has been a great success story in the fight against drugs and a number of other European countries are interested in the package of measures we introduced.</P>
    <P>The measures were accompanied by greater Garda awareness.  In the past I was critical of the Garda for not focusing on the major problem which was ravaging sections of our community &mdash; the proliferation of drugs.  Operation Dóchas, which introduced an extra 500 gardaí to Dublin, was a tremendous help, as were the follow-up Operation Main Street and Operation Clean Street.</P>
    <P>The other decision taken in 1996 was the establishment of the drugs task force, which recommended that £20 million be made available for projects to deal with youngsters at risk in disadvantaged areas and communities, to keep them away from drugs.  Originally, the Government decided to change that from £20 million to about £2 million, but under pressure it decided to increase it to £30 million.  Of course, £30 million is only a drop in the ocean in terms of what will be required and the number of applications for projects for young people at risk which have been made throughout the country.</P>
    <P>That is the background.  We had ghettoised areas which were being neglected in terms of policing and were being exploited by cynical drug pushers.  We put tough legislation in place in regard to powers of arrest and detention and seizure of assets, and we established a tough enforcement unit &mdash; the national drugs unit &mdash; which I give full plaudits for its work.</P>
    <P>In the space of those two years, there is now confidence in a community which had become antagonistic to the Garda.  Gardaí can now meet ordinary members of those communities in the street and talk to them, which was not the case in the late 1980s or early 1990s when whole areas of Dublin were virtually no-go areas for the Garda. There are now no no-go areas for the Garda in Dublin city.  That is a tremendous development and is the result of the package of proposals which was put in place.</P>
    <P>I share Senator Connor's concern about changing the annual review to a two yearly review.  I would much prefer if the report was made on an annual basis, which would give us the opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> We are going to have to enact the European Convention on Human Rights in our domestic law, at which time we will have problems with some of the terms in section 2, particularly the seven days detention provision.  There will also be problems with some of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, which has the same detention period, in relation to the British-Irish Agreement and the Real IRA.  I would like to see a greater breakdown of the statistics to see how the legislation is working.  This would allow us to see whether it is being used exclusively for the purpose intended or whether it has, as legislation tends to do, moved into other areas of enforcement.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to have made any progress in the area of video recording of interviews and interrogations, which is only happening on a pilot basis.  The report of the Barra Ó Briain committee in 1977 or 1979 recommended video and audio recording of interviews in Garda stations but, 20 years later, we are still at the pilot stage. We need to introduce that measure.  There will be a great deal of pressure on us in regard to human rights issues, especially when the European Convention on Human Rights is introduced, which we must do in the context of the British-Irish Agreement within the next 19 months.</P>
    <P>I am not fond of legislation which can be used in a repressive fashion.  Whenever we go beyond the norm, in terms of introducing legislation for a particular purpose at a particular time, we must constantly keep it under regular review to ensure it is not being abused in any way, that it is still necessary and that we get it off the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, mentioned in her speech that it is important that measures such as those contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill, 1996, should be kept under review and that Members of the House should have the opportunity, periodically, to receive a report on the effectiveness of the particular provisions and to express their opinions on them.  Having listened to the views expressed here today, it is clear that Senators also feel it is important for us to debate these issues at suitable intervals.</P>
      <P>We have a number of legislative provisions on our Statute Book which have as their objective the elimination of the menace of drug trafficking. All elected politicians are at one on the need to eliminate the drug disaster which is undermining society, particularly our young people.  Some of these measures are aimed specifically at tackling the supply side but the demand side must also be targeted, with a view to its reduction.  This involves an integrated approach to the problem, which is the approach which has been adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The success of Garda operations, such as Operation Dóchas, Operation Main Street and Operation <Col N="1086" /> Clean Street, as well as recent successes by the Garda and the Customs Service acting jointly in making significant drug seizures, is evidence of the determined effort to eliminate the problem.  I was pleased in the past, when I was Minister of State at the Department of Finance, to have brought through the Customs and Excise (Miscellaneous Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, the primary function of which was to ensure there was equality of legislation to assist the Customs and Excise officers in supporting the Garda Síochána and the Army so that, as Senator O'Donovan said, there would be a co-ordinated and co-operative effort to protect our coast, airports, sea ports and any other locations which drug barons could use to get drugs into the country.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Connor was critical of the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue.  The advantage of being in Government is that the most up-to-date information is always available to us &mdash; or, at least, it should be &mdash; but the Opposition does not always have such up-to-date information, in the interests of security, which can place it at a disadvantage.</P>
    <P>As I said, the solution of the problem requires an integrated approach of which legislation is one element.  The success of the 1996 Act can be gauged from the report on its operation between the 28 June 1997 and 30 November 1998, which has already been laid before this House.  The report shows that, during the period in question, 105 persons were convicted in the courts and a further 301 cases are still pending.  From the information in that report, based on material provided by the Garda, it is clear the Act has been used successfully in securing convictions against persons trafficking in drugs.</P>
    <P>Regrettable as such measures may appear to be, they are necessary if we are serious about ridding ourselves of the destructive potential posed by drug traffickers.  If, and when, the threat they pose is eliminated, the provisions of the 1996 Act will no longer be necessary.  As I said earlier, the mechanism exists for these particular sections to expire.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, my Government colleague, regrets he cannot be here today.  He is, as Senator O'Donovan said, out of the jurisdiction on very important national business. He would love to have been here to answer any questions but both Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, and I were pleased to be here on his behalf.  I thank Senators for their co-operation. I wish everyone a very happy and peaceful Christmas and a very successful new year.</P>

      <P>Cuireann sé áthas orm an Bille tábhachtach seo a chur ós comhair an tSeanaid inniu.  Is cinnte go bhféachfar ar an mBille seo sna blianta atá romhainn mar Bhille stairiúil; Bille a dtéann i ngleic leis an ngá atá ann cosaint cuimsitheach a thabhairt d'ár n-oidhreacht.</P>
      <P>From ancient time architecture has been called the mother of arts.  The architecture of any society or any age tells us much about the economic and social life of that age.  It also tells us about the technology and aesthetics of the age of the society from which it comes.  Our buildings are the greatest physical representation of our history and our cultural past.  It follows from this that every generation carries a great onus of responsibility to ensure that its built inheritance is preserved and passed on to future generations having, of course, added its own architectural increment.</P>
      <P>While legislation in this country for the protection of ancient buildings and monuments has generally been regarded as strong and effective, the legislation governing other buildings of architectural merit has not been as effective as it should be in preserving such buildings from the pressure of the modern age.</P>
      <P>No one would now deny that there have been serious lapses in our national performance in this respect.  Unfortunately, once lapses are made in this area they cannot be rectified.  There is widespread agreement that we need to put in place a much more effective regime if we are to properly fulfil our responsibility to our own and future generations to protect our architectural heritage from the threats posed to it, threats that can range from a lack of resources to carelessness, ignorance and greed.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme contains a commitment to introduce up-dated and consolidated planning laws to prepare for the challenges of the new millennium.  This Bill on the architectural heritage represents the first stage in meeting that commitment.  I plan to follow it up with a comprehensive consolidated planning Bill, the heads of which I plan to bring to Government shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This new regime, decided on by Government for the protection of our architectural heritage, <Col N="1088" /> can be said to comprise three pillars: modern, robust, comprehensive legislation, dedicated financial resources and the employment of adequate expertise and knowledge.  The first pillar consists of this planning Bill, which will transform the legislative protection afforded to the architectural heritage.  It has been drafted following comprehensive consultation and consideration of all issues involved.  Many of the provisions derive from the report of the interdepartmental working group on strengthening and protecting the architectural heritage which reported in September 1996.  The committee had consulted widely before reporting and many observations were received following publication of the report.  The Bill expands and improves on the working group's recommendations.</P>
    <P>The Bill will introduce a systematic approach to the protection of buildings in Ireland.  Local authorities have been criticised in the past for widely divergent approaches for listing buildings for protection in their development plans.  Some local authorities have comprehensive lists, others have none; some have one list while others have six or seven.</P>
    <P>Distinctions are often made between objectives to preserve buildings and objectives to consider their preservation.  The Bill will bring uniformity to the way in which buildings are protected in the future.  The formal record of protected structures created under the Bill will be kept in a standard format common to all local authorities.  The Bill will also remove the distinctions between lists.  If a building is worth placing on the record of protected structures then it is worth protecting.</P>
    <P>This new systematic approach to protecting built heritage will be enhanced by using the resources of the national inventory of architectural heritage, which is administered by the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The inventory will be used as a national database to record Ireland's built environment.  It is intended that those buildings which are identified by the inventory as being of international, national or regional significance will be recommended to the local authorities for protection.</P>
    <P>Local authorities will continue to have an ongoing role in identifying buildings for protection independently of the inventory.  They will have to determine the buildings which are of significance to the local community and, therefore, deserving of protection.  Guidance will be given to the local authorities to help them carry out these functions in a consistent manner.</P>
    <P>Once buildings are identified for protection they will be subject to comprehensive protection. The protection extended to buildings under the Planning and Development Act, 1963, was too narrow and many interiors have been lost because they were not specifically listed.  This Bill will ensure that where a building is protected the whole building, interior and curtilage, will be subject to that protection.</P>
    <P>Any works which would affect the character of the building will require planning permission.  I <Col N="1089" /> recognise that this proposal could be quite onerous on owners of protected buildings.  Therefore, the Bill provides that owners and occupiers of protected buildings will be entitled to a declaration from the planning authority which would determine the types of works which the planning authority considers would affect the character of the building.</P>
    <P>Another key issue in providing comprehensive protection is the need to protect buildings independently of the statutory five year review of development plans.  The Bill, therefore, facilitates the addition of buildings to the record of protected buildings as the need arises.  Furthermore, the Bill tackles the issue of protected buildings being allowed to fall into dilapidation due to the neglect of the owner or occupier and will allow local authorities take a proactive role in ensuring protected buildings do not become neglected and are modelled on the Derelict Sites Act, 1990.  We have had a number of very infamous cases where this was allowed to happen in the past but this Bill will ensure that it can no longer happen.</P>
    <P>The Bill also responds to the need to identify and make provision in development plans for special streetscapes or other areas of interest which need to be protected.  This will allow planning authorities to apply local planning policies to these areas in a way that will ensure that any development is compatible with the character of the area.  For example, this will facilitate protection of a whole square rather than just individual buildings.</P>
    <P>I accept that legislation in itself is not sufficient to ensure the protection of the built heritage, it needs to be backed by resources.  This brings me to the second pillar &mdash; money.  The Government announced last May that it would provide a new budget line of £5 million per annum from 1999 onwards to ensure that the package of measures can be fully implemented.  Out of this around £4 million will be available for grant aid for protected buildings.</P>
    <P>The new scheme of grant aid will be administered by the principal local authorities as it is the local authorities who will have the statutory function of protecting buildings under this Bill.  An advisory group made up of representatives from my Department, the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, the Heritage Council and the County and City Managers' Association is finalising recommendations on the detailed terms and conditions of the new grant scheme for protected structures.  We are aiming for effective and consistent administration of grant aid throughout the country.  I expect that, in the initial years at least, those buildings most at risk will be a priority.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also being provided with £300,000 per annum to assist them in employing the necessary conservation expertise to ensure that all buildings worthy of listing are identified, the legislation enforced and the grant scheme operated effectively.  Coupled with the major increase in general funding for local authorities <Col N="1090" /> which I am making available next year, this allocation should enable the local government service to employ 15 to 20 conservation officers.  This new cadre of conservation experts will constitute part of the third pillar &mdash; the expertise about which I spoke earlier.</P>
    <P>The provision of proper conservation advice is fundamental to the success of this Bill.  I am certain, therefore, that the deployment of conservation expertise in the local authority service will bring such expertise to local authorities and will enhance it where it already exists.  This local expertise will in turn be backed up by comprehensive guidelines drawn up at central level by Dúchas, the heritage service, in consultation with my Department.  Dúchas will also act as a central unit providing day-to-day advice to conservation officers and local authorities regarding their functions. This system will bring a consistency of approach to the conservation of the built environment in Ireland which has been lacking up to now.</P>
    <P>I will now turn briefly to the main provisions of the Bill.  Senators have available a very comprehensive explanatory memorandum so I will concentrate on the essential features.  The definitions of structure and protected structure in section 1 are crucial to the understanding of the Bill.  The effect of these definitions is that when a building is included in the record of protected structures, the interior of the protected structure, including its fixtures and features and the land and structures immediately around it &mdash; the curtilage &mdash; will be automatically protected and will no longer require specific listing.  This marks a major advance on the present limited provisions. Other features in the grounds of the structure beyond the curtilage, for example, a folly or an ornamental fountain, which add to the architectural interest of the building may also be included for protection if specifically identified on the record.  It should also be noted that the term &ldquo;protected structure&rdquo; as a legal term will replace the term &ldquo;listed building&rdquo;.  This is in line with common international practice.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that planning authorities will be obliged to have a record of structures of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social or technical interest which will form part of the development plan for the area.  This constitutes a wider definition of architectural heritage than the reference to buildings of &ldquo;artistic, historic or architectural interest&rdquo; in the existing legislation.  The record of protected structures will continue in existence even where a review or a variation of a new development plan is carried out under Part III of the 1963 Act.</P>
    <P>The requirement to set up a record is linked to the mandatory provision to include objectives in the development plan for the protection of the architectural heritage which is provided by the amendment of section 19 of the Planning Act, 1963, by section 33 of this Bill.  This amendment in section 33 also obliges planning authorities to include objectives in the development plan to <Col N="1091" /> protect groups of structures and places, including townscapes.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides that the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may, after consulting with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, issue guidelines to planning authorities to assist them in carrying out their functions under this Bill in protecting buildings and townscapes.  Again, the guidelines will ensure that a consistent approach to protecting the built heritage is adopted nationwide.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that in addition to the above guidelines, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands may recommend the inclusion of particular structures in the record of protected structures.  This will be based on the information contained in the National Inventory of the Architectural Heritage.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides that a planning authority may add a building to the record of protected structures where it considers that such a building warrants protection or may delete a structure where protection is no longer warranted.  The making of a deletion from, or an addition to, the record of protected structures may be carried out when reviewing the development plan as part of the statutory five year review or in accordance with provisions laid down in section 6.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the procedure for amending the record of protected structures independently of the development plan review process.  This will allow buildings to be protected as the need arises without having to wait for the five year development plan review process &mdash; a weak point of the old system.  The final decision on what structures are to be accorded protected status will rest with the elected members of the authority.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provided that planning permission will be required for any works on a protected structure which affect its character.  As the new protection will now extend to the interior of structures permission may, therefore, be required for interior decorating activity, like plastering, if it would affect the character of the structure. However, in order to clarify for owners and occupiers of protected structures exactly what works they are permitted to do without permission, they may request the local authority to indicate those works in a declaration.  For example, a declaration could state that any works to the interior would not affect the character of the building and, therefore, would not require planning permission. Alternatively, in the case of very valuable interiors permission may be required where, for example, redecoration was being contemplated. Planning authorities will be required to issue the declarations within three months of a request.  Provision has been made in the transitional arrangements to extend the time if a large number of requests for declarations is made when the Bill is enacted.</P>
    <P>Special consideration is to be given to structures which are used for religious worship.  Planning authorities will be obliged to request liturgical <Col N="1092" /> requirements and to consult the relevant Church authorities when issuing a declaration. The same will apply to a planning application affecting the interior of a protected church. Section 9 provides that it will be an offence to deliberately damage a protected structure, with fines of up to £1 million on indictment.  Owners and occupiers will be under a duty to ensure that a protected structure is not endangered, either through their actions or through neglect.  Section 10 provides that if a protected structure is endangered, planning authorities may issue a notice to the owner or occupier requiring works to be carried out.  The planning authority may at its discretion assist the owner or occupier either financially or otherwise in carrying out the works.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides that the planning authority may require the owner or occupier of a protected structure to carry out works to restore the character of a protected building.  This could include the removal of incongruous signs on a protected building or street, even if such signs were erected lawfully.  The planning authority will pay the full cost of any work carried out under this section. Sections 22 to 29 give power to planning authorities to purchase a protected structure which is endangered, compulsorily if necessary, and set out the procedures to be followed if this happens.</P>
    <P>Section 30 requires sanitary authorities, before issuing a dangerous buildings notice in relation to a protected building, to consider instead whether a notice to carry out works under this Bill or under the Derelict Sites Act would be more appropriate.  This is not an attempt to circumscribe a sanitary authority's powers, merely to oblige them to consider the fact that they may be dealing with a protected building which should be preserved if possible.</P>
    <P>Section 38 provides for transitional arrangements for buildings currently listed for protection or preservation under a development plan.  These will automatically become protected under the Bill.  However, owners and occupiers of these buildings will be consulted and they will be entitled to make representations to the planning authority regarding whether or not their buildings should remain as a protected structure.</P>
    <P>This Bill marks a major advance in the way we preserve and look after the precious heritage of buildings which we are lucky to possess.  It is a mark of our maturity as a society that there is widespread support for devoting some of our increased wealth to preserving our physical history for our own edification and for those who come after us.  It also shows our commitment to sustainable development by encouraging the use and re-use of existing building stock so that those buildings which have been in use for many decades, or even centuries, continue in use for years to come, not as museum pieces but as buildings which adapt and change as society and life itself adapts and changes.  I commend this historic and landmark Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome also this detailed Bill.  This is my first opportunity as spokesperson for the Environment and Local Government to address the Minister.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the Bill without going into specific details.  I will go into the details of the Bill on Committee Stage.  It would be impossible in the short time available to us today to discuss every aspect of the Bill.  The Minister described architecture from ancient times as &ldquo;the mother of the arts&rdquo;.  More recently it was called &ldquo;building politics&rdquo;.  I agree with this change because it is important to understand the distinction between the two, and the distinction between that and other arts.  While I have little experience as spokesperson on Local Government and the Environment, I have some experience in the history of building, having lectured for a number of years on the subject.  I can define the difference between that and other forms of art.  If one looks at a two-dimensional painting from the front, the artist tries to infer that there is depth in the painting. In sculpture there is the opportunity to look at it from outside.  Architecture is different in that it is not just two-dimensional, it is three-dimensional and internal also.  I welcome the fact that under the Bill we will be able to control the interiors as well as the exteriors of buildings.  It is important to remember that the front of a building does not stand alone.  The interior is often a reflection of the exterior.  I welcome the Bill from that point of view.</P>
      <P>The preamble to the Bill states that this commitment is contained in the Programme for Government.  I believe its origin is slightly earlier, through the ratification of the Granada Convention in 1987.  The then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, ratified the instruments on 20 January 1997 in Spain.  That is the filip which led to this Bill.  I am not saying the accolades should not go to the present Government, but there is a great commitment in this country to our culture and past.</P>
      <P>A number of aspects of that ratification are not included in the Bill.  Some of the obligations of the Granada Convention include the maintenance of inventories &mdash; Dúchas is doing this at present, statutory protection measures &mdash; these are included in the Bill, financial and fiscal measures for the maintenance, conservation and restoration of architectural heritage within the limits of available budgets &mdash; in Europe there is always a constraint on things when available budgets are referred to.  I will refer to this later regarding the number of people appointed to oversee this work and the adoption of integrated conservation policies which make conservation, promotion and enhancement of the architectural heritage a major feature of cultural, environmental and planning policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other aspects include developing public awareness of the value of conserving our architectural heritage.  Perhaps it is not appropriate to include <Col N="1094" /> this in the Bill.  However, it should be emphasised through second level educational programmes. Third level students of civil or construction engineering or architecture are made aware of this. Part of a historic course should be to place proper emphasis on the significance of buildings of architectural importance.  For example, when children visit this House on school tours they should know what to expect, not that this is just the Houses of Parliament.  Another aspect is the promotion of training in conservation skills.  This should be emphasised also.  The Bill refers to people with those skills.  When the inventory is completed and we have decided on landscapes, streetscapes and buildings, it will be necessary for continuity to have people with those skills in every local authority.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the fostering of new uses for old buildings.  The development of sponsorship by non-profit making associations in the field of architectural heritage and conservation should be accelerated. There may be ways of encouraging people to get involved, such as buying a famous painting and donating it to an art gallery.  The exchange of information and expertise on architectural heritage and conservation policies and practices between parties to the convention is outside the remit of the Bill.  However, it could be emphasised.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a growing awareness among the public about our heritage. Very often most of those who write to Deputies, Senators and local authority members about the protection of buildings are well intentioned but have little experience or skills and do not know whether the projects are worthwhile or if they should proceed with them.  If the inventory is complete, a judgment may have to be made against the protection of a building and then it can be decided whether local authorities are right. However, until now judgments were made on buildings and derelict sites that could not be preserved and we were asked to invest money in buildings which would be impossible to maintain.</P>
    <P>The 1976 Act dealt with the preservation of buildings of architectural, artistic and historical interest and it is proposed to replace those provisions with buildings, including townscapes, of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, scientific, social and technical interests. Those latter four interests are the major changes in the legislation.  I am a little confused about them and I ask the Minister to explain them as I am not sure what the Department's interest is in regard to them.</P>
    <P>For example, industrial architecture involves objects such as a mill race, which acted as a power source for electricity or grinders.  The Minister may be too young to remember them but I recall them as a source of energy common to many parts of Ireland, particularly Galway, which was an early industrial city.  They could be rebuilt and used as places of educational and scientific interest where students and young people could <Col N="1095" /> see the operation of belt systems driven by water. Investors who may have a parallel involvement in other energy sources might get involved and it could be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the social aspect given that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; covers all activities.  I would prefer if it were defined more clearly in the Bill because it is open to misinterpretation. For example, I live in a village outside Galway city that has an old townhouse in which one of the tribes of Galway, the Blakes, lived.  When I moved into the village 20 years ago, it had approximately 15 thatched cottages whereas it has two now.  Historically, the landed gentry lived in the townhouse with the village immediately beside containing thatched cottages, which relates to the &ldquo;social interest&rdquo;.  The cottages unfortunately have disappeared to a large degree and the castle burned down but there is a possibility that it could be restored.  People could be shown the village as an example of the great divide in the last century and as a reflection of our true history. Is that what is meant by the &ldquo;social interest&rdquo;? The scientific interest could relate to the mill race, to which I referred earlier.  Will the Minister tease that out?</P>
    <P>A number of years ago when I was a Member of the Lower House a recently widowed woman came to me with a huge problem.  It related to a castle, or townhouse, on her land which was used as a piggery at the time.  She was directed by the local authority to make it safe or knock it down. A crack ran up the side of the building and in order to make it safe she would have had to spend much money.  She had four children and simply could not afford it.  Therefore, the easiest option for her was to knock it down.  Of course, when she went to do so she was told that she could not.  She was then left in a quandary in that she could not knock it or rebuild it.  An American made her an offer whereby he would take away the building bit by bit and then rebuild it but, of course, he was not allowed.  That demonstrated the inconsistencies in the old Planning Act.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide opportunities for people or local authorities to step in and carry out the work in such situations provided, of course, they do not expect the owner of the property, who cannot afford to carry out the work, to carry the can for it.  How can a local authority afford it?  An American re-built the castle I mentioned, but that led to another problem.  When she had rebuilt this beautiful castle, she found that dampness was creeping in and she had to plaster the outside of the building.  I do not know how that would fit in under the Bill, but in order to make the castle habitable it had to be plastered and it lost its character.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another aspect of townscapes and curtilage.  Long Walk in Galway is much painted but it has nothing to offer architecturally, socially, scientifically or under any other heading except by being encompassed as a painting.  Each house along it was coloured slightly differently <Col N="1096" /> and the levels of each roof are slightly different. However, a huge structure was allowed to develop behind it, correctly so under planning laws, which dwarfs the townscape.  If this Bill is passed and Long Walk accepted as a townscape, will the developer, who is within his rights, be prevented from building at such a height behind the street?</P>
    <P>Another question that arises is that the developer may be in an area where there are tax concessions for development and he will find that he must apply to the local authority to go ahead with the project.  Under the proposed Bill, he may have to wait up to three months or even longer and that delay, coupled with that normally associated with planning, through formal objections, could put the project outside the planning deadline or delay it so much that the developer's money would be tied up and he could end up saying that he could not afford it.  These issues must be teased out.</P>
    <P>I will refer to specific sections on Committee Stage when I will have a better opportunity to tease out the issues I raised.  However, I completely agree with the Minister in regard to the dangerous building notice provision in section 20. It is a great step forward and at least allows an objective decision to be made regarding whether a building is dangerous or can be repaired. Sections 22 to 29 give power to planning authorities to purchase a protected structure which is endangered, if necessary by order, and set out the procedures to be followed if this happens.  The cost of this might be low in a small town but in a large city such as Galway, Limerick or Dublin, the cost might be extraordinarily high.  If a local authority was to apply a compulsory purchase order, its £3.9 million allocation for next year would be gone.  These sections need to be discussed to explain who will pay for these orders but my understanding is that the local authorities will bear the burden of the cost.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the thrust of Bill but there are aspects which I want to tease out.  I want to see the social and scientific interests more clearly defined.  However, I welcome the Bill and look forward to discussing it further with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on this legislation, which is long overdue.  A great deal of damage was done in the past.  If legislation such as this had been introduced many years ago much of our heritage, damaged more through ignorance than neglect, would have been saved.  I compliment the many people who donated their estates and historical buildings to the State.  The State protected the buildings and many of them are now tourist attractions. Muckross House in Killarney is an example of an historic building which was taken over by the Office of Public Works.  It attracts thousands of tourists annually.  In this legislation the Minister is trying to protect many other such buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also compliment the Minister for removing the term &ldquo;listed&rdquo; and substituting the term &ldquo;protected&rdquo;. <Col N="1097" /> That is a step in the right direction.  I compliment the Government for honouring its commitment in An Action Programme for the Millennium by introducing this legislation.  It has been long anticipated.</P>
    <P>People who had historical buildings on their land often did not realise their heritage value or were unaware of their history.  In many cases, when they could not repair the buildings they had no option but to knock them down.  Such buildings can never be replaced.  We owe it to future generations to protect a land that is steeped in history and the many buildings of historical value located in remote parts of the country.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has involved the local authorities in dealing with this issue and that he will make the necessary resources and staff available to them.  That will be necessary to carry out research and to compile a comprehensive list of protected buildings.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct in saying that there have been serious lapses in protecting buildings of historical importance.  It is also true that once a lapse has been made, it cannot be rectified later as we have seen time and time again.  I am anxious to get more information on many sections of the Bill but I will wait until Committee Stage when the Minister can discuss them in more detail.</P>
    <P>The aim of the Bill is the important matter on this Stage.  I was once the owner of an old jail or bridewell in my native village of Tarbert.  The architectural detail in the building was unbelievable and I was glad to offer it to the local development association which spent an enormous amount of money restoring it.  If that building had been lost, local people would have lost a valuable example of how old jails were built and operated.  Local communities which carry out this type of restoration work deserve our compliments. They collect money and use their own resources to fund their work.</P>
    <P>In the Bill, the Minister introduces a different type of structure to take responsibility for protected buildings.  There are many buildings throughout the country which should be protected, particularly in remote areas where one often sees round towers, beehive huts and other structures of historical value.  The provisions of the Bill also apply to urban structures of historical value.  Townhouses, for example, might be the birthplace or former home of historically important Irish figures.  These places are of historical value for the future and it is important that they are protected.</P>
    <P>The legislation provides that any work which would affect the character of a building will require planning permission.  That is only right and proper.  The Minister recognises that this proposal could be onerous for the owners and occupiers of protected buildings so the Bill provides that they will be entitled to a declaration from the planning authority which would determine the type of work the authority believes would affect the character of the building.  That is an <Col N="1098" /> important provision.  It ensures there will be consultation between the planning authorities and the owners of protected properties.  If an owner cannot afford to restore a protected property, the local authority will be able to take on that task and even take over ownership of the building with the permission of the owner.</P>
    <P>For many years countries such as Italy, Spain, Germany and France have attached great importance to protecting their historical buildings. Structures that have survived since the time of the Roman Empire, even parts of columns, are preserved while in Ireland we have tended to destroy historical structures, even if they date from the first inhabitants on the island.</P>
    <P>I recently visited one of the Skelligs Islands off the coast of Kerry and saw the old monastic remains that have been preserved.  They are a credit to the people who undertook the task of preservation. If those remains had been destroyed, it would have been shameful.  It is important to protect heritage structures and to pass them on in good condition to future generations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on taking positive action on this important matter.  I am also pleased that he has involved the local authorities, which will mean a hands-on approach.  If important buildings are identified, it is better that their preservation is carried out at local level rather than being directed from a central office in Dublin where the staff cannot keep an eye on every protected building.  Local authorities are better placed to protect such buildings.</P>
    <P>I look forward to discussing the Bill in detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Fine Gael will support this Bill. Any legislation relating to the planning process in local authorities, particularly with regard to preserving buildings of artistic, architectural or historical interest, is welcome.  I hope the Bill will have a speedy passage although I foresee difficulties arising with regard to costings and how the legislation operates on the ground.</P>
      <P>Will planners in local authorities work in conjunction with conservationists or other professionals who are qualified in this area? Obviously some buildings will be of value because their structure might date from a certain time and there might only be a limited number of such buildings left.  Other buildings may be less structurally valuable but have extra historical interest because of who was born or lived there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will know that local authority planning offices are very busy, particularly with complaints about how areas are being developed, perhaps without planning permission.  The process of warning notices can be tardy.  A planner in my authority told me so many decisions have to be made before the end of the year.  The office staff are flat out with the applications before them at this time of year, applications for ordinary house extensions which have to be approved, larger developments which may need environmental impact statements or further consideration <Col N="1099" /> and others which have been in the pipeline for some time for which further information is required.</P>
    <P>Planning officials are under pressure.  Residents might call about a structure, but the legal process, putting up a warning notice, felling trees and so on, is slow.  If a person wants to destroy a building it is easier for them to do it themselves than for the local authority to keep the process going.</P>
    <P>The Minister is giving extra money to local authorities but, when examining the operation of the Act, he should remember there are many rundown buildings of great historical value which could be renovated for the purposes of preservation and tourism.  There must be an acceleration of the operations of local authorities.  Planners are under a great deal of pressure with the healthy state of the construction industry, with an ever increasing amount of applications for extensions.</P>
    <P>A member of An Bord Pleanála said recently that the number of appeals, successful appeals in particular, has increased substantially.  Whether it be a major structure or an extension which interferes with the conditions of a neighbour, the legislation should allow for opportunities for individuals who can be affected by construction but who do not have the financial wherewithal to make an appeal successfully.</P>
    <P>The preparation of development plans by local authorities is an important issue.  According to certain scribes, one would think that local authority members take it upon themselves to start rezoning or planning without any regard for the law.  It is a statutory function which is subject to guidance of the planners and representations made by interested groups.  In light of what has been written at times, it is important to note this is a statutory function of the local authority and that plans are displayed and representations received from the public.  People who are elected are closer to what is happening than those writing articles.</P>
    <P>We all welcome this Bill, particularly as it relates to preservation and maintenance of buildings of great historical significance.  Senator Norris has been a tremendous supporter of the preservation of certain buildings, but the Minister will know that when buildings are being preserved, thousands of pounds can be sunk into their restoration and maintenance.  It can be a bottomless pit.  We all have favourite areas but buildings are not preserved by doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands, Deputy de Valera, well in what they intend to do.  I support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I compliment the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, on it.  This Bill will be welcomed by all as it will safeguard many of our fine historic buildings for generations to come while allowing them to be developed for use in the modern age <Col N="1100" /> in a planned way which will not damage their basic structure or beauty.  Many of them are in the Minister's county of Meath.  In Ireland we are fortunate to have many fine buildings from previous centuries.  Their beauty is magnificent and they attract tourists.  It is very important that they are protected.  This Bill places a clear responsibility on the planning authorities to create a record of buildings to be protected and to preserve the character of places and townscapes of interest.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Minster must be congratulated on the supporting measures in the Bill which will greatly assist the owners and occupants of protected buildings.  A new scheme of grants for protected buildings is being introduced in 1999 at a cost of £3.9 million which will be administered by the principal local authorities.  This is most welcome and the Minister deserves our congratulations for securing this money.</P>
      <P>Owners and occupants of protected buildings will be entitled to a declaration from the planning authorities which will determine the type of work the planning authorities consider would affect the character of the buildings.  The administration of the grants scheme and the drawing up of the declaration of work will require technical experience by the local authority.  The Government is allocating £300,000 towards this service in 1999.  This is also very welcome.  It may seem small when divided across the country but it is a step in the right direction and we have to start somewhere.</P>
      <P>While it is necessary to assist those who want to carry out work on protected buildings, this Bill also gives planning authorities power to direct works to be undertaken to preserve and restore our protected buildings.  It makes it a criminal offence to damage a protected building.  There is a substantial fine for damaging such a building.</P>
      <P>This Bill will bring a new era and attitudes in the protection of old buildings which are very much part of our heritage.  The initiatives in the Bill show the commitment of the Minster and the Government to protect and secure the future of our buildings in a practical way.  I support the Bill and I congratulate the Minister for introducing it.</P>

      <P>This is an important Bill.  Conservationists and people in general want it.  In Drogheda and other places we are fed up seeing our architectural heritage being demolished, sometimes in the middle of the night and usually by people who only have an interest in making a profit.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  It is very timely and I am not critical of any part of it.  Obviously people would like to see parts of it strengthened but the core is that the Government and the State are saying they want to protect our built environment and keep it in perpetuity for future generations.  This Bill makes it more difficult for people to demolish listed buildings and protects our built environment for our children and our children's children. It is important that is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> When the Drogheda Grammar School was illegally demolished in the middle of the night approximately ten years ago, the local authority did not take immediate legal action against those who did it.  A very good friend of mine, Eddie O'Doherty, and I took a High Court action under section 27 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, to force actions through the courts on those who illegally demolished the building.  The sole basis for their action was gain.  They hoped that if the listed building was demolished in the middle of the night &mdash; which it was &mdash; they would get away with it. However, they did not reckon on Eddie O'Doherty, the County Louth Archaeological Society and me.</P>
    <P>We fought a legal action over three long years and must have appeared before nearly every judge of the High Court in those days.  If necessary to we would have gone to the Supreme Court because the issue was very important.  The question was as follows.  If a building was listed in a development as worthy of preservation and a dangerous building notice had been served, could the owners serve notice on the local authority at 5.30 p.m. on Friday, demolish the building over the weekend and get away with it?  The answer is they did not.  The court ordered those who demolished the building to sift and sort the rubble by hand and safely store anything which could be used again in rebuilding Drogheda Grammar School.  Even though that action occurred a long time ago, I am proud to say that, as I speak tonight, that building is being reconstructed. I am very thankful for the court order and the decisions of An Bord Pleanála.  In the action on the demolition of Drogheda Grammar School, An Bord Pleanála were very comprehensive in what they insisted must go back up.  Unfortunately the facade was the only part of the building which was listed but it is going back up handmade brick by handmade brick because that is what was knocked down.  All the cut stone which could be reused is being sorted and carefully located for reuse in the building.</P>
    <P>After that successful High Court action, the Oireachtas increased the fine on those who demolished listed buildings from the £10,000 maximum fine imposed on the company by the Circuit Criminal Court in Dublin.  As a result of their action there was also a criminal prosecution. It was not an easy battle.  Personally I was unhappy with the actions of both the local authority and the then Department of the Environment, not because of what they did but because of what they did not do.  Two ordinary individuals went to the courts to defend the rights of our community.  The powers at that time did not deem the law to be strong enough to take the action we took.  We took it on our own shoulders and did it successfully.  I am very happy with this Bill as it strengthens the legislation.</P>
    <P>I note the powers given to planning authorities to purchase an endangered protected structure, if necessary compulsorily.  We wanted to purchase <Col N="1102" /> Drogheda Grammar School, and the Minister of the day &mdash; I forget which side he was from &mdash; said we could buy it but that we would have to raise our own funds.  The reality was that there would have to be local funding to purchase the building. I am glad this legislation is now in place.</P>
    <P>There must be a financial incentive to a developer to keep and restore listed buildings.  This is very important.  It should be a pleasure to own or live in a listed building and not a financial noose around one's neck.  Any funding spent on maintenance, upkeep or restoration of the building should be 100 per cent tax free.  There should be grants and other incentives if the building is deemed to be of national importance, especially if it is on the list of regional or national buildings. Owners of such buildings should not be at a loss financially and, if at all possible, should receive some benefit provided money is spent developing the buildings.</P>
    <P>The subject of the interiors of listed buildings is often raised.  I know development plans vary from county to county, but County Louth is listing interiors more and more, not just facades. Important though it is, preserving a building's facade is only going a small way towards preserving its ethos.  One should try to retain the shape and materials of the interior also, such as panelling. A big loss to Drogheda Grammar School was that the wonderful oak panelling, which had been there since 1730, was spirited away in the middle of the night.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  The Minister is taking firm, positive action to protect everybody's heritage.  I am sure the National Heritage Council as well as historical and conservation societies welcome it. The action that I and the late Eddie O'Doherty took will never have to be taken again, and this Bill goes a long way towards protecting that environment.  I pay tribute to Mr. John Redmill, a consultant and eminent historical architect, for his work on the Drogheda Grammar School and for other bodies such as the National Heritage Council.  We need people of his calibre to identify what must be done.  People like him have the expertise, knowledge of and love for these buildings. This Bill is about keeping what we love for children of the future.  The gombeen man is out to make a profit at everyone's expense and does not give a damn about heritage, culture or art, but his day is done because of this Bill.  That is a good thing, and we cannot have too much of it.</P>

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Aire agus an Bhille agus tréalaím leis freisin de bharr na hoibre san.  Is cinnte nach aitheantas amháin atá i gceist da n-oidhreacht ach tá cosaint i gceist freisin. Ní amháin san ach go mbeidh airgead, comhairle agus treoir phoifisiúnta ar fáil.  Tá sé soiléir go bhfuil an-mhacnamh déanta ar an mBille seo agus táim cinnte go bhfuil san déanta ó thaobh taithí.  In an-chuid slí is féidir a bheith an-bhróach <Col N="1103" /> as cuid de na rudaí atá tar éis tárlú sa tír seo gan fhios dúinn.  Go minic, go luath ar maidin nó mar sin a thárla an raic agus thuigeamar ansan an chailliúint ní amháin dúinne ach do na sluaite atá romhainn.</P>
      <P>It is evident from the Minister's presentation that this is far reaching legislation which is intended to mirror the requirements arising out of sad experiences here.  At the same time, given the renewed confidence in ourselves as a people, we are all aware of the evocative aspect of local history.</P>
      <P>In this respect I compliment local historical societies throughout the country.  They have not only kept a watching brief, but their many journals have also educated us.  People often pass a particularly important building without being aware of its significance, but a historical society brings it to life and focuses attention on it.  That ensures a protective attitude towards the building from the local community.  That is not always sufficient, and it is important that protection is legal in nature as well.</P>
      <P>It is evident that local authorities have an important role to play in this Bill, which is as it should be.  Local communities are often the foot soldiers who are prepared to be supportive and vigilant as well as to raise necessary funds.  I remember being in Wexford recently the day after a building that meant a lot to Wexford was destroyed.  I am not sure if it was listed &mdash; it is possible it was not &mdash; but it was the home of P.J. McCall, one of the foremost ballad makers of Ireland and Wexford.  He wrote most of the songs about Wexford.  I met those who brought the news and never saw people as upset, angry and agitated.  They took that building for granted, although it was in private ownership, which is where difficulties arise.  We must educate people at local level to realise that we should not take things for granted.</P>
      <P>We are entering a new millennium and new buildings are being proposed, but the buildings of the past are probably our greatest legacy.  They tell us something about ourselves and, more importantly, tell others about us also.  They remind us of our great civilisations.  We are often credited with having saved civilisation, so when people visit we do not have to think in terms of size and skyscrapers.  We can think of our heritage, and these buildings are reminders of that heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are not reminders in a dead sense; they are very inspiring in themselves.  We will never be able to calculate how our poets, songwriters, writers and music makers have been inspired by them.  I have often listened to composers and poets talk about what inspired them to write certain pieces, and that inspiration was often what they found to be evocative in national treasures. I genuinely wonder what the spike in O'Connell Street will tell us about ourselves in 100 or 1,000 years.  I am sure some people find it pleasing, but are we being fair to ourselves by not questioning <Col N="1104" /> that?  At a minimum the people should have been given a say in this.  If three or four of the entries had been put on display it would have given people an opportunity to choose.  There is no point telling people they should see a given thing in any monument.  It should be there and they must be inspired to see it; there is no difficulty in this regard with historical buildings.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has been given such a wide remit with this Bill.  If there was a narrow definition we would lose some part of our heritage and in ten years, we would bemoan that fact when we realised its value.  A very wide definition gives us the opportunity to consider various aspects of building.  I do not believe every building should be a Rock of Cashel; it might often be something as simple as a humble home to which an important story attaches.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, a cultural centre dedicated to Brian Ború was built at the foot of the Rock of the Cashel.  A particularly fluent Texan visited the site while the work was in progress.  He admired the magnificent timber work and spoke to the carpenters.  Pointing to the Rock of Cashel itself, he said &ldquo;that building on the hill is a con job&rdquo;.  That comment illustrated that his understanding of antiquity totally differed from ours.</P>
    <P>Our antiquity is similar to Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese antiquity.  A major survey carried out by Bord Fáilte monitored various tourist pursuits in Ireland.  Visits to national monuments were first on the list, accounting for in the region of 67 per cent of pursuits.  At a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Heritage and the Irish Language earlier today I pointed out that two of the other six pursuits also related to heritage. We are obviously admired as a people and there is an obvious admiration for our antiquity. The fact people visit our national monuments is a very important factor in our international standing. That is how we will be judged, although it might not always be how the balance sheet works out.  When we enter into trade with other countries there will be a definite spin-off from our heritage status.</P>
    <P>While legislation is important we must work in partnership in this area.  In the past, national school teachers, particularly those in rural Ireland, took time out to provide their pupils with a rounded education.  They informed them about their environment and focused on the history, culture and art of their local areas.  It saddens me that I do not see that practice to the same degree today; people will travel to visit the Leaning Tower of Pisa and the Great Wall of China but will not be aware of something very important in their own area.  Schools and communities alike should be encouraged to look at the treasures in their midst, not for purely mercenary reasons but in order to recognise their inspirational element. I compliment the Minister and welcome the proposed partnership between communities, statutory bodies and Government.  The conservation officers contemplated under the Bill could play <Col N="1105" /> an important role in informing and motivating communities to adopt a united approach to protected buildings and heritage in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  My contribution will be somewhat breathless as I have just returned from Warsaw. Perhaps that is a good starting point.  Last night, I walked around the old city which was completely destroyed by the Nazis during World War II.  In the immediate aftermath of the war, in spite of all the suffering, the city was wonderfully reconstructed. It has been nominated as a United Nations heritage area and will be afforded special protections.</P>
      <P>I was attending a human rights conference and stayed in an old palace which had been lovingly reconstructed in cement.  The royal palace in Budapest, which boasted one of the most superb baroque interiors in Europe, was completely flattened and rebuilt in cement by the Communists. The job is a mere facade; nothing remains of the original palace except some grim Stalinist offices.</P>
      <P>The Polish Prime Minister, on his recent visit to Ireland, requested to visit North Great George's Street, particularly the James Joyce Cultural Centre there.  He wanted to visit the centre not only because he has a cultivated interest in the works of James Joyce &mdash; translated into Polish by a Mr. Slomczynski who doubles as Poland's leading detective novelist &mdash; but because he was interested in the manner in which the building had been preserved.  A great deal of the plaster work on the magnificent ceiling in the centre was carried out by Michael Stapleton who also worked on the ceiling of this House.  The restoration work on the ceiling in No. 35 gives the lie to the oft heard statement that people had talent in the past, but do not have it any longer.  People can carry out such work if the necessary commitment, expertise and investment are available.</P>
      <P>My reference to North Great George's Street shows how parochial I am.  I recall Frank O'Connor saying that it was better to be parochial than provincial.  If one was provincial, one was considered limited, whereas if one was parochial, it meant that by knowing one's own parish, one knew everyone else's.  I am sure the Minister is aware that North Great George's Street figured to some extent in the development of this policy.  I recall the announcement of the Fianna Fáil policy at a meeting in North Great George's Street and I also recall this legislation being heralded at a meeting in a beautifully restored house across the road from my own.  The Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands are extremely sensitive to the need to preserve these kinds of buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister pointed to our good tradition of preserving ancient buildings, such as round towers, abbeys, cathedrals, tower houses and so on, and our lack of a real concern for domestic architecture, great houses, 18th century squares and brick built terraces.  While this is understandable <Col N="1106" /> historically and culturally, we have grown up and matured and no longer seek to punish those buildings for the supposed crimes of the people who lived in them.  There is no doubt that some of those people were arrogant blackguards but it would be a pity to punish our own inheritance because of people who died long ago.</P>
    <P>A city's soul resides, partly at least, in its built environment.  I want to comment on the issue of environmental impact studies and the manner in which we have been recently rebuked by the European Commission because of our negligence in this area.  It is very important that in a city like Dublin, as in Warsaw, we retain the human scale. There is one grotesque building in Warsaw &mdash; the gift of Joseph Stalin &mdash; which distorts the skyline and is a real blister on the landscape.  Its only advantage is that it offers an extremely good view of the city.  That lack of scale is one of my hesitations in regard to the proposed &ldquo;skewer by the whore&rdquo; on O'Connell Street.  I am concerned that its enormous scale may be used as a reference point to permit the building of other high rise buildings in the city.  We must be very careful not to allow that.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the proposed alteration of the only surviving real tennis court at Earlsfort Terrace to a small concert hall.  I know the National Concert Hall and its environs well and I know there is a need for a small recital chamber.  However, it should be possible to find another place for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister hit the nail on the head when he referred to modern, robust, comprehensive legislation, dedicated financial resources and the employment of adequate expertise and knowledge.  The Bill seeks to provide these elements and it will be a number of years before we can evaluate how they work in practice.  A sum of £45 million has been allocated but it will not be enough in overall terms.  It will be enough for us to see how the legislation works in practice.  Comparatively small amounts of money can make the difference in allowing a project to work.</P>
    <P>The Minister said</P>
    <P>Local authorities have been criticised in the past for widely divergent approaches to listing buildings for protection in their development plans.  Some local authorities have comprehensive lists; some have none.</P>
    <P>I agree.  However, some of the local authorities that had lists did not make practical use of them. The legislation had little teeth, so to speak.  The House knows that ink on paper never kept a building up &mdash; one may have all the legislation one wants but if it is not operated vigorously it is of no use.  Dublin Corporation already has many of the powers in this Bill and it could take certain buildings into public ownership.  It should have done so more comprehensively.  I am aware that one or two have been taken in ownership under the local authority powers but the powers should be used more aggressively in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1107" /> For 21 years I have lived next door to a building which had some of the most superb ceilings in Dublin and beautiful fireplaces.  They have been systematically destroyed and the house is collapsing. The owners of the building have a notorious record, owning dozens of buildings in a similar state of collapse.  I have dragged them through the courts and paid for the legal action but, at the end of the day nothing has happened.  One of the parties involved has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment and I do not wish that on her as she is elderly.  She has been fined £30,000 and I do not wish that on her either.  She has served neither sentence and the building still decays.  It is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>Across the road there is another building owned by a professional man &mdash; a consultant in cosmetic surgery.  His business is appearance but the outside and inside of the building have been pillaged of their important features.  It has become a Rachmanite network of bedsitters.  It is appalling that this should be allowed to happen on a street in which every building is List 1.</P>
    <P>I welcome the employment of conservation officers, which is an excellent move.  About ten years ago I spoke at the annual meeting of the Conference of Conservation Officers of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in York and I felt a little ashamed of our record &mdash; a little ashamed that we did not really have such a professional structure in Ireland.  I welcome its establishment. However, I do not wish to decry the work of people in Dublin Corporation and in voluntary groups who have monitored what Frank McDonald called &ldquo;the destruction of Dublin&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister referred to deletions from the listing.  We need to be careful in this regard and I would like to know more about the reasons a building would be deleted from the listing.  I hope that whichever group makes such deletions it would not be amenable to political pressure, in particular that exercised by commercial sources. If that happened it would be regretted greatly.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides a requirement to be put in place for owners to restore buildings and section 12 introduces the idea of purchase by the State authorities.  I note there is a question of provision in development plans for special streetscapes which is very important.  Preserving one building when the surrounding context is allowed to decay is fatal.  One must consider the context.</P>
    <P>Without wishing to be negative I wish to refer to a note from Lancefort, a company of which the Minister and his advisers will be aware.  There are mixed views about it but it has done some good work &mdash; it is a committed company with expertise in this area.  It raised the issues of the HARP area in Dublin and the Temple Bar and College Green hotels with the EU Commission.  The response from the Commission to the complaint, which makes interesting and rather regrettable reading, is summarised in a press release which states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Not being satisfied with Ireland's response to the inquiries which it made concerning the complaint, on the application of Directive 85/337/EEC (environmental impact assessment) to Ireland's architectural heritage and the related role of Community finds, the Commission recently notified a Letter of Formal Notice under Article 169 of the EC Treaty advising the Irish authorities that it considers that the Directive has been breached in a number of respects in relation to urban development projects and hotel complexes in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As regards urban development projects, the Commission took note of your detailed submissions on the Temple Bar project and the HARP (Historical Area Rejuvenation Project). These are not treated as covered by the Irish legislation.  Moreover, the component developments which contribute to such projects do not appear to be treated as covered either.  [In other words, we are not operating our own existing legislation and that is very unfortunate. ] The net effect is that, for environmentally significant urban development projects in existing core historic areas in Ireland, the Directive appears to have been left without a meaning in practice.  The Letter of Formal Notice takes issue with this.</P>
    <P>As regards hotel complexes, the Commission notes the evidence you submitted in relation to the hotel development proposed on a site bounded by Fleet Street, Westmoreland Street and College Street in Dublin, and in particular the failure to carry out an EIA notwithstanding the landmark setting and the demolition, gutting or mere shell-retention of four List 1 buildings (i.e. buildings enjoying the highest level of cultural heritage recognition by the responsible local authority), three List 2 buildings and three buildings in a conservation area.</P>
    <P>In particular, the Commission sought clarification on the way in which the Planning Appeals Board determines whether a sub-threshold EIA is required in relation to possible effects on the architectural heritage.  It also sought confirmation that both Dublin Corporation and the Planning Appeals Board considered the likely significance of the development in terms of architectural heritage for purposes of determining whether a sub-threshold EIA was necessary, together with a contemporaneous record of their consideration.</P>
    <P>The clarification and record have not been provided and, on the evidence available to date, the Commission has taken the view that the provision for EIA in the Irish legislation for hotel complexes in existing urban areas is not accompanied by the necessary interpretation and administrative practice to make it systematically effective, and that Ireland has not therefore taken the measures necessary to comply with the results required by the Directive for this project category, i.e. the submission of environmentally significant hotel complexes to EIA. <Col N="1109" /> That is a strong rebuke.  I do not wish to be negative or awkward about the Bill.  However, even as we celebrate this Bill there are things wrong in this area.</P>
    <P>There are delicious but sometimes painful ironies in this subject.  I have fought for over 20 years for North Great George's Street.  I fought a publicly acknowledged proposal of the city authorities to demolish almost the entire street.  We saved it.  We did not get much help then, but we have had help since from successive Governments, particularly this one.  We have also had help from Dublin Corporation, which is often attacked unfairly.  Although it has done some regrettable things in the past, it has shown goodwill and energy in this area under the previous and present city managers.</P>
    <P>I am now redoing the top two floors of my house and have run into planning problems.  It is a wonderful irony that having seen devastation all around I now receive a lash from the law which I always encouraged the authorities to introduce. That is the way democracy works.  We are negotiating the matter.</P>

      <P>That would be a delicious thrill which I could only anticipate eagerly.</P>
      <P>It is necessary to understand the whole environment. Like all great Dublin streets, North Great George's Street had a stable lane and mews houses at the back.  These houses were converted aggressively into factory complexes or discotheques, neither of which was appropriate.  The zoning followed this trend and someone on my side of the street who wished to rejuvenate one of these buildings for dwelling purposes was refused permission recently because it was zoned for office and industrial purposes.  That must change. We must continue the policy, also supported by this Government, of making a living city and bringing people back.</P>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which marks a significant step forward.  I compliment the Government for living up to the promises made at election time at a press conference in North Great George's Street.  It is now delivering the goods, perhaps not all the goods but an important instalment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we are indebted to the pilot who landed Senator Norris safely and in time to give us that interesting dissertation which wandered around North Great George's Street. To use sporting parlance, he started strongly, wobbled a little in the middle &mdash; my eyes glazed over when he started referring to EU Directives and the Lancefort judgment &mdash; but he finished strongly again.  He has shaken my confidence in the elements of the Bill which I thought would strengthen rather than weaken the subject under debate.  Dublin Corporation is perhaps the most cash rich local authority and can afford to take <Col N="1110" /> over listed buildings, unlike my humble county which has many buildings of architectural and historic merit but not a brass farthing to do this work.  I therefore wonder whether it is much use putting this legislation in place if it will not be enforced.</P>
      <P>The thread running through my thought process in approaching this Bill was the Beara peninsula in west Cork, from where my wife comes.  I have spent many happy hours pottering around the ruins of Dunboy Castle, near Castletownbere. Before reaching the castle one meets an historic building which, sadly, was burnt out by the IRA in the early twenties.  It belonged to the Puxley family, who were made internationally famous by Daphne Du Maurier in her book <i>Hungry Hill,</i> which was set in Beara and Castletownbere.  The building has been allowed to fall into disrepair.  I have no idea who owns it, and my wife informs me that the locals are not sure either.  Surely this is a building of national importance which is part of our heritage but was punished, as Senator Norris rightly said, for the crimes of those who lived in it.  It is neglected and derelict, a sad comment not only on those responsible for it but on this country.</P>
      <P>I single out that example because I know it but there are many more.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday I read about Moore Hall, home of John Moore.  The journalist said he had been crowned King of Connacht by General Humbert but, for her benefit and in the interest of historical accuracy, Humbert's decision was democratic &mdash; Moore was elected President of Connacht.  I was disappointed that the journalist did not discover that in her research because it is an important distinction; the French Revolution was about egalitarianism, not royalism.  That reference ruined the article for me.</P>
      <P>With the consent and help of Coillte, Mayo County Council will take over this building and is launching a fund raising campaign to restore it to its former glory.  This is as it should be and I was particularly pleased because the Moores of Moore Hall resonate throughout the history of Connacht, although judging by the article one would get the impression that the rest of us in the province are philistines and never heard of John Moore or what he and his successors did.  He and his family were fine Nationalists and it is ironic that, according to the article, it was Éamon de Valera who ordered the burning of the building at the height of the Civil War in 1923, to prevent the Free State forces from hoarding arms in the house.  That seems a flimsy basis for burning an historic building, particularly one which housed such a distinguished family as the Moores, but I am going by the account in the newspaper. However, given the historical inaccuracy in other parts of the piece, I am not sure I should quote from it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, which is long overdue.  The Minister was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday as saying our record of preservation in this area left much to be desired, and he is right.  Why has <Col N="1111" /> it taken so long for this legislation to come before the Houses?  Senator Norris said he was embarrassed ten years ago because we did not have conservation officers.  Like him I have a deep and abiding interest in history and our historical inheritance and nothing shames me as much as the burning of these wonderful houses across the country, often for no other reason than a grudge held by mavericks who set themselves up as the pseudo-IRA or protectors of the republican heritage. Having said that, hindsight has 20-20 vision and I, no more than anyone in this time, cannot know what they felt at that time.  It was at the end of a period of colonialism and I too might have gone out with a burning torch because of something done to my family or community by those whom Senator Norris kindly referred to as blackguards &mdash; I could think of stronger words.</P>
    <P>Now that this legislation is on its way to being passed, I hope its provisions will be enforced and that we will not be just paying lip service, as seems to have been the case to date judging by Senator Norris' experience.  I bow to his expertise in this area and admire his determination over many years to preserve historic buildings.  If he has had that experience in Dublin, I shudder to think that local authorities across the country may similarly shirk their responsibilities in this regard.  For instance, who is responsible for the former Puxley house in Beara?  As a result of this Bill, will those responsible or the local authority &mdash; in this case, Cork County Council &mdash; be compelled to do something about the building?</P>
    <P>The same is true of many other buildings.  In my home county, Leitrim, Carrick-on-Shannon Courthouse has been the subject of controversy for a number of years.  In 1994 the Office of Public Works declared the building unsafe and, as a result, Leitrim County Council and its staff, including the judicial administration, had to move out.  It was discovered the building was in danger of collapse; it had been poorly built in 1820.  It was the centre of the administration of British justice from that time on.  It was taken over by the new State in the 1920s and continued to function as a courthouse and administration centre of Leitrim County Council.  It has an affection in the hearts of people in the county, particularly those living in Carrick-on-Shannon.</P>
    <P>A former member of the planning authority, who was attached to the council, was quoted as saying at a council meeting at the height of the controversy that the building had no architectural or historic merit whatsoever, that it was little more than a bunch of stones that were badly built and that it should be taken down.  That is what started the local controversy.  The people of the area, and I support their view, felt they should not lose this historic building.  There are very few public buildings in County Leitrim; we should be building them instead of trying to knock them down.</P>
    <P>A certain sum of money has been allocated to this project and the roof has been replaced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> However, the building is still not habitable. Another sum of £150,000 was allocated by the International Fund for Ireland in the early 1990s for the curtilage, which is very modern in contrast to the building itself.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of this Bill, will the local authority be funded and resourced to ensure the preservation of this building so that it can become a living entity and used in a context other than its historic one?  I would not like to see this building collapse; I would like to see something done with it.  I am hopeful that sections in this legislation will help in this regard, for example, the reference to the allocation of £5 million.  I welcome that sum but I am not sure it will go very far &mdash; I would be interested to know how this money will be expended.  Perhaps we can return to this matter on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill also states that local authorities are being provided with £300,000 per annum to assist them.  Is that £300,000 per local authority?  I hardly think so.  It is.  It will cost £300,000 to fix the roof in Carrick-on-Shannon and it is being suggested that this sum will be of use to local authorities around the country.  I will be interested to hear how the Minister intends spending this money.</P>
    <P>The Bill is overall, as the Minister said, a landmark piece of legislation which is to be welcomed. However, I must add the caveat that, to echo Senator Norris, I hope it is not a matter of passing legislation simply for the sake of it.</P>

      <P>I have not prepared anything to say on the Bill but I am quite interested in this whole area.  I welcome the Bill which is a badly needed and long awaited first step towards the protection of buildings of architectural, if not historical, interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland was dotted with some wonderful houses of architectural interest.  Some of the finest architects of the 17th and 18th centuries designed and built houses all over this country, many of which were great estate houses.  Most of these have been lost.  Sadly, a Government agency played a greater part in the destruction of these buildings than any other individual body; this agency was the Irish Land Commission, and possibly the Congested Districts Boards which it replaced.  Many of the great estates in this country were eventually redistributed by the Irish Land Commission.  For example, Frenchpark House in my village was a beautiful 17th century Jacobean building, which was very rare in Ireland.  It was built in 1667 with some later additions.  It was destroyed in 1952.  It shell stood until the early 1960s when it was dynamited to become the base for the building of a factory.  Believe it or not, when it was dynamited people were there to celebrate its total destruction and wiping off the face of the earth because, to them, it represented something which was hostile and alien and part of the land war.  That was a great pity but we have grown up a lot in recent years.  However, the tragedy is the amount of our architectural heritage <Col N="1113" /> which has been destroyed and lost.  It is unforgivable.</P>
    <P>Whole streets have been lost in this city.  Dublin used to be called the second city of the British Empire, which meant that, architecturally, it was only equalled by London out of all the cities over which Britain had an influence.  One area in which the British exercised a good influence was that of architecture and the development of streetscapes in towns and cities.  However, many of the lovely streetscapes of this city have been lost.</P>
    <P>Until a few years ago, there were some surviving Georgian streetscapes which were falling down.  Senator Norris spoke about North Great George's Street, which is a fine example, but there are other examples in that area of Dublin which have been lost in relatively recent years. However, the urban renewal schemes, which were introduced in the 1980s, have reached out to protect many of these streets from total dereliction and to prevent the loss of buildings of great architectural interest in this city.  An enormous number of facades have been saved as a result.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill provides for internal alterations as all the emphasis in the past was on trying to save the facades of buildings.  Under the Bill, if an owner or occupier wishes to make internal alterations he must have planning permission, and there will be a strict code in regard to the protection of the original character of the building.  The interiors of many fine houses in this city and in towns have been destroyed by the division of rooms into bedsits and so on.  Beautiful ceilings have been destroyed and partitions have been placed in the most inappropriate places. Damage has been done to original interiors which can never be repaired.  However, I am delighted that, under the provisions of this Bill, that can no longer happen as any internal alterations must be the subject of strict planning permission.</P>
    <P>There are still quite a number of very interesting 18th and 19th century large farm-houses throughout the country, varying from moderate to quite significant architectural interest.  The problem experienced by people who own these houses is the cost of carrying out repair work, particularly now that the planning laws will require them to carry out any alterations strictly in accordance with the new regulations which are to be laid down and in keeping with the original character of the house, as far as that is possible. That is very costly.</P>
    <P>It is unfair to put that requirement on such occupiers or owners without offering them financial assistance, particularly as we are asking such people to preserve the architectural heritage of the country.  These buildings become more precious with every year that passes.  There is a vague reference in the Bill to the provision of funding, but the amount of money appears to be quite small &mdash; no doubt, we will find out all about it on Committee Stage.  We need an absolute commitment that the State will provide financial assistance for people who happen to own a property <Col N="1114" /> of unique or interesting architectural character and who wish to preserve and improve it or to carry out essential reconstruction work to it.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government or the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands should have architectural advisers who would provide free advice to the owners of such properties who wish to carry out improvements or repairs to them. They should also be offered a financial incentive.</P>
    <P>Many owners of such houses will say they want to move out of them because of the difficulties of maintaining and heating them.  It is often more attractive for them to move out of these houses and build a modern bungalow, allowing the heritage property to fall into rack and ruin.  That has happened in hundreds, perhaps thousands, of instances around the country.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the fact that the planning stage is the first of a three part approach to this problem. Two additional Bills are promised.  I urge the completion of the process on an accelerated basis. We have waited a long time for this legislation and I hope it will not be years before the next two Bills are introduced.</P>
    <P>Much of the archaeological and historical heritage of the country is badly protected and is in a terrible state of neglect.  Castles, keeps and other historic buildings, which in other places would be of huge archaeological interest, are not even listed buildings or structures.  They enjoy no protection. I visited a fine medieval castle in County Kerry that appeared to date from the sixteenth century and was amazed to find it used as a farm building, albeit it was enjoying some preservation by being used thus.</P>
    <P>I live beside the ruins of a thirteenth century monastic abbey.  The central tower, which is approximately 60 feet tall, lists off the perpendicular by approximately four degrees.  I raised the matter several times in the Dáil when I was a Member.  The former national monuments section of the Office of Public Works used to tell me it had no responsibility for the structure.  One day it will be blown down by the wind because it has no support.  It is a pity that State agencies, which should have responsibility, will say they have none.  The building has decorated stones containing interesting motifs and when it falls everybody will be horrified and ask why it was allowed to happen.  These things happen because we let them.</P>
    <P>The matter to which I refer is not covered by this legislation but it is related to the problem we have in this country.  The national monuments branch has been in existence for approximately 108 years.  During that period it has taken into full care and protection and done restoration work on approximately 800 or 900 monuments throughout the country, despite the fact that more than 60,000 monuments require protection.  While the branch does excellent work the net total is unimpressive. It has barely scratched the surface in dealing with our archaeological and historic heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> When I rose to speak I did not know what approach I would take to the Bill.  Senator Norris has returned from Warsaw.  I travel there tomorrow. I last visited it in 1975 and was most impressed by the restoration of the old town, including the restoration of the old church of St. Mary and St. John and the other buildings, which were not just demolished by the Nazis but were dynamited to effect their total destruction.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation.  I hope the Minster will return to the House next year to introduce two further Bills to complete this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is good to hear universal compliments paid to the Bill.  Our enthusiasm is a sign of the times.  We now have such confidence in ourselves and the country that every bit of it is precious.  There was a time when Georgian architecture was considered to be almost foreign to us because it was put up by foreign hands.  It is a tribute to the Department that such effort has been put into the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on introducing it.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd spoke of the difficulties he encountered when Drogheda Grammar School was knocked down.  I remember the occasion.  If it were to be knocked down now, not only Senator O'Dowd and his friend would be raging: the whole town would protest in anger.</P>
      <P>Like Senator Connor I regret the many important buildings which are no more.  They may not have been astonishing except for their peculiar characteristics.  For example, the building which contained Sutton's, the seed merchants in Cork on the South Mall, had a funny little turret on the end.  However, because it was a valuable site the entire red bricked building was demolished to be replaced by a terrible concrete monstrosity. Buildings like this were destroyed on a national scale; that was a great pity.</P>
      <P>Perhaps we could restore some of these buildings. Like Senator Norris and Senator Connor I have travelled and have visited Warsaw and seen the buildings to which they referred being not restored but rebuilt.  The rebuilding was very sad because in many cases very rough plaster material had to be used.  It is incredible to think that when the city was on its knees and in ruins the first act by those involved in the restoration was the procurement of the Caneletto paintings of Warsaw from Italy to restore what were used in the restoration of the streetscapes of the city.  Similarly, despite the scale of death in St. Petersburg &mdash; I visited the graveyard there &mdash; the first thing the citizens did was to rebuild the Summer Palace, which was not even the palace located in the city centre.  To have a strong sense of one's heritage is very important.  While we are perhaps coming late in the day to this, we are at last doing so.</P>
      <P>The restoration of small buildings has made a huge difference to some small towns.  One thinks of the King House in Boyle, another Cistercian Abbey; perhaps the Cistercians were everywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> They were also in Glanworth where the mill has been beautifully restored while it now contains an elegant restaurant.  If the signs were in French one would think one was in the Dordogne.</P>
    <P>We can do tremendous acts of restoration. They do not have to be of big or important houses.  A lady I know went to live in a modest house opposite the Olympia Theatre.  The most important aspect of the house was a plaster work sign at the front, which reads &ldquo;The Sick and Indigent Room Keeper's Society&rdquo;.  She has found it a source of entertainment to tourists, who I gather bring her gifts of sandwiches.  They presumably believe there is a colony of people within who require support.</P>
    <P>When the British-Irish Parliamentary Body visited York our hosts told me they would not take us to see their Viking remains because they thought we had such splendid ones.  I did not confess to what happened to Wood Quay but said I would like to see all Viking remains and would be grateful if they would take me to see theirs.  It is a pity we did not manage to preserve sufficient to have the kind of display they have in York.  I believe we would find it much more difficult today to carry out the kind of desecration that occurred at Wood Quay.</P>
    <P>There are problems with a group of buildings I would describe as working churches.  They cannot get funds from the State, and properly so.  Is it possible for the Minister to find a way of providing for them?  They face grave difficulties.  For example, the Augustinians are leaving their church on Arran Quay, the first church built after Catholic emancipation.  In addition, great efforts are being made to try to restore St. Catherine's, outside which Robert Emmet was executed. There are also great difficulties in preserving St. Mary's Cathedral in Limerick.  Can something be done to support this very important structure?  I know the State does not support religious property but perhaps there is some way to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with all those people who made such a fuss about church interiors.  I know central altars are important but very fine marblework in many of our cathedrals was about to go for the chop but for the intervention of some parishioners and clergy.</P>
    <P>It is important that interiors are covered by this legislation.  Recently ambassadors visited this House and I sat in this room with some of them. The Italian Ambassador asked me who decorated the ceiling.  To my shame I did not know the name of the craftsman but said I thought he was Italian. The ambassador said no, that a lot of the work in this country was done by Irishmen.  We must treasure the interiors as well because many Irish people were trained in the craft and did the work. It was not done by a couple of Italian plasterers who came here.  It is very important we maintain the work of our ancestors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> The emphasis on streetscapes is very important but unfortunately, the State has been one of the worst offenders in this area.  For example, look at what happened to the longest Georgian streetscape in Ireland and England, the ESB building on Lower Fitzwilliam Street.</P>
    <P>With regard my pet subject, can anyone try to retrieve our equestrian statues and erect them somewhere?  Whatever about the horse riders, can we not get back the horse statues because some of them only had a leg or two blown off? Will someone look for these statues?  I remember splendid horse statues in St. Stephen's Green and another in the Phoenix Park.  Can I make a final plea to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to look for these horses?  I am not so worried about their riders but our streetscapes could be very much improved if we got them back.  I always enjoyed taking visitors from the North out the back of the building and showing them a statue of Prince Albert.  We let the statue of Queen Victoria go to Australia.  If it becomes a republic, perhaps we will demand that the statue be returned.</P>

      <P>I thank all who took part in the debate.  I also thank them for their welcome of the Bill.</P>
      <P>There is general agreement that this Bill represents a major step forward in ensuring that Ireland's built heritage will be passed on to future generations.  The system which this Government is establishing to strengthen the protection afforded to the built heritage is very much based on a partnership approach between the Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and Dúchas, the heritage service of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government will be charged with implementing this Bill and overseeing the new grants scheme to be administered by local authorities. Local authorities will have the primary role in identifying buildings for the protection and for preserving the best of the built heritage through the planning system.  Dúchas will be charged with compiling the National Inventory of Architectural Heritage and with providing conservation advice and guidelines to planning authorities as the need arises.  We are creating a systematic approach to protecting architectural heritage.  It uses the resources and local knowledge of the local authority and backs it up with central advice and expertise.  This approach should overcome the inconsistencies in approach to built heritage which existed in the past.</P>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and look forward to the details being discussed on Committee Stage.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 refer to the definition section of the Bill which reads, &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, in relation to a person, means a substantial restriction in the capacity of a person to participate in economic, social or cultural life.&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 2 seeks to delete &ldquo;economic, social or cultural life&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;any aspect of society&rdquo;.  In other words, it seeks to broaden the definition. Why is it necessary in the legislation to limit the definition to economic, social and cultural matters in the terms of reference of the National Disability Authority?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to delete the word &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo;. The reason for this amendment is that the word &ldquo;impairment&rdquo; has a negative connotation and the word &ldquo;condition&rdquo; does not substantially affect this paragraph.  However, it is important to the people it describes.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (2), between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following new paragraphs:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to monitor the recommendations of the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities;</P>
      <P>(b) to provide grievance and redress procedures for individuals or groups in accordance with section 14;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments go to the heart of the legislation and our attempts to improve it in order to give it some teeth.  This section refers to the functions of the authority, which are extremely disappointing in that an authority is to be constructed with little or no teeth.  The authority will assist the Minister; undertake and collaborate in research projects; advise the Minister; monitor the implementation of standards and codes of practice; liaise with other bodies; prepare codes of practice; recognise the achievement of good standards and quality and prepare strategic plans.  These functions are, indeed, worthy, but at what point can the authority deal with grievances of disabled people and represent them?</P>
      <P>I read the &ldquo;Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities&rdquo;, which was a landmark publication in regard to the rights of people with disabilities.  In the context of amendment No. 8 I remind the Minister of the commission's recommendations on the establishment of a National Disability Authority.  I wish to point out the difference between the recommendations and the legislation.  It states that the National Disability Authority should be established, reporting to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Its key functions would be to monitor compliance with the recommendations of the commission and other relevant EU and international agreements that have been accepted; undertake commissioned research; advise on and develop standards &mdash; an important activity; require the creation of appropriate standards; monitor and evaluate programmes, which have been included in the Bill.  It would also provide grievance and redress procedures.  That is the subject of this amendment and it is the greatest disappointment among people involved in this area.</P>
      <P>The authority would publish an annual report, provide a disability support service and organise community action plans at local level.  The report stated that membership of the NDA should be balanced and representative, the authority should co-ordinate development of local community action plans and planning groups should include users and carers, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of these amendments specifically refer to the recommendations of the commission because for the first time it represents, in a valuable and valid fashion, the views of disabled <Col N="1122" /> people and those who work closely with them. This report defines the rights of disabled people and their relationship with us in the wider society, which is not one of charity but of rights.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 would provide the first paragraph in the legislation defining the functions of the authority, one of which would be to monitor the recommendations of the report of the commission thereby strengthening the role of the authority considerably and reflecting the report. Ultimately, this and other amendments are designed to give the authority some teeth, which it does not have under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister disputed my claim to elegance.  I see myself as a parliamentary dentist because we are trying to put some teeth in the legislation.  Senator O'Meara's comments about monitoring are extremely important in light of the guidelines of the report, which she quoted. One Government amendment has been tabled which addresses the question of compiling statistical information and this would be appropriate for the planning, delivery and monitoring of programmes and services for people with disabilities. This is a good amendment and I am glad the Government tabled it.  I hope this resulted from the informed debate in this House but it is still only deals with monitoring the delivery of services. There are no sanctions.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, we dealt in considerable detail with the question of those groups who are found to be in flagrant violation, through perversity, inaction or whatever, and are falling down on the job or not acting in the interests of those they are supposed to be serving.  Under the legislation all the authority is entitled to do is inform them.  That leaves an enormous gap and illustrates that it is without teeth.  There ought to be a penalty or sanction.  I say this from the Independent benches in a non-partisan way.  I recall that when this notion was discussed there was significant agreement in principle on the Government side of the House.  I am surprised that there has been no attempt by the Government to deal with this, which of course we would have welcomed.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister does not particularly like what I have suggested by way of sanction, but it is up to him and his advisers to come up with one. A Bill without any sanction in this area is useless. My amendment states that &ldquo;unless such programmes or services adhere to standards and codes of practice, as implemented by the National Disability Authority, moneys provided in whole or in part by the Oireachtas shall be withdrawn&rdquo;. That seems reasonable.  If they are not doing their duty or are acting in violation of standards and codes of practice laid down by the Oireachtas and the authority, how can they justify spending money provided for them by the Oireachtas?  If we do not include a provision such as this, they can spend the money whatever way they wish and there is no sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is not an amateur effort dreamed up by myself and my colleagues.  It is a carefully <Col N="1123" /> considered amendment which was drafted in close consultation with professional groups and individuals working in this area.  In other words, this is what the professionals recommend.  Given that there is such a gross absence in this section of the Bill, it is up to the Minister to provide something with which to fill the gap.  These are the most important amendments and I hope it will not be necessary to put them to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  This is a matter of credibility and responsibility and I appeal to the Minister to give our contributions serious consideration.</P>
      <P>When I first read that section of the Bill I thought a line of the section was missing.  I am not saying that for fun but as a matter of fact.  The Minister's reaction would be no different.  Indeed, any Member of the House, glancing through the legislation just to get a flavour of its intent, would think there was something missing from the section.  There is a need to continue its logic.</P>
      <P>This is the type of provision which makes the Legislature an object of ridicule for the press.  I can anticipate the headline in <i>The Star</i> newspaper when a case arises in the next year or two where somebody encounters a problem, checks the legislation for a means of redress, discovers that it consists of informing the offending authority and that authority, on being informed, says &ldquo;get stuffed&rdquo;.  That does not reflect well on anybody. The Minister and I come from similar backgrounds and I doubt that either of us would like to have to accept that response.  The Minister would not be too pleased to have to accept somebody thumbing their nose at him when he informs them that they are failing to comply with their obligations.</P>
      <P>A form of redress should be included and the amendment was drafted with that objective in mind.  The Minister might believe a different form of redress would be more appropriate but I cannot imagine that he could agree that this gap should be left in the legislation.  It is a yawning gap.  There is a responsibility on Members, as public representatives and legislators, to plug such a gap.  It cannot be right that people who are found to be offending in some way and who are so informed, are allowed to continue in their actions.  Something must be done.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.  I am sure he, no more than other Members, does not wish to be ridiculed about this.</P>

      <P>I wish to speak to amendment No. 20, put down by Senator Ridge, which refers to section 14.  That section deals with information from certain bodies to the authority.  The section is inadequate without the addition of amendment No. 20.  It reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) The Authority may seek information on any matter which concerns the provision of programmes or services for persons with disabilities from a person (including a public <Col N="1124" /> body) who has overall responsibility for provision of those programmes or services or a part thereof.</P>
    <P>(2) Where&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) a programme or service is required by law to be provided to persons with disabilities, or</P>
    <P>(b) any other programme or service for persons with disabilities is directly or indirectly funded in whole or in part out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas&mdash;</P>
    <P>and, in the opinion of the Authority, such programme or service&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) is being provided in an inadequate or unsatisfactory manner in any regard, or</P>
    <P>(ii) is not being provided to persons with disabilities,</P>
    <P>then, the Authority shall inform the person or body providing or failing to provide the programme or service concerned.</P>
    <P>We merely wish to add &ldquo;and stipulate that any such person or body shall immediately take steps to meet the requirements of the Authority&rdquo;.  That phrase is necessary to complete the section and I cannot anticipate what arguments the Minister might make to gainsay it.  The points made by my colleagues are common sense and seek to give teeth to the authority.  The Bill establishes an authority but that body must have what is included in its title &mdash; authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the debate on Second Stage and belated representations in this regard, I have decided to broaden the powers of the authority to include a role in the preparation of statistical information for the planning, delivery and monitoring of programmes and services.</P>
      <P>Before formally putting amendment No. 10 before the House, I draw the attention of Senators to the last phrase which refers to &ldquo;people with disabilities&rdquo;.  The formula used elsewhere in the Bill is &ldquo;persons with disabilities&rdquo; and I seek leave of the House to move orally this amendment to the amendment.</P>
      <P>With regard to amendment No. 23a, a number of amendments were tabled by Senators to provide for additional redress procedures where the authority finds that a person or body providing a programme or service to people with disabilities has not adhered to appropriate standards or codes of practice.  The amendment will empower the authority in such circumstances to make a recommendation to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the review, reduction or withdrawal of any moneys provided by the Oireachtas in respect of the service concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to include this provision in section 15, which deals with reports and information to the Minister.  This is a more appropriate location for it as section 14 is concerned with the interaction <Col N="1125" /> between the authority and service providers. The arrangements I am making in this provision are more appropriate to the authority than the punitive action envisaged in Opposition amendments, involving an order of the Circuit Court, and will be more effective in regulating compliance.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge &mdash; I experienced the frustration of not having this acknowledged many times when I was in Opposition &mdash; that I have borrowed directly from Senator Norris' amendment in devising the amendment I have put before the House.  Senator Norris has described himself in this context as a dentist so while I am not accepting his crown, I am certainly accepting his filling.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8, 13 and 13a seek to broaden the remit of the authority in different ways.  Amendment No. 8 provides for the inclusion of monitoring the recommendations of the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities among the functions of the authority.  The Government is committed to implementing progress in regard to disability.  It is committed to the adoption of the plan of action for implementing the commission's recommendations. This plan is expected to be finalised by the end of February and will be submitted to Government. These matters will evolve, therefore, in the short to medium term.</P>
    <P>I envisage no long-term role for the National Disability Authority in this connection.  I could not make specific provision for such a time delimited activity in the Bill.  It is not appropriate to detail the basis for current Government policy in primary legislation intended to establish a new authority with a broad ranging remit.  I cannot, therefore, accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 provides for the inclusion of community action plans among the functions of the authority.  The report of the establishment group makes clear that the role of the National Disabilities Authority will be best served if the functions assigned to it are clearly those of a dedicated authority with responsibility for policy and the development and monitoring of standards of service provision.</P>
    <P>In making its recommendations, the establishment group diverged on a number of points, including the National Disability Authority's role in relation to the development of community action plans, from the original recommendations made by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The establishment group's thinking, which I fully accept, is explained at some length in its report.  The development of community action plans has, for these reasons, not been provided for in section 8(2) of the Bill. They will involve the wide range of agencies, many of which will be providing services for people with disabilities.  As such they will be subject to monitoring by the National Disabilities Authority.  Any such interplay would inevitably jeopardise the monitoring and evaluation role of <Col N="1126" /> the authority and I cannot, therefore, accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13a proposes a further elaboration of functions of the authority as enumerated in section 8(2).  I am satisfied that the additional provision proposed for insertion at paragraph (i) is not necessary.  This is because the substance of the provision is already catered for under paragraph (a) in relation to the promotion of policy relating to disability, and under paragraph (e) in relation to liaison with bodies involved in the provision of services to people with disabilities.  I do not, therefore, consider that the amendment proposed would in any way add to the functions of the authority as provided for, and I do not proposed to accept it.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8(b) and 18 to 22, inclusive, seek to broaden the functions of the authority to include grievance procedures.  It is my view that the assignment of such activities to the National Disability Authority would run counter to its core functions.  The role envisaged for the authority by the establishment group is essentially proactive. It has a strong co-ordinating and developmental role, a research function, a standards body, a codes of practice role and support and liaison remit.  These functions can best be discharged through close co-operation, support and leadership. I am convinced that an enforcement role fits badly with the central remit of the authority as well as overlapping with redress functions available elsewhere.  For these and related reasons, I cannot accept the amendments which would involve the authority in redress and grievance actions.</P>

I was reading from the yellow section and I completely accept that the Minister has met the substance of amendment No. 21 which I tabled.  I welcome this.  The Minister has done exactly what we wanted and the Bill is immensely strengthened.

I welcome the Minister's announcement of the Government amendment and I am happy to yield my crown to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not my interpretation of the Government amendment.  The Minister's amendment is much weaker than the Senator's. The Minister's amendment does not refer to standards and codes of practice.  Indeed, reading Government amendment 23a, it is so vague it could mean anything:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (3), the Authority may, in making a report to which section 8(2)(d) relates, make recommendations for the review, reduction or withdrawal of any moneys provided by the Oireachtas for any programme or service where it is of the opinion that it would be <Col N="1127" /> appropriate in the circumstances to make such a recommendation.</P>
    <P>That is weak.  The authority may make a recommendation to the Minister, that is all.  In making a recommendation there is no reference to standards or codes of practice.  My interpretation of Senator Norris' amendment was the he was trying to create a situation where the authority could recommend the withdrawal of money where a service is not up to scratch.  The Minister's amendment does not go that far.  On my first reading of it, my interpretation was that it went some way to meet our concerns about section 15, but on second reading it is clear that it does not.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's remarks about amendments Nos. 8, 10, 13 and 18 to 22 inclusive, the majority of which I tabled, it is clear that we are attempting to include a number of issues, particularly those set out in the Report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, in order that this Bill would have substance and meaning.  While I take the Minister's point that the legislation is not designed to create a proactive authority, he should accept that it should have some authority.  Judging from his remarks about his own amendment, the Minister appears to recognise that might be necessary, otherwise what do we have?  An authority which advises, monitors, recommends, liaises, prepares and recognises strategic plans.  That is fine but what happens then?  Where will people with disabilities be in relation to this authority if the service is not up to scratch and the public money is not being properly spent?  All that can happen is the authority may make a recommendation.  Even if the amendment read that the authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; make a recommendation, it would be considerably stronger.</P>
    <P>On amendment No. 18, which specifically seeks to insert the words &ldquo;following receipt of a complaint or on its own initiative&rdquo;, here, once again, we try to give the authority some strength.  It would give the authority the opportunity to pursue individual complaints about the inadequacy of service.  This point is raised repeatedly in the report of the commission.  I will not go through the report fully, it is sufficient to read the first paragraph of the commission's overview.  Legislation has been brought in since the report was published but it is worth reiterating the views expressed therein:</P>
    <P>People with disabilities are the neglected citizens of Ireland.  On the eve of the 21st century, many of them suffer intolerable conditions because of outdated social and economic policies and unthinking public attitudes.  Changes have begun to come about, influenced by international recognition that disability is a social rather than a medical issue, but many of those changes have been piecemeal.  Public attitudes towards disability are still based on charity rather than on rights, and the odds are stacked against people with disabilities at almost every <Col N="1128" /> turn.  Whether their status is looked at in terms of economics, information, education, mobility, or housing they are seen to be treated as second-class citizens.</P>
    <P>It seems that in establishing this Authority in the manner in which it is drafted in this legislation, we are losing a valuable opportunity to create an authority which could reflect the desires of the disabled community and those who work with them in this State, to raise their status from second to first class citizenship.  This is the desire behind our amendments.  In particular I refer to amendment No. 22.  This amendment seeks to insert the following:</P>
    <P>The Circuit Court may on the application of the Authority, and after hearing the respondent, make such order as is necessary to ensure compliance with an order of the Authority under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>In other words, the authority could go to the Circuit Court seeking an order, it would have power, it would have teeth.  The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that where the authority comes across inadequate service provision, it can require it to be remedied.  In the legislation as currently drafted the authority only may recommend to the Minister.  There is nowhere it can go to redress the anger and dissatisfaction of people who come up against inadequate service provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is more than adequate under the circumstances.  We all broadly agree with the thrust and direction of the Bill.  In this regard, amendment No. 23a comes a long way to meeting the fears and reservations of the Senators who spoke on Second Stage.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, I queried the position regarding sanctions.  The decision of the Government and the Minister to broadly take on board the amendment tabled by Senator Norris, almost verbatim, is a indication that the Minster is willing to listen and that he has listened and taken action.  This economic sanction is reasonable and is more than adequate.  Some of the sanctions being suggested would not be appropriate to the authority it is proposed to establish.  It is has many functions and is an innovative approach to people with disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that for many years those suffering with disabilities, physical or otherwise, were dealt a poor hand and given a raw deal.  However in the past 20 years, major strides have been made. On Second Stage I mentioned that I recalled reading the Labour Party manifesto for the 1992 election and their proposals for revolutionising the law regarding those with disabilities.  They <Col N="1129" /> were a full five years in Government and little, if anything, happened.  Now we have a Government and a Minster prepared to take action and the Minister deserves credit for it.  It is very easy to pontificate from the Opposition benches. However five years lapsed during which relatively little was done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Norris, I had not seen the Government amendment when I spoke previously.  This morning when we were considering the wording of Senator Norris's amendment I thought it covered the functions we were trying to achieve.  The Minister listened to the argument and responded in a very fair way.  There are amendments from Senators O'Meara and Norris and the Minister.  On first reading it appears that the Government amendment does not go as far as that of Senator Norris but it goes substantially further than what was sought in the Labour Party amendment.  That is my reading of it.</P>
      <P>Also, on further reflection, I would say there is a strength in the Government amendment which I find very attractive for two reasons.  First, it allows action to take place merely on the basis of the authority forming an opinion.  This is achieved far more easily than that which Senator Norris and I were trying to achieve.  Second, I am happy with the latter part of the amendment which requires, allows, facilitates and provides for the Minister to take action.  I prefer it that way because it is the way the political system should work.  Also, if we have learned nothing else over the past two or three years in both Houses, we have learned that every decision is challenged. Anything which has any kind of a domestic remedy built into it, such as this one where we would be giving quasi-legal powers to an authority, will, without doubt, be challenged if the reason is big enough.  It will be challenged through judicial review, the legislation, the High Court and so many systems and structures that it would get itself into paralysis.</P>
      <P>I am attracted by the idea of the authority forming an opinion &mdash; which is all it is required to do under the amendment &mdash; and bringing that opinion to the attention of the Minister.  If the Minister does not take action on it there is a clear target for the rest of us to focus on.  The Minister of the day is given strength on the basis that he or she is taking action on something being brought to his or her attention by an independent authority.  There are many fail safe mechanisms built into this.  It is a more effective way of dealing with it.  The amendment which Senator Norris and I put forward was an modh díreach to get straight to the point.  However, an modh díreach can often hit a brick wall and in this case the brick wall could be a legal challenge.  This is a safer and sounder way of dealing with it in legal terms.  I am very happy with the provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a flaw it is that the Minister may decide not to take action.  However in the amendment that Senator Norris and I put forward, the authority might decide not to take action.  It is <Col N="1130" /> easier to deal with a Minister than an authority. A Minister is accountable to the elected public representatives and can be asked to appear before the Houses to give a reason.  However an authority is two steps removed and we would be effectively paralysed from taking action.</P>
    <P>The Minister has listened carefully and I appreciate his response.  Senator Norris and I feel this has done what we set out to do, which in the words of those who contacted us was to give &ldquo;sufficient legislative power to impose sanctions&rdquo;. I recognise that power in this amendment is not totally vested in the authority but it is initiated by the authority and brought to conclusion by the Minister.  That is the way it should be and I am happy with that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 20 tabled by Senator Ridge is similar to Senator Norris's amendment No. 21.  The Minister referred to it as going into the area of &ldquo;grievance collecting&rdquo; or something like that.  Perhaps he could repeat the phrase.  By the widest stretch of the imagination, I do not know how he could describe it as such. He said that if these amendments were accepted they would put the authority into the area of grievance collecting.  The phrase is not that important.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Meara.  Words are all important, especially when it comes to matters of law and we are dealing with a matter of law here. I would like to remind those Senators who are taking a softer line that we are also dealing with a matter of public funds.  What would the Comptroller and Auditor General say if he was asked for advice on this?  He would say the wording should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and not &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  &ldquo;May&rdquo; means nothing.  It means &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not&rdquo;. The easy way is usually &ldquo;may not&rdquo;.  When the wording is &ldquo;shall&rdquo; it is a command.  The word here should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in relation to the spending of public money which creates the service to those with disabilities.  That is all we are seeking. The amendment would be fine if it read &ldquo;the Authority shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;the Authority may&rdquo;.  It is as simple as that.</P>

    <P>I support this Bill.  It is very important that Ministers listen to what people say and try to accommodate them to arrive at the best result. The Minister has done so here, though Senator O'Toole's points about the primacy of the Oireachtas must also be taken on board.  The Minister is accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and that is where the checks and balances are.  We must look to the supremacy of the Oireachtas there.  The Minister has made a sincere and successful effort to accommodate the <Col N="1131" /> views expressed to him, and the Government amendment should be supported.</P>

The approach would have some merit where the remedy sought is straightforward and easy to achieve, but the process of informing the authority of its obligations as provided for in the Bill is just as likely to secure similar results.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara stated that she saw no reference in amendment No. 23a to standards and codes of practice.  It is true that it may not be in the vernacular in the body of the amendment, but there is cross reference to section 8(ii)(d).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates to standards and codes of practice.  I accept that Senator O'Meara accepts this.</P>
      <P>I strongly agree with Senator O'Toole in accepting the broad thrust of Senator Norris's amendment and in accepting that the authority itself may put forward an opinion.  This is stronger than what Senator Norris has in the body of his amendment, which stipulated that unless the programmes and services adhered to standards and codes of practice as implemented by the National Disability Authority, moneys provided in whole or in part by the Oireachtas would be withdrawn.</P>
      <P>There is very little doubt that this could result in a myriad of court cases, and I accept what Senator O'Toole says in this respect.  The issue would be whether, as a definitive fact, the programme or service did or did not adhere to the standards and codes of practice.  It will be accepted that this would be a matter of opinion, whereas giving the authority the power to express an opinion is stronger for the reason that an opinion can be right or wrong.  The fact that it does express an opinion to the Oireachtas regarding this matter strengthens the Bill considerably, because Senator Norris has hit on a core issue in his amendment: the Exchequer provision supports public service programmes, for people with disabilities or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is clearly a matter of considerable importance. If a statutory body such as the National Disability Authority states that, in its opinion, money should be withdrawn, I doubt, to use Senator O'Toole's words, if the Minister of the day would be slow to ignore that opinion.  The simple reason is that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform would then become the target, and God knows the Minister, as I know too well, has sufficient <Col N="1132" /> arrows flying in his direction to look for more.</P>

      <P>We are addressing the issue of the teeth the authority will have in ensuring compliance with the standards promulgated.  In general terms I am satisfied we have moved forward so that the authority has teeth to ensure that standards and services are maintained or improved.</P>
      <P>In that context, if it should transpire during further debate here or in the Dáil that I conclude there is still a serious difficulty in relation to enforcement I would have an open mind.  I do not want an authority to sit there in some kind of beauty contest.  That is of no relevance to those concerned and of no satisfaction to me.  I want an authority that can do something innovative and radical.  I fully accept Senators saying that this cannot be achieved by an authority which does not have the capacity to ensure enforcement, and that is why I accept the broad thrust of Senator Norris's amendment, which I consider very good.</P>
      <P>The legislation also provides, in section 15, that the authority may report to the Minister on any matter relating to its functions, and that circumstances, where a service provider either cannot or will not remedy limitations notified to it under section 14, seem obvious situations for the authority to exercise these powers.  The authority has two options under section 15.  It may report on the gamut of its activities in its annual report and, in this context, it would be expected that the authority would single out particular issues for special recommendation and consideration.  That annual report will, of course, be laid before the Oireachtas.  Section 15 also provides that the authority may make such other reports to the Minister as and when it sees fit.  I see the authority exercising this reporting function in circumstances where the information procedure under section 14 has failed to bear fruit, especially where information procedures relate to complex or cost increasing proposals.  Such action by the authority would place the issue into the only arena where it can be resolved either by reprioritising activities or by the provision of additional Exchequer funding.  The direct reporting relationship at ministerial level, which the National Disability Authority will enjoy by statute, is poorly understood or appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1133" /> The approach provided for by the Bill will facilitate the development of services for people with disabilities far more quickly and completely than the approach envisaged by the amendments which opt either for litigation or the mandatory withdrawal of Exchequer funding.  The question of Exchequer funding would be the subject matter of an opinion expressed by the authority itself. Means of redress already exist through the Office of the Ombudsman where a public body fails to provide a programme of service to a citizen.  I remind Senator Connor that &ldquo;procedures&rdquo; was the term I used, not &ldquo;grievance, fetching, collecting or blood-letting&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the past, the Office of the Ombudsman has shown itself to be an effective reference point for dealing with issues of concern to people with disabilities. This was highlighted in the report of the authority's establishment group.  It stated that the Office of the Ombudsman had responded positively, strongly supporting the importance of accessibility of complaints systems and stating that special consideration be given to meeting this need for people with disabilities.  The Office of the Ombudsman has, to date, investigated a number of cases directly involving the provision of services to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>It is important we are fair to the Office of the Ombudsman.  In his annual report last year, the Ombudsman dealt with issues of direct concern specifically to people with disabilities, namely, basic income entitlement and eligibility for the free travel scheme.  I have no doubt that in future reports, the Ombudsman will also address other issues of critical or central importance to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>A new infrastructure for equality would provide a redress of first instance in cases of discrimination through the new office of the director of equality investigations.  The new office will deal with discrimination by employers and providers of goods, facilities and services in the public and private sectors.  The remit of the new office would extend both to the employment equality legislation due to be published next year and equal status legislation in the year 2000.  Senators will be aware that discrimination on the grounds of disability is one of nine grounds of discrimination which will be specifically outlawed under the Employment Equality Act and the proposed equal status legislation.</P>
    <P>I trust that my comments on this matter alleviate Senators' concerns.  I welcome the fact that Senators Norris, O'Toole, O'Donovan and Keogh are satisfied we have moved in the right direction in regard to providing teeth to the authority. Although Senators Connor and O'Meara may not fully embrace the amendment, I believe they will accept it represents a significant improvement.  If it should transpire that a cogent argument can be made to the effect that this legislation is not sufficiently effective, I would be prepared to consider the matter further.  However, at this stage, I believe the amendment is adequate.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister has moved to embrace concerns expressed on this side of the House.  I have listened carefully to his comments. He stated that should he hear a sufficiently cogent argument he would be open to further amending the section.  It behoves us to advance such an argument.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to accept that the expression of an opinion is, in effect, a sanction of any kind. How could the expression of an opinion be a sanction?  The Minister stated that the expression of an opinion by the authority is a very strong move.  That may be true in theory.  The Health and Safety Authority which is charged with monitoring the implementation of a range of legislation in regard to safety on building sites, farms, workplaces and so on, regularly expresses its opinions in regard to the role of employers.  That has not resulted in any increase in the level of fines imposed on errant employers or those found guilty of breaching the law in regard to health and safety.  Is the expression of an opinion by the Health and Safety Authority any different to the expression of an opinion by the National Disability Authority or any other authority established by legislation?</P>
      <P>The Minister will forgive my skepticism.  It lies with us to provide a more cogent argument to the Minister in this regard.  I accept his amendment has met many of the concerns expressed here and is a significant improvement.  However, I do not believe it is significant enough.  If the Minister states that the expression of an opinion to a Minister is a sanction, I accept that.  However, I am not aware of any other case in which that applies. Legislation on other aspects of the workings and responsibilities of authorities and public bodies is framed in such a manner as to clearly describe their roles and functions and the sanctions which will apply.  The Minister might elaborate on the manner in which the expression of an opinion could be regarded as a sanction.  Having listened to him, it might be more appropriate to table a further amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I agree the Minister has come some way towards addressing our concerns.  I appeal to his instinct as a solicitor; he is aware that in matters of law, the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; means that one is not obliged to follow a certain course of action.  We are simply seeking to strengthen the wording by changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  This relates to the very important question of public funding of services to people with disability where clear evidence was available that a service provider was not providing a service where public funds were being used.  I believe the National Disability Authority &mdash; if, in its wisdom, it formed such an opinion &mdash; should be bound to inform the Minister of such.  The Minister should not come into the House portraying himself as some kind of latter day St. Sebastian shot through with slings, arrows and lances.  It is our duty to put these points to him; they are not the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune but of just desserts.</P>

      <P>In my view, the sanction is not imposed through the expression of an opinion, rather it is what occurs subsequent to an opinion being expressed.  The opinion will put the train in motion.  When the opinion is expressed and put to the Minister of the day, the spotlight will be on him or her to take action.  The action of threatening to withdraw funds from groups or organisations almost totally dependent on Exchequer funding is as strong a sanction as one could accept.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor made that point that &ldquo;may&rdquo; allows the possibility of &ldquo;may not&rdquo;, but by the same token &ldquo;shall&rdquo; allows the possibility of &ldquo;shall not&rdquo;.  We could embark on a semantic exercise and end up going around in circles.  The Senator must acknowledge that since the Second Stage the Minister has tabled about ten amendments. On this most important issue of sanction, he has proposed an amendment almost entirely incorporating what is in Senator Norris's amendment No. 21.  In this regard the Minister has gone a long way to meet the demands of Senators.  Senator Connor might be gracious enough to accept that.</P>

      <P>I am in favour of this amendment to deal with sanctions.  I have a certain experience in this area and the question of imposing sanctions and separating the sanctioning authority from the authority which determines or investigates is important.  It is a matter which I have been promoting on behalf of Members in the Committee on Members' Interests.  On many occasions recently I have seen the imposition of sanctions failing and being found to be legally unsound because the body which investigated a case is the same as that which imposed the sanction. In this matter it is important that there will be a clear distance between the body which comes to a conclusion that something incorrect has happened and the party which imposes the sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be opposed utterly to replacing &ldquo;may&rdquo; with &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I accept Senator Connor's arguments <Col N="1136" /> about the difference in the meaning of the words &mdash; he is right, they are completely different. However, we cannot set up an authority and then tell it how to do its business.  If we set up an authority we give it a legislative basis to do something and it must do that.  If it does not, we have made a mistake.  It takes from the value of and the respect for an authority if we decide that, it having come to a conclusion, we want to tell it what to do.  As legislators we give a body the authority to take the next step.  On this occasion the next step is for the authority to decide to refer an opinion to the Minister to the effect that it has come to a conclusion about a person or body on which it is reporting and it may then recommend a review, reduction or withdrawal of money.</P>
    <P>To provide that the authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; do one thing or another does not add any authority to the authority, so to speak.  It would amount to us telling the authority how to do its business.  I do not like that approach.  It is not a good model.  I believe in giving people the right to exercise power.  As I have often said in the House, because a person has a right to do something does not mean it is right to do it.  In this case, just because the authority may have the power to do something will not always mean it is correct to exercise that power.</P>
    <P>Although I cannot come up with any at the moment, there may be reasons which make Senator Connor's point attractive.  At least &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would mean that we know it will be done in a particular way.  However, I always worry about trying to anticipate everything that might happen because no two cases or investigations are the same.  I believe in giving space for people to take and implement decisions.  For that reason I am attracted by the idea that the sanctioning body is the Minister and the body which comes to a conclusion about how the rules were not kept is one which is distanced from the Minister. Therefore, the Minister would act on its advice and evidence.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the Minister's response to amendment No. 13a.  I do not disagree particularly with the points he made.  I seek to establish what is meant by some elements of section 8. Section 8 (2) (c) refers to programmes and services. Will the Minister assure me that reference includes such issues as employment and training? The terms &ldquo;programmes&rdquo; and &ldquo;services&rdquo; are vague and are not defined in section 2.</P>
    <P>My amendment No. 13a goes to the heart of how this Bill will work.  In his replies the Minister referred to this working in conjunction, in co-ordination or in parallel with or with some linkage to the new equality authority and he talked about how that would operate.  I never trust the parliamentary draftspersons, particularly those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Every time I take something for granted I find it to be wrong.  Section 8 (2) (e) contains a reference to &ldquo;liaise with other bodies&rdquo;.  I note that in section 2 there is reference to a public body.  My amendment attempts to ensure that <Col N="1137" /> public bodies would be included.  I am not hung up on the wording of my amendment.  I wish to ensure that there will be an effective link between the disability authority and the equality authority. I am heartened by what the Minister said in response to a previous question about the need for such a linkage.</P>
    <P>What I seek to achieve could be done with a minor change.  Amendment No. 13a seeks to give the authority the power to liaise with State employment, equality and training authorities to monitor and promote policies affecting people with disabilities.  As an alternative, in section 8(2)(e) which states &ldquo;to liaise with other bodies&rdquo; we could insert &ldquo;including public bodies&rdquo; and that would address my concerns.  That creates the link the Minister is talking about &mdash; it uses the term &ldquo;public bodies&rdquo; which is already defined in section 2 and meets all those needs.  By doing that it would create a strong authority.</P>

      <P>I think everyone would acknowledge we do not want to make the National Disability Authority a court or a star chamber, and in deference to Senator Connor's remarks about bows, arrows, shots, cannonballs, etc., we do not want a torture chamber either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in taking on board some of the amendments I think we would be in danger of doing precisely that.  If we accept Senator Norris's amendment or even its broad thrust we have reached the core issue, which is Exchequer funding.  It will be acknowledged by experienced politicians that there are few more effective mechanisms for achieving change or maintaining momentum than the threat or possibility of losing such funding; most people would agree with that observation for the simple reason that it is true.  In that respect, the authority is given the power, where appropriate, to express its opinion on whether Exchequer funding should be reviewed, reduced or withdrawn.  It must be obvious that this provision has been tailored, as regards Senator Norris's amendment, to ensure the provision is in accordance with the Constitution, because it would not be in order for anyone other than the Oireachtas to decide Exchequer funding should be withdrawn, reduced or reviewed, save the Government, which is part of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Senator O'Toole's observations and taking his last point first, section 8(2)(e), where it mentions &ldquo;bodies&rdquo;, does not read &ldquo;private bodies&rdquo;, in those circumstances he would accept it must of necessity include public bodies.  In addition, section 14 will be of assistance in this context.  I assure the Senator that section 8(2)(c) includes placement and training for employment.  It cannot deal with employment itself in that context because that could not be described as a service within the meaning of the <Col N="1138" /> paragraph.  I hope those assurances are of assistance.</P>
    <P>Without replaying the match I am of the strong view that the core issue is one of funding.  I believe the power given to the authority to express its opinion, where it feels it would be appropriate in the circumstances, is desirable.  It achieves the objective which, to be fair, everyone wants to achieve.</P>

      <P>The reason for this substitution is that the authority should be in the position to advise any Minister, not just the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on issues arising from the legislation since service provision to people with disabilities relates to other Ministers also.

This should be left with the Minister, because when the muck hits the fan one person will have responsibility for cleaning it up.

      <P>Section 8 lays down the primary functions of the National Disability Authority which include the requirement that the authority should report to me, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on matters relating to the co-ordination and development of policy relating to disabilities of persons and standards of programmes and services, and on the implementation of standards and codes of practice.  Amendments Nos. 9, 11 and 12 seek to provide instead that the authority should report to the Government rather than to the Minister under whose aegis the authority will operate.</P>
      <P>The Government has placed functional responsibility for disability issues under the aegis of my Department.

      <P>We could spend more time dancing on the head of the &ldquo;may&rdquo;<i>versus</i>&ldquo;shall&rdquo; pin.  However, I wish to refer to section 10, which relates to codes of practice.  The Bill states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Authority may, and shall if requested by the Minister, prepare for submission to the Minister draft codes of practice for the purpose of achieving the aim of good standards and quality in the provision of programmes and services <Col N="1141" /> provided or to be provided to persons with disabilities.</P>
    <P>This is obviously one of the core sections of the Bill as it encapsulates very clearly one of its primary aims and ambitions and, to a large extent, sets out the whole spirit of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I will not rehash the previous arguments about &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, but it appears, from reading the Bill, that it would have been far more valuable to give the authority a very clear mandate here, in other words, to state &ldquo;the authority shall prepare for submission draft codes of practice&rdquo;. The section states quite clearly the authority &ldquo;shall if requested by the Minister&rdquo; prepare draft codes of practice, but it would have been much clearer to state simply &ldquo;the authority shall prepare&rdquo; those codes of practice.  That would give the authority a much clearer and more effective legislative function.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very good example of where the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; should replace the word &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  I agree with the amendment because, if the authority is required to do anything, it should be required to draft codes of practice.  It is in all our interests to make it a <i>sine qua non</i> that, if it is to monitor models of good practice, it should, in the first place, draft such codes of practice for the purpose of achieving good standards.  Otherwise, we will leave ourselves open in two ways; first, they may not have proper guidelines, reference points or rules on which to base their decisions or opinions; and, second, it may make it difficult for the persons and bodies they are monitoring to determine how they should approach matters and do their business.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 14 strengthens the section. Amendment No. 16 is probably not quite as clear and I am not sure if it is necessary.  I do not understand why the Minister would not accept amendment No. 17, but I am sure he will explain it to us.</P>
      <P>It seems quite clear, however, that it would be in the interests of the Minister, the House and everyone else if part of the function and a continuing role of the authority were the creation of draft codes of practice.  This would be accepted in normal industrial relations nowadays.  If the Minister took action against someone because they disagreed with the opinion which had been formed by the authority and if they could point to the fact that the authority had not provided codes of practice, it would weaken the Minister's position.</P>
      <P>We expect these people to do a certain amount of work.  From the point of view of any of the professionals attaching to the authority, it would be better if they could have an input into ensuring there are clear codes of practice.  Perhaps we are missing something, but I definitely feel the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I agree with the two previous speakers.  I have already said enough about the difference between &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and &ldquo;may&rdquo; and I do <Col N="1142" /> not want to rehash that argument.  However, it is becoming clear to us that the Minister simply does not want this Bill or the National Disability Authority to have teeth.  I wonder what is the conflict.  If it were to be an authority, the legislation setting out its terms of reference would be set out in authoritative language.  It is as simple as that.  The Minister might explain to us why he will not change the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, as requested in this series of amendments.</P>

      <P>The Senator may think so but it seems to me that it was not.</P>
      <P>This authority is an independent statutory body.  Section 10 states &ldquo;The Authority may, and shall if requested by the Minister, prepare for submission to the Minister.  ..&rdquo;. Inserting the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; would impose limits on what the authority could and could not do and would take from its independence.  If the authority does not do the proper thing the Minister can compel action.</P>
      <P>The House has often argued about the meaning of the words &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not&rdquo;.  When one asked in school &ldquo;An bhfuil cead agam dul amach go dtí an leithreas?&rdquo; the teacher could have replied that one &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may not&rdquo; go or one &ldquo;shall&rdquo; or &ldquo;shall not&rdquo;.

      <P>I have reviewed these amendments carefully.  However, despite their apparent precision they could lead to confusion as to the responsibilities of the authority as well as removing entirely from the scope of the Bill what I would regard as a useful ministerial function. Section 10 deals with the development of codes of practice and is, if I may use the term, permissive in its approach.</P>
      <P>This approach has been adopted because of the nature of the obligation placed on the authority, which is general and couched in broad terms.  The intention is that the authority should not be restricted in identifying subject matters suitable for the development of codes of practice, neither should it be committed by law to promulgate codes of practice over the general and comprehensive terms of its remit in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> However, there is one exception to this permissive approach.  It is mandatory for the authority to prepare such codes of practice when requested to do so.  This arrangement will ensure that where the authority fails to identify and prepare a code of practice and a need arises which becomes known to the Minister, he or she is in a position to ensure the need is addressed.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in section 20 follows the approach in previous legislation, such as the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, and the Employment Equality Act, 1998.  I would be slow to depart from a tried, tested and successful formula.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take another look at these amendments.  It does not do them justice to treat them as a group.  It is important that amendment No. 14 is accepted.  Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are different in intent.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 17 seeks to amend section 10(3) to read:</P>
      <P>After a code of practice has been submitted under subsection (1), the Minister shall by order declare that the draft.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; here because the Minister should have the right to exercise judgment.  I, therefore, do not support the amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 16 seeks to amend section 10(2) to read:</P>
      <P>Before submitting a draft code of practice under subsection (1) to the Minister, the Authority shall consult with such other Ministers of the Government or any other person or body as the Authority considers appropriate.</P>
      <P>The amendment proposes the deletion of the subsequent words &ldquo;or as the Minister may direct&rdquo;. However, it is good that the Minister should have the authority to direct the authority to consult with people, bodies or Departments.  This amendment is, therefore, restrictive.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister has a good argument to make regarding amendments Nos. 16 and 17. However, the intent of amendment No. 14 is different.  It seeks to amend section 10(1) to read: &ldquo;The Authority shall prepare for submission to the Minister.  .&rdquo;.  This is the beginning of the process; it shall then consult and the Minister shall then declare.</P>
      <P>Section 8(2)(d) provides that a principal function of the authority is to &ldquo;monitor the implementation of standards and codes of practice.  .&rdquo;. However, codes of practice do not come into operation unless the authority decides to compile them and if an authority decided not to proceed on this basis a central provision of the Bill would not be adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, as provided in amendment No. 14, addresses this possible difficulty. The amendment proposes that, in agreeing this provision, it is the Oireachtas, not the Minister, <Col N="1144" /> that directs that the authority &ldquo;shall&rdquo; prepare the draft codes of practice.  That is a positive way to proceed.  It should be clearly seen that the authority has the duty to compile codes of practice. It should then consult on them before finalising them and the Minister should then accept or reject them.</P>
    <P>The legislation should unequivocally determine that it is part of the role of the authority &mdash; it is not something over which it should have discretion &mdash; to draft codes of practice for the purpose of achieving the aims of good standards and quality in the provision of the programmes.  It can never have been the intention of either the Minister or the Government that this should be within the discretion of an authority.  I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 14, which is different from amendments Nos. 16 and 17 in terms of what it seeks to do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined that the intention is that the authority should not be restricted in identifying subject matter suitable for the development of codes of practice, nor do I believe that it should be committed by law to promulgate codes of practice over the general and comprehensive terms of its remit in the area.</P>
      <P>Section 9(1) already provides that the authority &ldquo;shall prepare and submit to the Minister, for approval by the Minister with or without amendment, a strategic plan for the ensuing three year period&rdquo;.  That would refer to codes of practice.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole and others have argued that under section 10, there should be a statutory imperative on the authority to prepare for submission to the Minister draft codes of practice. This would appear to imply that at the first attempt the authority should put before the Minister draft codes of practice which would become the only draft codes to be thus submitted.</P>
      <P>In the alternative, the argument can be cogently made that the fact it is discretionary means there is far more elasticity in the legislation in so far as the authority is concerned, in other words, it is provided with a degree of flexibility to which it is entitled.  I do not believe that the independence of the authority in terms of its determination process should be interfered with to the extent that it should become a statutory imperative for the authority to do what the Minister wants.  There is a safety valve in that there may be occasions where the Minister would request the authority to prepare a submission but I would not envisage that this would become the norm.  It would be desirable for the authority to have, and be seen to have, a degree of independence and flexibility in its operations.  I am disposed to maintaining the <i>status quo.</i>  Under section 9 the strategic plan would include codes of practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not.  That is factually incorrect.  I have carefully read the legislation and it does not include codes of practice.  It states: &ldquo;A strategic plan shall comprise the key objectives, <Col N="1145" /> outputs and related strategies, including the use of resources, of the Authority&rdquo;.  That is all that is in it.  The Minister also talks about putting a time limit on it.  The strategic plan has to be done within three years and this does not include codes of practice.  I suspect that codes of practice are not included in the strategic plan for the precise reason that he implied, that it would require them to do it on a timescale quicker than perhaps they would be entitled to do it.  It is also incorrect for the Minister to say that section 10 implies that they have to do it immediately or only once.  It does not.  Section 10(4) says: &ldquo;The Minister may, after consultation with the Authority, by order revoke or amend an approved code of practice&rdquo;. The term &ldquo;an approved code of practice&rdquo; implies there will be other codes of practice, in other words, there will not be just one code of practice; there will also be different draft codes.  The fact that they are drafted means that they are subject to change.</P>
      <P>Everything the Minister has said confirms that the term should be &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and that they should put in their own time.  It is not in the strategic plan, nor should it be because that suggests they can set it for each three year period.  Inserting this in the strategic plan would result in a hamfisted operation because it would appear that they put their draft code in and they cannot change it until the next strategic plan is produced in three years' time.  Codes of practice are not included in the strategic plan.  Whoever said they were is giving inaccurate advice.  It is not there, it is quite rightly not there and it was never intended to be there. It is intended to be something that the authority should do when they feel it is appropriate.  Without doubt they should have to do it and they should have no discretion about it.  I ask the Minister to recognise and accept that the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  We would expect by legislative imperative that the authority would be required to draw up codes of practice.</P>

      <P>A small &ldquo;m&rdquo; is used for a reason. In an Act where &ldquo;Ministers&rdquo; is used it refers to the Minister for Finance and the Minister of another Department.  It also refers to the Ministers who are included in the Act, and they often use a capital &ldquo;M&rdquo;.  Usage of the small &ldquo;m&rdquo; means that it can be a Minister, Minister of State, Minister of the Cabinet, etc., it just means any particular Minister.  That is what is intended.  That is a regularly used drafting device.</P>
      <P>In recent times the draftspersons conventions are changing.  The term &ldquo;the Government&rdquo; has been referred to in the singular.  Two years ago the Government was referred to in the plural.  In the new version of Office 1998 which gives corrections as one goes along it draw one's attention and gives one a slap on the wrist for using a capital incorrectly.

      <P>The National Disability Authority is required to make an annual report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the performance of its functions and activities during the preceding year and such reports shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The National Disability Authority is also empowered, under subsection (3), to make <Col N="1148" /> such other reports to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with respect to its functions as it sees fit.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied it would not be appropriate to require that any additional or special reports, which the National Disability Authority may make, should be subject to laying before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The authority must, within the provisions of subsection (3), be free to report to the Minister in respect of any issues which it feels would benefit from such reporting.  Such reports may arise as a consequence of an intervention by the authority, under section 14, with a service provider.  In many cases, aspects of the report may be confidential.  It would be incumbent on the Minister to take appropriate action on receipt of such reports.  The power of the authority to report in this way to the Minister and, in turn, the Minister's ability to proceed with matters raised by the authority in a manner considered to be most beneficial, is crucial to the establishment of an effective mechanism enabling the authority to channel its concerns directly to the Minister and, through him or her, to all Departments and service providers.</P>
      <P>Where the National Disability Authority feels it is appropriate, it will be open to it to refer in its annual report to matters it has raised in special reports to the Minister.  In this way, issues appropriate to public debate may be brought into the public arena.</P>

      <P>In page 11, subsection (1)(b), line 31, to delete &ldquo;19&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>These amendments relate to the appointment of worker-directors to the staff of the authority. Section 20(4)(b) refers to &ldquo;one member of the staff of the Authority who shall be elected by secret ballot of the staff of the Authority.  .&rdquo;.  This is the usual method for the election of worker directors, the appointment of whom is common in the semi-State sector.  Amendment No. 24 seeks to delete &ldquo;19&rdquo; in section 21(b) and substitute &ldquo;18&rdquo; while amendment No. 27 seeks to substitute the phrase &ldquo;two members&rdquo; for &ldquo;one member&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am not aware of any board which includes worker directors that restricts their number to one.  The Minister regularly refers to common practice in other legislation but it is common practice to have two worker directors on a board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1150" /> A single worker director could find himself or herself alone in representing the views and interests of staff and in discussing policy issues. Worker directors can and do contribute to the range of responsibilities of the board, authority or committee on which they sit.  Why does the legislation provide for only one worker director? Given that the principle of having a worker director is contained in the legislation, will the Minister not accept that the appointment of two such directors would be more effective in enhancing that principle?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>I support Senator O'Meara's amendments.  The section states that the authority &ldquo;shall consist of a chairperson and 20 ordinary members who shall be appointed by the Minister and who shall, subject to the other provisions of this section, hold and vacate office as the Minister may determine&rdquo;.  The Minister, therefore, has control of the 20 ordinary members of the authority. The staff of the authority will have the right to elect, by secret ballot, one member of the authority. We are seeking the election of an extra member of the authority by the same process.  I cannot understand why the Minister should not accept this proposal.</P>
      <P>I suspect that the Minister never intended that the National Disability Authority should be a proper authority with the degree of independence it would require to be effective.  Obviously, there is a subplot involved because in every discussion we have had on Committee Stage the recurring theme is that the Minister wishes to restrict the actions and authority of this so-called authority. The staff of the authority will be isolated if the number of worker directors is confined to one. He or she will have little influence on the authority. Senator O'Meara is correct to point out that throughout the semi-State sector, where worker directors are now the norm, the number of such directors is much larger.</P>

The House should recall what happened during the formation of the last two Governments and the view of the two minor parties about having only one seat at the Cabinet table, in effect, one worker director.  Both Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats did not consider having a single representative at Cabinet the best way to do business.  That led to the creation of the famous half seat at Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respectfully request the understanding support of the Progressive Democrats for this amendment.  They have been through this situation and have considered the arguments for and against a single representative at Cabinet.  Perhaps they would rehearse now the arguments they made when they were forming the Government. They are the same reasons the workers in <Col N="1151" /> the National Disability Authority should have two representatives rather than one on the authority. It is a telling argument and I look forward to the support of the Progressive Democrats. They should at least do us the honour of agreeing with our arguments even if they are obliged to vote against them.</P>
    <P>When the current Taoiseach was Minister for Labour, he brought before the House two Bills dealing with worker representation, including worker representation at sub-board level.  On a number of recent occasions there have been ministerial orders to increase the number of State companies which should have worker directors. That simply represents the Government's view.</P>
    <P>The trade union movement is currently trying to convince union members of the benefits of the concept of partnership, a concept which was mentioned many times during the Budget Statement and in numerous speeches by the Taoiseach.  That partnership has led to inclusion whereby workers are asked to take their brains to work, not just for the task they must complete, and also to take a strategic approach to their work.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to increase the number of worker directors on the Authority to two.  As far as I am aware, there is no example of there being just one worker director in a semi-State body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We are discussing the need for worker representation in order to reflect the approach to partnership.  The appointment of at least two worker directors is normal practice in the semi-State sector.  The nearest relevant example is the National Rehabilitation Board.  It has 15 members of whom four are worker directors. The authority, on the other hand, comprises 20 members of whom only one will be a worker's representative.  That is not a good balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are strong reasons for the appointment of worker directors.  It shows a sense of trust and confidence in the staff and in their approach and <Col N="1152" /> commitment.  Their view and vision might often be relied on by the other members of the board because they work in this area every day.  It gives a good balance and would add to the other balancing measures of the additional amendments introduced today.  I ask the Minister to concede this amendment and to increase the number of staff members elected to the board from one to two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support in principle the arguments made on this side of the House.  There are also two strong practical arguments in favour of not limiting worker representation to one person. The staff will have intimate acquaintance from their day to day work with the needs of people with disabilities, and while they will be represented in their own right on the board, staff in this area have an important role to play and should be represented to the maximum possible extent.</P>
      <P>The Minister's colleague, the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, showed great openness to this argument in the legislation which restructured Bord na Móna.  Even though it was drafted to minimise or exclude worker representatives from the subdivisions of the main company, she accepted the arguments made during the passage of the legislation and restored a favourable balance for worker representatives.</P>
      <P>The other practical argument is the situation which could arise if there was only one worker representative and that person was indisposed through illness or other reasons and was unable to attend meetings.  The staff would be disenfranchised in the deliberations of that meeting.</P>
      <P>I support the arguments my colleagues have made in principle but there are also practical arguments and I hope the Minister will respond favourably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 20(1)(b) and 20(4) provide for the appointment of an elected worker-director to membership of the authority. Amendments Nos. 24 and 27 seek to increase the number of worker-directors of the authority from one to two employees.  The National Disability Authority will be a small expert body with an initial staff complement of 35 employees.</P>
      <P>It has to be pointed out that the National Rehabilitation Board has five times that number of staff.  As a consequence of the fact that there will be only 35 employees of the National Disability Authority, there is no ground for making provision for the appointment of more than one member of staff to the board.  I cannot accept the amendments for this reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of worker participation in the boards of State bodies has evolved in recent decades and reflects the current partnership approach to social and economic issues.  A particular approach is evident in the large corporate bodies such as Aer Lingus, An Post and Telecom Éireann.  These bodies have substantial numbers of employees, often involving diverse groups <Col N="1153" /> which may have different concerns.  The boards of these organisations are generally management boards with major responsibility for overseeing the functioning of a large commercial organisation. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which has responsibility for policy and legislation in this area, has encouraged the development of worker participation in this context. The Department also recognised the differing needs of non-commercial State organisations in regard to staff representation.  For this reason it advocates that a case by case approach is taken when making legislative provision for staff representation on the boards of new organisations.</P>
    <P>In a number of recent cases, legislation has been enacted to establish new State bodies without reference to staff representation on the board.  This was the case with Enterprise Ireland, which was established last year with a staff of 100. It was also the case with the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  In both cases, however, one staff representative has been appointed to each board on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>Similarly the National Social Services Board, which is to be involved in the new information providing service, has no statutory provision for staff representation on its board.  It does, however, have one staff member on its board. Nonetheless, I am convinced it is appropriate to make provision for a staff representative in the legislation establishing the National Disability Authority and that is what I propose to do.  As a small expert body, I envisage a very close working relationship between the board and the staff which will be facilitated by the inclusion of this representative.</P>
    <P>I have indicated why I do not intend to accept the amendments.  I have to insist that the issue of staff representation on the board of the National Disability Authority must be evaluated on the basis of the approach which is most appropriate for that body.  In short, I believe that my view is reasonable.  It is necessary to ensure a close working relationship, and for the benefit of the authority itself, that there would be a staff representative, but there will be only 35 employees and in those circumstances, one representative could adequately express the views of the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>To return to the Latin theme, and the issue of Caligula having made his horse a senator, I want to make it clear that I am not suggesting that there is any Senator in this House who bears even the remotest similarity to the equine species. Having said that, it is necessary of me to quote an old mentor, the late Professor Murphy, who used to like saying &ldquo;<i>inclusio unius, exclusio alterius</i>&rdquo;, which means that if you include one, you exclude another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  In the event of a single worker-director on a board such as this not being available, where does the principle of representation <Col N="1154" /> apply?  Will the Minister clarify if the possibility of the appointment of a substitute exists in the legislation in light of the fact that the member will be elected by secret ballot?  If it does not, it strengthens the argument for two worker-directors because it is unfair to provide for one.  Even if a person is representing 35 people, it is still an onerous responsibility and occasions will arise when that person cannot be there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

      <P>Again the Minister labours the point that the staff complement is small.  With 20 members, the board is quite large.  There is room for a second worker director to represent the staff.  That is the way we should be moving in this modern age giving a greater say to the staff of any concern.  State bodies have given the lead in that they have introduced the concept of worker-directors.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister holds the authority for appointment to the board, perhaps he might describe the criteria which he will apply.  One hopes that political considerations will not come into it.  What advice will he feel obliged to take in relation to the various bodies which provide care and assistance to people with disabilities, either on a voluntary or a statutory basis?</P>

      <P>I have been trying to resist the temptation to rise to Senator O'Toole's bait but I will have to do so.  An analogy between an authority board and the Cabinet is a spurious analogy for one reason: the proceedings of the Cabinet are subject to confidentiality; the proceedings of the board of an authority board are not.  The confidentiality aspect is the very good reason to have a second person present at Cabinet.</P>
      <P>Senator Connor seems to be labouring under confusion as to the difference between State boards and authorities.  It is perfectly legitimate for the workers to be fully represented in the case of a State board which runs a large public utility and it is desirable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to do with the difference between boards which control large public utilities where there is a large staff input and the activity impinges directly on the staff.  That is not so evident in the case of an authority.  It is particularly not evident in the case of an authority in which service provision is separated from the authority. If we examine the functions of the authority we see they are all to do with acting as a central national body to assist the Minister, undertaking <Col N="1155" /> research, advising the Minister and monitoring the implementation of standards and codes.  Of course the professional people involved in the sector have a competence and should have a view.  It is interesting that the only groups specified in the legislation are the workers &mdash; one of whom shall be elected &mdash; and one officer of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>To dismiss Senator Dardis's very weak argument that the reason this is different from Cabinet is that Cabinet is subject to confidentiality, any board of any description can make rules about confidentiality.  Every one of the 3,200 primary school boards of management has written a confidentiality clause into its regulations. That has its own impact.  Section 29 states:</P>
      <P>(1) Save as otherwise provided by law, a person shall not, without the consent of the Authority, disclose any information obtained by him or her while performing, or as a result of having performed, duties as a member of the Authority, a member of staff of the Authority (including the Chief Executive), a member of an advisory committee or a consultant or adviser to the Authority.</P>
      <P>(2) A person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> That is from the Bill.  There is a confidentiality law governing it.  If that is the only difference between it and Cabinet, the argument goes.  They are subject to precisely the same rule except that one is covered by the Constitution and the other is covered by the law of the land which is subject to the Constitution.  Let us drop that argument.</P>
    <P>The matter that bothered me most when I was listening to the Minster talking about him being a target is something I have seen happen many times since I came in here.  I listened carefully to the Minister's comments.  He is a bright guy and knows his stuff.  He has not put forward one argument against having a second worker-director.  He told me what happens in the Enterprise Authority, the National Standards Authority and the NSSB.  I suspect somebody other than the Minister has made this decision.  Is the Minister convinced of this?  If he is, he has not articulated it. There is absolutely no reason for this.  This is what gives the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the reputation it has for being closed, exclusive, opaque, not involving people and not participating in the common views of the community.</P>
    <P>There is a commitment to partnership; there is a commitment to showing trust and confidence in the workforce and this is a very good opportunity for the Minister to take that on board.  I will regret if he does not.  There would be no gain to him and I do not know what the Department could gain by not expanding this.  The numbers do not add up.  I could understand if a certain number was required to be on the staff and we had to wait until there were 35 before we could have the second person.  The closest example I could give is the National Rehabilitation Board where there are four out of 15 members.</P>
    <P>I prophesy that there will be serious difficulties with the operation of this board within five or six years.  As soon as the inevitable tensions develop between the staff of the boards and the elected or appointed authority, they will not be sorted out.</P>
    <P>Section 20 states that one member of staff shall be elected by secret ballot of the staff of the Authority.  Section 28 states &ldquo;the members of staff, including the Chief Executive&rdquo; thus implying the chief executive is a member of staff. Section 25 states the &ldquo;Chief Executive shall not be a member of the Authority&rdquo;.  There is a straight conflict there.  In section 20, as a member of staff, he is entitled to be elected.  In section 28, he is included as a member of staff and in section 25 he is the only member of the staff who is excluded by name from becoming a member of the authority.  I know the Minister will have four weak arguments against accepting that but I do not care.  Some day this will appear before a court and these arguments will be made and this provision will fall.</P>
    <P>The arrangement under section 25 whereby the chief executive &ldquo;may&rdquo; attend meetings of the authority is a bad one.  In this situation there may be a problem with some aspect of the workings <Col N="1157" /> of the staff &mdash; this happens in the best run places &mdash; and the chief executive can be excluded from attending the board while a worker-director elected to the board will try to represent three or four different points of view on his or her own. This is a bad arrangement.  There is a deficiency in those elements of it.  There is a separate relationship there that will not work.  The Bill may be forced through the House tonight but that does not help.</P>
    <P>Going back to the fundamental issue, the Minister's job will not be made any easier by restricting this to one person.  I ask him to accept this amendment and extend the &ldquo;one member&rdquo; to &ldquo;two members&rdquo; for all good reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding among the Opposition about what exactly is the National Disability Authority. We are not talking about a company.  We are talking about an authority.  I am sorry to bring up amendment No. 26a but it is relevant, even if it is slightly out of order.  It proposes that the Minister shall have regard to the desirability that the majority of the authority will be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers, in other words, that these will bring a certain type of expertise and are representative of people who are to be assisted by that authority.  It is not like a company; it is a totally different body.  The explanatory memorandum states that the NDA will not be a service providing agency but will function as an expert body.  It is desirable that there be a communication vehicle, though I disagree with the term &ldquo;worker-director&rdquo; as that gives a totally incorrect emphasis.  The point is that it will function as an expert body; it is the authority and the members thereof that are functioning. They have the expertise.  It is not like the board of a company where one refers to the employees and their representatives.  The person elected to the National Disability Authority by the staff members should also be bringing a degree of expertise that is pertinent to the work of the authority.</P>
      <P>This is totally different; we are not comparing like with like.  The arguments being made are fallacious because they do not recognise the role of the authority.  There is a fundamental misunderstanding here.  The matter does not relate to the representation of workers but to a body of expertise.  That is the fundamental point that must be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the entire argument again, for obvious reasons. Senator Keogh is correct.  Subsection (3) sets out the concerns the Minister must take into account when deciding who shall and shall not be members of the authority.  The Senator is also correct in stating that this is an expert body whose role clearly parallels organisations such as Enterprise Ireland, which I have mentioned, the National Social Services Board or the National Standards Authority.  The arrangement for the <Col N="1158" /> inclusion of one worker-director is in line with existing practices in those organisations.  In addition, I have not made an administrative arrangement.  I have made it a statutory imperative that there will be a representative of the staff. As I have said, it is one staff member out of approximately 35, which is not bad.</P>
      <P>The fact that I am making it a statutory provision means I am going beyond the practice in similar organisations, and I feel justified in doing so because I strongly believe that the staff should have a representative.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Meara asked if there would be a substitute.  The member of the authority will be elected by the staff by secret ballot, and in as much as Senator O'Meara is irreplaceable until the next election, so too will be the member of the authority, and that is how it should be.  We cannot have substitutes in elections.  Would that it were so; many former Senators and Deputies might turn up every now and then.  It does not work like that.</P>
      <P>Regarding Senator O'Toole's point, this could not be more inclusive.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is doing its level best to be inclusive, open and transparent with this and other legislation.  We are doing our best to defrost the window and not to be opaque.  If Senator O'Toole is not satisfied with our performance, there is very little more I can do other than to assure him that we are not trying to sweep anything under the carpet.  We are trying to be as clear and open as we can.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with Senator O'Toole's point about the chief executive, but that does not mean he might not be right.  I will seek the opinion of the Attorney General on the Senator's proposition and then discuss it with him again.  I realise Senator O'Toole brought the matter forward to be helpful.  At least one of his other points regarding the Department might have been mischievous, but we cannot all be perfect all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that this matter will be checked out by the Attorney General. However, people should have some idea how this will work.  The board is made up of a diverse group of people which is by its nature intended to be inclusive of the people who will receive this service.  There is no argument with this point, but there is an argument with the next step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the list of things this board has been given to do &mdash; it is to advise Ministers, undertake commissions, act as a central co-ordinating body, liaise with other bodies, implement standards and codes of practice and prepare codes of practice and strategic plans.  Who will do that?  That work will be devolved from the board to its staff, and for that reason the staff are underrepresented. If I were chief executive of an operation where I had trust and confidence in the staff, and 21 people were coming in every month who had experience in facets of the area in which I was involved, I would want a staff member who <Col N="1159" /> would create a cohesive force to draw together the strength of the diverse group of people on the authority.  That is an effective and efficient way to do business.  I deal with a lay board each month, and people with the best will in the world, no matter how supportive, will always look at issues from a selective perspective.  That is what they are selected for, and someone else must draw that together.  The staff members will be doing the actual work, and they will have a huge practical input, apart from their professional expertise.  They will be discharging the responsibilities determined by decisions of the authority.</P>
    <P>That is a far more efficient way of doing business. I have made my case as strongly as I can and can make it no stronger.  A mistake is being made here, and I appeal to the Minister to reconsider. He should take a more open approach, and he should concede that we would be better off having a second staff member on the board.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 25 seeks to amend the Bill to stipulate that the chairperson of the authority shall not be a person engaged in the provision of services to people with disabilities, either as an employee or a member of the board of such a body.  These criteria would leave a situation in which up to one-third of the membership of the interim National Disability Authority would be excluded from the possibility of serving as chairperson of the authority.  Senator O'Meara, being a member of the Labour Party, will be accustomed to the frustration which could occur as a result of being excluded on such grounds.  The remainder of the authority's membership comprises either people with disabilities who are not engaged in service provision or the parents or carers of people with disabilities.  The chairperson of the interim authority could have come from either of these groups or from among the service providers.  In the event, Senators will <Col N="1160" /> be aware the chairperson is an employee of Rehab, a service provider.</P>
      <P>I am aware some people may have been disappointed that the chairperson of the interim board is a service provider.  Irrespective of who was appointed, somebody would have been disappointed.  I assure Senators that my selection of the chairperson from among the members of the interim board was made with a view to the very challenging programme which falls to be delivered by the incumbent of that position.  I am satisfied the chairperson possesses all the experience, expertise, drive and commitment required to make a success of the authority.  I am pleased she accepted my invitation to take up the appointment; the task is a very onerous one to which she is eminently suited, having a tremendous record in this area. The proposed amendment would conflict directly with the arrangements which have been put in place for the interim authority and I am not disposed to accept it.</P>

      <P>In page 11, to delete lines 46 to 50 and in page 12, to delete lines 1 to 3 and substitute the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3) 15 members shall be appointed by the Minister from persons nominated to the Minister by organisations representative of persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers; and the remaining 3 appointed members shall be chosen by the Minister from persons appearing to the Minister to have relevant knowledge and experience.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The paragraph in section 23 which relates to the appointment of members of the authority appears to be considerably broad and vague in its drafting, leaving a huge amount of discretion to the Minister.  This amendment seeks to change that and narrow the amount of discretion allowed to the Minister.  The amendment substitutes the current paragraph to ensure that, under the legislation, 15 members of the authority shall be appointed by the Minister from persons nominated by organisations representative of persons with disabilities, the remaining three members to be chosen by the Minister from persons appearing to have relevant knowledge and experience. That is a much tighter drafting than the current paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unknown for organisations representative of people in an area covered by legislation to have nominating authority or power.  A number of organisations nominate people to a considerable number of boards; ICTU and IBEC would <Col N="1161" /> be prime examples.  The amendment is in recognition and acceptance of the existence of bodies which are not only entitled but well suited and placed to nominate suitable, experienced and representative people to serve on boards and bodies where their views could be expressed and heard. It would seem entirely appropriate in the context of this legislation that organisations representative of people with disabilities should be specifically given nominating power under the legislation. The very clear opinion was expressed in the report of the Commission on People With Disabilities that a strong sense of exclusion was experienced not only among people with disabilities themselves but also among those who represent them and work on their behalf.  If the Minister were to accept this amendment, he would send out a strong signal that it is his desire and intention to ensure such a sense of exclusion is ended.  I appeal to him to take this amendment on board and give organisations involved in this area nominating power to the authority.</P>

      <P>I wish to point out a correction.  Amendment No. 26 will be discussed on its own.  Amendment No. 26a is an alternative and is related to amendment No. 28 with which it will be discussed.</P>

      <P>The Minister's proposal in this section is desirable in its general intent, namely, that a majority of the authority would comprise persons with disability and people with knowledge and experience in this area.  That is very worthwhile.  However, he spoils matters by reserving the sole authority to make the appointments. I am sure he would wish to be above reproach in this matter and ensure there could not be any suggestion that these were jobs for the boys.</P>
      <P>The authority will be a very large one with 20 board members.  The Minister is to have the authority to appoint the chairperson and to make a further appointment from another Ministry which he deems to be relevant.  Other nominations are to be made from staff.  Effectively, the Minister has the authority to make two nominations in addition to the chairperson, with one other person to be chosen from the staff.  Apart from those four people, the other 17 would effectively be appointed directly by the Minister.  The Minister does not have to observe any guidelines other than that the appointees should be from the area of disability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect the Minister would welcome the drawing of some parameters.  It is usual for nominating bodies to make nominations which are subsequently accepted by a Minister on foot of which appointments are made.  In that sense, a proper balance would be achieved.  I expected the Minister to welcome an amendment such as this which is not intended to tie his hands, rather to ensure a proper balance in terms of nominating bodies. It would also ensure that the process would be seen to be removed from the Minister while, at <Col N="1162" /> the same time, allowing the Minister overall responsibility and authority to make the nominations.</P>

      <P>I have carried out some research on the composition of the board.  Having seen the names of the nominees, I am satisfied that representation across the board is well balanced. More than 60 per cent of the board members are people with disabilities, among them wheelchair users, people with sensory disabilities and three members of the Irish Council for People with Disabilities.  With respect to the argument being made, the composition of the board as it stands is excellent and the Minister must be complimented on setting it up.</P>

      <P>Section 20 (3) sets down several criteria which will be observed in ministerial appointments to the authority.  Specific requirements are made with regard to the desirability that a majority of the authority would be persons with a disability, their representatives, families or carers.  Specific provision is also made that members appointed would have knowledge or experience, directly or indirectly, of matters pertaining to disability or of another subject which would be of assistance to the authority.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 26 proposes to replace the existing subsection (3) with a new subsection to provide that 15 members of the authority shall be appointed by the Minister from persons nominated by organisations representative of persons with disabilities, their families or carers, the remaining three to be chosen by the Minister having regard to their relevant knowledge and experience.</P>
      <P>I am not disposed to accept this amendment because I am satisfied that subsection (3) as it stands ensures that each successive Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will have sufficient flexibility in appointing a balanced and representative authority.</P>
      <P>Great care and consideration were taken in selecting the members of the interim authority, who were appointed last July.  As Senator O'Donovan said, over 65 per cent of the present board members are representative of people with disabilities, their families and carers and several members are representatives of service providing agencies.  The social partners and relevant Departments have also been included.</P>
      <P>In appointing the members of the authority I received many nominations from individuals actively involved in the disability sector.  I examined each nomination carefully and found them a source of great assistance in selecting such a broadly representative board.  It is standard practice for interested parties to make such nominations and for consideration to be given to nominations received.  This will be the case without recourse to legislative provision.  I would not advocate the inclusion of such a provision in the</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1163" /> Bill and I do not believe it would add any value to the criteria already provided for in section 20.</P>

      <P>The Senators' proposed amendment makes mandatory provision that the members of the authority should be appointed with due regard to an appropriate gender balance. I support the Senators in their amendment with regard to the principle of balance representation for men and women on State boards. However, I propose to make an amendment in a slightly different format to ensure that primacy is given to the desirability that a majority of the authority is composed of people with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers and that they have knowledge or experience of matters pertaining to disability or of assistance to the authority.</P>
      <P>I am happy to say that the members of the interim authority satisfy the intention of this provision in that 45 per cent are female and 55 per cent are male.</P>

      <P>With regard to the language used in the amendment, will the Minister clarify what is meant by &ldquo;the Minister shall have regard to the desirability&rdquo; that not less than eight of the members are women and not less than eight are men?  He points out that our amendment would make it mandatory and there is a reason for that. I accept that in practice this happens in many cases but we are looking to the possibility of a future authority sliding out from its responsibility in this regard.  What is the Minister's view on <Col N="1164" /> that?  We discussed earlier the power of an opinion.  What is his view on the power of desirability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister with responsibility for equality it is my policy to ensure we have equality, whether in terms of gender or something else.  Nobody wishes to be on a board if he or she feels he or she is not qualified to be there.  In the circumstances I am expressing the desirability that the objective of not fewer than eight of the members being women and not fewer than eight being men is achieved.  That is the ambition and setting it out in legislation as opposed to making it a purely administrative function, which could be the case, is desirable.  I do not believe that a Minister would ignore the provision of the legislation expressing the desirability if the Minister concerned has responsibility for equality.  To say the least, it would be strange and anomalous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to understand why the Minister needs to water down the provision suggested in our amendment No. 28 that at least 40 per cent of the authority shall be women and at least 40 per cent shall be men.  The Minister has indicated that he is responsible for equality and, surely, equality means just that and not desirability.</P>
      <P>The Minister has also indicated that in making the appointments he shall have regard to the desirability that a majority of the authority shall be persons with disabilities, their representatives, families or carers.  The numbers of males and females with disabilities is likely to be about even. If one seeks to make a figure of 40 per cent mandatory, it seems hard for the Minister to argue convincingly that he is not likely to get appropriate and qualified people for the job.</P>
      <P>The Minister is not even obliged to have it within certain parameters, having rejected our amendment that the nominees would come from nominating organisations, thus avoiding the possible difficulty that the nominations from the nominating bodies within the sector might have a gender imbalance.  The Minister has absolute flexibility in making the appointments.  I find it difficult to understand that he feels he must put in place a caveat that they would be subject to desirability.  It is, of course, desirable but there is no compulsion and no reason a Minister must follow the desirability.  The Minister and his successors should not feel constrained in any way by being obliged to have a minimum of 40 per cent of both genders.</P>

      <P>I have given it as my view that the primary consideration should be that the board would be made up for the most part of people with disabilities, their families or carers.  It is also desirable that there would be not fewer than eight women and not fewer than eight men on the board.  That is a reasonable provision.  I have already indicated that in the formation of the interim board I have achieved both objectives <Col N="1165" /> and I anticipate that those objectives will be achieved in subsequent boards.  One cannot give an absolute guarantee in regard to these matters. I am satisfied to trust the judgment and experience of my successors inasmuch as I feel Senators can trust me.</P>

      <P>This section concerns the review of the legislation; it is a one line section but an important one.  It provides that not later than three years after the establishment day the Minister shall initiate a review of the operations of Parts I and II of the Bill.  Our amendment seeks to give that responsibility to the authority rather than to the Minister because, given its role and function under the legislation, the authority is the appropriate body to carry out the review.  I presume that the review, like various multi-annual reports, would then be made available to the Minister to do with as he should and must.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 34 provides for a review of the legislation after three years of operation. Amendment No. 35 seeks to allow the authority rather than the Minister to review the legislation three years after establishment day. This is a most unusual proposal.  In the normal course it is for the Minister concerned to review legislation and to bring his proposals for change to Government and the Oireachtas.  Senators know the review of legislation involves a wide consultation process and in three years' time that will include bodies with an interest in the legislation. It seems inevitable that the process will impact directly on the National Disability Authority and I expect special regard will be had to its views on the options for amending the legislation at that stage.  I hope that is satisfactory.</P>
