      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="The Taoiseach The Taoiseach">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now more than two weeks since we witnessed the callous and vicious attack which cruelly shattered the heart of Omagh.  On a sunny Saturday afternoon, while families went about the everyday business of life, buying school uniforms and enjoying the carnival atmosphere, there was a massacre.  We were all deeply affected by the horrific images which filled our television screens.  We were numbed by the terrible suffering of the victims and the sadness and grief of their families and friends.  In seconds, the lives and dreams of so many were changed forever. Those who responded so bravely and with such humanity at the scene will always remember those terrible scenes.</P>
      <P>As I stood in Omagh a week later, the depth of the scars and trauma which this atrocity has left on everyone was visible.  Years from now, survivors may still be recovering from their injuries and will be reminded on a daily basis of what they have survived; the friends and loved ones of the bereaved will still mourn and will live with their shattered dreams of what might have been; and many will be haunted by the horrific scenes of human suffering and devastation which they witnessed. Many people will depend on the help and understanding of their families, friends and caring professionals to help them through the difficult times ahead.</P>
      <P>We were all united by our feelings of sorrow and grief.  This Government and people in every corner of the island expressed their sympathy through words, prayers and the dignified silence which was observed throughout the island a week after this evil act.  It is important that we, the elected representatives of the people, express and record our feelings here in this House.  As I did in Dáil Eireann yesterday, I express our deepest and sincerest sympathy to all those who have been injured or bereaved as a result of the bombing in Omagh.  A terrible wrong was done to the people of Omagh.  We grieve for your terrible loss and suffering; our hearts and prayers go out to you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bombing of Omagh was a reckless attack on a community, on a people.  Those who died were Catholic, Protestant, young and old, men and women who came from North, South and abroad.  The bombing of Omagh was also intended as an attack on the British-Irish Agreement, an attack on democracy and the will of the people.  The British-Irish Agreement has the support of the Irish and British Governments.  It has the support of the largest Nationalist, Unionist, loyalist and republican parties with one or two prominent exceptions, some of whom may yet come to accept it.  It has the support of the United States and the international community.  The Agreement is about the right of the people on this island to decide the kind of future they want <Col N="843" /> and how they want to achieve it.  The people chose a society built on respect and tolerance when they voted in such overwhelming numbers in favour of the British-Irish Agreement.  This vicious attack was intended to undermine the right of the people to decide on their own future.</P>
    <P>The Government is sending a clear message to those responsible for this atrocity.  You will not succeed and you will not defeat the will of the people.  If you continue to choose to ignore the will of the people of Ireland and continue on the path of violence, fear and intimidation, be in no doubt that this Government will crush you.  We will do everything we can to bring you to justice. We are determined that the people of this island, North and South, will have peace and we are determined that the victims of Omagh will have justice.</P>
    <P>The so-called Real IRA cannot hope to take on the people of Ireland and win.  It has already disgraced itself and the name which it has misappropriated. There is no community in Ireland that wishes to have that organisation operating in its midst.  The INLA acknowledged in its ceasefire statement, which I welcome, that the new conditions created by the British-Irish Agreement demand a ceasefire, and that the onus on all is to ensure that the democratic wishes of the Irish people are upheld.</P>
    <P>This House expects and demands that all remaining groups follow suit forthwith, or they will face the consequences.  These people are about to learn a lesson that will teach them to respect the strength of Irish democracy.  The time for sophistry that provides a cover for murderous attacks on fellow Irish men and women is over. We would also say to any young people who might be involved or thinking of becoming involved in violence to listen to the voice of the people.  Violence does not and never will pay.  We have seen too many victims and too much suffering. Those who persist with violence will not be remembered as the heroes of the future, they will be remembered for what they are &mdash; cold and callous murderers.</P>
    <P>Last May, the people in every corner of this island voted in overwhelming numbers in favour of the British-Irish Agreement because they wanted to see an end to such atrocities.  The Government is determined to uphold the choice they made.  When the Government met in the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, we decided on a security and legislative response to this atrocity. A response which is extremely tough, even draconian, and which we felt reflected the will of the majority of people on this island.  Neither I nor the Garda ever underestimated the potential threat posed by this new organisation formed last December.  Every effort was made through a tough security counter-strategy to dissuade them from continuing and to frustrate their operations, in so far as possible on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The Garda had considerable successes and intercepted them on six occasions.  The Garda <Col N="844" /> have made and will continue to make every possible effort to help the British authorities to bring those responsible for this crime to justice and additional resources are being provided for this purpose.  On a legislative level, following these statements, the Seanad will consider the Bill presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that contains our legislative proposals. These new legislative proposals will be additional to existing stringent provisions of the law.  The Government believes that, together, these provisions will significantly improve the capacity of the Garda Síochána to deal decisively and effectively with those who carried out the merciless attack in Omagh.</P>
    <P>The measures being brought forward are targeted solely at those who engage in continued violence.  They are time limited and will lapse when we are sure they are no longer necessary. We will monitor closely their implementation, with the safeguards, checks and balances in the British-Irish Agreement also coming into effect.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh tragedy, many people have asked why the measures which are now being introduced were not put in place in the past and that is an understandable reaction.  No pure security response could ever resolve the complex political problem that has caused such deep rooted division.  Every democratic society when confronted with the type of threat faced on this island has difficult decisions to make and must balance these decisions with the long-term implications for society and the freedom it enjoys. Our primary objective has always been to take the most effective security response, conscious that particular responses could, in the long term, have exacerbated the situation and ultimately caused more lives to be lost than would otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement has changed the situation fundamentally.  There is now for the first time a broad democratic consensus on the way forward.  The extremists have no legitimacy, no authority, no basis of support in international law. They act for no one but themselves and have condemned themselves to total isolation.  There have been many tragedies and atrocities over the past 30 years.  This year we have had truly appalling outrages.  This House has not yet had the opportunity to offer sympathy to the family and friends of the Quinn boys, Richard, Paul and Jason.  I wish to do so again now, as I did yesterday.  We must all do what we can to end the bitter sectarianism and division which led to their deaths. A terrible price has been paid for an unwillingness to find accommodation.</P>
    <P>In remembering the victims of Omagh and Ballymoney, I know that all the other victims over the past 30 years and their relatives will have been recalling their own tragedies and heartbreak. They have not been forgotten.  The work of the Victims Commission has begun.  The former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, will be consulting with victims and their families about their needs. We will continue to focus our efforts on creating <Col N="845" /> a society where there will be no more victims and tragedies.</P>
    <P>We are moving into a new chapter in the life of this island.  If we have learnt one lesson from our history, it is that the infliction of pain and suffering is never the answer and benefits no one. This year, as we commemorate the anniversary of 1798, we are discovering once again the true non-sectarian vision of the United Irishmen.  It drew its strength from North and South and from Catholic, Protestant and dissenter.  It was a popular movement that aspired to a unity of people.  This is also the year when the people in every corner of this island voted together in favour of the British-Irish Agreement for a society built on the principles of democracy, pluralism and equality which respects everyone.</P>
    <P>The heroes of today, the visionaries who will be commemorated by generations in the future will not be those who engage in violence.  They will be those with the courage and vision to work together to break down the bitter divisions of the past, those who help build an Ireland that all of us will want to live in.  That is the best tribute that we can give to the victims of the Omagh bombing and other tragedies.</P>
    <P>Following the attack on Omagh, I have had an intensive, sustained level of meetings with many of the political parties involved.  These meetings and contacts were geared towards responding to the Omagh atrocity.  As well as focusing on security matters they focused in detail on the importance of implementing the Agreement in all its aspects.  We are all fully agreed on the critical need to maintain political momentum.  The Irish and British Governments are working closely together.  We are at one on what is required.  We will continue all our efforts, working closely with all of the parties involved to see this process through and to build a better future for everyone on these islands.  We will keep going until we succeed. I thank you, a Chathaoirleach, and all Senators for attending this week to assist in the passage of this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach to the House.  The first and most obvious thing to do today is to express our grief, sympathy, sorrow and revulsion to the people of Omagh, especially those who lost loved ones, those who were maimed and the healthy people who are now condemned to lead shattered, painful lives as a result of this foul, malevolent and sinful act.  Everybody cried during those awful days as we saw pictures of smiling, innocent children cut down with such brutality, of caring, loving mothers whose love, generosity and selflessness was rewarded with barbarity; pictures of young men and women full of hope, promise and the joys of life, all of which was blasted away; pictures of older people who should have been free to enjoy the serenity of old age which a lifetime of work had earned for them, but had even this modest ambition so cruelly taken from them.  We think also today of the people who will live the rest of their lives in pain <Col N="846" /> and agony, people whose lives henceforth are about survival, not fulfilment, about constant pain and dependence on others.  In some cases the ultimate sacrifice might have been more merciful.</P>
      <P>However, we should be clear about this.</P>
      <P>Omagh was not about abstract laws of history, ideology or politics, it was about people who decided that their view of the world took precedence over all others.  Compared with their rights ordinary people had none.  It was about evil, arrogance and the brutal use of power.  It was fascist in the deepest sense of the word.  It was done by people who despise democracy, who spurn the constitutional and, indeed, human rights of others, who do not believe in compromise and who reject the voice of the democratically elected people.  These are the people against whom this State, in defence of democracy, must show ruthlessness and determination.  That is why the Taoiseach's strong words today must be given flesh and put into effect with immediacy and totality.</P>
      <P>Sadly, however, we know only too well how easy it is to forget.  We have stood here on many other occasions and condemned brutal and terrible atrocities, which may not have been as awful as Omagh, yet it is easy to forget.  Life rolls on, memories fade and other priorities appear.  We must never forget Omagh.  Even the successful conclusion of the peace process, for which we all devoutly wish, should not diminish or lessen the horror of that awful day.  We must never forget the evil done in our name or that these perverted people claim to speak in the name of the sovereign Irish people and were so claiming when they perpetrated this terrible act.  We must never lose sight of the human dimension of what that evil did to good and innocent people.  Those who did it must be made answer and that is why the Taoiseach's strong words are encouraging but must also be given reality.</P>
      <P>On the part of my party and group let me do the simple thing by saying to the people of Omagh how we grieved and mourned with them, how we suffered with them.  Let us hope we will never forget the evil done on that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the House it is my sad duty to convey the condolences and sympathy of the House to relatives of the dead, the maimed, the traumatised, the bereaved and all those who have suffered in the town of Omagh. This was the work of people who were satanically callous and indiscriminate in their mass murder and mayhem, the worst in the history of modern Ireland.  As well as conveying our condolences and sympathies to the relatives of the dead, the injured and the traumatised we also offer our support and thanks to all the doctors, nurses, members of security forces, members of the public, people from Omagh and the adjoining areas who came to the assistance of those dying and in extreme agony and performed what can only be regarded as heroic, charitable and neighbourly acts which helped in no small way to alleviate to <Col N="847" /> some extent the terrible events of that dreadful day.  The sense of outrage felt by the people of every political opinion at the bombing of Omagh is fuelled by the sheer cruelty of the act, the dreadful suffering it has inflicted and the deliberate flouting of the will of the people.  To plant a bomb where people might pass is evil and irresponsible. To place an instrument of mass destruction where people are gathered in large numbers to work, shop, enjoy themselves and meet their friends indicates a depth of deliberate and planned cruelty.</P>
      <P>The suffering in Omagh is a replica of the suffering inflicted on many innocent victims in this country and in Britain over the past 30 years.  We have been shocked before and have hoped that each atrocity would be the last.  The sheer scale of the dead and injured in this instance has appalled us and left us feeling numb and overwhelmed by their suffering.  The Omagh bombing is a deliberate rejection of the will of the people which has been expressed in a free ballot throughout the island.  The choice of venue, a town with an enviable record of good community relations, and the timing were designed to cause maximum damage, not only to the people in the town or from wherever they came but also to the British-Irish Agreement.  This atrocity was planned to flout the will of the Irish people and to generate as much terror as possible throughout the whole community.  It was destined to destroy not only the Agreement but our hopes for peace.</P>
      <P>The reaction of the elected representatives, therefore, must be to protect the right of the people to live in peace which they endorsed so overwhelmingly in the referendum.  To do that we, as legislators, have to strengthen the powers of the State to identify and bring to trial those responsible for these murders.  I must emphasise that the legislation we introduce here today must not be conceived as a backlash to tragedy but carefully drafted and subject to strict review within a stated and relatively short timeframe.</P>
      <P>The rule of law on which our democracy is founded must not be jeopardised by our reaction to those who seek to undermine both democracy and its standards of justice.  The only rational explanation of the bombing of Omagh is that the perpetrators want to spread so much terror and despair that they will be in a position to maim, rob and destroy with impunity.</P>
      <P>The people who know who these perpetrators are and who have the knowledge that would bring them to justice should reflect on the shame they will experience should there be another atrocity or another terrible defiance of the will of the Irish people to live together in peace and harmony.</P>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for coming into the House today and, with Senator Manning, I welcome the sentiments he expressed and the Government's approach that has followed this terrible atrocity in Omagh.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Independent group I would like to be associated with the comments made by other speakers and to indicate our own views on this matter.  It is important for all democratically elected people to show a united response to this atrocity.</P>
      <P>Le tríocha bliain anuas táimid ag féachaint ar na sochraidí agus ag éisteacht leis na buamaí; ag léamh miontuairiscí a bhaineann le tragóid i ndiaidh tragóide ach thar aon cheann eile, ba é seo uafás na n-uafás.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to see beyond this point.  There is a hope, and one wonders if it is a hope we can live with, that this will be uafás na n-uafás and that the people of this island will never again experience such a tragedy.</P>
      <P>It is right that we extend our sympathies to the people of Omagh, Buncrana and the other villages which suffered so grievously.  We offer our condolences to the families and extended families of the injured and the bereaved.  We offer our support to the maimed and the hospitalised in their struggle towards recovery and normality, in the new definition of normality for them.  We want to express our understanding to the school-children of Buncrana, Omagh and Ballymoney also.  I was delighted that the Taoiseach mentioned Ballymoney in his contribution because it is important that the suffering experienced by the Quinn family is recalled.</P>
      <P>We must also express our regret and embarrassment that the will of all the people on the island, as democratically articulated to us, was attacked with such contempt and terror.  Those terrorists sought to blast the democratic process into smithereens.  Like everybody else, we found it impossible to accommodate the horrific images emerging from our television screens into our sitting rooms.  It became too much to take in.  In terms of statistics we were given a number and one tried to wonder what the number meant. These people were going about their normal Saturday afternoon tasks.  It was almost banal, people going shopping.  Then the horrific human tragedy began to unfold and to hit home for a second time.  There was the response of the relatives, and it began to hit home again.  There were the funerals.  It never really achieved finality.  The impact it has left on all of us seems to have just increased.  Regrettable as it is to say, those bombers managed to scar forever the image of Irish democracy.  It is our duty and responsibility to pick up the pieces and to move on from there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to make the connected point that these people set out to bomb their way into a united Ireland.  They had one significant victory because we did see a united people at the end of it.  We saw Protestant, Catholic, republican, Unionist, Nationalist, culturally British, culturally Irish, politically British, politically Irish all united in horror, in revulsion and in rejection of the violence which has been visited on us without a mandate from anybody.  As one commentator said, when Unionist and Nationalist tears ran together there was no difference.  We were united in our <Col N="849" /> horror and rejection of what had been done and in our absolute certainty that this was not the way forward.</P>
    <P>It is important to thank all the public representatives, the Taoiseach, the Government, the heads of the political parties and representatives North and South for the tremendously dignified way in which they responded to an appalling tragedy and the way it has been sensitively dealt with, if the word &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; can live with the kind of violence we have seen.  Inasmuch as there was a way to respond sensitively, that was done. It certainly made one feel this country knew where it was going on the issue, and that is something that extended to Government and Opposition parties, Independents and others.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Omagh, Buncranna, and Ballymoney pupils, to the hospitalised and the injured, to families who are scarred and scarred forever and to the communities in those places, that we on the Independent benches offer our sincere sympathy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the Taoiseach to the House and applaud his efforts since he became Taoiseach in seeking to achieve peace on this island.  It is now 18 to 19 days since the horrific attack in Omagh.  The carnage unleashed that day by a small group of people was not only an attack on innocent people but an attack on democracy.  The human tragedy resulting from the bombing of Omagh has been alluded to this morning in this House and yesterday in Dáil Éireann.  The pain, the anguish, the grief of the victims of that bombing cannot be ameliorated by words or speeches.  This pain and grief will stay with the victims for the rest of their days. However, I hope the victims of Omagh can take some solace from the genuine sympathy expressed by all Members of the Oireachtas over these two days.  Likewise I offer our sympathy to the family of the three Quinn children who were also tragically killed.  It is an appropriate time for us to remember the other atrocities and other victims over the past 30 years, not forgetting our former colleague, Gordon Wilson, who was a survivor of one such terrible atrocity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The slaughter at Omagh also necessitates a response, and part of that response comes in the form of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill that will be discussed in this House later today.  As a public representative with a record of involvement in civil liberties and in campaigning for victims of miscarriage of justice, I do not relish the passage of legislation of this nature.  Nevertheless, strong and effective action must be taken against the killers who detonated the bomb at Omagh and my party has indicated that we support the action proposed by the Government.  However, the proposed legislation and the resultant security clampdown by the Garda Síochána are not the only responses needed at this critical time.  We also need a political response.  This response must underpin that progress on this island over the past four years.  It <Col N="850" /> must take its lead from the popular revulsion of violence expressed by the people of Ireland over the past fortnight.  It must build on this public feeling and ensure that the emerging political structures in Northern Ireland remain at centre stage in the coming weeks and months and that the twisted agenda of fanatical dissidents does not become the momentum that drives the political agenda.</P>
    <P>In that context I welcome the statement made by Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, on Tuesday last.  It is a welcome development that should assist the political process currently underway. The timing of the statement is crucial and while I and others would prefer a more forthright use of language, this is not the time to become involved in a squabble over semantics.  I also warmly welcome that following on from the Sinn Féin statement, the First Minister designate has arranged a meeting for all party leaders.  This emergence of real and substantial dialogue is to be warmly welcomed as it is so critical to building a just and lasting settlement between the peoples of this island.  I also welcome the decision by Sinn Féin to appoint Martin McGuinness to the decommissioning body.  It is a significant step forward.</P>
    <P>The intention of those who bombed Omagh was to destroy the peace process.  In doing so they showed their utter rejection of democracy.  On 22 May last the people of this island, on both sides of the Border, expressed their democratic support for the British-Irish Agreement.  If anything, the carnage perpetrated at Omagh has strengthened the resolve of the ordinary people of this island to ensure that the potential of the British-Irish Agreement is realised.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the violence of the Real IRA is utterly senseless.  They adhere to views and analysis that have no currency among the electorate. They reside in an historical cul-de-sac utterly removed from the real experience of the public. They have no mandate, no support and no justification for their campaign of murder.  After the horror perpetrated on 15 August they must recognise the total revulsion with which they are held in this country and call a complete and total end to their campaign of terror.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of Omagh is the senseless destruction of so many innocent lives, mainly of women and children.  The lesson of Omagh is that it must never happen again.  Terrorism and the use of violence must never undermine the democratic will of the people.  It is our duty as politicians to ensure that this never happens.  After Omagh we must all redouble our efforts to fight against the men of violence and to ensure that a new future for all the people of this island emerges from the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Yet again the Members of Seanad Éireann have assembled dumbfounded and sorrowful because of a mindless terrorist atrocity which swept away innocent lives and happiness. Many times over the past 30 years the House has struggled to find words to express our sorrow at <Col N="851" /> the loss of life and sympathy for those injured and bereaved and to show our undiminished support for peace and democracy.  Over the years we have been consistent in our condemnation of the evil people responsible for so much death and destruction.  The catalogue is grim &mdash; Teebane, Enniskillen, Loughinisland, Greysteele, the Shankill, Warrington and recently the children in Ballymoney. There have been so many over the years that we almost begin to forget some of them.</P>
      <P>More recently, as the flame of peace began to flicker and burn more brightly, we came to hope that each atrocity would be the last.  Our hope became stronger and more confident as we saw the signing of the British-Irish Agreement on Good Friday and when the people of the island gave it such overwhelming support in the ballot box.  However, the hope was cruelly extinguished at 3.10 p.m. on 15 August 1998.</P>
      <P>We struggle for words today which can bring some comfort to the families of the 28 dead, the many injured and their families and the community of Omagh.  We struggle too for words which can adequately convey our utter rejection of mindless and diabolical violence as a means of perverted political ends.  We have also assembled to do our duty.  Our duty is to the families of the dead and wounded in Omagh, Buncrana and Spain.  Our duty is to do everything in our power to ensure, once and for all, the bombs and bullets fall permanently silent and that those who seek to destroy peace are crushed.  Our duty extends to letting the self-styled murderous Real IRA which planted the Omagh bomb know that there will be no hiding place and that the full force and power of the law will be unleashed upon it.  The Taoiseach underlined this duty forcefully.</P>
      <P>Later today we will be asked to enact the toughest anti-terrorist legislation in decades. With many others in the House, I will vote for the law, not because I am unaware of its implications for civil liberties but because it is right and necessary.  It was said in the Dáil yesterday that the Bill might infringe on fundamental rights. That may be the case but there is a more fundamental right, the right of each citizen to life and a future.  It is in that context that it is correct to enact the legislation.</P>
      <P>The democratic will of the people has been overwhelmingly expressed through the ballot box and it must be vindicated.  The State must resist and reject fascism.  True republicanism must be proclaimed and not diminished or debased.  The people are the sole source of authority and they have spoken overwhelmingly and forcefully.</P>

    <P>We assemble to remember in pain and sorrow those who died but determined to ensure their memory is vindicated and that, in true Christian spirit, out of great suffering can spring redemption. Only then will their loss be a little more bearable and in the carnage we will have rediscovered our hope.  In that never to be forgotten day in Omagh Catholic, Protestant and dissenter <Col N="852" /> were united in death.  It is up to the living to unite in building an enduring peace on this island so that there can be no more atrocities.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>This House meets, as the Dáil did yesterday, in the shadow of the Omagh atrocity.  People throughout this island are only now beginning the long process of coming to terms with the tragedy which Omagh represented. That tragedy will live for the rest of their lives with the families of those who died, the surviving victims and the communities from which they came in Ireland, North and South, and in Spain.  Omagh has left no one on this island untouched.  I hope the revulsion which we all feel in its aftermath will not be allowed to dim and that it will mean an end to such violence for good.</P>
      <P>The people who perpetrated the Omagh atrocity are a tiny and unrepresentative minority who attracted minimal support for their political position on the British-Irish Agreement in the referendums, North and South, in May.  They have therefore sought to destroy the British-Irish Agreement through terror both in the attack they launched in Omagh and in earlier attacks.  We, as public representatives, must not only remain faithful to the mandate we received in those referendums but renew our commitment to the Agreement.  Our response to Omagh must be implementation of the Agreement in full because it is implementation of the Agreement which offers the prospect of the very thing they seek to destroy &mdash; the possibility of a new beginning and a peaceful future based on the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect.</P>
      <P>Both Governments remain committed to that objective and have made that a central part of our response to the Omagh tragedy.  We will continue to give it the highest priority and I welcome the progress that has been made in recent days in that respect.  It is important now more than ever that the momentum produced by the signing of the Agreement, and its endorsement in the referendums in May, is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The events in Omagh demand a response at other levels as well.  This Bill is part of that wider response and is measured, balanced and proportionate to the threat posed by the activities of groups, such as the so-called Real IRA, opposed to the Agreement.  The measures it contains are ones which have been identified as offering potential in usefully supplementing the existing provisions of the Offences Against the State Acts. The Government is satisfied by the advice available to it that these measures will provide a focused response which will have particular relevance <Col N="853" /> in the context of the activities of groups such as the so-called Real IRA.  The passage of this legislation will therefore be an important step in strengthening the powers available to the Garda for the purpose of countering such groups and those who provide them with support.</P>
    <P>Those measures are directed to four essential purposes.  First, the Bill makes changes to the rules of evidence which currently apply in relation to both the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and more generally for the purpose of other offences under the Offences Against the State Acts and scheduled offences under those Acts.  Second, the Bill will create certain new substantive offences of particular relevance to the activities of unlawful organisations and those who provide support for them.  Third, the Bill will strengthen the hands of the courts in respect of those who provide support to such groups or engage in offences on their behalf. Fourth, the Bill will extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
    <P>A number of changes to the Bill were made yesterday arising from the debate in the Dáil.  At this stage I draw the attention of the House to the following matters.  Section 2, which deals with inferences that may be drawn in certain circumstances in relation to a charge of membership of an unlawful organisation, has been amended to limit the application of the section to the failure to answer questions or to furnishing false or misleading answers to any question material to an investigation of an offence during questioning in relation to that offence before charge.  The definition of the expression &ldquo;serious offence&rdquo; which has particular application to section 9, the offence of withholding information, has been amended to exclude from its scope offences of a sexual nature for reasons which I will explain to the House shortly.  Section 10, which provides for an extended period of detention under section 30, has been amended to provide that, when an application is being made to a District Court judge to permit the further detention of a person not exceeding 24 hours, the person who is the subject of that application will be produced before the judge concerned and the judge shall hear any submissions made and consider any evidence adduced by or on behalf of that person.  Section 14 has been amended to make it clear on the face of the Bill that that provision does not and is not intended to affect or limit any functions or powers of Government or the Director of Public Prosecutions under the 1939 Act in relation to scheduled offences.  Section 18 has been amended in three important respects: to bring forward the date on which certain sections of the Bill will lapse to 30 June 2000 unless continued in force by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas; to provide that any resolution which may be made continuing such sections in force will specify the period for which the section is being continued in operation and, finally, requiring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to <Col N="854" /> prepare a report on the operation of any section which it is intended to continue and lay it before both Houses in advance of moving any such resolution.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes three changes in regard to evidentiary matters and the principal changes in this regard are contained in sections 2 to 5. Section 2 has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation and is one of the key provisions of the Bill.  Its effect will be to provide that where, in any proceedings against a person in relation to that charge, evidence is given that the accused failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence while being questioned in relation to that offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper.</P>
    <P>The section goes on to provide that references to any question material to the investigation of the offence includes any references to any question requesting the accused to give a full account of his or her movements, actions, activities or associations during any specified period.  The section also provides that any such inference may be treated as or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any other evidence relating to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>The section contains two important safeguards. It provides that the section itself will not have effect unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of a failure or of a false or misleading answer might be and provides that a person shall not be convicted solely on an inference drawn from a failure to answer a question or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply.  The section will also only have effect in relation to the failure to answer a question or the furnishing of a false or misleading response in reply to a question after the coming into effect of the Act and only in relation to questioning in advance of charge as a result of an amendment I moved to the Bill in the Dáil yesterday.</P>
    <P>Two related changes to the Offences Against the State Acts are being made by sections 4 and 13.  Section 4 will amend section 3 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, to align the definition of conduct with the expression used in section 2, that is, conduct is being defined to include movements, actions, activities or associations in addition to the failure to deny such a report.  A further related change is being made by section 13 which provides that section 52 of the 1939 Act which provides for an offence of failing to give specified information to the Garda will not have effect unless immediately before a demand for information is made of a person under that section, the person is informed in ordinary language of the fact the demand is being made under that section and what the consequences are of failing to give an answer or furnishing information which is false or misleading.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="855" /> Section 3 of the Bill which makes the second important change in the area of evidence also has specific reference to the offence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  It provides that in proceedings for such an offence the accused shall not, without leave of the court, call any other person to give evidence on his or her behalf unless notice has been given of his or her intention to do so.  The procedures to be followed in this regard are set out in subsections (2) to (7) of the section which are closely modelled on the existing provisions of our criminal law in relation to the requirements to give notice of an alibi an accused intends to rely on for the purpose of his or her trial.  The section also provides that the requirement in relation to the giving of notice will not apply to a witness whose evidence is solely in relation to the matter of sentence.</P>
    <P>The third change in the area of evidence is being made by section 5.  This section is not restricted to the offence of membership but will, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more, have application to any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, scheduled offences for the purpose of the 1939 Act and offences arising out of the same set of facts as an offence under the Acts or a scheduled offence.  The effect of this section, which is closely based on a similar provision in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, will be to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that there is not and could not be in the changes which we are proposing any interference with the court's responsibility under our criminal law to convict an accused only where it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt of the offence charged.</P>
    <P>The Bill also creates certain new substantive offences.  Section 6 establishes the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  That offence will attract a penalty of up to life imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Section 7 will make it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession is for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences.  The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the materials were not in the person's possession for such purposes.  This offence will attract a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 8 will make it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members <Col N="856" /> of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences.  The section also provides that it will be a defence to prove that the information in question was not being collected, etc.  for the purpose of being used in the commission of a serious offence.  The offence of unlawful collection of information will attract a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.  A serious offence is defined for the purpose of the section as an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or more involving loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss or damage to property or a serious risk of any such loss, injury, imprisonment or damage and includes an act or omission done or made outside the State which would be such an offence if done within the State.  An amendment to the definition of serious offence which I moved yesterday arose in the context of this provision and was in response to concerns which had been expressed that it could, in the context of the following section dealing with the withholding of information, inadvertently lead to the inclusion of mandatory reporting in sex abuse cases.  The amendment therefore excluded from its scope sexual offences.  It would not be appropriate to deal with the complex issue of mandatory reporting in an Offences Against the State Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will make it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes might be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution, or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable cause to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána.  A serious offence is defined for this purpose in the same terms as for section 8.  The penalty which will attach to the offence of withholding information is a fine or imprisonment for up to five years or both.</P>
    <P>Section 12 will make it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.  This offence will attract a penalty of a fine or imprisonment for up to ten years or both.</P>
    <P>These are offences of a type which are in the main likely to be committed by members of unlawful organisations arising from the activities of such groups.  They are, therefore, targeted at specific activities.  The effect of section 14 will be to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act.  That means that persons suspected of committing such offences will be liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act and may be charged before the Special Criminal Court in respect of such offences on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions. The effect of the amendment to the Schedule to the Bail Act, 1997, made by section 16 will be to enable these offences to be regarded <Col N="857" /> as serious offences for the purposes of that Act when bail applications are considered.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also intended to strengthen the powers of the courts in respect of those who provide support to the activities of unlawful organisations or engage in offences on their behalf.  It contains two measures to this end.  First is the provision in section 15 which specifies that the court may impose unlimited fines in relation to the four principal offences dealing with possession of firearms and explosives.  Second is the provision in section 17 to amend section 61 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with the forfeiture of property used for the purpose of committing or facilitating the commission of an offence, or intended to be used for that purpose, in circumstances where a person has been convicted of an offence.  The effect of the change being made by section 17 is to provide that, in the case of persons convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, a court will be required to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.</P>
    <P>The fourth essential purpose of the Bill is to extend the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act &mdash; 48 hours at present &mdash; in two separate circumstances.  First, section 10 will allow a District Court judge to authorise the detention of a person for a further period not exceeding 24 hours on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, provided that the district judge is satisfied that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.  This section was amended in the Dáil yesterday to provide that, when an application is made to a District Court judge to permit further detention of a person, the person who is the subject of that application will be produced before the judge concerned and that the judge will hear any submissions made and consider any evidence adduced by or on behalf of that person.</P>
    <P>Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained but released without charge for a further period, which again is not to exceed 24 hours, in circumstances where the district judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which they wish to question the suspect.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a review mechanism.  Section 18 provides that the provisions of the Bill, other than sections 1, 13, 15, 16, 18 and 19, will cease to be in operation on 30 June 2000 unless continued in force by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, and that any resolution made continuing such sections in force will specify the <Col N="858" /> period for which the section is being continued in operation.  It also requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to prepare a report on the operation of any section which it is intended to continue and to lay it before both Houses in advance of moving any such resolution. In this regard, the British-Irish Agreement includes a commitment on the part of the Government, which it will be honouring, to carry out a wide ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts generally.  I will be establishing such a review mechanism shortly by the establishment of a special committee under independent chairmanship and with the participation of both Governments and outside experts.</P>
    <P>The remaining sections of the Bill are in standard form and contain the necessary definitions in section 1 and provision for the Bill's Short Title, construction and collective citation in section 19.  It would be wrong to pretend that any legislation or security measure can provide a cast iron guarantee that terrorist activity will cease or that terrorist attempts will not succeed.  There are no simple solutions to the problem of terrorism &mdash; if there were they would have been tried and would have succeeded many years ago.  Therefore, we will continue to depend heavily on the professionalism of the Garda Síochána which has had considerable success in countering the activities of the Real IRA and preventing attacks in Northern Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the passage of this Bill will strengthen our laws for the purpose of tackling groups, such as the Real IRA, who have yet to declare a complete ending of their campaigns of violence.  The Bill is only one element of a package of measures on the security and legislative fronts designed to counter the activities of those who engage in violence and the combined effect of the enactment of this Bill and other measures will significantly enhance the capacity of the State to tackle such groups.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the Omagh atrocity the decision by the Real IRA to suspend armed operations while it engages in internal consultations is of little comfort to its victims.  A suspension of such actions is not enough.  Now is the time for those groups which have yet to declare a definitive ceasefire to renounce such violence and to prove in word and deed that they mean what they say.  The Government has made clear that it will not allow any group to destabilise the British-Irish Agreement or subvert the will of the Irish people.  The Government will closely monitor the efficacy of these measures and will not hesitate to take further action should these prove necessary to curb their activities.</P>
    <P>Much depends on the decisions taken by those groups which have not yet renounced violence. Ultimately, only they can create the conditions whereby it will be possible to dispense with many of the powers which this Bill and the Offences Against the State Acts more generally provide.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister and I am delighted that the Taoiseach came into the House to contribute to the short debate and the minute's silence on the awful tragedy in Omagh.  This was probably the most heinous of all the shocking and awful outrages which have taken place in Northern Ireland in the past 32 years.  It was a brutally calculated act of mass murder which had one objective &mdash; to wreck the peace process.  The vicious, twisted, warped mentality of those who carried out this bombing is supported by no one but the handful of psychopaths who planned and executed the awful deed.  The Minister stated in the Dáil yesterday and reiterated in the House today that all they have done has been counter-productive. I reiterate that point on behalf of Fine Gael in this House.  Their dreadful deed has united people of every political and religious persuasion in a manner rarely seen before in showing revulsion and condemnation for these unrepresentative, abominable people and their crimes.</P>
      <P>All democrats who hold the preservation of human rights and civil liberties as their central belief detest having to introduce legislation such as this.  Draconian laws are unpleasant.  They smack of sickness and abnormality in the system. In every country where draconian laws have been introduced, often for good reason and without ill-intent, they have led to allegations of abuse, conflict with the courts and, on occasion, proven abuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most Members of both Houses hate having to introduce measures such as these.  That was evident from the contributions in the Dáil.  Many Members gave vent to their frustration at having to react to the tragedy and awfulness of Omagh in this way.  No doubt that frustration and dislike for what must be done will be stated from all sides of this House during the debate on this Bill. If this legislation is what is needed to arrest and convict the perpetrators of this crime, not only those who made and transported the bomb and planted it but those who planned it and motivated those people to plan it, it will be well worth it. One hopes that with similar powers on the Statue Book in Northern Ireland and in Britain there will be no safe haven, in the physical or legal sense, for these killers.  We hope those people, who are well known to the Garda and the RUC and identified in everything but name by some sections of the media, will be arrested, given a fair trial with the rest of their accomplices and, if found guilty, put away for a long time &mdash; if not for the rest of their natural lives &mdash; if they show no repentance.  In the light of the almost unimaginable heartbreak and devastation of the relatives of those murdered and the pain and suffering of those maimed and injured, one could get carried away by the need to punish these people <Col N="860" /> for what they have done but we must be restrained.</P>
    <P>I am glad that in neither jurisdiction is the death penalty an option.  However heinous the crime involving the taking of a life or lives, we do not have the right to judicially take the life of the perpetrator or perpetrators, however tempting that might be at times.  We hope these evil perpetrators will be judged and sentenced under law in our courts or in the courts of Northern Ireland. Let them remember that one day they will face another judgment.  One is reminded, without further comment, of what was said by a cleric some time in the 19th century about hell not being half hot enough or eternity not being half long enough for them to atone for their crimes.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not without its flaws.  Because of its potential to infringe on civil liberties and human rights it is most regrettable that the Bill is not accompanied by a human rights monitoring group or body.  By this I mean an independent group or body established under law to oversee the protection of human rights as a first principle in the operation of legislation but especially in this kind of draconian legislation.  In Northern Ireland there is the standing advisory committee on human rights monitoring group.  This has been established there for a long time.  Surely now is the time to introduce it here.</P>
    <P>There is an air of changing the criminal law by stealth.  A major provision of this Bill is the curtailment of the right to silence for people arrested under the Offences Against the State Act.  I absolutely support that because of the circumstances and the way in which this right has been abused by the evil members of illegal organisations. I understand the Minister is setting up a working group to examine the right to silence in all criminal cases.  The name of Mr. Eamon Leahy, who will not be unknown to the Minister, has been mentioned as the chairman of such a working group.  When replying perhaps the Minister will comment on what else he has in mind regarding the attenuation of the right to silence in other cases.</P>
    <P>Section 10 deals with extending the periods of detention under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  This is a difficult area.  I agree there may be cases where periods of detention as long as seven days could be justified but there needs to be greater definition of what a fair period of detention is, the frequency of required judicial interventions in periods of detention, etc.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, allow for the detention of up to seven days, in certain cases, of people arrested or being investigated for serious crimes.  I have no difficulty in principle about it being applied here.  I am glad the Minister stated on one of the amendments he is introducing that not alone must the investigating garda go to the district justice to show good reason detention should be extended but the accused person will also be brought before the judge.  This means the accused, or somebody acting on their <Col N="861" /> behalf, will have the right to make submissions before the judge in their defence.  This safeguard was badly needed and I am glad the Minister has included it.</P>
    <P>Extended detentions are necessary in certain difficult investigations.  However, the issues of civil liberties and human rights, which are relevant in this context, have not been properly addressed.  I urge the Minister to be very careful in introducing further periods of detention in dealing with crimes of this kind, heinous as they are, and in other cases.</P>
    <P>In the context of such investigations I also urge the Minister to set a deadline for the installation of video and audio recording equipment in investigation centres.  Such facilities exist in very few Garda stations.  I have no doubt a number of Garda stations will be identified as suitable for carrying out investigations, questioning, etc.  It is essential that video and audio recording equipment is installed in all such places and that all investigations are carried out with the use of video and audio recording.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the forfeiture of property which, on the face of it, is very desirable and is just desserts for those who use their home, farm or warehouse to store arms or explosives or to provide facilities for training, etc.  I note the Minister was put on the defensive when discussing this issue in an interview on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last Monday.  It is a very vague area.  Section 17 states: &ldquo;the court shall, subject to subsection (5) of this section, make the forfeiture order, unless, having regard to the matters mentioned in subsection (2) of this section and to the nature and degree of seriousness of the offence of which the person has been convicted, it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made the order&rdquo;. One cannot escape the fact that the right to own and possess property is inviolable under the Constitution. The right is well enshrined in the Constitution and is an extension of provisions in English common law which are based on the idea that a man's house is his castle.</P>
    <P>I see all kinds of problems relating to the constitutional right to property when these cases reach the courts.  This is particularly so in the context of family involvement in property &mdash; we know what the Constitution says about the position of the family.  My conclusion is that there will be very few confiscations.  Applications by the State to confiscate property because of clear evidence that it was used in the storage of arms or explosives or to facilitate illegal and subversive activity will open a very rich area for clever lawyers. The section needs to be rewritten or more closely examined.  I appreciate the difficulties involved, which were clearly evident when the hard questions were put to the Minister in the radio interview and he went on the defensive. The Minister must examine the provision more clearly.</P>
    <P>I welcome President Clinton to this country. He comes to further the peace process.  No American President in this century has involved himself <Col N="862" /> so much in the politics of Ireland and we express our gratitude for what he has done.  He provided a momentum for the peace process, he appointed Senator George Mitchell to facilitate that process, he is back here in the light of the progress which has been made since the signing of the British-Irish Agreement and he will visit Omagh today.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the recent statement by Mr. Gerry Adams.  It is not adequate but, nevertheless, it was very welcome in relation to the fact that the IRA's war may be over.  I welcome the nomination of Mr. Martin McGuinness to the International Body on the Decommissioning of Weapons.  That is most important.  I welcome the fact that Mr. David Trimble will meet with Mr. Adams next week when he meets the leaders of all political parties in Northern Ireland.  These are positive steps forward in the peace process and we hope these steps will lead to a situation where we will never again see an event such as that which occurred in Omagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House, although I regret the reason for his appearance before us today.  I accept, however, the necessity of this legislation.</P>
      <P>We extend our heartfelt sympathy to those bereaved as a result of the outrageous atrocity committed in Omagh and to their relatives and friends.  It was truly the slaughter of the innocents, an evil mindless act of the most extraordinary brutality committed by terrorists with no moral standards who are capable of anything.</P>
      <P>That attempt to subvert the democratic will of the people throughout Ireland must be firmly resisted and crushed.  I agree with the strong words of the Taoiseach which he reiterated in this House today.  These fascist murderers who call themselves the Real IRA are real in one sense only &mdash; they are the real enemies of the people and nothing else.  They represent no one but themselves and must not be allowed to deny the people the peaceful future they desire and for which they so overwhelmingly voted in referenda North and South in a free and fair democratic fashion.</P>
      <P>We are here to address ourselves to this legislation in the wake of that atrocity.  I welcome the Bill because I believe that we have a duty to act decisively in defence of our democracy and no citizens have the right to hold weapons of destruction.  There can be only one Garda Síochána, only one Army and the Oireachtas must be the sole source of legitimate authority in this State.  These terrorists have arrogantly sought to subvert the democratic process by supplanting it with the bomb and the bullet.  They do not recognise the sovereignty of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People everywhere have rightly expressed their revulsion at the terror tactics and they have equally expressed their support for peace and constitutional politics.  Accordingly there must be no hiding place for anyone who continues to espouse violence.  As a society we must be vigilant in defence of our democracy because the perpetrators <Col N="863" /> of the Omagh bombing have possibly only tactically chosen to remain inactive at present and could strike again if the forces of democracy permitted themselves to be distracted and to drop their guard.  Surely there has never been less support for terrorism, never a stronger desire among so many for it all to end and never a stronger view in favour of proper and determined action in pursuit of a firmly established peace.</P>
    <P>Sinn Féin and the Unionists hold keys to further needed improvements.  I believe Gerry Adams and Sinn Féin's declaration in favour of democratic process.  I believe they are sincere in declaring, as our colleague Senator Maurice Hayes wrote yesterday, that the war is, in effect, over.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to encourage them in every way possible further along the democratic path we are so glad they have chosen.  There must not be veiled threats of a return to violence and so-called punishment beatings must cease.  Sinn Féin, as a signatory to the British-Irish Agreement and all it entails, has a duty to assist in the creation of peace its members proclaimed so loudly and to help break and isolate the dissident terrorists responsible for Omagh who remain at large.  We repeatedly hear that this is a tiny group of recalcitrant, misguided renegades.  Sinn Féin has condemned the Omagh bombing and those responsible for it and must now assist in cutting off their oxygen supply.  This legislation will also play a part in that and we fully support it.</P>
    <P>Omagh was surely intended to drive Unionists and Nationalists apart and destroy the prospects for the Northern assembly.  I salute the obvious success of the intensive ongoing diplomacy and negotiations between the British and Irish Governments and the US Administration which presumably facilitated Gerry Adams's statement and Martin McGuinness's acceptance of a position on the International Body on Decommissioning. In spite of his domestic difficulties, we must state our gratitude to President Clinton for his interest and support, the action taken by his Administration and, in particular, the services of Senator George Mitchell without whose dogged determination and enduring patience the British-Irish Agreement would not have been reached. We must now resolve to hold a steady nerve and continually remind ourselves of John Hume's oft expressed view that the island of Ireland must be viewed in terms of its people rather than its territory. That must become the reality.</P>
    <P>I welcome the measures provided for in the Bill, such as the fact that inferences can be drawn from an accused's failure to mention particular facts which would be revealed by any honest and decent citizen without fear, for the direction of any unlawful organisation and the forfeiture of property where someone knowingly conceals weapons of destruction and/or semtex and where the courts feel justified in making such an order. I wish the Minister well with this legislation.  I wish both Governments and the security forces <Col N="864" /> on both sides of the Border every success in their ongoing efforts to bring to justice those responsible for the appalling savagery in Omagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DennisODonovan" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  It would be remiss of me not to express my revulsion at the Omagh bombing.  Any decent citizen would be of the same view.  The people of 1916 and 1798 would certainly abhor what this renegade group, the Real IRA, has done in a deliberate effort to shatter the peace process.  I compliment the Taoiseach, the Government and others who, in the face of devastation, held their heads high, acted with dignity and worked ceaselessly in negotiations with the First Minister, Mr. Trimble, the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and others to ensure the situation did not explode.  Had that not happened, bombings could have occurred in the Republic.  That would have created a total nightmare and could have blown the process completely out of the water.</P>
      <P>The British-Irish Agreement and its endorsement in the referenda brought new hope to Ireland, North and South.  It created an atmosphere of change which can be seen in the approach and attitude of the British Government to Ireland and in the Irish Government itself.  For 30 years, violence, bombing, bloodshed and bullets did not achieve anything and peace is now being given a chance.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote some poetry published in Tom McCaughren's book.  The author is a 13 year old boy from Schull and he won an award for it last year.  The name of the poem is &ldquo;At the beginning&rdquo; and it reads: &ldquo;At the beginning there were no bombs, no guns, no drugs, let's begin again&rdquo;.  It is a very simple poem and it reminded me that there is hope of a new beginning for all of us, the Government and all constitutional politicians, North and South, including the reformed Sinn Féin.  I welcome the statement made by Gerry Adams and the appointment of Martin McGuinness to the decommissioning body.</P>
      <P>The Omagh bombing and the devastation it caused has resulted in uniting all the people on this island.  Never before has there been such a sincere and deep rooted feeling that we want to get rid of the bomb and the bullet and look at constitutional hopes and probabilities for the future of this island.  Yesterday, I was confused by the statements made in the Dáil by Ministers and Deputies, particularly those from the Labour Party and Green Party.  On the one hand they voted against parts of this Bill because they wanted to protect civil liberties.  On the other hand they were trenchant in their demands for the wiping out of the renegade wing of the IRA. Those Members are trying to have it both ways. They should realise this legislation was not introduced willy nilly by this Government.  At least 99 per cent of the people on this island wanted something to be done before terrorism got out of control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the Garda Síochána has intercepted six bombs and I compliment them on that.  A <Col N="865" /> bomb intercepted at Dún Laoghaire port could have caused huge devastation had it reached England or wherever it was to be detonated.  The Government was faced with a dilemma.  The feeling in west Cork and elsewhere is that they had to do something draconian or else introduce internment.  I am glad internment is not an option at this stage.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes very draconian measures but if we had a Utopian society we would not need them.  It is on the basis of great research, thought and soul searching that the Government decided to confront the men of violence, who number about 100.  They are a renegade element who have no respect for this or any other Government, no respect for Protestant or Catholic views or for any political or constitutional institution. As mentioned in the statements by the Taoiseach and the Minister, a clear message must be sent to these people that they cannot continue with this approach.  They cannot defy the will of the people who voted last May and they cannot defy the will of the British and Irish Governments who are working in tandem towards a peaceful solution.</P>
    <P>Since the Omagh bombing the Government has been working day and night in an effort to put the peace process back on track.  After much consultation and advice it has introduced legislation to amend the Offences Against the State Acts.  In 1972, the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, introduced a clause whereby on the evidence of a Chief Superintendent, the Special Criminal Court could convict a person of being a member of the IRA.  However, in a subsequent test case this proved inoperable and the Supreme Court decided corroborative evidence was necessary.</P>
    <P>There is one important and necessary change in the Bill.  The courts can now draw an inference if a suspect gives misleading information or refuses to speak.  This could tilt the balance in favour of getting a conviction where the courts and authorities are satisfied the inference is proper and correct.</P>
    <P>Normally, in relation to any serious criminal offence, when the book of evidence is presented, the judge advises the defendant to make it known to the court and the Garda if he or she has an alibi.  This legislation goes further.  If, after three days questioning, a suspect remains silent, does not provide necessary information, or gives misleading information, he may not rely on an alibi at any subsequent trial.  This is an important change.</P>
    <P>This legislation also provides that the names of witnesses should be made known.  If a suspect is relying on the testimony of witnesses, he should give their names when questioned.  The legislation is also tightened where any person who is likely to commit another offence while charged will not be released on bail.  The court has discretion in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is also an increase in the maximum detention period from 48 to 72 hours.  Existing legislation provides for a maximum detention period of 48 hours while the Criminal Justice <Col N="866" /> (Drug Trafficking) Act provides for a maximum detention period of seven days.  The Criminal Justice Act provides for a maximum detention period of 20 hours.  In this legislation because of the serious nature of the offences and the criminal element we are dealing with, an extension of 24 hours is welcome, to allow the authorities to continue questioning a suspect.  If that suspect is released after 72 hours, he may be re-arrested. This is an important and appropriate amendment given the nature of the crimes we are trying to stamp out.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to create five new offences. The first relates to directing an unlawful organisation. A quartermaster or senior official of a renegade unlawful organisation can be sentenced to life imprisonment on conviction.  The provision creates a clear distinction between the ordinary members of such organisations and those in authority who might direct operations from places such as Galway, Dublin, Belfast or London.  The latter call the shots and have the power to direct that a bomb be placed in a certain town.  Under this Bill they face life imprisonment on conviction. The previous maximum sentence was five years which is clearly inadequate in current circumstances.</P>
    <P>Any person who collects parts or components for making and detonating bombs and is caught in possession of such items faces a maximum of ten years imprisonment on conviction.  The Bill also provides that somebody who trains or instructs recruits to republican groups on the use of firearms and explosives will face a maximum prison term of ten years.  Another offence dealt with in the Bill relates to those who collate information, for example, on RUC officers, senior gardaí and so forth.  If they are caught in possession of such information or in the process of collecting it, they face a penalty of five years imprisonment.  The Bill also provides for the offence of withholding information.  Where it is obvious that a person has information and refuses to come forward with it or knowingly withholds it, he or she can be sentenced to five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It was argued at length during yesterday's Dáil debate on the Bill that the burden of proof is being changed.  However, that is not my interpretation. The rules of evidence are being changed to confer a greater degree of flexibility on the courts.  That is reasonable in this context.  I would prefer not to have to discuss this type of legislation, however, the attitude of a small group of men and women who have shown by their actions that they have no respect for the institutions of this State and those of our nearest neighbour &mdash; indeed, they have shown disrespect for the American President who is currently in this country &mdash; means that stringent and tough measures must be taken.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out that only two organisations are proscribed here, &ldquo;Óglaigh na hÉireann&rdquo; as they call themselves and the INLA. Worries were expressed as to whether that <Col N="867" /> description would apply to the Real IRA and other renegade groups.  It will apply to all such groups, regardless of what adjective they use with the letters IRA to describe themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill with a degree of reticence. It is a necessary measure.  The Government had no choice but to act swiftly.  A number of people have asked why this legislation was not passed three or four months ago, which might have prevented what happened in Omagh.  Would that have been an appropriate welcome to the British-Irish Agreement?  To have introduced draconian legislation immediately after the referendums when we were embarking on a peace process would have sent out all the wrong messages.  The British-Irish Agreement has the support of almost all the loyalist groups, Sinn Féin and most of the republican groups.  Gerry Adams has made a welcome statement.  There was a massive yes vote in the referendums and we cannot allow a small group of people to ignore the wishes of the Government and people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the Bill have been criticised but I am confident that, in the bitter shame of the aftermath of the Omagh bombing, 95 per cent of the people would give their broad support to it. The only alternative available to the Government was the introduction of internment and I am glad that option was not taken.  When internment was last introduced on this island heroes were created and a new era of IRA activity followed.  The death of one or two prisoners on hunger strike could lead to a similar renewal.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House.  The Government has been forced to introduce this measure by the atrocity carried out by the Real IRA in Omagh.  The decision to introduce this Bill was not taken lightly but it is the only way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I will share my time with Senator Ryan.  I welcome the Minister, I congratulate the Government and I reflect on the fact that we rarely see unanimity among Senators and Deputies.  It is symptomatic of the seriousness with which this matter is taken that we do not score points off each other when we differ on various parts of this Bill and on the action being taken by the Government.  There has been lack of acrimony and political unity about the need to respond to this awful tragedy.  We may disagree on the detail and on the measures which need to be taken but we all move in the same direction.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to those who oppose this Bill on grounds of civil liberties.  It is not easy in the atmosphere of the aftermath of this bomb to take the unpopular but considered and long-term view that this Bill will be bad for civil liberties in the long run and that it is a knee-jerk reaction to an appalling tragedy which makes bad law.  I do not share that view but those who hold it do so courageously in the face of some public unpopularity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I prefer to look without emotion at the civil <Col N="868" /> liberties of those who are dead or bereaved. There is no prevention because the tragedy has occurred but we can move to try and prevent it from happening in future.  Civil liberties are important; they are the bedrock on which democracy is founded, but there are times when civil liberties must be infringed.  Nobody has an absolute right to them.  There is no doubt that this Bill dramatically and drastically infringes civil liberties. When the Government says the Bill is draconian it is correct.  These measures are draconian but one has to pay a price if a small group is prepared to murder other citizens in pursuit of a goal or methods which nobody else shares.</P>
    <P>Whereas I welcome the thrust of this Bill, it would have been more honest, appropriate and certainly more effective if the Government had introduced internment.  In terms of the civil libertarian ethos which some are championing, I do not see a great deal of difference between infringing civil liberties in the form we have here and in interning people.  However, it could have been a great deal more effective if we had interned people or if we were to do so.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Donovan is entitled to his perfectly legitimate point of view that internment would not work, but he drew a parallel with the last occasion on which it was introduced.  In this case there is no parallel with the last time.  The conditions were never more ideal here for internment than they are now because there is a small group of pathological killers prepared to do anything to impose their will.  They are not only pathological killers, they are also to a great extent identifiable people.  From the magnificent work done by the Garda Síochána in preventing so many of these tragedies from happening before, we know that their intelligence within the group known as the Real IRA was superb.  I cannot remember the numbers but the Minister will know.  I think that nine, ten or maybe more bomb attacks were prevented.  It is absolutely certain that the Garda, with the help of the RUC, the British authorities and others, could have rounded up a large number of these people already, on the Minister's signature.  It is fair enough to ask whether this would have prevented the Omagh bombing, but I do not know.</P>
    <P>I heard a Minister say &mdash; I will not name him because I do not wish to create political embarrassment &mdash; in an interview that such an occasion as the Omagh bombing was inevitable, and he was right.  However, it is legitimate to ask whether atrocities would have been prevented had internment been introduced earlier, after the British-Irish Agreement.  I do not know the answer to that question but I suspect that fewer atrocities would have been attempted and that a large number of the people behind such atrocities would have been locked up.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>There are deep set political as well as practical objections to internment.  In its foolishness, the British Government took internment off the Statute Book, which made it very difficult to introduce here when people would presumably have <Col N="869" /> been fleeing from this side of the Border to the other, rather than the other way round as happened in the past.  The conditions for introducing internment were never better.  There is no public support for these people and there would have been no reaction in terms of a flood of public support for them.  The Real IRA are now pariahs within Irish society who could have been and should have been picked up and locked up on an earlier occasion.</P>
    <P>I have minor reservations about some of the clauses in this Bill, but I also have doubts about the practical effect of it.  This Bill must be signed by midnight tonight.  The difference between this Bill being signed by midnight and the introduction of internment is that every member of every paramilitary organisation knows that he or she is in danger of being picked up in the morning.  We have given the most amazing warning to them and none of them will be sleeping in or anywhere near their homes tonight because they will know that this Bill comes into law then.  That is a practical difficulty which internment would have resolved and which might have saved lives.</P>
    <P>However, I congratulate the Government on the specific offences which it has created.  I congratulate it on its evident determination to fight this group and the complete lack of ambivalence in regard to it.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say a few words about the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin.  The words of Deputy John Bruton in the past few days have been particularly courageous. They have not been words which would be considered helpful or which would have gained the unanimous support of people in this House, but it is appropriate that the Provisional IRA should be required to make unambivalent statements in these circumstances. There are difficulties and there is a strategy to suck them along which may or may not work. However, as Deputy John Bruton said, words are very important and it is not acceptable that people should sit on the Executive or in Government if there is a private army at their beck and call, and that will be the reality.  Whereas words have been used by their representatives or people close to them &mdash; I am thinking particularly of Mr. Adams &mdash; the Provisional IRA-Sinn Féin have given themselves an escape clause and we need more from them than we have got.  We cannot go forward in the hope that some people who are sitting on the Executive will not call in the threat of that private army during the new government of Northern Ireland.  That will always exist unless there is an unambivalent statement from the Provisional IRA and from its associates in Sinn Féin which can reassure us that they are unambiguously committed democrats forever.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I congratulate the Minister on his intent, energy and determination to counter terrorism.  It is a pity that internment was not introduced because it would have been more effective.  It might have prevented the Omagh <Col N="870" /> bombing and it might have the effect of preventing atrocities to come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly difficult issue for me which could well cost me considerable political support so I will choose my words carefully. There is no doubt that a firm and unambiguous response to the Omagh atrocity by the people and their political leadership was needed.  There was also a firm and unambiguous determination by all not to exchange blame for the offence at political level.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the First Minister of Northern Ireland for the generous gesture of visiting Buncrana, the symbolism of which was appreciated by all.  Many other fine gestures were made but that one deserves particular recognition.</P>
      <P>That this legislation has produced clarification of the law is very welcome.  I am astonished that until now it was not an offence in this State to give direction to an illegal organisation.  It seems to be a huge gap in the ordinary criminal law not to have such an offence.  Though such activity has been an offence for the last ten years in Northern Ireland, the law, as far as I am aware, has been used only once.  Similarly, a properly drafted section of the criminal law which made it a serious offence to train people in the use of weapons or explosives is not what I would classify as repressive legislation.  It is a necessary and appropriate part of criminal law, not just emergency legislation.  It should be an offence to train people in the use of weapons and explosives for illegal purposes, providing that is what the section means.  Unfortunately, apart from many other things that are wrong with this Bill, the sections are incredibly sloppily drafted and ambiguous and notwithstanding successive Government denials, in at least two sections it is the responsibility of the defendant to prove his or her innocence.</P>
      <P>I find objectionable the notion that, once this legislation is enacted, I could legitimately be arrested by a member of the Garda on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation because of my associations.  It is bad enough that under the 1972 legislation my conduct could have been used to infer guilt.  The phrasing now used is that &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; is described as &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused person&rdquo;.  I have had associations with people whom the Garda are convinced were members of illegal organisations.  I have spoken at public meetings about what I believed to be miscarriages of justice and inappropriate application of the law against members of illegal organisations or people who were convicted of such membership.  I am, therefore, quite clearly guilty by association, as are a considerable number of other Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past the Garda and the Department of Justice have had to pay compensation to people improperly arrested under suspicion of membership of the IRA and against whom no charge could be brought.  This sloppy, vague wording <Col N="871" /> means they will never have to do that again and that is obviously the first priority on the wish list of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It is a great pity that under the cloud of Omagh a vague and sloppy wording has been inserted into our legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most offensive part of this Bill is section 8 which deals with information.  I am astonished that the media have not noticed it.  It states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(1) It shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of an unlawful organisation of serious offences generally. . .</P>
    <P>Not that this must be proven.  Will the Minister indicate what sort of information I might have in my possession which would not be likely to be of assistance to an unlawful organisation?  If I possessed an ordnance survey map of the Border region, carried out a study on which Border roads were usable or unusable due to bomb damage or had in my possession, for legitimate reasons, a textbook on electronics, the information these could provide would be likely to be of assistance to an unlawful organisation.  That is the nature of the offence.</P>
    <P>Section 8(2) generously states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her. .</P>
    <P>A defendant must, therefore, prove that such information was not collected for the purposes defined in section 8(1).  Leaving aside Government assurances to the contrary, a person accused of such an offence will be deemed guilty until they prove their innocence.  The same situation applies to section 7.  To my mind these sections are offensive, particularly in light of the fact that they could have been drafted differently.  I invite the Minister to inform the House how he proposes to make the provisions in sections 7 and 8 reasonable under the law as we understand it. These sections state that any information or articles a person might have in their possession could allow them to be detained and imprisoned until the authorities decided to drop the charges against them.  People will be obliged to prove that information in their possession is innocently held, the authorities will not be obliged to prove otherwise.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the offence of training people to use firearms includes training people in the use of crossbows or air guns.  To include this in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill is at least sloppy, if not downright sinister.  The extension of the Bail Act to cover all offences under the Offences Against the State Act means that offences under the former Act which only carry a maximum penalty of three months in prison <Col N="872" /> can now cause people to be detained indefinitely and refused bail if the State gets its way.</P>
    <P>I intend to ask the Minister a number of detailed questions on Committee Stage. However, will he inform me how it is proposed to ensure that this legislation is applied solely to the Real IRA?  It will only take one malicious or incompetent senior member of the Garda Síochána to start arresting members of the Provisional IRA and this will cause the peace process to unravel.  Does the Government intend to give a political directive to the Garda to arrest only certain people, which would be a sinister development, or are we to trust the good judgment of gardaí not to arrest members of the Provisional IRA?  Are we in danger of innocently undermining the peace process by driving Sinn Féin and the Provisional IRA back into the corner out of which they are slowly emerging?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrMauriceHayes" hpid="Dr. M. Hayes Dr. M. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Dr. M. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and Members for permitting me to contribute so early in the debate.  As a representative from the northern part of the country, I join in the expressions of sympathy by the Taoiseach and the party leaders.  As a Member of the House I was proud to note the sincerity, concern and sensitivity with which that sympathy was expressed.  I support the tribute paid by the Leader of the House to the medical services, social services, police, fire service, ambulance service, voluntary organisations and the ordinary people of Omagh who coped with tragedy and disaster in a way few others could have managed and in a way which bonded both communities together.  That should give everyone hope.</P>
      <P>The important thing to remember about the tragedy at Omagh is that we should not lose our sense of shock.  When the media circus has moved on and politicians have stopped visiting the town, we must remember the survivors and never allow our sense of shock to be overcome.  The Omagh bombing showed there was no room for ambiguity or for what John Healy called &ldquo;the sneaking regarders&rdquo;.  There is no halfway house between a democratic society and violence.  Violence has not been and is not ever justified as a means of securing a political objective.  We owe that to the victims and survivors of the Omagh bombing.</P>
      <P>Stewart Parker in his play &ldquo;Pentecost&rdquo; called victims of the Northern troubles &ldquo;predators&rdquo; in the sense that life and potential had been snatched away from them and the rest of society owed them something, to ensure that the survivors could live out their lives for them and could create the type of society in which this could not happen again.  That is the message of Omagh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action taken by the Governments, particularly by the Taoiseach, which I commend, was extremely important in the immediate aftermath of the bomb.  It was particularly important that people underlined the importance of the political process to assure people there was a rule of law which would be upheld and the perpetrators <Col N="873" /> would be pursued and brought to justice.  That did a great deal to prevent a backlash or untoward reaction to the events in Omagh.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and congratulate the Government on it.  There are parts of it with which I find some difficulties and I will ask the Minister to consider them.  It was improved during its passage through the Dáil and I hope it might be possible for it to be further fine tuned. It is important that it strikes at the godfathers, directors and perpetrators, those who make the bombs.  These people have been untouched while unfortunate, very often idealistic, young men and women have been sent out in cars to blow themselves up or get caught and serve many years in jail.  Anything that helps society deal with those people is to be commended.</P>
    <P>The threat to democratic values is no less than that posed to society by drugs and, therefore, it is reasonable that many of the legal instruments that have been found to be useful in dealing with drug barons should be applied in these cases.  I welcome the idea of the confiscation of property in cases where, for instance, arms have been found on property.  The important factor which will emerge from this is that laws will not defeat the terrorists but rather the attitude of people. That is what I meant when I said that the Omagh bombing should not be forgotten.  The shock should not wear off because these people were seen stealing cars, driving them and assembling the bombs.  Until we can pierce that wall of silence and encourage those who saw them that it is their civic duty to help the rest of us to deal with the problem, law on its own will not work.</P>
    <P>However, I support these laws to the extent that they attack the problem.  Governments must weigh up the security of the State on one hand with the rights of individuals on the other.  I have no worries regarding human rights in the sense that all human rights conventions generally allow exception for the security of the State or the maintenance of public order.  Even if there were difficulties that would be enough to protect this legislation.  That is not to say we should not try to make it as damage proof as possible.  This legislation should be focused, proportionate to the threat, time limited and monitored.  I have a great deal of sympathy for the proposal to have a human rights commission to deal with such cases. I was a member of a standing advisory commission on human rights in Northern Ireland for four years which monitored such cases and I found it extremely helpful in validating the law. There is no point talking about the right to silence when dealing with people who are trained to be silent.  They are prepared to stare at a point on a wall without saying a word for 72 hours no matter what happens to them.</P>
    <P>On the collection of information, one must be prepared to accept the courts have some common sense.  It is one thing when a person is picked up with an ordnance survey map but it is a different matter if the map contains a ring around the address of every policeman within ten miles of a <Col N="874" /> certain area.  These are important measures and I commend the Minister on the legislation.</P>
    <P>We should try to ensure that the monitoring of the application of the acts is as continuous and rigorous as possible.  When legislation is passed in a hurry, unexpected or unaccounted for events may arise.  It would be sensible &mdash; this would not have to be laid down in legislation &mdash; to confine questioning to those Garda stations equipped with video and sound recordings.  That would prevent potential trouble afterwards.  It would save having trials within trials when people are brought forward.  There should be monitoring of the way in which the Garda use legislation &mdash; this was referred to by Senator Ryan.</P>
    <P>It has been my experience in the past that the police force often use the biggest instrument at its disposal rather than the smallest one.  I have seen cases in the past where the Offences Against the State Act has been used for crimes of an ordinary nature.  In Great Britain at present CS gas, which is used for the control of riots, is being used to control or arrest mental patients.  Will the Minister put in train a review mechanism to ensure the legislation is proportionate, time limited and focused?  I commend the Minister and the Taoiseach on the steps taken by the Government which will considerably advance the peace process.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a particularly sombre day in the life of this Parliament.  On very few occasions have we been asked to give extraordinary powers to the Government of the day.  It is almost 59 years to the day in September 1939 when, for the first time under the present Constitution, the Government came to the House asking for extraordinary powers which remained in existence throughout the emergency.  Successive Taoisigh at different times going back to W. T. Cosgrave, de Valera, Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave and Garret FitzGerald have on occasions had to resort to the use of these powers because in the view of their Government and the best security advice there was a danger to the State.  The State is not some vague, anonymous, amorphous entity.  The State is all of us.  It is our laws, our Constitution, the practice of democracy, the supremacy of democracy, the doctrine of one Army and one police force in the State.  When these were in danger of being subverted, political leaders of all parties have had to come to these Houses seeking extraordinary powers which invariably they have been granted. With a few exceptions the use of those powers over the lifetime of the State has been careful and as was intended.  Those exceptions, which I will <Col N="875" /> address in a moment, are much less likely to happen today.  Over the years the courts, for the most part, have upheld the legislation.  Any wrong practices, and there were wrong practices at different times, were identified and addressed in the full light of publicity.</P>
    <P>The problem today is not the Omagh bombing, terrible as it was, but the mindset of the people behind it.  Like Senator Hayes, I am glad this legislation is trying to get to the godfathers, the people responsible not just for the suffering inflicted on innocent people but also for the perversion of idealism.  People will spend many years in jail for the terrible deeds they did as a result of being influenced by these people.  It is a symptom of a mindset which will do again what it did in Omagh if, for its own perverted ideology, it believes it is in its own interests.  We are dealing with people who do not respect my rights or the view that I and all other politicians have that life is about compromise, that I cannot always get my own way, that might is not right.  That is the reason exceptional laws are needed.</P>
    <P>We are told today by our Government, on the best security advice available to it, that these powers are needed.  I accept its view with reluctance. I am suspicious and I am always concerned that, as Senators Hayes and Ryan pointed out, the police can and do use powers that were not intended in other circumstances.  These are the matters about which we must be vigilant.</P>
    <P>Those of us on this side of the House, and Members on the other side, will subject this legislation to detailed scrutiny on Committee Stage. We have suggestions to make, some of which have been accepted already by the Minister in the other House.  That is our job and we will continue to do it.</P>
    <P>One major difference today from when this type of legislation was first initiated in the 1930s is that there is now a range of informal safeguards to ensure these powers will not be excessively used.  Those safeguards did not exist to the same extent in the past.  For example, there is a new attitude in these Houses where Members tend to be more vigilant, aggressive and searching than they were in the past.  I say this as somebody who has studied many of the Dáil debates since the foundation of the State.  There is a different type of attitude on the part of Members.  There are more means of asking questions and of ensuring that Governments behave whether it is the committee system, the presence of television cameras or whatever.</P>
    <P>The courts today are very different from the courts of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  They have a much stronger human rights awareness and they are quick to act upon excessive use of these powers or any alleged breaches of human rights brought to their attention.</P>
    <P>The media today is very different from the somnolent media of earlier years.  The media now has a strong investigative role.  Members of the media see it as their job to monitor what is happening <Col N="876" /> and public opinion will be made aware quickly if there are excesses.  That will in turn feed into these Houses and into the courts.  There is a new cultural climate which is the strongest safeguard we have against excessive use of these powers for any sustained period.</P>
    <P>Public opinion has changed greatly in recent years.  It is finally moving away from what Senator Hayes dubbed as the sneaking regarder, the syndrome of always playing it both ways.  I hope public opinion will not tolerate these type of activities.  While none of us likes this sort of legislation, Governments have in the past sought to use such legislation in the way intended by Parliament when passing it.  In addition, the informal safeguards in place today, in the form of the media, these Houses, the courts and public opinion ensure that any temptation to exceed the authority being given will be brought to a quick end.</P>

      <P>This morning we revisited Omagh.  I was out of the country at the time of the Omagh bombing and for me it was a tremendous atrocity.  I was in America at the time, and the reaction of ordinary people was overwhelming when they heard an Irish voice, people we would feel probably have more day-to-day experience of violence than we in the Twenty-six Counties would have.  Their reaction was one of revulsion and complete disbelief.  Despite important national and international news at the time, the Omagh bombing dominated the local newspapers in the area where I was, South Alabama, for four consecutive days.  That shows the horror with which this atrocity was viewed by people who live in another democracy.</P>
      <P>Senator Hayes brought home to us how ambivalent we tend to be on the Northern question in relation to violence.  It is not very long since we stood to express our horror at the Ennis-killen bombing.  While we have to balance the rights of ordinary people to civil liberties, there is no question but that the legislation before us has to be supported, with the reservations expressed by the Senators which will be discussed on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>Monitoring is an important aspect of the legislation. The way legislation is implemented is always of tremendous importance.  This includes the sophistication of equipment in Garda stations, lack of ambivalence in questioning witnesses, videotaping of interviews and scrutiny not just by people who operate the equipment but also a constant awareness on the part of democratically elected representatives to ensure that this legislation is operated in the way it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are one nation with one army.  We cannot accept the so-called Real IRA who are hell-bent on destroying the peace process, on going against the democratic wishes of the people of Ireland, on going against the British-Irish Agreement in an effort to derail it.  The most important human rights are those of the young children who will not enjoy a life of fulfilment, of maimed teenagers <Col N="877" /> who have to look forward to a struggle with life.  We as an Irish nation should be supportive of this legislation because it is ambivalence that gives those people the feeling that they can be supported.  We should not forget Omagh or Enni-skillen, but we should be mindful that legislation must protect civil liberties.  It must be scrutinised on a regular basis and include everything that is needed to ensure that there is no violation of human rights.  Once and for all we must stand up to the small group of people who are not just fighting for some ideology for which there is no excuse but against the democratic rights of all of us &mdash; Senators, Deputies and people of Ireland. Let us not forget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I thank him for all his efforts in the peace process and for putting this legislation together. None of us wants to be here today expressing grief, sorrow, dismay and abhorrence of the appalling tragedy in Omagh.  None of us expected to be here today to pass legislation which is variously described as tough or draconian.  It probably is draconian legislation.  However, none of the people in Omagh on 15 August expected to be blasted away.  This is the week that many of our children return to school or go to college.  It is a happy time and many people on that Saturday were making preparations for it.  However, children and their futures were blasted away.  This is the grim reality and the legislation must be placed in that context.</P>
      <P>The bombing in Omagh on 15 August was an act of evil.  It inflicted pain and suffering on a community which was slowly but surely adjusting to the happier circumstances of life in a more peaceful Northern Ireland.  The people of Omagh and the visitors, like their counterparts in all towns in Northern Ireland, were daring to hope for a new normality which would allow them to lead their lives without the backdrop of violence for the first time in generations.  An act of savagery by fascists, the murder of 28 people and the injuring and maiming of dozens of others, provided them and us with a rude awakening.</P>
      <P>A few weeks have passed since the tragedy in Omagh and the time has come to convert the universal sense of revulsion at what happened into a tangible response to the perpetrators of this unspeakable act.  All the words of sympathy and outrage uttered in the wake of Omagh will ring hollow to the relatives and friends of the victims unless the most powerful force of the law is unleashed against the so-called godfathers, perpetrators, sympathisers and fellow travellers of the self-styled murderous Real IRA and their ilk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has been done cannot be undone.  Those who oppose the introduction of the new measures in the Bill have suggested that they represent a serious erosion of civil liberties.  It is not something any of us relish; none of us wants to be in the House to deal with the Bill.  However, the most important right is the right to life.  The Government has a duty first and foremost to protect <Col N="878" /> its citizens from the onslaught of terrorism and from death and destruction.  It is reasonable that the State should seek to strengthen its hand against those who spend their days trying to subvert it.  These people are setting out to destroy not only the peace process but also our State and nation.</P>
    <P>We must be mindful that this amending legislation does not lead us directly or indirectly down the road of miscarried justice.  The Minister has been reasonable in this regard.  He has made amendments to alleviate some of the fears which have been expressed.  Section 10 provides for an extended period of detention but a person who is the subject of an application will be produced before a judge.  This is a good and reasonable measure.</P>
    <P>In section 18, the date on which certain elements of the Bill will lapse unless they continue in operation under a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas, has been brought forward to June 2000.  This is also a good amendment. The Minister has sought to alleviate some of the concerns and this has been acknowledged. Some of the amendments emphasise the supremacy of the Oireachtas in the State.  This is the correct path to follow; there is no other way. It is indicative of the fact that the Minister, in common with all Members, would prefer not to have this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>Genuine concerns have been expressed.  That is to be expected and we cannot dismiss them. Points have been well made about the need to monitor the various facets of the Bill.  There is a logistical problem in making audiovisual equipment available in every Garda station but given the small numbers involved it should be possible to bring suspects to those stations where equipment is available.</P>
    <P>Straightforward questions should be asked. Why should it be lawful for someone to direct an unlawful organisation?  Why should it be lawful for the owner of a farm on which an illegal organisation makes bombs to withhold such information from the Garda Síochána?  The provisions of the Bill will make it more difficult for a tiny violent minority to dictate the future of the island.  They cannot have their way.</P>
    <P>In April the British-Irish Agreement was signed in Castle Buildings.  In May it received the support of the overwhelming majority on the island.  People made it clear in no uncertain terms that they wanted peace.  Those responsible for the bomb in Omagh flew in the face of public sentiment. This country stands to lose so much if the men of violence, however small in number, are allowed to return centre stage.  The edifice which has been built with great care and attention could come tumbling down if we are not resolute in the face of renewed violence.  We cannot allow another atrocity.</P>
    <P>This is an important day on this island.  President Clinton is seeking once again to bring his influence to bear on the peace process.  He has been a good friend to Ireland.  In giving the process <Col N="879" /> priority he has been instrumental in leading us down the road towards lasting peace.  Deserved tribute has been paid to Senator Mitchell and all the political leaders on this island and in Britain for the role they have played.</P>
    <P>There have been some positive developments this week.  In a significant statement the president of Sinn Féin, Mr. Gerry Adams, committed the organisation to pursuing its political goals through exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  Sinn Féin has also appointed Mr. Martin McGuinness to liaise with the independent decommissioning body chaired by General John de Chastelain.  As the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and First Minister, Mr. David Trimble, said, words must be followed by action.  Decommissioning, like prisoner releases, is a central part of the British-Irish Agreement.  The process is and will always be about constructing trust and confidence.</P>
    <P>The fledgling Northern Ireland Assembly will meet in 11 days.  There is every reason to believe the painstaking progress made on the political front since the Omagh bombing will bear fruit when all the parties meet at Stormont.  We await the establishment of the North-South implementation bodies and the putting in place of the other structures envisaged under the Agreement.  These represent the future, not bombs and bullets.  The more progress made on the political front the more difficult it will be for the warped and perverted few to sell their message of violence. Special circumstances require special measures.  It would be remiss of the Government not to deal to the best of its ability with the prospect of another atrocity.</P>
    <P>The overriding concern in the introduction of this Bill is to protect human life, North and South.  The Offences Against the State Act has saved countless lives by apprehending hundreds of people bent on the pursuit of evil and destruction. Its existence on the Statute Book has probably prevented some of the worst excesses of paramilitary violence, notwithstanding the acts of violence which have occurred.  I note that civil rights associations have described the changes as over the top, but I disagree.  The logic these associations bring to the argument is false.  The majority of countries in the civilised world have not had to frame their laws to counter constant terrorist threat.  Thankfully, events such as Omagh are few and far between, but the threat of such events places an onerous responsibility on the Government of the day to act decisively, which it has done.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister and his officials for the manner in which the new legislation has been put together.  Of course we all hope Omagh was the last atrocity, but we have seen too much over the years to become too hopeful that it will be the last.  We cannot lose hope, but Omagh should remind us that as the fragile flower that is the British-Irish Agreement seeks to take root and blossom, there are those who want to pull it from <Col N="880" /> the ground and throw it away.  They must not be allowed to succeed.</P>

      <P>Omagh, as we know, was an attempt to destroy the democratic process in Ireland that was as outrageous as it was callous. For the people who planted the bomb to claim they acted on behalf of the Irish people, when the results of the recent referenda showed they obviously did not, is one of the greatest insults that we have had to endure in addition to the pain, distress and death suffered by the people of Omagh.</P>
      <P>However, we must be very careful that we do not damage democracy ourselves because of our justifiable outrage.  It is very easy to pass legislation which, due to our rage, we consider necessary but which we would not consider in normal times.  I admit that these are not normal circumstances, and I would like to agree with Senator Keogh that this is an isolated incident, but tragically this type of campaign against a civilian population is becoming the norm internationally.</P>
      <P>If the Government feels this legislation will help apprehend those who defied the overwhelming wishes of the population of Ireland, North and South, then we will have to accept it, though with reluctance.  Deputy Hanafin said last night that this legislation is not desirable but that it is essential, and that is probably how many of us feel.  Many Deputies and Senators have expressed their concerns about the extent of the legislation, and I have expressed my concerns about the lack of video recording of interviews.  This is of great concern when the lack of a response to questions in these interviews will be taken seriously as evidence. I understand civil liberties groups describing this as a huge infringement on a person's right to remain silent, but if the whole interview is videotaped there is a definite justification for using the tape in court.  Failure to give information is another situation where I would like to see video evidence being used.  This could be a genuine mistake and it will be difficult to add this to a person's guilt if one has not seen how the whole interview has been carried out.</P>
      <P>We should all be conversant with our civic duty in reporting suspicious activities.  There must be many who will remember the murder of Tom Oliver. His reward for doing his proper civic duty in reporting specific activities to the police was his murder by the IRA.  While I understand this will be made a more serious crime, we must remember an enormous amount of courage will be required by such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ross spoke about the possibility that internment might have been a better solution.  He was right to point out that unfortunately we are comparing internment now with that of the early 1970s in the North of Ireland where ridiculously <Col N="881" /> out of date information was used and people who had nothing to do with illegal activity were interned.  There was an appalling backlash in the community which resulted in probably one of the best recruiting drives the IRA ever had.  He had a point because at least we would have admitted our failure in that the legislation in place is not sufficient to apprehend people we suspect of being involved in terrorist crime.  I am concerned about whether the legislation will be enough to apprehend such people and bring them to justice.</P>
    <P>I would like those convicted of bombing offences and who are now serving prison sentences to do more about the bombers involved in the Real IRA.  I have written to them on this subject and believe I can say something about it.  I campaigned for years for the ratification of the transfer of prisoners convention and for the transfer of these prisoners.  I received a letter from Lord Williams of Mostyn yesterday telling me why one such prisoner could not be transferred. While I am glad those involved in bombings who are now in prison and who have served long sentences are unbowed and unbroken &mdash; nobody wants to see peoples' spirits broken &mdash; some members of the IRA have pointed out how futile their activities were.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile if more saw how counterproductive the destruction of the lives of children is.  The babies who lost their lives in Omagh were not the first to lose their lives as babies.  Even younger died in bombing attempts, including a six month old baby in Germany, babies in England and in previous campaigns in Northern Ireland.  Women, including pregnant women, old people and many others died before the Omagh bomb.</P>
    <P>I would like if those imprisoned for these offences &mdash; we are constantly being told prisoners have made a great contribution towards the peace process &mdash; would publicly point out that people should desist because the sentences they have served show the campaign does not in any way increase the likelihood of a united Ireland.  Our experience over the past 25 years must show how futile the effort has been.</P>
    <P>Will the Presidential Commission refer the legislation to the Supreme Court?  I am concerned by the number of constitutional lawyers who believe it will be referred.  Naturally, I have great confidence in the Attorney General and the Minister but it is worrying that the legislation might be struck down almost immediately by the Supreme Court.  Unfortunately, that has happened in the past with special powers legislation.  I wonder what comments the United Nations Commissioner on Human Rights, Mary Robinson, would make on the legislation if she was here. Would they be similar to those she made here in the 1970s?  At that time people were regularly imprisoned for membership of the IRA on the word of a Garda superintendent.  I heard a report of one case where a superintendent was questioned as to whether he knew the accused, had met him before or could recognise him, and the <Col N="882" /> superintendent had to admit that he had never met the man before, would not have recognised him and this was the first time he had come across him, but in that case the man was convicted.  This is a subject about which we all feel strongly.  I hope the Minister will accept that while I have reservations about what he is trying to do I understand why he is doing it.</P>
    <P>I tabled an amendment to a section of the Bill which requires a person to deny any published report that he or she is a member of an illegal organisation.  It is difficult enough for the Minister to have mistakes made about him rectified in a newspaper.  With due respect, it seems only <i>The Irish Times</i> takes clarifications and corrections seriously.  It publishes them the next day, but there must be many Members of the Oireachtas who have written repeatedly to the editors of other newspapers asking them to correct a report. It is almost impossible to have an incorrect report corrected on the radio media.  How long will a person be allowed to ensure a correction is made?</P>
    <P>One Member of the Oireachtas has been trying for two years to get a radio station to correct an erroneous report about him.  He has gone to great lengths to do that and the only thing he can do now is to take a case against the station concerned, but that would cost him a good deal of money.  People accused of membership of the Real IRA may not be in a position financially to take cases against newspapers or radio stations which state that they are members of the IRA and which will not publish a disclaimer.  Removal of that provision from the Bill would be welcome because it appears foolish to me.</P>
    <P>I understand the good intentions behind the Bill, but I wonder how useful it will be against those whom we are trying to convict.  It reminds me of the legislation on dog muzzling.  We were horrified by the actions of uncontrolled guard dogs who attacked children and, in some cases, killed them.  Legislation was introduced to the effect that such dogs should be muzzled immediately, but I have not seen any increase in the number of muzzles on dogs, and children are still attacked by them.  I hope this legislation will do what the Minister intends it will do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice to the House.  I also welcome the Bill which is part of an ongoing process following the British-Irish Agreement, but sadly it was accelerated and given a different focus and shape because of the horrendous tragedy of the Omagh bombing two weeks ago.  That horrendously tragic holocaust has been variously described in the media.  One or two of the most significant and profound descriptions that tended to capture the attention <Col N="883" /> referred to the bomb as being addressed to humanity and not to politics, enemy military organisations, foreign alien governments or extremists on the other side.  That headline captured my attention.</P>
    <P>Séamus Heaney described the immediate aftermath of the bomb as people not cursing the political motivation of the bombers, but their callousness and the enormity of their indifference to human life.  Those words go some way towards capturing the deep sense of the tragedy and holocaust that happened.  Senator Maurice Hayes wrote voluminously about it and what struck him was how potent a symbol it was in terms its potential to be the Pentecost in Northern Ireland in the Stewart Parker sense.  This was because ordinary people going about ordinary tasks were obliterated with total, absolute and abject indifference by those who carried out this callous and heinous deed.  It deeply shocked all people on this island.  The point was forcefully made by a previous speaker that this was an effort by a tiny but callous group to bomb the island and all its peoples and traditions into a united Ireland. What it has achieved is a unity of determination, purpose and vision about the kind of Ireland we need, want and are determined to ensure is brought about.  There is a significant irony in that.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill.  Some people, including the Minister, said it contained harsh, tough measures. There is no doubt about that and some would say with some justification that they are draconian.  I cannot recall in my 16 years in the Houses of the Oireachtas participating in a debate on a Bill whose measures were so harsh.  I cannot recall legislation with measures which go so far in some respects being introduced to the Statute Book. While the measures may be draconian, tough, harsh and regrettable, most people who wish to advance the British-Irish Agreement towards permanent peace in Northern Ireland would accept unequivocally and unambiguously that they are necessary.</P>
    <P>It was disappointing to learn that, in the Dáil yesterday, the Labour Party and Green Party voted three times against some of the measures in the Bill.  Deputies Ó Caoláin, Joe Higgins and Gregory also voted against the measures a number of times.  We live in a democracy and I do not wish to diminish the rights of the Deputies and their parties to take a certain line.  It would be contrary to what I am speaking about because it would be akin to what this ruthless, mindless minority is trying to achieve.  However, it comes across as speaking out of both sides of one's mouth, of having the best of both worlds.  It satisfies their civil libertarian friends on the one hand &mdash; we are all civil libertarians &mdash; while at the same time addressing the element which poses a threat to the British-Irish Agreement.  This latter issue is being dealt with forcefully, determinedly and constitutionally in the Bill with all due regard to our international human rights obligations.</P>
    <P>The Minister admitted that the Bill is a small <Col N="884" /> but vital element in the package needed to facilitate the growth of a new understanding in the totality of new relationships on this island.  It is the birth and growth of these new relationships which is helping the island to quickly overcome and move forward from, while not forgetting, the horrendous holocaust of a few weeks ago.  The tragic event in Omagh sent a potent and frightening signal to all on this island of the threat to the British-Irish Agreement posed by tiny groups of individuals who are ready to use violence to wreck the Agreement.  Their motivation is not republicanism but their opposition to the Agreement. Even though they have lost support in most parts of Ireland, they are still determined in the same psychopathic way to use the maximum force, brutality and violence to wreck the greatest potential for the advancement of permanent peace in the history of Anglo-Irish relations in recent times.</P>
    <P>However, they are going even further &mdash; they are attacking our civilisation.  In a unique way, the people endorsed the British-Irish Agreement in two referenda.  These groups are attempting to subvert the will of the people to further their sick, irresponsible agenda.  Reasoned argument will not reach them.  In the aftermath of the British-Irish Agreement these small, breakaway, extremist groups are throwing down the gauntlet to the Government and the people, North and South.  The referenda offered an unprecedented and unique opportunity.  They also issue a mandate and a directive to the Government to take these groups out of circulation in accordance with due process and to remove any undemocratic, terrorist obstacles to fulfilling the terms of the British-Irish Agreement.  The overwhelming majority of people Catholic, Protestant or dissenter, Nationalist, republican or Unionist is behind the Government and the Minister.  In concurrent referenda they showed that the mandate is clear &mdash; there is no longer any place for the bomber or the gunman in Irish society.  They have to be removed and peace has to be promoted on the island.</P>
    <P>Against this background, the Government has a duty to act.  It could have decided to play for time to see if people's sense of outrage would be sufficient to bring these people to heel.  However, that would have been a cowardly opt-out.  The Minister would have abrogated his responsibilities. The people have exercised their responsibilities and transferred power to the Minister and the Government.  They want them to act now to promote peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome Tuesday's statement by Mr. Gerry Adams that violence must be a thing of the past, over and done with, for everyone.  This declaration is being interpreted as a signal that the war is over.  It puts the peace process back on course as it significantly enhances the prospects of Sinn Féin and the Unionists sitting together in a Northern Government.  That is a significant and vital element in the progression towards what is <Col N="885" /> aspired to and signed up to in the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the safeguards which accompany it.  I also welcome the decision to include a review mechanism.  Measures such as these should not be left on the Statute Book any longer than necessary.  They are a response to an emergency.  They are vital, necessary and regrettable but I hope they will be successful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that both Houses on the two islands have been recalled and that the two Governments are acting in unison.  A mandate was given by the British-Irish Agreement and the referenda whereby no small, unrepresentative group can attempt to return to the days when the bomb and the bullet were the norm.  It is appropriate that joint action is taken.</P>
      <P>It is almost three weeks since the Omagh bombing and this gives us an opportunity to reflect on and tease out the implications of legislation. We are not reacting overnight in a panic.</P>
      <P>I wish to correct Senator Fitzgerald who likes to have a go at the Opposition.  The Opposition parties and certainly the Labour Party did not vote against the Bill three times; they voted for amendments which were intended to improve the Bill.  It is the function of the Opposition to introduce amendments to safeguard the right of citizens and to ensure that this legislation or any other legislation does not interfere with any constitutional right.</P>
      <P>The carnage perpetrated by the Real IRA at Omagh has shaken the people to the core.  The grief, anguish and pain inflicted on that day has sickened every right-minded person in Ireland. The bombing has strengthened the determination of ordinary people throughout the island that the British-Irish Agreement be made to work and that a just and lasting settlement emerges in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The result of the Omagh bombing has also been to remind us all of the threat that exists to democracy from fringe terror groups, intent on subverting the will of the people, as expressed in the recent referenda on both sides of the Border. The threat posed to democracy and the peace process by the Real IRA is a substantial one.  The people in that organisation are deluded fanatics, immune to the wishes and hopes of the people of this island.  They have demonstrated their commitment to perpetrate the most appalling crimes in an attempt to undermine democracy and it is the duty of the State to respond to their violence with all the legal means at its disposal.</P>
      <P>The Government's response comes in the form of the Bill before the House.  Before turning to the Bill I wish to comment broadly on the tasks facing both Governments and all democrats in this island at this critical time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's response to the Omagh bombing has chiefly been a security response. While this is undoubtedly necessary, it is only part of the whole package needed to concentrate totally and exclusively on the suppression of a <Col N="886" /> small fringe terror group, no matter how desperate, ruthless and evil its actions, and is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>The horror of the Omagh atrocity necessitates a comprehensive response including this legislation but it must go far beyond the Bill or the Garda's ongoing actions against the Real IRA. At this crucial time it is vital that the Real IRA and its cowardly acts do not dominate the political agenda or distract attention from the political structures emerging in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The political response to this bombing that supports the dynamic for progress and which exists within the Northern Ireland Assembly is absolutely vital.  Both Governments must act in unison to ensure in the coming weeks and months the Assembly and the shadow executive work and are seen to work.  This is an onerous task but is all the more important in the wake of the Omagh atrocity.</P>
    <P>In recent days the republican movement has indicated it rejects the use of violence for political purposes.  I was pleased to see the disavowal by Gerry Adams yesterday of violence as a means to an end and that Martin McGuinness has been appointed to the commission on decommissioning. Both are significant steps forward and, in the view of the Labour Party, are leading to the working of the new Assembly.  These developments are welcome and can provide a significant impetus in the coming weeks.  I urge both Governments to redouble their efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>Beyond the realm of established politics there is a large amount of work to be done regarding a community response to the Omagh bombing.  The public outcry in the wake of the Omagh tragedy demonstrated the emotional attachment the Irish people on both side of the Border have for the British-Irish Agreement.  In the days following the bombing the airwaves and letters pages of the newspapers were evidence of the deep sense of revulsion felt by the ordinary people on this island.  Not only was the sense of revulsion evident but the commitment of the people to realising the potential of the British-Irish Agreement ran like a common thread through the response of people everywhere.  This is a most important development and must be recognised by both Governments.</P>
    <P>While new legislation and a renewed commitment to making the assembly work is important, ensuring the people have ownership of the peace process is critical, particularly in the wake of the Omagh bombing.  How can this goal be achieved? I believe the Government should undertake a complete review of its funding of cross-Border and cross-community organisations.  In this respect I was surprised to hear a backbench Fianna Fáil Deputy say that funding to one such organisation had been cutback in the recent past, leading to a severe cutback in the places available on its various programmes.  This penny pinching attitude cannot be allowed continue.  Voluntary and community organisations which work tirelessly <Col N="887" /> to promote understanding on the island must receive the full backing of both Governments and the EU in their efforts.  I hope the Minister will communicate my views to the Government on this matter and I look forward to swift and effective action being taken to properly resource these organisations.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion in terms of British-Irish co-operation in the context of the Agreement, and encompassing all the bodies on the islands, including those in Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man and the North and South of Ireland, is the Council of the Isles.  It is an excellent proposal in the context of trying to weld the various peoples and cultures together with a common purpose. This can help create a sense of cohesion and partnership in moving forward and I would like to see this concept explored to a greater degree.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party accepts the need for legislation of this nature given the threat to democracy and the peace process posed by small ruthless terror groups.  As a social democrat I take no particular pleasure in supporting in principle a Bill of this nature.  However, I am deeply committed to protecting our democracy against attacks by fascists intent on destroying all we hold dear. It is against this background that I and my party have given broad support to the Bill.  However, there are a number of aspects of the Bill to which I object and the Labour Party will be tabling appropriate amendments in an effort to seek improvements and the inclusion of safeguards.</P>
    <P>My experience in dealing with human rights and civil liberties over the years, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, has left me with a keen awareness of how easily temporary emergency legislation can become permanent and how its application can be extended way beyond the original purpose intended by those who framed it.  I have seen how such legislation can be subject to abuses in its operation.  Abuse comes about in particular when there is strong political pressure to get results.  The host of miscarriages of justice both here and in Britain have tarnished the rule of law, discredited sections of the police force, reduced the morale of the police force and raised question marks over the operation of the criminal justice system.  Ironically, such abuse has impeded the pursuit of those who have lived by the bomb and the bullet and who have committed atrocities on both islands.  Therefore, we must be extremely careful in ensuring we do not return to a situation where allegations can be made, such as those made in the 1970s concerning a heavy gang operating to get results following the passing of emergency and exceptional legislation which has since been repealed.  At that time the Barra O Briain and Judge Martin committees were established.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arose in relation to a host of cases in Britain following the sudden and hasty introduction of the prevention of terrorism legislation in 1974 subsequent to the Birmingham bombings.  We are all aware of the consequences <Col N="888" /> of this legislation in Britain.  We have particular concerns about three areas.  The absence of a nationwide system of electronic recording of interviews in Garda stations is worrying.  This was prescribed in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and 15 years later only exists in the form of an extremely limited pilot scheme.  With the extra powers included here &mdash; the curtailment of the right to silence and inference of corroboration in relation to prosecution of offences and convictions &mdash; it is absolutely essential that any station where a person is detained under this legislation and interviewed for up to three days has adequate audio and audio-visual recording equipment.</P>
    <P>The Minister does not need to do as the Judge Martin report recommended &mdash; install such facilities in every Garda station in the State immediately &mdash; but he must ensure that stations to which people arrested under this legislation are brought for interview have these safeguards, both for the gardaí and the detainee.  That is essential.  Senator Maurice Hayes, who has considerable experience of this area in Northern Ireland, stated there should be monitoring of all cases dealt with under this legislation by human rights groups.</P>
    <P>This legislation is an amendment to the Offences Against the State Act introduced in 1939 to combat subversion at a critical time in the history of this island and of Europe.  We have remained in a state of emergency since with an Offences Against the State Act which includes offences in the scheduled and non-scheduled categories. Over the years we have seen the courts bypassed by the operation of this legislation, legislation which was originally intended purely for the purpose of countering subversion.  Now we have gone a step further and created new serious offences which carry a penalty of five or more years.  There will be a greater catch-all of offences than would be the norm in any jurisdiction. The danger which exists is potent and it is important the legislation is used for the stated intention &mdash; offences against the State &mdash; and not as catch-all legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minster took steps in the Dáil to alleviate our concerns about a terminal date for the legislation. That date should be coterminous with the provisions and proposals of the British-Irish Agreement, which intends to see in operation the rule of law with strict safeguards enhanced and protected by human rights commissions, both North and South, with strong powers of monitoring. This legislation should not extend beyond that period of time.  We would like this legislation to selfdestruct at that point rather than being subject to review.  The Minster of the day should have to reintroduce the legislation and subject it to the full rigorous procedures of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  A Bill such as this should be placed on the Statute Book with extreme caution. There is a precedent for emergency legislation to become something of a permanent feature of our legal code and a danger that legal principles established in emergency legislation can subsequently become part of the normal legal landscape. <Col N="889" /> That constitutes an erosion of democracy and it is our duty as legislators to ensure that does not happen.  While it is essential that we provide the Garda with the necessary legal powers to pursue those who wish to subvert democracy, it is also critical that we do not undermine that very democracy in our efforts to pursue those responsible for the Omagh carnage.  I hope the Minister will look favourably on the reasonable amendments which have been tabled by the Labour Party and other Members of the Opposition as they would enhance the Bill and ensure the constitutional rights of citizens would be upheld.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MickLanigan" hpid="Mr. Lanigan Mr. Lanigan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lanigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and the introduction of this necessary legislation.  Some people would say it is a pity a special sitting such as this had to be convened to enact legislation which might appear to some to go against the grain of civil liberties in that it might be seen to enhance the State's control over its citizens.  State involvement in people's lives has increased over the years and some would suggest that George Orwell's day has now come.</P>
      <P>This is necessary legislation; the Government did not wish to introduce it but was forced by events to do so.  Successive Governments have introduced numerous Bills which protect citizens against extremes.  The extremes in question are caused by those who do not wish us to live in a democracy and who would like to take away our democratic principles and government.  As Senator Costello pointed out, some of the legislation introduced in the past has remained on the Statute Book.  It was necessary for it to remain there as long as people perpetrated crimes against Irish people, North and South and, indeed, against people in Great Britain.  A concerted effort has been made over the years to eliminate true democracy from this country and therefore certain powers conferred on the Government by the Oireachtas have had to be enacted.</P>
      <P>The Omagh tragedy has impacted more than many others on people throughout Ireland.  It also impacted on people in Spain and, indeed, throughout the world.  In this era of instant communications, SKY, ABC, NBC and CNN were broadcasting pictures of the atrocity before many of us were even aware of what had happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The implications of the Omagh bombing are horrendous for the victims, their families and communities and legislation such as this will not be able to overcome the problems which will arise in the future for those injured, maimed and mentally tortured by the bombing.  In some cases, it could be said the people who died might have been luckier than those who must live with the effects of the atrocity.  We have to be cognisant that the Garda Síochána, the RUC and the British and Irish Governments have been working extremely hard to rid this country of terrorists. They have been trying to ensure that people can live in a peaceful environment where there is <Col N="890" /> hope for the future.  Too many people have no future because of the actions of the past.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been called draconian and contains draconian elements but they are necessary if we are to capture the terrorists behind the murders that have taken place.  We must seek out the people who commit murder supposedly in the name of the republican movement.  They are as far removed from the real meaning of republicanism as they could be.  They have no conscience, do not have the public interest at heart and serve only themselves.  The Bill, although draconian, has an appropriate time limitation on it and it will be reviewed by both Houses on 30 June 1999.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with a small group of dedicated terrorists who do not care who they hurt.  They will not listen to anybody and will continue to do what they want.  Their actions are not in the best interest of the public, republicanism or people who want to live their lives and cope with all the trauma that life brings.  At present, everyday life is extremely difficult for many people without adding the extra trauma of death and the loss of limbs, etc.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that when emergency legislation was introduced in the 1970s it resulted in the Garda going overboard in the way they operated the legislation.  That was possibly true in the past.  Now the Garda employ a very open and transparent mechanism under which the Minister and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can be notified immediately.  I have no doubt that if something untoward happened now in any Garda or RUC station the media would know about it immediately.  The general public would then be informed of the incident and I am sure there would be an immediate outcry.  This is different to what happened in the 1970s.  We are a millennium away from the 1970s in terms of the attitude of the public towards law and order and its transparency.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an electronic recording system used in all cases, not only in cases where people are arrested under this Bill.  There is a need for a system to record interviews being conducted in the confines of a Garda barracks or anywhere people are charged or interviewed. This will be provided for and it is not specific to this Bill.</P>
    <P>It seems that this Bill was introduced to deal with groups such as the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA.  Unfortunately, others who might be immune from prosecution may decide that since this legislation is directed at the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA they are free to build up their own organisations.  I am glad the Minister has stated that if the IRA or INLA decide to carry out any act of violence they will be dealt with under current legislation.</P>
    <P>I ask the innocent people involved through the ownership of land where bombs were made or equipment held to go to the Garda under the rules of decommissioning and admit to having had armaments on their land in the past.  Under the British-Irish Agreement and the decommissioning <Col N="891" /> agreements, this legislation should not apply to them.</P>
    <P>I hate to see the introduction of this Bill as there will be civil liberty problems.  However, it will only impact on a small number of murderous people.  As long it is so confined, I am glad it is being introduced and that it is of limited duration. I hope that on 30 June 1999 there will be no need for an extension of the legislation.  However, I doubt that.</P>
    <P>I ask those involved in the Troubles from the start, before the Omagh bombing, to stop and think of their families, the families of those around them and the damage they have done. This will not be forgotten and cannot be remedied.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House in this important period in our history. The response of the Dáil yesterday was clear and unambiguous and echoed the unanimous voice of the people, for whom we speak.  There is absolute outrage in the community, North and South, at the extent and horror of the slaughter of the innocents in Omagh.</P>
      <P>The people who planted that bomb had one aim &mdash; to totally destroy the new and historic British-Irish Agreement.  This Agreement represents a fundamental change in our history.  For the first time, Catholics, Protestants and dissenters are agreeing on the way in which Northern Ireland should be governed and on where the future of the young people of our country lies. The Agreement is dear to the hearts of the people and they voted for it in massive numbers. The Omagh bombing, against the background of that consensus, North and South, is all the more horrendous and unacceptable.</P>
      <P>It also went against the fantastic work Mo Mowlam, the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, President Clinton, Irish Americans and people all over the world put into making the Agreement possible.  It happened because of the influence of Irish people all over the world and the coming together of their minds and hearts.  Wolfe Tone, the founder of Irish republicanism, said the aim of the United Irishmen was to unite Catholics, Protestants and dissenters in the common aim of Irishmen.  This is what the Agreement is about and is what the Omagh bomb set about destroying.</P>
      <P>This legislation, difficult and controversial as some of its provisions are, is absolutely essential. This State is saying to these people that they will go no further with their activities and that we will use every possible legislative arm to ensure they are put away and they cease their activities.  There is no place in our country for what they do.  This legislation is tough and severe.  It shows we mean business and that we will ensure these people will no longer be free to continue their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The aim of the legislation is clear.  Its application is not intended to create new martyrs for the cause of the so-called Real IRA.  There must be no such martyrs; no ground should be given to <Col N="892" /> these people.  The powers conferred by the Bill must be used wisely, in a disciplined and surgical manner.  There are not many people involved in this organisation and the Garda know who they are.  The State should move against them immediately but carefully.  As Senator Costello pointed out, care should be taken with regard to how these people are interviewed in Garda stations. The Minister should introduce video and recording facilities in all Garda stations as soon as possible to ensure there are no doubts or equivocation when these matters come before the courts.  What happened in the Garda stations should be quite clear to the court.  There should be absolute clarity about what the Garda Superintendent says and why he or she says it.</P>
    <P>I have great faith in the Garda Síochána and believe its members will use this legislation wisely and well.  I also welcome the commitment given by the Taoiseach today when he said: &ldquo;The measures being brought forward are targeted solely at those who engage in continued violence. They are time limited and will lapse when we are sure they are no longer necessary.  We will monitor closely their implementation.  .&rdquo;. Will the Minister outline how his Department will monitor their implementation?  It is most important that such monitoring takes place and that the public is fully aware of what is happening.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Bruton made an important speech in the Dáil yesterday which attracted criticism from some members of the Government. The importance of that speech is borne out by an article in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> which reports that visits have been made by members of the IRA to homes in Louth, Armagh and other counties.  During those visits statements are read out to members of the Continuity IRA or the Real IRA in which the IRA threatens to shoot them unless they cease their activities immediately.</P>
    <P>Who is running this country?  This behaviour cannot be allowed to continue.  The IRA must, through Sinn Féin or other channels, make a clear and unequivocal commitment that there will be no more violence.  Will the Minister support Deputy Bruton's call on the IRA to cease these activities?  With regard to the newspaper report to which I referred, what does the Minister intend to do to make it clear that there is only one Government and police force in this country? The Garda Síochána is being armed with this legislation to carry out the wishes of the people and anybody who interferes with that must be dealt with immediately.</P>
    <P>This issue is of critical importance.  As we speak, President Clinton and the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, are meeting in Belfast.  I welcome the progress that has been made between Mr. Trimble and Mr. Adams and the moves that have been made, publicly and privately, to bring all parties to the conflict in the North together.  However, part of that process must be an absolute commitment to an end to violence.  I call on Mr. Adams to condemn the activities of those people who <Col N="893" /> have been active recently in my native county and in other counties.  Their activities must stop immediately.</P>
    <P>Chile had a dreadful regime for many years. One of the television images from that period which I found most affecting was that of the families of people who had been taken away in the dead of night and murdered.  I welcome the decision of the IRA at least to identify and return their dead to these families.  This is an important step forward and shows that within Sinn Féin there is a move towards putting this conflict behind us forever.</P>
    <P>To the Unionist population I say that the liberal and enlightened Protestant tradition which was so alive 200 years ago is still important to us. We want to see a proper meeting of minds between Unionists and Nationalists, North and South, so that we can go forward together into the new millennium, respecting and understanding each others traditions, working together and putting behind us forever the terror, the violence, the bomb and the bullet.  This legislation will do that and I hope it is put into effect soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonLydon" hpid="Mr. Lydon Mr. Lydon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lydon</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of the House I will share my time with Senator Ormonde.</P>
      <P>When I heard of the Omagh bomb and of the scale of the carnage resulting from it I was immediately reminded of the Dublin bombs of 1973.  I was reminded because I was close to one of those bombs and missed it only by a minute or two.  The memory of that still lives with me.  How long will the memory of this outrage live with the people of Omagh?  A long, long time.</P>
      <P>My second thought was of the sheer illogicality of the act.  These people who call themselves the Real IRA would probably claim they are following in the footsteps of the men of 1916.  There is no comparison between these thugs and the men of 1916.  At that time Ireland was oppressed but now we are a free and sovereign nation in the Republic and in the Six Counties there is no longer oppression.  The only motivation of the people who set that bomb can have been to upset the peace process.  In doing so they opposed the greatest democratic decision ever reached here when people North and South voted for peace. They not only opposed the wishes of the people, they opposed the Irish, British and American Governments and even the paramilitary groups to which they had sometimes belonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret the necessity to introduce legislation of this nature.  Mindless acts of terrorism generally force Governments into producing very oppressive legislation but I am glad to see the Government has limited the life of this legislation to two years and I hope it will not need to be renewed. I hope that at long last we will have excised this cancer from our society.  We know that in Britain the Prevention of Terrorism Act is renewed year after year.  That was perhaps necessary before the beginning of the peace process.  Some questions must be asked concerning this legislation but I agreed with the Minister when he said we cannot <Col N="894" /> avoid introducing this legislation unless we are prepared to give these people a free rein to wreak havoc and terror on the people.</P>
    <P>As well as remembering those killed by the bomb, including two unborn children, we must remember those who were physically injured or who suffered psychological trauma and who must try to put their lives together again.  Even as we send messages of sympathy we realise that words cannot express how we feel.  I go to Omagh frequently and know the people well there.  It is a small town where people get on well together.</P>
    <P>Another bomb was intercepted while, apparently, being driven to the Grand National at Aintree.  What would have happened if that 2,000 lb.  bomb had exploded accidentally on a ferry? The people who plant these bombs are mindless. They care nothing for God or man and I can see no way of stopping them except through this legislation which though repressive, is necessary. I am delighted it will only apply for two years. Hopefully, we have eventually reached the end of the violence.  Most of the paramilitary groups are on side and all the people are at one in seeking peace.  The international community, including the American Government, is behind us.  Only a handful of people now want to wreck the peace process.  They have no excuse and no mandate from us or from any part of the nation to continue making bombs and destroying lives by blowing people to smithereens.  It must stop; this is the time.  That is why I will be supporting the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Government for its speedy response to the awful atrocity in Omagh.  We have reassembled to make our feelings about that tragedy known and to convey our sympathy and solidarity with the maimed victims and the families of those who died.  Many of the injured are still in hospital and they will have to live with the after effects of the bombing for the rest of their lives.</P>
      <P>This was a reckless attack on the community. Catholics and Protestants, going about their daily shopping on a Saturday afternoon, suddenly found themselves confronted with the work of these awful thugs who parked their car bomb in the middle of a busy street and walked away. They have yet to come forward and say they are guilty of this atrocity.  They are cowards, not men. They call themselves Irishmen; they are blackguards of the first order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Words are not enough to describe the atrocity. I find it hard to express how I felt on Saturday, 15 August, when I saw the tragedy on television that evening.  It spoiled that lovely holiday evening for everyone in Ireland.  Some of us who were ready to go out and enjoy ourselves did not do so after hearing the news.  We were not in a fit state to understand what had happened.  It took at least three or four days for the extent of this enormous tragedy to penetrate people's minds. There must be no more Omaghs, no more violence. The British-Irish Agreement clearly indicated that North and South, Catholics and Protestants, <Col N="895" /> Unionists and Nationalists, people of all creeds gave a mandate for peace.  That is what we must work on.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement is here to stay. The strength of public opinion has brought us here to introduce this very harsh legislation. However, we did not bring it about; it was the bombers who did so.  Because of what happened in Omagh people said we had better work for them and we have a mandate to reflect public opinion.</P>
    <P>Many people told me they were delighted the House was being recalled today and asked me to speak out for them.  People do not have any difficulty with this legislation.  They will, of course, be concerned that it may be harsh in some respects, but I have great trust in the Government's ability to implement it.  As the Minister said, the legislation will be monitored, especially where there may be weaknesses.  The decision to review the legislation in two years time is evidence that the Minister is aware of the public apprehension and concern about civil liberties.</P>
    <P>The focus of the legislation is not on everyone, but on those who set out to maim and kill people in Omagh on 15 August.  It is up to everyone in Ireland to ensure that those responsible are brought to justice.  We all have a responsibility to help the Government and the Garda to bring justice to every part of this country.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement is here to stay. This is evident in the co-ordinated approach of the British and Irish Governments.  President Clinton is in Ireland at present for no other purpose than to strengthen the Agreement.</P>
    <P>There is no way forward with violence.  There is no shortcut to this approach other than to state that the bombing is over, the legislation is enacted, and there is dialogue, trust and commitment. That is the way forward to peace.</P>
    <P>The memories of the Omagh tragedy will live with us for the rest of our lives.  Many young people were affected.  On television recently I saw a young boy whose arms were heavily bandaged due to the burns he received in that awful tragedy.  That picture stays with me.  The boy will be marked for life.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am delighted to support this legislation. I want peace in Ireland and to reflect the wishes of our forebearers.  I want to be sure that democracy will continue to play an important role.</P>
    <P>There has been no shortcut in our approach to this legislation.  We must implement it.  The public is crying out for it.  It is the power of the people which is working here today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As I watched the funerals in Omagh I was reminded of another funeral, that of my brother-in-law, which I attended in Portadown some years ago.  As we talked with his then fatherless children, I remember saying that surely this is the end, that nothing could be worse than this, because those who believed that violence is <Col N="896" /> the answer had committed that crime.  Yet those violent acts continued.  Therefore, I welcome the Minister's words.  I support the goals of the Government and the objectives and aims of the Minister.  I hope that what we are attempting to achieve in this legislation is that we will never again see the expression of hopelessness which we saw in the eyes of mothers who lost their children, wives who lost their husbands, fathers who lost their children and children who lost their parents. I hope we will never have to look into the eyes of those we saw at the funerals in Omagh just a couple of weeks ago.  Today the Minister is sending a message about our abhorrence of violence and about our aspiration in this legislation to crush those who promote that violence.</P>
      <P>However, I struggle with my concerns about this Bill.  The headline in <i>The Irish Times</i> today stated that this Bill will pass all Stages and will be signed into law tonight.  That was clear.  The article did not state, &ldquo;it is hoped to&rdquo; or that this is the objective but that this will happen.  It did not state that without concern and recognition that it will happen.  I know it will happen but, let us be careful that we do not send another message that we care little for some of the values which underpin the institutions of this State.  Over the past five years I have spoken in this House of my worries about &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation, of my concern about the Seanad being a rubber stamp. I stated that I have great difficulty with legislation which is steamrolled through in one day because that means no amendments will be accepted and that we will not have time to scrutinise the Bill. In this case, it means that it will not just be steamrolled through the Seanad, but that it is being done for understandable reasons.</P>
      <P>I understand the Minister's objectives but I am concerned that in pushing this Bill through with such haste it is not receiving the attention it deserves.  Is it not an irony that the legislation which receives the least scrutiny is the very legislation that most needs it as it deals with basic human freedom?  Is it not also an irony that we, as parliamentarians, who routinely wring our hands with concern about the lack of respect that others hold for the political process are prepared to undermine the institutions of parliament by rubber-stamping hastily prepared legislation?  I urge the Minister to listen carefully to the debate and to give serious concern on Committee Stage to what is being said.  Sixty amendments tabled for discussion on Committee Stage in the Dáil did not receive proper discussion.</P>
      <P>I understand what we are trying to do but we must be very careful that in attempting to achieve the very worthy objectives of peace and stability we do not create bigger difficulties.  The introduction of &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; legislation in Britain resulted in bad decision-making by courts such as arose in cases in Birmingham, Guilford and many others. The onus is on us to scrutinise this Bill and pay it all the attention we can.  We must ensure that what comes into being will be legislation that does what we wish it to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> Senator Henry has tabled an amendment for Committee Stage in relation to the committing of an offence if, &ldquo;there is an omission by the accused to deny a statement of his involvement in an illegal organisation&rdquo;.  In her Second Stage speech, Senator Henry spoke about how we have all had something written about us on occasions.  Sometimes it is advisable not to deny it; sometimes it is impossible to get a denial.  I understand what the Minister is trying to do but I am concerned that we are not affording this legislation, with most worthy objectives, the time and scrutiny it deserves by rushing it through this and the other House.  We do not welcome the introduction of that type of legislation.  The Minister told us it is essential and we accept that.  I have not heard anyone suggest we should not put this legislation in place.</P>
    <P>We all believe that the British-Irish Agreement will work; we have to believe that.  We must not allow anyone to block it or bomb us out of it.</P>
    <P>At a meeting with the Food Marketing Institute in Chicago some months ago I was asked to briefly explain the British-Irish Agreement &mdash; they actually asked me to explain the history of Ireland and Northern Ireland in about ten minutes.  I used the opportunity to tell the Americans how much we appreciated the great work done by Senator George Mitchell and President Clinton whom I welcome to Ireland.  We know we have a much better chance of ensuring the British-Irish Agreement will bring peace and stability to our country as a result of the help we are receiving from these people.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the arguments being put forward.  I welcome that this legislation will cease to exist in two years unless we decide to renew it.  I am convinced that if we are very careful about how we handle this legislation and if it is not abused there will be no need for it in two years.</P>
    <P>No one is pleased by the introduction of legislation of this type but everyone is satisfied that its aims and objectives will be achieved.  Let us not leave this House this evening and state that the Oireachtas has completed its work.  The legislation will not provide the panacea to solve our problems, it is merely the first step.  The next step will be to see how the courts interpret the legislation. If we do not give the Bill the detailed consideration and attention it requires, there is a danger it will be overturned by the courts.  In the past legislation passed by both Houses which had not been given adequate attention proved to be unenforceable.</P>
    <P>In the coming years we will be obliged to rely on the forces of law and order to use the legislation as we intend it to be used.  Everyone appreciates the wonderful work carried out by the Garda Síochána in the past 12 months in intercepting explosive devices, particularly the bomb discovered at Dún Laoghaire which was destined for the Aintree Grand National. However, such work will not continue unless it <Col N="898" /> has the support of all citizens.  The responsibility for this rests not only on us, as legislators, or on the enforcers of law and order, the Garda Síochána, but on us as citizens.  We must support the forces of law and order to ensure there will be no need for this legislation in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister is correct to state that the legislation will not be needed in two years.  He will be proven right if we continue to take steps such as those taken in Dundalk in recent weeks where people who seemed to support or were unwilling to condemn the Omagh bombing found themselves being isolated by citizens who stated they did not wish to have any truck with them.  The citizens said they did not wish those people to have a voice which will destroy our democracy and were not going to allow the use of the bomb and the bullet to continue.  The people said they were not going to allow themselves to be bombed out of peace and that the people of this island, particularly those in Northern Ireland, deserved peace.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's objectives and I congratulate him on the effort he has put into drafting the legislation.  However, I urge him to be cautious and to give the legislation serious consideration so that it will have its intended effect, namely, to ensure that peace is brought to this island.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  Saturday, 15 August 1998, will be recorded as one of the worst and most horrific days in Irish history when 28 innocent men, women and children were killed in Omagh, an event which has outraged people throughout the world.  No words could express our condemnation of this act, which was carried out at the peak of Saturday afternoon shopping in Omagh.</P>
      <P>I join with the Leas-Chathaoirleach and Members in expressing sincere and heartfelt sympathy to the bereaved relatives and friends of the victims of this terrible act.  I wish those detained in hospital recovering from injuries received as a result of the bombing an early return to full health.  Some received serious injuries which will result in permanent disability.  We assure these unfortunate victims of our prayers and good wishes.</P>
      <P>The British and Irish Governments have reaffirmed their commitment to the British-Irish Agreement and are actively engaged in moving forward its implementation in all its aspects.  They are determined to approve this response to the Omagh tragedy.  In my home area of Monaghan and Cavan many people have been touched by this tragedy through death or serious injury caused to a relative or loved one and I offer my sympathy and support to them especially.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="899" /> When the House adjourned for the summer recess all of us hoped that violence and bombings were left to history books with the new era of peace and harmony dawning on this island.  The massive endorsement by the people, North and South, of the Agreement on 22 May showed an overwhelming demand for peace and a rejection of violence and armed conflict.</P>
    <P>However, the Omagh bombers cannot and will not be allowed to damage the future envisaged in the Agreement.  I compliment the Taoiseach, Prime Minister Blair, David Trimble, his deputy, Seamus Mallon, the Unionist leaders, John Hume, Gerry Adams and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on their leadership at a very difficult time for our people.  They have throughout the building of the peace process shown outstanding political leadership through their reactions and they continue to work to move the process forward to ensure the tragedy of Omagh is never repeated.</P>
    <P>All of us must send a clear message to those who want to destroy the Agreement that they cannot and will not be allowed to destroy the will of the people.  Every measure must be used to break any group which does not represent the way forward and offers only despair to all communities. The Bill will assist in bringing about the peace and stability to which all of us look forward. I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House.</P>

      <P>I regret we must welcome the Minister to the House, but I compliment him on his speedy response to the Omagh bombing by bringing the Bill before the House.  The measures in it have been described as draconian, but the individuals who carried out such a barbaric, cowardly act as a result of which innocent people, mainly children and young adolescents, were murdered in cold blood, deserve nothing more than the most severe punishment that we, as legislators, can impart to them.  One funeral that stands out in my mind was that of Avril Monaghan and her baby daughter Maura.  The depth of feeling on that occasion between people North and South, Protestant and Catholic, Unionist and Nationalist was clearly palpable.  No measure introduced here could alleviate the pain and suffering of these people.  It is our responsibility, however, to ensure that what happened in Omagh is never repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have had serious reservations if the word of a superintendent or an RUC constable were enough to convict an individual, but we know that the right to silence has meant that a number of individuals have escaped justice in recent years.  I welcome the fact that the inference from their failure to answer questions or give a full account of their actions in relation to a particular offence may be treated as a corroboration of evidence.  These individuals are extremely intelligent, manipulative and conniving and rule the roost from a distance, far from their intended <Col N="900" /> targets.  They sit on their laurels, issuing orders whereas some gullible creature will, for a few pounds, drive the car with the bomb.  It is my sincere hope that this Bill will ensure the top dogs who direct unlawful organisations, be they Quartermaster General, General Master, or Director will be brought into the net.  I hope this Bill will manage to bring these people to task because to date many of them have been able to avoid the law as a result of information being withheld.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the Bill say it infringes on civil liberties.  Have they thought anything of the civil liberties of those who have lost their lives in Omagh?  For example, did they think of the civil liberties of the unborn Monaghan twins in Augher?  Those who oppose the Bill have not mentioned them.  The Irish people want peace and it is our duty to try to bring it about.  If it takes draconian measures to bring this about, that must be accepted and endorsed by all straight thinking people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, may I make an important point at this stage?  When this Bill was going through the other House, a very specific commitment was given by the Minister that there would be an annual review and this was conveyed to the Opposition Deputies.  This was not dealt with specifically last evening because the amendments were all guillotined together but commitments were given and reported in the Dáil debates.  However, the amendment as it appears today is very different from what we were told. There will not be the annual review that we had been promised.  Either this is a major breach of faith on the part of the Minister and his Department or is the result of a major cock-up.  One way or the other it is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>This party supported the Bill under pressure yesterday on the clear understanding that this provision would be part of the Bill.  I want the Minister to know that my party will be dictated to in its vote by whether this commitment is met. A very clear commitment was made by the Minister in the Dáil yesterday.  We acted in good faith having been assured that the drafting would reflect the annual review.  It does not.  The Minister's officials are aware of what has happened and I will have to receive a full explanation from the Minister.  We want the original points we made addressed.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  It is unfortunate that this House has to meet to consider such legislation. The death of 28 innocent people in Omagh in such tragic circumstances brought shame to this country and inflicted terrible suffering and grief on the families concerned.  It was an evil act that everybody castigates.  It is important that <Col N="901" /> people both inside and outside this House ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice.</P>
      <P>Almost three weeks have passed since that terrible atrocity and I wonder why it has taken that long for legislation to be introduced in these Houses.  The Taoiseach stated that there are only 100 people involved in the RIRA, 50 of whom are in the North and 50 in the South.  It is extraordinary that in the past two-and-a-half weeks we have not heard reports of these people being arrested or questioned.</P>
      <P>I understand that under the 1976 Act the Minister could introduce a special set of emergency measures under which these people could be arrested and questioned.  Instead we have this legislation, 50 per cent of which is commendable but one must seriously question the other 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The response to this tragedy has been slow.  We have had a great deal of lip-service in recent weeks but little action.  That is unfortunate.  One could argue that the legislation before us will enable the necessary action to be taken but that action could have been taken under existing legislation and resulted in a swift response.</P>
      <P>Certain elements of the Bill are welcome but others are unnecessary.  In a time of crisis it is important to keep a level head and cautiously assess the situation.  It is important also that the response is not an emotional one to match public anger.  In any state where there is a proper system of law and order it is fundamental that the rule of law applies and that the rights of individuals are protected.  As Senator Leonard said, the murderers who committed this atrocity did not have any consideration for the right to life of the 28 people killed.</P>
      <P>It is appalling that a group of people can form a semi-political organisation, give themselves a name like RIRA and deem themselves worthy of special consideration.  They are murderers and to put an umbrella other than that of murder over their heads is despicable.  It is vitally important that the provisions we are introducing do not give recognition to the people who classify themselves in this way.  They want to be put into a special type of political category but they are simply murderers and should be treated accordingly.  They should be arrested and brought before the courts. I am disappointed that has not happened in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the specifics of the Bill, fundamental amendments were tabled yesterday in the Dáil on Committee and Report Stages.  We are familiar with the procedure of grouping amendments together and voting on them as a group, but the Minister gave a clear commitment yesterday evening in the Dáil to accept a Fine Gael amendment proposing an annual review.  The Bill published this morning does not include that, nor do any of the amendments which were accepted and included in the Bill refer in any way to an annual review.  I hope the Minister can have that matter rectified before this House rises this evening.  This is a fundamental issue of principle in relation to <Col N="902" /> the very ethos of this Bill, in relation to the rule of law, to civil liberties and the rights of citizens. It is important that it be accepted.  The Minister accepted our proposition yesterday but for some reason it is not in the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann yesterday.  It is important that it be accepted because of the content of the Bill and particularly because of the nature of some of its sections.  Some of these sections were accepted by Fine Gael because it was felt that on balance there was a need to pass them and also because it was agreed to include the amendment I mentioned. I hope the Minister can respond positively.</P>
    <P>Section 2 deals specifically with associations. Subsection (4) refers to any question material to the investigation, including references to any questions requesting the accused to give a full account of his or her movements, actions, activities or associations during any specific period.  No definition has been given in regard to associations. This is an important issue.  What type of association are we talking about?  Are we talking about an association with a person?  Are we talking about being involved in an organisation?  Will it be the case that if a person meets somebody who is involved in some type of illegal activity or some illegal organisation and is seen in discussion with him or her on the corner of a street for half an hour, that person has associated with that person? If a person attends the funeral of such a person, does that mean that under this section he or she is considered to be associated with an illegal organisation?  Those important questions were not clearly answered in the debate in the Dáil yesterday, nor have any clear answers been given since.  The fact that the decision rests with one Garda superintendent places a huge onus on that officer and also puts people at grave risk.  All it would take would be for one Garda superintendent to make a misjudgment for there to be a serious miscarriage of justice.  That is why it is important that the legislation be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Section 4(1) refers to activities or associations on the part of the accused person.  Many aspects of the Bill, such as section 12 and the training of persons in the use of firearms, will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  Many issues need to be addressed and I alert the Minister to the fundamental error in the Bill published today in relation to the general understanding in the other House yesterday.  I ask the Minister, and his officials, to consider this matter and ensure that the annual review provision is included in the Bill passed by this House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not witnessed such scenes since the troubles started in the North of Ireland on 5 October 1968 following a banned civil rights <Col N="903" /> march and all that ensued.  That event brought into focus the difficulties which obtained in the six north-eastern counties.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, for the alacrity with which he responded to the outrageous events in Omagh.</P>
    <P>Many people may describe the Bill as draconian, but drastic measures are needed to deal with drastic situations.  The people responsible for the introduction of the legislation are those who perpetrated the outrage in Omagh on 15 August.  In light of that grotesque attack, the Government had to respond in a firm manner to ensure that the police authorities have the appropriate powers to confront and defeat the violent opponents of the peace process.  The legislation is a measured and balanced response.  It is proportionate to the threat posed by the activities of the group which carried out the atrocity in Omagh.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for all right thinking people, and those with a command of language, to find words to describe the atrocity that was committed in the name of republicanism.  The people involved do not know the meaning of the word.  I stood before the electorate as a republican and was democratically mandated by them.  I am proud to be a republican, but it is regrettable that those people described themselves as republicans.  They are involved in the slaughter of innocent people, of three generations and unborn children.  They are everything that is wrong, evil, heinous and vile. Unfortunately, my limitation in the use of English precludes me from adequately saying what I wish to say about these sub-humans.  I will not describe them an animals because animals would not behave in that manner.</P>
    <P>New offences are created by the Bill, including the direction of unlawful organisations, the possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences, the unlawful collecting of information, the withholding of information and the training of persons in the making or use of firearms. These are important steps.  The people who carried out the outrage in Omagh were well versed in the making and use of explosives.  No form of animal would herd people into a place of slaughter.  It might have happened in the 1940s but not with the same cold and callous planning.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be reviewed in June 2000.  I am confident, given the momentum generated by the peace process, that its provisions will not be required thereafter.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement was overwhelmingly supported by the people, North and South, and by democratic politicians on both sides of the divide.  The Real IRA which perpetrated the atrocity in Omagh does not have a democratic mandate and is blind to the wishes of the people. It must be defeated by whatever manner possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the visit of President Clinton who helped to underpin the British-Irish Agreement as it will ensure the structures envisaged are put in place.  The Government must be congratulated <Col N="904" /> on taking the initiative in guaranteeing the Real IRA will be defeated.  The Taoiseach must be congratulated on maintaining close contact, especially in the past week, with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair.</P>
    <P>Those who profess to be the defenders of civil liberties are concerned about these measures. The Government aims to defend life.</P>

      <P>The Omagh bombing has left an indelible scar on the landscape of our history.  There can be no equivocation.  The senseless slaughter of young and old has united all the people of the island in sadness and revulsion.  The State must respond to this appalling atrocity in which many were injured and maimed by taking strong and effective action to prevent a recurrence.  I compliment the Minister on not over-reacting by introducing internment.</P>
      <P>This legislation, though undesirable, is necessary. Its implementation must be closely monitored as any miscarriages of justice would provide recruiting fodder for the paramilitaries, as happened previously.  Similar legislation has been passed in the House of Commons.  The Government will have to be vigilant to prevent excesses, as happened previously in Britain perhaps born out of prejudice on the part of certain elements of the establishment against Irish people.  This would allow the paramilitaries to flourish by attracting young people to join and to engage in propaganda.</P>
      <P>It is my desire that the British will leave this island and that there will be a united Ireland with its people living in peace, harmony and friendship. The British-Irish Agreement provides a framework to pursue this goal.  We must first reconcile the differing traditions to move ahead with confidence and assurance.  The Omagh bombing, and similar acts, serve only to undermine this effort.  I call on those still engaged in paramilitary activity to desist.  They harm the cause they pretend to espouse.  We hope the perpetrators of the slaughter of the innocents at Omagh will be brought to justice, just as we regret the failure to bring to justice those responsible for the Dublin and Monaghan bombings which were similar atrocities in the 1970s.  The Taoiseach today recalled the vision of the United Irishmen in bringing together Protestant, Catholic and dissenter. Irishmen everywhere should be determined to fulfil this vision now that that opportunity has been given to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many others, I do not like this Bill.  I had a record for many years before becoming a Senator of opposing such legislation. My only previous visit to the House prior to my election in 1987 was in 1984 when a member of the Cathaoirleach's party voted against the party whip on a criminal justice Bill.  That person was <Col N="905" /> recently elevated to the Bench and is now deploying justice in a different way.</P>
      <P>This is desperately uncompromising legislation. I recognise the difficulties my fellow countyman, the Minister, has in dealing with this situation and there is no right way to deal with it.  Having a philosophical frame of reference regarding this Bill, I feel that any reasonable democrat reading it would say that any democratic system of government has the right to defend itself and to use force to do so.  I have never been a pacifist, though I have strong views on neutrality and sovereignty. Our Constitution gives us the right to declare war, and though I would never want to do so, it is important to see the constitutional and philosophical base for our legal system.  Our laws also allow for martial law to be implemented when democracy seeks to defend itself.</P>
      <P>There are people who claim they are involved in a war in the North and are applying their own rules.  That is the only justification and basis for draconian legislation.  I compliment the Taoiseach for describing it as draconian before it was published, though his spin doctors were probably telling him to get his reaction in first.  However, it is more than that.  It is a clear indication from the Government of what they need to do.  I do not like aspects of this legislation, and I will deal with those on Committee Stage.  I have great sympathy for the Government and I do not intend to vote against the Bill.</P>
      <P>However, it is crucially important with legislation like this to have a constraint that limits its power.  Democrats, voters and commentators must be reassured that we have not gone a bridge too far.  An element of consensus has emerged and in that regard I ask the Minister to reconsider section 18.  The Dáil debates indicate clearly that both he and the Opposition accepted there should be an annual review built into the Bill. That is a wise precaution and it is a measure of the Minister's confidence in dealing with issues that he accepted the substance of the amendment, which creates a restriction.  It is also positive, as it looks to a time beyond our current problems when we will no longer need this type of legislation and when we can hope for peace and the normal process of law and order.</P>
      <P>There is likely to be a fairly substantial row this evening about what the Minister did and did not say last night.  The Minister did what he did in good faith and his actions were accepted in good faith.  I have no doubt the Minister, and others, intended section 18 to contain a provision for an annual review.  I have no doubt my colleagues in Fine Gael will push this very strongly when we are debating that section and that Members will find themselves in the usual wrangle.  I understand a commitment was given in good faith by the Minister and he expected it to be included. That was accepted by the other side.  However, it was not included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things can be done.  The Minister can face this down and ignore the fact commitments were given or accept an amendment.  In terms of practical <Col N="906" /> politics, accepting an amendment would mean the recall of the Dáil and the Seanad and the deferment of the signing of the Bill.  Whether we like it or not, that would create great difficulties.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said: &ldquo;Amendment No. 45a seeks to ensure that if sections of the Bill are renewed they should be subject to an annual review by the Oireachtas.  I propose to meet Deputy Flanagan's point.&rdquo; That is the commitment he gave last night.  I wish to put forward a proposal to deal with this situation.  In his reply to Second Stage, will the Minister give a commitment to table an amendment to this Bill on the first sitting day in October?  An error has been made and it is not the Minister's fault.  He gave a fair and honourable commitment and he is in an impossible situation in terms of meeting it.  The way to deal with it would be to give a commitment, which I would accept, to table a further amendment on the first sitting day in October to what would then be the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1998.  Effectively, that would allow the Minister to meet his commitment and ensure the consensus in the Lower House is met.  It is important that we can trust each other when dealing with these issues.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects of the Bill with which I have problems.  Section 8 states: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences&rdquo;. That provision is too wide.  I do not know what it means and it could apply to anything.  The word &ldquo;useful&rdquo; is the wrong word and the words &ldquo;crucial&rdquo; or &ldquo;essential&rdquo; should be used or else the word &ldquo;useful&rdquo; should be removed.  The section should read: &ldquo;. which is of such a nature that it is likely to be used in the commission of an offence&rdquo;.  A piece of paper, a book or a piece of metal could be useful.  That is a serious flaw in the section.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Senator Ryan, has spoken about the definition of firearms which applies to objects it was never intended to apply, such as pellet guns and so on.  When we debate the Bill in detail on Committee Stage other issues will arise.  An error has been made in not honouring a commitment given last night to include a provision for an annual review.  I appeal to the Minister to table an amendment on the first sitting day in October. I accept it is not the Minister's fault the commitment has not been honoured.  He cannot be expected to check every word altered, but he must take responsibility for this legislation.  He will be asked tonight to accept an amendment, but he will find it impossible to do so.  This Bill will be signed by the Presidential Commission tonight and, rather than stand in the way of that, the concerns on both sides of the House could be addressed if the Minister gave his word that he would table a simple amendment to one section of the Bill on the first sitting day of the next session. That would enhance his reputation as a man of his word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my words to those uttered in this House today by the Taoiseach, the Minister, and Members condemning in forthright terms what happened in Omagh.  Many words have been spoken on that subject and I do not intend to add to them.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with much of what Senator O'Toole said about this legislation which is not welcome.  The reason we are debating it is because of the recent deaths of so many and the outrage we experienced barely two weeks ago. The fact that happened at a time when we had hoped we were finally building, albeit in its early fragile stages, a lasting peace on this island and making progress made the atrocity all the more difficult to take and all the more tragic.</P>
      <P>This legislation is not welcome because we are taking a major risk in guessing it might work.  The atmosphere in which it is being discussed is not a good one in which to pass such legislation.  A proper balance must be struck.  Despite that, and having regard to the background against which this legislation is being discussed, we find we have no option but to support it due to our sense of outrage and because we want to send a strong signal to those responsible for this atrocity.  That is our gut instinct and reflects our emotions.  We are speaking from our hearts rather than our heads when we say we have no option but to support this legislation.  We want to send a strong message to those who are responsible for this outrage that they have no place in our democracy, that they do not speak for us, for those who died, for the injured, for those who have worked so hard for peace and those who support the cause of peace and they never will have that support. This legislation is our way of saying that, although it should not be the only way to express our shock, grief and outrage.</P>
      <P>Despite this atmosphere we must ask ourselves as legislators and as leaders how best we can honour the memories of those who died not only in this atrocity, but in others.  The Taoiseach referred to the Quinn children and other Members referred to other atrocities on this island.  How best can we honour the memories of all those who have died in this awful way in the past 30 years?  How can we best advance the cause of peace?  We know in our hearts and souls that this legislation on its own is only a small part of the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was out of the country when this atrocity was committed in my name and in the names of others.  I did not become aware of it until 48 hours after it had happened and I found it hard to take it in.  I still find it hard to take it in because I did not share in the outpouring of grief.  I did not see the television pictures or hear the radio interviews. I have heard about them since and of the great emotion expressed in them.  People close to me whose judgment I greatly respect told me of their reaction &mdash; that these people must be found and incarcerated &mdash; and of the great anger and outrage which arose amidst the shared national grief.  In many senses I missed that, although it <Col N="908" /> does not mean I am less angry than anyone else that this was supposedly carried out in my name.</P>
    <P>Having read British newspapers while I was abroad, it was clear that almost immediately some good came from the atrocity.  First, the families of those who died or who were severely injured and their communities stated their desire that the peace process would continue and that peace would flourish.  Second, the outrage was strongly condemned by Sinn Féin.  The result of both factors and the shared national grief and outrage was the utter, complete and total isolation of those responsible for the bombing.  I do not believe that will change.  The strength of public opinion and outrage has been the most significant factor in the immediate aftermath of the outrage. Legislation such as this is probably much less powerful than the strength of shared public opinion and the huge desire that peace would grow and that what happened should be consigned to the past.</P>
    <P>In that regard, it must be seen that this is a small response to the outrage of Omagh and that our greatest energies must be put into developing the cause of peace and ensuring political dialogue continues.  There are hopeful signs that, in the coming days, we will see a sea change in the politics of Northern Ireland and that, while there are difficulties to be overcome, we may see in the future the development of what we have dreamed of, desired and hoped for, the reality of peace and democracy in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regarding the details of the legislation, other Senators on this side of the House expressed their concern about certain elements of it.  I support some measures, such as the creation in section 6 of a new offence of directing an unlawful organisation. I am sure it is directed at &ldquo;General&rdquo;-type people who never dirty their hands with Semtex but who are happy, in a cynical and evil fashion, to direct operations and to send their footsoldiers to do their dirty work.  The legislation is well framed and clear and uses good language in this regard.  It is a section with which I find myself very much in agreement.</P>
    <P>Senator O'Toole referred to the section on information and I share his concerns in that regard.  It is drafted in too wide a fashion and is not welcome.  We will table an amendment regarding the videotaping of evidence which we consider extremely important in terms of the balance of the Bill to ensure that those who are innocent are not abused.</P>
    <P>I find it hard at the same time as this is happening to understand the atmosphere which has been generated around the case of Elaine Moore which is very much on our minds.  An innocent Irish person has found herself in difficult circumstances simply because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  In effect, she is a suspect because of her nationality.  In that context I agree with Senator Walsh that we must be careful when responding to an outrage.  I hope the Government will be vigilant on behalf of Irish citizens, particularly those in Britain, in an atmosphere created <Col N="909" /> by those who never have or will speak or act on behalf of the Irish people.</P>

      <P>Is mian liom tacú leis an méid a dúirt gach cainteoir eile anseo, gur chuir an t-uafás san Ómaigh náire orainn uilig.  Is trua go raibh orainn teacht ar ais anseo chomh tapa sin tar éis an dul chun cinn a bhí déanta sa Tuaisceart.  Déanaimid comhbhrón le gach uile dhuine a raibh baint acu leis an méid a tharla san Ómaigh agus tá súil agam nach dtarlóidh a leithéid arís.</P>
      <P>Many have expressed an appreciation of the difficulty faced by the Minister and the manner in which he has handled that difficulty.  Many have also expressed reservations and concerns about emergency legislation such as this. However, the 30 people who died in Omagh were denied the most fundamental civil liberty, the right to life.  Many of those maimed will never again have the equal opportunity enjoyed by the rest of us.  The relatives of those killed or injured have had their dreams and hopes shattered for all time.  All of this is the legacy of the Omagh bomb and the reason this legislation is before the House.</P>
      <P>Any true democrat will state that emergency legislation may serve democracy but seldom enhances it.  The brutality of the Omagh outrage was in stark contrast to the hope and vision engendered by the British-Irish Agreement.  It was a reminder of the dark pit of depression and inhumanity from which we had emerged.  The Agreement was negotiated by the tireless and patriotic efforts of all the partners and was ratified by the people.  It was also a foretaste of the seemingly impossible being achieved.  In extending sympathy to those who have suffered, honouring the memory of those who died and offering some glimmer of hope to those traumatised by this terrible event, it behoves all people of goodwill to redouble their efforts to bring the British-Irish Agreement to fruition.</P>
      <P>It has been said many times that there must never be another Omagh.  There must also never be another act of aggression by one human being against another on this island.  Above all, under no circumstances must we allow ourselves to drift back to the hell from which we have emerged.</P>
      <P>It was always expected that the peace process would face many challenges.  However, no one envisaged that the challenge would be so devastating and inflict so much pain and suffering as to reduce a normal and friendly people to a traumatised, frightened and helpless community. However, from that naked grief grew a spirit of support, consolation and, hopefully, renewed hope.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who have not joined the peace process, have missed the significance of the British-Irish Agreement and ignored the expressed will of the people, but they could not in all humanity ignore the cries of those who suffered in Omagh, cries which tore at all our hearts.  The war is, indeed, over for all time.  It is a time for positive action, <Col N="910" /> reconciliation, healing of wounds and the building of friendship and co-operation.  It is a time for unity of purpose, working together for the common good, celebrating our common heritage while respecting our differences and enhancing our lives through diversity.  This will require courage, dedication and commitment and, in God's name, let us not waste time or opportunity to this end.</P>
    <P>It is the hope of each and every person, expressed in the Dáil and the Seanad and by ordinary men, women and children, that it will still be possible to maintain the momentum of the British-Irish Agreement.  Many of the statements we have heard in recent days &mdash; statements which have been welcomed by the different leaders &mdash; give us the hope that it is still possible to create a further momentum because that is the only real answer we can give to the people in Omagh who have suffered, and all the people of Ireland whether at home or abroad.  Every opportunity should be availed of in the coming months to promote the type of policies to which I have referred, which are positive in thrust and have the common goal of working for all the people on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank sincerely all 22 contributors to the debate &mdash; Senators Connor, O'Donovan, Ross, Ryan, Hayes, Manning, Jackman, Keogh, Henry, Liam Fitzgerald, Costello, Lanigan, O'Dowd, Lydon, Ormonde, Quinn, O'Brien, Leonard, Walsh, O'Toole, O'Meara and Ó Murchú.  This is indicative of the importance the House attaches to this legislation.  It is a tribute to the House and it is appropriate the legislation should receive that level of debate from Members.</P>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised, some of which are of fundamental importance, not least the whole issue of the burden of proof.  This issue was raised specifically in relation to section 7, which deals with the possession of articles for purposes connected with certain offences, section 8, which deals with the whole question of the unlawful collection of information, and section 12, which deals with training persons in the making or use of firearms, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of section 7 it will be a defence for a person charged to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the article in question was not in his or her possession or under his or her control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of a specified explosives or firearms offence.  Likewise in the context of section 8, which deals with the unlawful collection of information, it will be a defence for a person to prove that the information in question was not being collected or in his or her possession for the purpose of its being used for the commission of any such offence.  A similar issue arises in the context of section 12 by virtue of the provision that it would be a defence for a person to prove that the giving or receiving of instructions or <Col N="911" /> training in the use of firearms or explosives was done without lawful authority or reasonable cause.</P>
    <P>The effect of the changes proposed in relation to inferences do not represent an interference with the courts responsibility under our criminal law to convict an accused person only where it is satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accused's guilt of the offence charged.  The comment applies equally to the offence created by these sections.  The standard of proof in a criminal trial remains, i.e. the court must be of the view that the individual is guilty of the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.</P>
    <P>I wish to set aside some further misconceptions which arise in this respect.  Clearly in the case of any prosecution it will be a matter in the first instance for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the ingredients of the relevant offence by reference to the terms of the offences themselves.  This will mean, for example, in the context of section 7 that the prosecution will have to prove not only possession of the article in question but possession in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the person had the article in their possession or under their control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence under the firearms or explosive substances Acts.  It will therefore have to show that the circumstances in which the person was in possession of the articles were such that they created such a reasonable suspicion.  Similarly, for the purposes of section 8 it will be a matter for the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the collection, recording or possession of information was likely to be useful in the commission of particular kinds of serious offences by members of an unlawful organisation.  Finally, for the purposes of section 12 similar proof will be necessary concerning the giving or receiving of training in the use of firearms or explosives.</P>
    <P>It is only when such issues as set out are proved that the onus or burden of proof shifts to the defendant.  The effect of an analogous provision under section 27A of the Firearms Act, 1964, was outlined in the case People (DPP) <i>v.</i> Foley of 1995 as follows:</P>
    <P>An accused is entitled in the first instance to call on the prosecution to prove its case.  <i>Prima facie,</i> his situation is that he does not have to give an explanation or give evidence.  But if proof of guilt is forthcoming &mdash; if circumstances are laid before the court of trial that point to the guilt of the accused &mdash; then an accused must attempt to rebut the prosecution case by evidence or else suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>This must stand as reasonable in everyone's eyes. Nobody will argue that an individual should not try to answer a case where the weight of evidence exists and they have a case to answer.  If the individual does not answer the case the court is entitled to accept the evidence of the prosecution <Col N="912" /> in the absence of rebuttal evidence.  I do not think anybody should have a problem with this.</P>
    <P>It is only in the circumstances I have outlined that the burden passes to the accused and that he or she would be expected to show that, for example, possession was not intended for a purpose specified in the relevant section.  Provisions of this kind are in no way extraordinary or unusual, although some Senators sought to establish that they were.  Relevant examples of similar provisions include section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, under which it is an offence for a person to make or possess an explosive substance under such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that it is not being made or possessed for a lawful reason.  It equally provides that it will be a defence to show that it was made by or was in the possession of the person for a lawful object.  There is a similar provision in section 12 of the Offences Against the State Act concerning the offence of possession of an incriminating document.</P>
    <P>Section 27A of the Firearms Act, 1964, provides that a person who has firearms or ammunition in their possession or control in such circumstances as give rise to a reasonable inference that such possession or control is not for a lawful purpose will be guilty of an offence.  Section 9 of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, provides that a person in a public place with a knife or other article which has a blade or is sharply pointed shall be guilty of an offence and that it will be a defence for that person to prove that he has good reason or lawful authority for having the article.</P>
    <P>More generally, some of the concerns which have been expressed in regard to these offences largely ignore the important protections which the criminal justice system incorporates, including the fact that decisions to prosecute offences of this kind would be a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  For example section 7(1) of the Act states:</P>
    <P>A person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she has any article in his or her possession or under his or her control in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession or under his or her control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, or the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990, which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of the Act of 1939.</P>
    <P>Clearly the prosecution would have to establish that was the position and it would be a defence for the person, as stated in subsection (2), to say that at the time of the alleged offence the article was not in the individual's possession or under the individual's control for any purpose specified in subsection (1).</P>
    <P>In the same way, when the Director of Public Prosecutions is considering whether a case should be brought he must take into account whether he <Col N="913" /> has a reasonable chance of proving his case beyond a reasonable doubt before a court.  If it should be the case that the Director of Public Prosecutions is of the view that he does not have that opportunity then he will not bother to bring the case.  It is absolutely farcical for people to argue that the whole burden of proof is being thrown out the window by this legislation.  That is not the position.  It could not be the case.</P>
    <P>There were other arguments in relation to electronic recording.  I favour electronic recording in principle and any opposition which I have expressed to it has only been from a pragmatic point of view.  I am anxious to make progress with the practice of such recording.  It would be wrong to attempt to establish a link between either the operation of the Offences Against the State Acts generally, or provisions of this Bill, to a requirement to record all such interviews at this stage. The principle reason for that is it would be impractical in terms of the stage which preparations for such recordings have reached.  It would not be possible to have a workable scheme in place with sufficient coverage for some time and the measures contained in the Bill are clearly required now.  I should add that the experience of the pilot scheme to date shows that the issues raised by such recordings, and in particular the taking up by detained persons of the right to have interviews recorded, are far more complex than they would appear on the surface.</P>
    <P>The suggestion has been made that the continued operation of this Bill should be linked to the establishment of the human rights commission to which the Government is committed by virtue of the British-Irish Agreement.  The Government is determined to fulfil all of the obligations placed on it under the British-Irish Agreement.  In this respect work is already underway on the preparation of the necessary legislation to enable effect to be given to this commitment in the Department of Justice Equality and Law Reform and it is being given priority.  Whilst I hope to be able to process that legislation within the time scale envisaged, I am not prepared to make the continued operation of the provisions of this Bill, which are necessary in their own right, dependent on the enactment of that legislation.</P>
    <P>Concerns were expressed about the measures in the Bill relating to the right to silence.  I do not accept the proposition that allowing inferences to be drawn from silence in certain specified circumstances represents an unwarranted attack on the rights of an accused person.  Section 5 of the Drug Trafficking Act, 1996, allows such an inference and the provision here mirrors that.  I have also received a report from the expert group which I established to examine changes in criminal law proposed in the report of the Garda SMI steering group.  That group has recommended that such an inference provision be extended to all offences which carry a penalty of five years or more.  That is wider than the proposal in section 5 of the Bill. A very specific inference provision is included in <Col N="914" /> section 2 in regard to membership but I believe that to be warranted in the very particular circumstances of the offence and it strikes the correct balance between the rights of the accused and of society to protect itself from the activities of unlawful organisations.</P>
    <P>With regard to the entire question of forfeiture, it was suggested there might be constitutional difficulties with this proposal because of the guarantees given by the 1937 Constitution provision on the protection of private property.  I am satisfied the Bill, as drafted, will withstand constitutional challenge.  The Attorney General has approved the terms of the Bill and it will be for the courts to ultimately decide on its constitutionality as no individual can be definitive about that.</P>
    <P>Some concern has been expressed about the scope of the offences.  I have already explained the thinking behind individual provisions and their relationship to activities and groups such as the Real IRA and its supporters.  The offences in question are as narrowly drawn as possible in the context of our legislation.</P>
    <P>Senator Ross expressed the view that internment without trial was a better option than what he described as the infringement of civil liberties. The Government was faced with a very stark choice between amendment of the Offences Against the State Acts and internment without trial.  It must be remembered that legislation is amenable to the courts of the land; the courts of this country will, in the final analysis, decide upon the guilt or innocence of an accused person.  Internment without trial is a different matter.  I have tremendous respect for the courts of this country which have served us very well.  Few Supreme Courts throughout the world have so jealously guarded the rights of citizens in the way the Irish Supreme Court has and its decisions in this area are the envy of many countries in the free world.  I have every confidence the courts will uphold the 1937 Constitution which is the ultimate guarantor of human rights and civil liberties.</P>
    <P>The hypothetical argument has been made that if internment without trial had been in operation here over the years, atrocities such as Omagh might not have occurred.  Nobody can answer that.  However, nobody could have expected the Government to have responded to the Agreement arrived at on Good Friday with draconian legislation.  The Real IRA and its activities have been carefully monitored by the Garda over the past year and they have had some very significant successes.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this legislation somehow contains the prospect of an individual being found guilty by his or her association with other individuals.  That is not correct.  An inference may or not be drawn by a court in specific instances; a court will be allowed to consider the fact that an individual did not choose to reply to a question material to the charge.  A court could draw an inference in that respect if, for example, an individual did not take the opportunity of explaining <Col N="915" /> his or her actions, activities, movements or associations.</P>
    <P>None of these inferences of themselves could serve to convict an individual.  Each and all of these could only act by way of corroboration of other evidence, be it physical or the opinion of a chief superintendent of the Garda Síochána. Again, the court would have to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused person.</P>
    <P>The issue of monitoring the legislation has been raised in the context of the Human Rights Commission.  There is a commitment to the Human Rights Commission in the British-Irish Agreement and the Government is proceeding with all possible alacrity to ensure that the human rights commission is established.  However, it is not necessary to have a human rights commission established in tandem with this Bill to oversee its operation.  All of the Bill's provisions are amenable to the courts of the land.</P>
    <P>I agree with some Members that the mindset that lay behind the Omagh bombing has not gone away.  Unfortunately, the people responsible for this atrocity may strike again and that is why this Bill is so necessary and urgent.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with most of the concerns raised by Members during this debate and I will deal with more specific issues on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform shall not exercise any power conferred on the Government or the Minister, as the case may be, by or under any enactment to provide for&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)the release (including temporary release) of prisoners from prisons or places of detention, or</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to ensure that in the case of people who are found guilty of crimes under this legislation the Minister will not have the power to permit early release or remission of punishment, particularly with regard to those <Col N="917" /> convicted of heinous crimes such as the killing of members of the Garda Síochána.  It would be a source of great distress to relatives of victims of such crimes, and God forbid that any more should occur in the future.  Under this amendment, the Minister would not have the power to permit early releases similar to those which have been agreed under the British-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Senator's motive for putting down this amendment.  It is important to make it clear that people who continue to engage in the activities this Bill is designed to address will face the full rigours of the law.  There is no question of people who engage in these activities after the date referred to in the amendment benefiting from the special early release arrangements in the British-Irish Agreement.  However, while I do not intend to undermine that message, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
      <P>The terms of the amendment are too sweeping. It would, for example, apply to all people convicted of scheduled offences after a certain period even though those offences can be committed by people who are not engaged in terrorist activities. It would place an absolute prohibition on release no matter what compelling humanitarian circumstances might arise.  Although those involved in terrorist activities showed little humanitarian concern in their crimes, it would be demeaning of the State to put itself in the position of being unable to respond with appropriate compassion no matter what circumstances arose.  Acceptance of the amendment would prevent a prisoner who might be approaching the end of his sentence and who has a terminal disease from being released on humanitarian grounds, which is not something the House would have me countenance.</P>
      <P>It is a fundamental principle of the governance of the country that the administration of prison sentences is a matter for the Executive.  The effect of the amendment would be to tie the hands of the Executive in fulfilling that objective.  None of my reservations means that I do not share the sentiments behind the amendment but I hope the Senator will accept the reason I cannot support it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a person is arrested for the purpose of detention pursuant to section 30 of the Act of 1939, on suspicion of having committed an offence under section 21 of that Act, he or she shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be removed to, and detained in, a Garda Síochána station to <Col N="918" /> which the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 74 of 1997) apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This refers to a most important matter with regard to safeguards.  My party is anxious to ensure that there are adequate and reasonable safeguards when interviews take place in a Garda station.  The amendment proposes that these be introduced in so far as is reasonably practicable. The amendment is generously phrased when one considers the background to this issue.  Let us consider the background to the provision of safeguards in emergency and other legislation.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provided for the electronic recording of interviews in Garda stations. Judge Martin's report of 1990 recommended that a record be kept of all interrogations in Garda stations.  This Bill allows for 72 hours detention and the evidence which will carry most weight will be that of the Garda superintendent.  Inferences can be drawn from a failure to answer questions or to give a full account of all movements, actions, activities or associations.  It is essential that what is presented before the court is backed up by an audio-visual recording of what happened in the Garda station.  When a Garda superintendent says in evidence that a defendant was silent during the entire period of questioning he or she must be able to back up this evidence with an audio-visual record.  Such a safeguard is essential because a conviction for the offences listed in the Bill could lead to a long sentence.</P>
    <P>Miscarriages of justice have occurred in the past arising out of abuses during interrogations. Gardaí are themselves open to being falsely accused of abuses committed during questioning when no record of questioning is available.  I ask the Minister to ensure that at least one station in every province, in particular the main Garda station in Carrickmacross where many interviews take place, should be designated for conducting interviews under this legislation and should be equipped with audio-visual recording equipment. If that is done many of the concerns about abuse of civil liberties will be allayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's points concerning the curtailment of the right to silence.  The video recording would prove a Garda superintendent's evidence that the accused person did not give evidence and did not speak. In relation to allegations of undue duress being put on prisoners to get confessions or statements, it will be important to have a video recording which will hopefully disprove such allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I made the point that the Minister should set a timetable for having this equipment in as many Garda stations as possible throughout the country.  I imagine one will be required in every Garda station where there is a resident Garda superintendent.  I take it that, currently, such equipment does not exist in divisional <Col N="919" /> headquarters where there are Garda chief superintendents.  The aim must surely be to have such equipment installed in every station where there is a resident Garda superintendent.  While this equipment is expensive it is not enormously so and the Minister would easily be able to fund it from his 1999 budget.  In anticipation of getting all the money he needs to install the equipment in the Garda stations, I have specified that the programme should start now.  The Minister should set a deadline so that at least by this time next year, maybe earlier, the contract for the installation of video equipment will have been carried out in all those places.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment because it is drafted in a reasonable way.  It could be quite useful should those who may be taken into custody, arrested or charged under these provisions, once enacted, contest any of these provisions in court.  I expect they will be contested. In the past 30 years strong legal measures have been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas, which were questioned, challenged or interpreted in the courts to an extent where their original intent was substantially watered down.</P>
      <P>From the first day the Taoiseach responded to the events in Omagh the legislation has been rightly termed draconian.  If, by general acknowledgement, we are introducing the legislation reluctantly but necessarily, we should ensure any proceedings taken under it will stand up to scrutiny at all levels.  The provisions in respect of recording interviews in Garda stations, which are common practice in police forces all over the world, were recommended a long time ago.  There is an onus on us to ensure the draconian laws we are passing will provide the utmost protection not alone to suspects but also to evidence which may be adduced in court on behalf of the State.  In this day and age it is not unreasonable to expect that proceedings will be recorded.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I attended a conference when changes to the right to silence were first being considered.  At the conference a number of senior officers from the Garda Síochána stated they regarded it as a reasonable <i>quid pro quo</i> that should the right to silence be cut back or amended in any way, the recording of interviews should be introduced for the protection of all concerned. There would be no great opposition from that quarter.</P>
      <P>The amendment is carefully drafted and states:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(6) Where a person is arrested for the purpose of detention pursuant to section 30 of the Act of 1939, on suspicion of having committed an offence under section 21 of that Act, he or she shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be removed to, and <Col N="920" /> detained in, a Garda Síochána station to which the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997 (S.  I. No. 74 of 1997) apply.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While the amendment accepts such exigencies, including emergency circumstances, it seeks to balance the reduction in normal legal rights by protecting proceedings for all concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the electronic recording of interviews with suspects raises complex issues and it might be useful for me to set out for the House the background to this issue.  Pilot trials in the use of audio and audio-visual recording of interviews with suspects are ongoing at four selected Garda stations.  These are: the Bridewells in Dublin and Cork, and Tallaght and Portlaoise stations.  These trials are being overseen by a steering committee under the chairmanship of the President of the Circuit Court, Judge Esmond Smyth, whose task it is to assess them and report to the Minister in relation to a national scheme.</P>
      <P>Up until early February 1997 the pilot trials have been in operation at these stations on a non-statutory, voluntary basis.  However, on average only 8 per cent of suspects agreed to have their interviews recorded.  I think it is fair to say that the low take-up rate by detained persons in relation to the option of electronic recording caused serious difficulties in trying to progress from the pilot scheme.  The steering committee advised that it would be unable to reach definitive conclusions on the effects of electronic recording on the basis of such a low percentage take-up. It accordingly recommended that regulations be made under section 27 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, making it mandatory that interviews in the pilot trial stations be recorded subject to the gardaí having a discretion to discontinue electronic recording where a suspect objected to continued recording.</P>
      <P>Arising from this recommendation the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations, 1997, were made on 11 February 1997.  These regulations provide for the electronic recording of interviews with suspects in the four Garda stations participating in the pilot scheme.</P>
      <P>With these regulations in place, the committee expects that the pilot scheme will begin to produce data on which a proper evaluation can be based.  In this regard, the services of a research consultant have been engaged for the purpose of carrying out the necessary and statistical analysis of the data emanating from each of the pilot scheme stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="921" /> I assure the House that I am anxious that as much progress as possible be made on this matter as quickly as possible and I will take whatever steps are open to me to achieve that.  I propose shortly, in fact, to meet with Judge Esmond Smyth to discuss in particular the future measures which might be taken to facilitate and expedite their work and I will of course bring to his attention the comments which have been made in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I announced in the other House last night that shortly a further two Garda stations at Henry Street, Limerick, and Mill Street, Galway, will be added to the pilot scheme and the necessary installation works are being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The reality is that it would not be possible to have a workable nationwide scheme in place for some time and the measures contained in the Bill are clearly required now.  In that context, it is worth noting that it was decided that it would be appropriate to proceed with much longer periods of detention under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996, without a nationwide scheme being in place.  We would also have to proceed on this basis in relation to the detention provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The approach in the amendment requires a person detained under section 30 as far as practicable to be detained in a Garda station where electronic recording is in place.  Given the reality of the situation which I have outlined, this approach is not workable.  The concept of &ldquo;so far as reasonably practicable&rdquo; could lead to endless litigation.  In subsequent court cases representatives of the accused could argue that it was practicable for him or her to be brought to a Garda station with recording equipment with the prosecution having to show that it was not.</P>
    <P>In addition, the amendment would have the no doubt unintended consequence of possibly increasing the amount of time a person is in Garda custody as the time of detention for the purpose of section 30 only counts from the time the person reaches the station.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that I appreciate the thinking behind the amendment and I am anxious to progress the issue of electronic recording as quickly as possible but, for the reasons I have outlined, which I believe are reasonable, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister has some problem with the phrase &ldquo;so far as is reasonably practicable&rdquo;, we would be quite willing to leave it out and make it necessary to have the facilities in all stations without giving them that flexibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point is that the legislation was introduced in 1984.  Whereas the pilot scheme indicated that only 8 per cent of suspects volunteered to have their interviews recorded electronically, there seems to be considerable evidence that this was partly due to the fact that they were afraid records would be taken and used against them in <Col N="922" /> the future.  They were not given a proper explanation of what was being done.  This problem does not arise in other countries.  Pilot schemes have been in operation for the past 14 or 15 years. The Minister must look seriously at ways of progressing this because we cannot operate in this way for the next 15 years.</P>
    <P>This legislation is different from the norm; it is, as the Taoiseach and Minister said, emergency draconian legislation.  We must ensure it is not used in such a way that it abuses the rights of the gardaí or the suspect.  I suggest that the Minister be a little more forthcoming than saying a steering committee and research consultancy will look at this and that he is anxious to progress it as far as possible.  Other remarks made by him indicate that no progress is likely to be made.  We are looking for a commitment that audio visual recording facilities will be reasonably available to the gardaí conducting interviews in the context of offences arising under this legislation.</P>

      <P>If we take out &ldquo;as far as is practicable&rdquo; we are then into making this mandatory, which we are not in a position to do at present.  It is not workable at the moment.  My objections to the amendment are not philosophically based and do not emanate from any point of principle.  The logistics dictate that it is not possible to do as Senator Costello wishes.  We will try to advance the concept of audiovisual interviews as quickly as possible.  It is important to point out that the take-up rate was only 8 per cent in that accused persons were reluctant to take this option.  That we have made this compulsory will mean we will be able to extract a far greater degree of data from the pilot schemes in operation. We will then be able to proceed from there. I cannot go off on a tangent at this time with this matter, desirable though the whole question of audiovisual recording is in the context of this and other legislation.  Unfortunately I cannot say any more than that we are progressing this matter.</P>

      <P>By the time the Minister has progressed along the lines suggested this legislation will have terminated in accordance with the provisions laid down.  Enough progress will not have been made in time if the Minister continues along the path he is suggesting.  If it is to bear any relevance to this legislation the Minister must be in a position to make a commitment here and now to make audiovisual recording facilities available straight away.</P>

The logistics are such that I cannot meet the Senator's request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(10) No inference shall be drawn from the failure of a person to call a witness in respect of whom he or she has given notice under subsection (1).&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 3, a substantial section, deals with the notification of witnesses and introduces a new requirement that a person who is accused of membership of an unlawful organisation must disclose for the defence a list of witnesses to the prosecution in advance of the trial.  This section is a very good example of why one should spend time discussing legislation such as this.  I think this new requirement needs teasing out and other elements need to be discussed at length but unfortunately we will not get the time to do so. We tabled an amendment to insert at the end of the section that &ldquo;no inference shall be drawn from the failure of a person to call a witness in respect of whom he or she has given notice under subsection (1).&rdquo;.  We did so in the absence of an opportunity to have a detailed examination of this very detailed section.</P>
      <P>Some basic safeguards should be provided for and in that context this amendment proposes that if the accused is required to provide advance notice of his or her defence to the prosecution, as the section requires, and where strict deadlines may apply, no adverse inference should be drawn by a court by reason of a failure to call witnesses where such advance notice has been given.  One can envisage that happening, particularly in cases where strict deadlines apply, and the intent of this amendment is to insert a level of protection in that regard.</P>

      <P>Section 3 requires that a person facing a charge of membership of an unlawful organisation must notify the prosecution of any witnesses he or she proposes to call in his or her defence.  The amendment would provide that no inference shall be drawn from the failure of a person to call a witness in respect of whom he or she has given notice.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to accept this amendment.  If it were to be accepted the reality is that a member of an unlawful organisation could notify, say, 50 witnesses without the intention of calling any of them in an effort to undermine the efficacy of the section.</P>
      <P>I should mention that this section is based on a section in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, and I want to keep the provisions of this legislation, so far as I possibly can, in line with the provisions in that more tested and tried legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, to delete lines 19 to 24 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;movements, activities and actions.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In his contribution to this House, and in those to the other House, the Minister made great play of the fact that the provisions of this section on their own could not result in somebody being convicted of membership of the IRA or, I should say, an illegal organisation; my use of the phrase &ldquo;IRA&rdquo; is technically subversive in that I could be prosecuted for that alone under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>
      <P>This amendment is an amendment to the Act passed in the Dáil under the most extraordinary circumstances on the night of the first bombings in Dublin.  The purpose of the amendment made then is that any conduct by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall be evidence that he was then such a member.  Obviously the Government was not satisfied with that so it decided to define the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; and inserted a number of phrases including &ldquo;movements, activities and actions&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Apart from the offensive nature of the original section of the 1972 legislation, to include the word &ldquo;association&rdquo; and to suggest that movements, actions, activities or associations could be used to corroborate evidence that a person was a member of an illegal organisation is an extraordinary change in our thinking, not because people can be convicted but because they can be legitimately arrested because of those with whom they associate.</P>
      <P>I want to give specific examples of what could be done.  I used to frequent a licensed premises 20 years ago which was described by a member of the Garda Síochána in court, much to my amazement, as known to be frequented by subversives. I, therefore, was associated with subversives. I have presided at and spoken at meetings about what I and others believed to be miscarriages of justice and abuses of the Offences Against the State Act and people whom the Garda Síochána believed to be associated with illegal organisations were present; in other words, members of Sinn Féin in particular.  Clearly, I have associations which, under this legislation, would allow a reasonable garda to come to the conclusion that I am a member of an illegal organisation.  He could not prove it, but he could arrest me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform &mdash; I suspect the Minister may not be fully aware of this &mdash; is that the Garda Síochána or the Department have agreed to pay out substantial damages because people have been arrested on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation when the arrest was entirely spurious.  A young lady was ejected from a Fine Gael Árd Fheis at the time of Nicky Kelly's struggle to clear his name because she interrupted <Col N="926" /> Garret FitzGerald's presidential address, and when she proceeded to protest outside the Garda officer in charge warned her to shut up or she would be arrested.  When she did not shut up he told her he was arresting her.  When she asked him what for he said he was arresting her on suspicion of membership of an illegal organisation. Subsequently that young lady was paid substantial damages by the State without admission of liability because she sued for unlawful arrest.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment proposed by the Minister, she could be branded guilty by association and, at the very least could legitimately be arrested because of who she associated with. Similarly, the entirety of the committee that ran the H-Blocks campaign in this State in 1981 could have been arrested, detained and questioned &mdash; I accept they could not have been convicted.  This means that any citizen who associates him or herself with any campaign in which people whom the Garda Síochána believe to be members of an illegal organisation are involved can be at least arrested, detained and questioned presumably for the duration of time permitted by this legislation. It does not mean that people can be convicted, but it is a licence, if people wanted to use it as such, to make life very difficult for people who are conducting what should be in a normal democratic state legitimate campaigns on issues of human rights, civil liberties and the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing as an amendment is, first, to eliminate reference to associations because of the extraordinarily disproportionate nature of that word and, second, that the wording should be &ldquo;movements, activities and actions&rdquo; rather than simply the vague term &ldquo;associations&rdquo; so that there would have to be at least a combination of circumstances.  I also propose to amend the second section of this, which is taken from the original legislation in 1972 and contains the quite extraordinary proposal that somebody who fails to deny published reports that he is a member of an unlawful organisation can be held to be suspect of membership.  That particular section means that Martin McGuinness in particular and Gerry Kelly also could be arrested by any member of the Garda Síochána in this State because they have not denied it every time a journalist has suggested that they are members of the IRA.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister wants to do with this legislation, but he should get away quickly from the concept of guilt by association, which will be used to tarnish the reputation of people who have a correct, legitimate and necessary &mdash; for the sake of a democratic society &mdash; commitment to struggles on behalf of people who are victims of injustice who, by definition, are on the margins of society.  My amendment proposes, therefore, to remove this obnoxious word &ldquo;association&rdquo; from this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Senator Ryan the Labour Party has tabled a similar amendment.  We do not see the connection between &ldquo;movements, activities <Col N="927" /> or actions&rdquo; and &ldquo;associations&rdquo;.  If one considers the meaning of the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;, it appears to refer to a person's activities and actions which may be used in evidence.  The area of associations is entirely different.  It involves other people's homes, arenas and places they frequent. A good example before the British courts, is the recent case involving Ms Elaine Moore.  She was arrested on the basis of association and has been charged.  This legislation would have been used strongly against her if it had been in place in Britain at the time of her arrest.</P>
      <P>Mr. Giuseppe Conlon, the father of an accused, was prosecuted on the basis of association.  He spent years in prison and died there.  If one is in the wrong place at the wrong time, one can be guilty of association.  There is a world of difference between movements, actions and activities and associations.  The Minister would do a good day's work if he removed that term.  I do not understand why it is necessary to include it in the provision in addition to the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 4 refers to the omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  How can a person peruse all the reports, rumours, magazines&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senators Ryan and Costello about section 4.  However, paragraph (ii) is ridiculous.  I realise it is a small amendment to the original section 3(1)(b) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, but I am not aware of how many people, if any, have been arrested or arraigned on the basis of that provision so what is the point of repeating it in the new legislation?</P>
      <P>One of the most important points about which we hear constantly is the difficulty people experience &mdash; it is worse for people in private rather than public life &mdash; in having corrections made to inaccuracies in the press or other forms of media. Other speakers mentioned the Internet.  It is impossible for citizens to police the Internet and see everything that is being said about them or have it corrected.  Members of the Oireachtas have great difficulty having inaccurate information about them corrected.  It is not unknown for senior Oireachtas Members to take libel cases against newspapers where they considered they were not getting adequate treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only newspaper of which I am aware that has an enthusiasm for corrections is <i>The Irish Times.</i>  Perhaps the other newspapers have a similar policy and are not so public about it, but it is extremely difficult for people to have corrections <Col N="928" /> made.  In terms of the paragraph, should people peruse literature and for how many years should they follow up books to see if their names were mentioned, even in an historical context if they previously belonged to a subversive organisation? Books are frequently written about organisations which were unlawful 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that if one is a member of an unlawful organisation, one is supposed to deny it.  What is the point of people denying their membership of an organisation when one knows that they are supposed to deny it even if they are members?  About 20 years ago when I asked a certain person whom I knew to be in the IRA if he was a member &mdash; it was frequently reported in the newspapers that he was, although he generally denied it &mdash; he replied that he was its Belfast quartermaster and a bad one at that.  What did his denial mean?  One is not supposed to say one is a member of an illegal organisation.  It is a pointless exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Henry.  There is a sense that those who are trying to improve the Bill should feel guilty for tabling amendments and it is presumed they do not support it.  The thought is far from our minds.  Senator Costello highlighted the dangers.  The State could incur huge costs as a result of being sued if we pass bad legislation.  I find it difficult to believe this is good legislation.  The section contains the words, &ldquo;. omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation, but the fact of such denial shall not by itself be conclusive&rdquo;.  What does this mean? As Senator Henry said, the legislation should be capable of being understood.</P>
      <P>About 30 years ago in an Irish daily newspaper I was mistaken for somebody else and referred to on the front page as a veteran IRA man.  While the editor agreed to make a correction, I felt he went too far in that he not only said I was not an IRA man but was far removed from Nationalism and republicanism.  I almost asked him to make a second correction.  Sometimes it is best to leave something uncorrected to avoid drawing attention to it.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to seriously reconsider this provision and look forward to hearing his explanation. We are anxious to ensure this is good legislation.</P>

I hope the Minister will define clearly what it means in the <Col N="929" /> context of this section which contains the words, &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused person&rdquo;.  It may be defined in a variety of ways.  Does this mean that associating with someone else is an association? If one is seen speaking to another person for a considerable length of time, can that be defined as association?  This is open to wide and varied interpretation and clear definition is needed of all these terms so that those empowered to use this legislation can do so with a clear idea of what is meant.  I hope the Minister gives a detailed definition in his response.</P>

      <P>I support Senator O'Donovan.  This legislation is intended to guard against what happened in Omagh.  It is important to realise that those who committed that type of deed will not be stopped by legislation that does not go far enough and that this legislation will be implemented in the best spirit possible by the Garda and the Judiciary.  It is vital that we give them the powers to arrest, prosecute and jail those who have committed or are capable of committing these deeds.  I understand the concerns expressed, but the authorities, elected representatives and Judiciary that worked for the British-Irish Agreement will continue to work to safeguard peace.  This legislation will be implemented in the spirit in which it is intended, and while I have concerns, given the terrorism and the mentality we are dealing with, this is the level of measure we must take.  It takes a great deal of courage to introduce the changes in legislation that will ensure that these people are put behind bars and that they will not be able to do what they did in Omagh.</P>

      <P>Section 3(1) of the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, provides that</P>
      <P>. any conduct by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was, at a material time, a member of an unlawful organisation, shall, in proceedings under section 1 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was then such a member .</P>
      <P>Section 4 of this Bill defines conduct as including &ldquo;movements, actions, activities or associations on the part of the accused person&rdquo;.  The amendments propose to exclude the reference to associations.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that what the Bill proposes may remind people of the phrase &ldquo;guilty by association&rdquo;, and some may find that instinctively unpalatable.  However, we must deal with the reality of membership of illegal organisations. Like it or not, that reality encompasses the fact that the associations of a person can be relevant to the question of membership of such an organisation. In those circumstances I strongly contend that it would be unwise to delete the word &ldquo;associations&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision is included in the Bill as much for the avoidance of doubt as anything else.  A strong case can already be made that the definition <Col N="930" /> of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; in the 1972 Act already includes the concept of associations.  To that extent, we are clarifying the position.  If I am wrong, then we are adding &ldquo;associations&rdquo; to the meaning of the word &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;.  While I appreciate the thinking behind amendments Nos. 4 and 5, I emphasise that the associations which a court can take into account are only those which imply or lead to a reasonable inference that a person is a member of an unlawful organisation.  It is childish and nonsensical to put forward the argument that if an individual meets another person in town who perhaps may be a member of the Real IRA and engages in a conversation with him or plays football on the local football team with him that of itself would be evidence of the fact that his association was such that a reasonable inference could be taken from it that he was a member of an unlawful organisation.  On the other hand, if , for example, a person went one night to a room at a secret location and had a meeting for a couple of hours with five or six people who were members of the IRA, a court might be entitled to draw reasonable inference from that.</P>
    <P>Let us be reasonable when we define the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  We are talking about a reasonable inference, not an unreasonable, unfounded or ill-founded inference.  Some of the arguments in this respect have been unreasonable and, in those circumstances, the fears which have been expressed in relation to what the Bill proposes to do are not justified.  I cannot support those amendments. Section 3 of the 1972 Act is concerned with what can and cannot constitute evidence of membership of an unlawful organisation.  It does not create an offence in itself.</P>
    <P>The amendment which section 4 of this Bill makes simply aligns the definition of conduct with the inference provisions in section 2.  The inference provisions in section 2 provide that if an individual, for example, refuses to answer a question regarding his or her associations, movements, actions or activities, then the court may &mdash; and it might not &mdash; in those circumstances draw an inference which would be corroborative to the effect that an individual was a member of an unlawful organisation.  There is nothing unreasonable or unfair about that because it must be proven to the court beyond a reasonable doubt which is, I repeat, the burden of proof applicable in Irish criminal courts and the criminal justice system. The section does not deal with the question of arrests and it would be erroneous to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>The effect of Senator Henry's amendment would be to delete the reference to conduct being defined to include the omission on the part of an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation and the fact that such denial would not by itself be conclusive.  I should explain the amendment which the Bill makes to section 3 of the 1972 Act is of limited scope and is restricted to that part of the definition which proposes that conduct should be defined to include movements, actions, activities <Col N="931" /> or associations on the part of the accused person. The reference to an omission by the accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation and the fact of such denial should not be conclusive is not something new.  That is already part of section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act, 1972, and it is included again in this Bill only because an amendment is being made to the relevant provision.</P>
    <P>The provision was enacted in circumstances and at a time when persons &mdash; people will recall them &mdash; openly advertised their role in unlawful organisations.  It has limited impact now as published reports of members are, as we all know, routinely denied.  I am not sure the Senator or the House would want to return to the situation which existed in that regard in the early 1970s. More than that, the other considerations which gave rise to the inclusion of the provision in the 1972 Act seem to remain valid.  It is interesting to go back and outline the reasons the then Minister felt this provision was necessary.  Column 269 of the Official Report of 29 November 1972 states:</P>
    <P>But a moment's thought will show that there are some reports which any reasonable person would naturally deny if they were false, as when a respectable person is reported to be acting dishonestly or in any other manner which he himself would regard as reprehensible. In such a case his omission to deny the report will ordinarily, as a matter of common sense, imply or lead people to infer that the report is true.  This principle applies with particular force to the offences under consideration, for there are some people who have been so often referred to in published reports as being prominent members, or holders of important offices, in unlawful organisations that they must be regarded, by reason of their failure to deny the reports, as holding themselves out as being members.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to reflect, 26 years later, on whether there are people whose names are reported who do not deny that they are members of an unlawful organisation.  The provision made in this regard should also be seen in the proper context of the section.</P>
    <P>Section 3(1)(a) provides that any statement made orally, in writing or otherwise, or any conduct by an accused person implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of an unlawful organisation shall, in proceedings under section 21 of the Act of 1939, be evidence that he was such a member. The key words are conduct &ldquo;implying or leading to a reasonable inference&rdquo;.  In other words, the conduct must imply or lead to a reasonable inference. The definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo; in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) will be read in that wider context and consequently an omission to deny such a report will be evidence only if the omission <Col N="932" /> is to deny a published report and is such as to lead to a reasonable inference that the accused was a member.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry referred to an individual not knowing that it was published that he or she was a member of an unlawful organisation.  Senator Costello made the point that an individual could not be expected to keep up with all the sophisticated communication methods and therefore he or she would not know whether his or her name was published as being a member of an unlawful organisation.  Lack of knowledge of a published report would be a circumstance where it would be reasonable for a court to draw an inference from a failure to deny a published report.  It would be accepted that a court could not be expected to draw an inference from a published report about which an individual did not know. To do otherwise would be unreasonable.  I am sure all Members would agree that a court would not do that.</P>
    <P>The 1972 provision has been on the Statue Book for almost 26 years and in that time it has not been established in any way that it is open to the type of abuse Senators suggested, let alone that there was any such abuse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Department paid out money because the section dealing with membership was abused.  Because the Department declined to contest that in court it had to pay out money.  I am aware of a young man who, after a meeting related to the Gibraltar Three, was stopped by the Special Branch and told that if he did not tell them who he was and where he came from he would be arrested on suspicion of membership of the Provisional IRA.  This section is abused.  The fact that the little people do not have the necessary resources to contest this in court does not mean this section is not abused.</P>
      <P>I have been followed home by the Special Branch and have had them wait outside my apartment and change shifts in the process.  I know others who were stopped and asked directions by officers in an unmarked Garda car and ended up being lectured.  These people had no connections with subversive organisations.  The problem with these sections will not arise in court but when gardaí, who believe they are devices to trawl for information, use them for that purpose.  If the Minister wishes them to be used for that purpose by all means let him say so.  Pretending it is a matter for the courts is disingenuous.  These sections are used to trawl for information and this Bill is an excuse to trawl further.  It is not the right way to proceed.  The law should protect the citizen and not leave him or her open to inconvenience at best and significant misuse at worst by gardaí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell me what sections of the Bill or the Offences Against the State Acts guarantee that these provisions will only be used against the Real IRA as distinct from the Provisional <Col N="933" /> IRA, the largest illegal organisation in the State, which as recently as last Tuesday said it was organising in each of the Thirty-two counties? If it is used against the Provisional IRA, what will happen to the peace process?</P>

      <P>There is no question of any Member not wanting the Minister's legislation to be as effective as possible.  The Omagh bombing is not the only outrage; we have suffered in this country for years.  Imagine if that bomb had gone off on the ferry from Dún Laoghaire.  We are dealing with people who operate in such a manner.  I cannot see the benefit of asking people who are told to lie to deny reports in the papers that they are not what they are.  I would not mind if there were value in it but I cannot see the value in asking them as we would not believe their lies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I put the converse case to Senator Henry.  If we do as she says, it effectively means a person can be of the view that, if his or her name is published in a newspaper as being a member of an unlawful organisation, he or she is under no obligation to deny it.  It would be as if it did not matter.  We do not want people to feel they can be publicised as being members of an unlawful organisation in a civilised, democratic society with no obligation on them to deny it. There is also the matter of evidence which is of considerable importance.</P>
      <P>Senator Ryan stated that compensation was paid out in some cases.  I do not doubt his accuracy but he should outline, as regards the specific provision with which we are dealing, in what cases compensation was paid out.  Is he speaking of compensation in respect of matters concerned with section 30?  Are we talking about arrest or conduct?  It is important that it be clarified.  Membership of an unlawful organisation is difficult to prove; people do not wear it on their sleeves.  It is not like proving a person is a member of a golf or GAA club.  Courts require certain proof.  For obvious reasons, it is not easy for the authorities to prove membership of an illegal organisation. The evidential changes proposed are reasonable in so far as they concern the precise definition of &ldquo;conduct&rdquo;.  I remind Senators that at all times the court has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt or innocence of the accused.  The court has to be satisfied at all times as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the inference it is suggested it should draw.  If it is not satisfied then it will not draw that inference and the matter does not go to evidence.  The position cannot be put any more strongly.</P>

This Bill contains amendments to the Offences Against the State Act, 1972, concerning membership of an illegal organisation. Will the Minister explain how the Government proposes to ensure that these measures are only used against the Real IRA and the Continuity IRA and not against those organisations which have announced and, more or less, maintained a ceasefire?  How does the Minister propose to ensure that this legislation is not applied to members of the Provisional IRA or is it the intention to start locking up members of that organisation?  If so, has he any thoughts on the consequences of such actions for the peace process?  We have been told that these measures will only apply to the Real IRA.  However, I have seen nothing in the legislation which states that it applies only to that organisation.</P>

Anyone who is a member of any of those organisations or who subverts the State in any way can be taken in under the provisions of this Bill.  Anybody who wants to do anything like what was done recently should be taken in, whether it is the Real IRA or any group of people who put a political-type halo over their head and think they can be classified in a particular category.

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), a person who knowingly solicits, contributes or holds moneys for the use or benefit of, or for use for the purposes of, an unlawful organisation in respect of which a suppression order under section 19 of the Act of 1939 is in force shall be guilty of an offence under that subsection.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to strengthen the extra safeguards being put in place by this legislation to counteract people who assist organisations such as the Real IRA, who were associated with or involved in the atrocity in Omagh and the other attempts at killing and bombing in the past number of months, some of which have succeeded in causing destruction and others which, thankfully, have been foiled by the Garda.  There is a gap in existing legislation to the extent that there is not a specific offence covering contributing to, fundraising for or holding money on behalf of an illegal organisation.  Although such money is held forfeit to the State under the amending legislation of 1985, criminal proceedings cannot be brought against those involved.  I propose that an additional subsection be added to section 6 to cover this matter.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about the handling and conveyancing of money which may be raised outside the jurisdiction in, for example, the United States.  People such as Martin Galvin in the US, who was previously associated with fundraising for Noraid and other organisations, have been explicit in their support for organisations such as the Real IRA.  The legislation should clearly state that any contribution towards, fundraising for or holding of money on behalf of an unlawful organisation contravenes the law and that those involved will be tracked down by the Garda and brought before the courts to have their cases heard.  We are talking about a range of grave offences and making such provision is the least we can do.  We should try to deprive that small organisation of whatever oxygen exists to allow it survive now or in the future.  Tackling fundraising and financial contributions in support of their activities should be one of the first issues to be examined and addressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenOMeara" hpid="Ms O'Meara Ms O'Meara">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Meara</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment. Section 6 creates the new offence of directing an <Col N="937" /> unlawful organisation.  The amendment goes a long way towards strengthening what is already a very useful section in terms of reaching those whose hands may never touch semtex or who may never drive a car containing a bomb but who are as guilty and more so of perpetrating evil acts through their organisation or support of them and their collecting, soliciting, contributing or holding money used by an unlawful organisation.  This is a very useful amendment which considerably strengthens the Bill.  It would give the authorities the necessary powers to ensure that those who contribute in any way towards these dreadful acts are dealt with effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>An amendment such as this would make a significant difference and I am astonished that such provision does not already exist.  It would keep Martin Galvin out of the country as such provision would allow for his arrest, a consummation devoutly to be wished.  Such provision is an appropriate response.  It should not be possible under the law to raise funds for an illegal organisation.  Neither should it be possible for people who have done so outside the State to visit here.  I enthusiastically support the amendment as it is the correct approach in the context of section 6 which is a long overdue measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I also support the amendment. Last night BBC television screened a programme relating to the activities of supporters of the Continuity IRA or the Real IRA in the United States. The programme included interviews with Mr. Galvin.</P>
      <P>The reason the IRA is the best armed subversive group in Europe and probably in the world is because it was able to raise huge sums of money to buy arms.  Colonel Gadaffi and the other suppliers did not give the arms for nothing.  The arms were paid for, and probably well paid for.  That is why this arsenal is out there &mdash; a cause of concern for all of us, although it has merited little comment today.</P>
      <P>There is a small group which has access to a proportion of that arsenal.  Given what we saw on television last night, fundraising will continue covertly within this State and openly outside its borders, perhaps in the United States.  Money will be transmitted to this country and some so-called treasurer will have the responsibility of handling it.  It is timely of Senator Costello to put down this amendment.  I do not know if this amendment was tabled in the Dáil last night, and I realise that accepting it in the Seanad would raise the difficulty of having to recall the Dáil, but the Minister should consider accepting it because it is a weapon he needs in his armoury to fight these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a determined hard core, who do not necessarily live in this State, who intend to continue to raise funds and who will get them because of the romantic view which exists beyond <Col N="938" /> the shores of this country about the so-called struggle for independence here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleagues, I support this amendment.  It is a sound and sensible amendment with one specific purpose &mdash; to cut off the means by which subversive organisations can equip themselves with arms and ammunition. That is a basic issue and Senators Costello, Gallagher and O'Meara have made a very solid proposal.</P>
      <P>If this amendment is taken on board, it will give the Minister another strong section to deal with the practicalities which emerge.  These organisations could not function unless they were well financed.  In the United States huge amounts of money are raised.  We have heard that President Clinton will take action against fundraisers in the United States to discourage those people.  It is imperative that we take action and use the opportunity presented by this Bill.  I can see no reason the Minister would have any difficulty in taking this amendment on board.</P>

      <P>To add to the positive contributions in favour of this amendment, we consider it an important additional area which has not been covered by the provisions of the Bill.  It would ensure the people involved would feel the rigours of this legislation.  If we look at some of the areas which have been covered, one would wonder why this area was not examined to get the godfathers who have been going around the world, to the United States, Germany and the Arab countries, collecting funds and depositing them in various funds with the intention of causing mayhem.</P>
      <P>I am amazed the Minister is not receptive to an amendment of this nature.  We are not talking about some poor old granny making a contribution by buying an Easter lily, we are talking about people of substance who have solicited funds, who are part of organisations here and abroad and who would also hold this money.</P>
      <P>It behoves the Minister to show that he is intent on getting to the root of the problem at this level.  Certainly there are many parts of this island which could do with this money &mdash; it could be well used in some of the disadvantaged areas in my own constituency, in the Border counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 6 provides for an offence of directing an unlawful organisation. This amendment would add a new section to the effect that it would be an offence under the section to knowingly solicit, contribute or hold money for the benefit of an unlawful organisation. The manner in which the amendment is drafted would mean that a person who collected money for an unlawful organisation could be liable to imprisonment for up to a life term, although I doubt that is its intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pursuing the finances of unlawful organisations raises very complex issues and the advice available <Col N="939" /> to me is that a provision along the lines contained in the amendment would be cosmetic and fail to make any substantial difference in terms of operational realities.  It might be helpful to mention that legal provisions already exist which impinge on this area, namely, in section 5 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, and section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976.  A provision dealing with permits is contained in the Street and House-to-House Collections Act, 1962.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the pursuit of any kind of financial wrongdoing is difficult but difficulty does not excuse inaction.  I am very disappointed by the Minister's response to this amendment. I thought one of the first things he would attempt to do to cut off the oxygen supply to these illegal organisations would be to deprive them of the money they need to buy arms, manufacture explosives and so on.  Regardless of how complex it might be, the least I would expect in a debate on what we are told is draconian legislation would be a commitment from the Government that whatever needs to be done to target this money and the people who collect and distribute it would be done.  The parallels with the drug crime situation in this country are obvious and it took a terrible disaster in that area to put in place the necessary legislation which targeted the issue of finances.  We have seen how effective that legislation is and such provisions should apply equally, if not more so, to organisations which carry out atrocities such as we have witnessed in Omagh.  I expected a more robust response and commitment from the Government on this count.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's remarks and consider his excuses to be very lame indeed.  This Bill contains a draconian proposal for the confiscation of people's property. On Second Stage I made the point about the inviolability of people's right to private property contained in the Constitution and the involvement of a person's family in such property.  Those provisions will be very difficult to enforce.  Considering we are taking such draconian steps on that front, I believe it would be relatively easy to make it absolutely illegal for someone to fundraise or hold funds for an illegal organisation which would use them to buy arms and manufacture explosives.  The IRA was successful in purchasing all kinds of sophisticated weaponry and explosive substances because it had the necessary funds to do so.  Much of that money was raised through bank robberies but the majority of it was raised outside Ireland, particularly in the US.  There was no mechanism in place through which that money could have been intercepted coming into the country or which would make its handling or use illegal.  We have legislation of this kind in other areas, in relation to drug trafficking and so on. <Col N="940" /> The Minister's excuse is rather lame and he should admit that this provision was overlooked in the drafting of the original Bill and that it is too problematical to include it at this stage as he wishes the Bill to be signed into law this evening. That would not be possible if he accepted this simple, but necessary, amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not lightly say the issue raised here is a complex one.  It is not quite as simple as it sounds.  Section 3 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976, states that any person who recruits another person for an unlawful organisation or incites or invites another person or other persons generally to join an unlawful organisation or take part in, support or assist its activities &mdash; which would include the collection of money &mdash; shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction or indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.  This amendment is laudable but there are considerable legal complexities involved.  In the meantime it is a criminal offence to incite or invite another person to support or assist the activities of an unlawful organisation. The Offences against the State Act, 1985 also contains provisions which deal with the collection of money for unlawful organisations.</P>
      <P>The first layer of complexity is that people do not travel around the country saying they are collecting for the Real IRA or any proscribed organisations. In the past arguments were made that the political wing of a paramilitary organisation should be proscribed in order, for example, that one would be able to prevent them collecting money.  Proscribing an organisation with a political objective &mdash; albeit with a military wing &mdash; is extremely complex and difficult to the point of being impossible because its name could be changed continually.  It is very difficult to proscribe an organisation which professes itself to have a political objective and that it is entirely divorced from the use of arms or promoting military means.  I trust my explanation will help to outline the outer layer of complexity involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>There are few areas of law that are more complex than the laws relating to property in this State, particularly since the constitutional protection afforded to property is very strong.  Yet it is right that we should make provisions to confiscate property if it is used for the illegal purposes set out here.  As a democracy we expect our Government to re-examine the current legislation, to take any reasonable steps to revise it and bring legislation before us to ensure that those engaged in illegal activities, such as those outlined, should be deprived of their money.  Our laws ensure that anyone who helps these organisations to raise funds, manages their finances, holds money for them or moves it around is regarded as indulging in the worst possible type of crime.  I cannot accept that complexity is a reason for not giving a commitment on behalf <Col N="941" /> of the Government that any further action that needs to be taken in this area will be taken.  It is the least I expect from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister explained to us that proving membership of an illegal organisation was complex and, therefore, complex legislation was needed, but nevertheless insisting &mdash; as we all agree &mdash; that it is necessary to attempt as far as possible to bring people to justice when they are members of an illegal organisation.  The complexity did not hinder us from attempting to deal with that problem quite justifiably.  I do not understand why complexity of itself should leave such a gap in our legislation.  Legislation is a statement of society's views.  Many aspects of legislation contain statements of the beliefs of society about what is right and wrong.  This amendment is a statement further underlying our determination to prevent illegal organisations from getting the resources to perpetrate awful acts.  I am disappointed the Minister used complexity as an excuse not to at least accept in principle the intent of this amendment.</P>

      <P>None of us dispute the need to deal with people who indulge in fundraising activities for illegal organisations.  I share the views expressed by Senators Ryan and Gallagher that complexity should not prevent us from introducing the required legislation.  However, the matter is already covered in the section.  Section 6 states, &ldquo;a person who directs, at any level of the organisation's structure, the activities of an organisation in respect of.&rdquo;, which surely embraces the intention of the amendment.</P>
      <P>We do not wish to go after those who buy <i>An Phoblacht</i> or Easter lilies.  We wish to go after those behind fundraising, the godfathers who are part of the organisation.  That is achieved in section 6.  I do not see the need to make an additional amendment.  As the Minister said, the penalty under the section is imprisonment for life. We need to be clear about what we are talking about.  Senator Ryan was concerned about somebody who might be lifted by the Garda because they might be a member of the Provisional IRA. Is he not concerned that somebody might be lifted outside a church in Cahirciveen because they happen to be selling <i>An Phoblacht?</i></P>

Following the tragic death of Veronica Guerin, we laid out in detail how we would deal with illegal drug dealing.  It behoves us to spell this out in exactly the same fashion in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is stonewalling us by saying he agrees with what we are proposing, as he went halfway towards indicating.  However, as he has <Col N="942" /> no intention of recalling the Dáil, perhaps he will adopt the same principle as he did earlier in relation to section 18 whereby the annual review mechanism will be introduced in the new Criminal Justice Bill.  He should give a commitment that he will amend that legislation to include a provision to create an offence of soliciting, holding or contributing to funds.  It need not necessarily be life imprisonment.  The offence of supporting an illegal organisation already carries a penalty of ten years.</P>

      <P>I outlined that there is no vacant gap in our legislation and I already referred to the relevant Acts.  There are forfeiture provisions in the 1939 Act which were supplemented in the 1985 Act.  The issue will be examined but it is not susceptible to the solution suggested by the Senator.</P>
      <P>A review of the Offences Against the State Acts is taking place and this matter, among others, will be examined in that context. The forfeiture provision is quite strong and is supplemented by the 1985 Act.  These provisions were tested in the courts in the Clancy case and were upheld.  The more mundane matters of collection and so forth are, to an extent, dealt with in existing legislation. One who invites or incites another person to assist an unlawful organisation or to support its activities will be guilty of an offence and liable to ten years imprisonment.</P>

The Minister said earlier that the provisions for annual review were already in the legislation but that for the purpose of avoiding doubt and confusion and in order to be helpful, he would be prepared to look at it in specific terms in the context of the Criminal Justice Act.  We are being reasonable about this matter.  The objective of pursuing those who contribute, fundraise or hold money on behalf of unlawful organisations should be provided for under law.  It would be helpful if the Minister would give a commitment to look at this matter again in the context of the Criminal Justice Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), line 36, to delete &ldquo;giving rise to a reasonable suspicion&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;where it can be reasonably concluded&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sections 7 and 8 are probably the most repugnant sections.  Section 7 provides that a person shall be guilty of an offence for which the maximum term of imprisonment is ten years if he has in his possession an article &ldquo;giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession or under his or her control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence.&rdquo;.  It does not provide that they should have the article for the purpose of committing an offence but that their possession of the article gives rise to a reasonable suspicion. All the State is required to prove in court is that there is a reasonable suspicion.</P>
      <P>The section provides that if there is a reasonable suspicion that somebody has an article for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence, the person is guilty of the offence unless he can prove that at the time of the alleged offence the article was not in his or her possession or under his or her control &ldquo;for any purpose specified in subsection (1)&rdquo;. Under this section, the defendant is guilty unless he can prove himself innocent.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to reverse that position and to retain the legitimate attempt to penalise people who have articles in their possession &ldquo;where it can be reasonably concluded&rdquo; that the articles were in their possession or under their control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister restore the normal form of law which is that people are innocent until they are proven guilty of an offence?  It is not sufficient to suspect that a person has committed an offence.  Section 7 says a person is guilty of an offence if it can be shown that there is a reasonable suspicion that an article is in his or her possession for an illegal purpose.  The only defence specified in the section is to prove that the suspicion is unfounded.  In spite of multiple denials by representatives of the Government this is a fundamental reversal of our criminal law because under section 7 a suspect is guilty unless he can prove himself innocent.  This guilt is not based on fact or evidence but on reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion has a long history in law and it is not proof.  My amendment removes the phrase &ldquo;giving rise to a reasonable suspicion&rdquo; because it is such an appalling reversal of our normal justice process and substitutes &ldquo;where it can be reasonably concluded&rdquo;.  In other words, where it can be proven.  If my amendment is accepted <Col N="944" /> there will be no need for subsection (2) which requires people to prove their innocence.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the Minister's explanation because he has said that nowhere in the Bill is there a requirement to prove innocence.  Sections 7 and 8 both require that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Senator Ryan has said.  The Bill places the onus on the defendant to rebut a charge.  It is not clear whose reasonable suspicion is referred to nor is the difference between reasonable suspicion and opinion clear. Failure to rebut a charge could result in a ten year term of imprisonment.  Senator Ryan's amendment calls for a level of evidence greater than mere suspicion.  This legislation shifts the burden of proof onto the defendant.  It could be very difficult for a person to prove that an item was in his or her possession for a legitimate purpose.  To convict a person of an offence which carries a heavy penalty should require more than reasonable suspicion which I regard as little more than an opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is based on a person being guilty of an offence where there is a reasonable suspicion that the article is in his or her possession or under his or her control for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence under the Acts.  The offences specified in the Acts are serious ones.  It is provided that there will be a complete defence if it can be shown that the articles were not in the possession of the person for the purposes specified.  Senator Ryan would remove the defence provision, but the offence would involve reasonably concluding that the articles were in the possession of a person in connection with the commission of an offence.  The section as it stands is carefully balanced.  The standard of proof in criminal cases is generally, as we all know, beyond a reasonable doubt, which is different from the concept of &ldquo;could be reasonably concluded&rdquo;.  Accordingly, the actual effect of Senator Ryan's amendment, although I know that in all probability that is not what was intended, would be likely to lessen the protection available to the accused person in that the standard of proof would be lessened.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands refers to a reasonable suspicion, but that has to be read in conjunction with the defence to show that the articles were not in the possession of the person for the purposes specified in subsection (1).  That defence is complete.</P>
      <P>The section as it stands is very carefully balanced and I respectfully submit that there are dangers with the Senator's amendment, which means that I cannot accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is among the worst defences of a section of a Bill that I have heard in my political career.  The reality is that there is no requirement of proving beyond a reasonable doubt.  If a person <Col N="945" /> is charged with this offence in a court, all the prosecution has to prove is that there is a reasonable suspicion.  I invite the Minister to explain how one can disprove that there is a reasonable suspicion.  A reasonable suspicion is precisely that &mdash; a suspicion based on reason.  If there is anything else, such as a previous conviction or political statements, the balance of proof goes from the prosecution to the defendant.  The Minister should at least accept that the burden of proof here has been moved from the prosecution to the defendant, which is a reversal of our normal tradition of criminal law.</P>
      <P>Since extensive research has obviously been done, can the Minister give me examples of similar phraseology in our criminal law where the phrase &ldquo;a reasonable suspicion&rdquo; can be used to convict somebody of an offence?  The State only has to prove that there is a reasonable suspicion. The Minister is playing with words.  I do not have to tell the Minister, who is a lawyer himself, that proof in criminal law is a particularly precise term.  In this case the defendant has to prove that the equipment or articles were not for a criminal purpose, while the State simply has to prove that there is a reasonable suspicion that they were. That is not balance.</P>
      <P>The suggestion that my amendments would worsen the position of the defendant is a nonsense. It is a good one to throw up but it is nonsense because the State would then have to prove that it could be &ldquo;reasonably concluded&rdquo;, which is a much stronger burden of proof.  All the defendant would have to do is raise a reasonable doubt about that conclusion, which is the normal process.</P>
      <P>In this section the Minister and the Government are ducking the issue of the complete reversal of the burden of proof from the normal traditions of our criminal law.  This was not discussed in the Lower House either.  I would remind the House that when one is dealing with people who have been brought to court, we do not know if they are guilty.  They are innocent people being charged with an offence and the normal procedure in our courts is that they are innocent until the State can prove them guilty.  In this case all the State has to do is show that there is reasonable suspicion and the suspect then has to prove the opposite.  That is a complete reversal of our tradition of criminal law and it is being slipped through without the Minister even dealing with the issue.  We are entitled to more.</P>

      <P>Senator Ryan said the defence of the section put forward by me was the weakest he had heard since he entered political life.  I was not putting forward a defence of the section.  It was, in fact, a commentary on the amendment, which I regard to be extremely weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That much having been said, I think Senator Brendan Ryan has again got the wrong end of the <Col N="946" /> stick.  The facts are that the offence under section 7 must be proved by the prosecution.  The prosecution must not only prove the possession of the article in question but must also prove possession of the article in question which would give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the person had the article in his or her possession for purposes connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990, or Explosive Substances Act, 1883. That is clearly the correct construction.  It could not be otherwise.  The proof must be brought forward by the prosecution.  That much is clear from subsection (1).  Of course the question of control would also constitute an offence within the meaning of the subsection.  Therefore, the State or the prosecution would have to show that the circumstances concerned in which the person was in possession of the articles were such that they created a reasonable suspicion.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, the reasonable suspicion is not that somebody was going off to play tiddlywinks but a reasonable suspicion that a person had this article or articles in his or her possession for the purposes connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of an offence under the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990, or Explosive Substances Act, 1883.  We all know that these are extremely serious offences.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that the question of the defence comes into play once the proof has been established by the State and then it is provided that it would be a defence for a person to prove that the article was not in his or her possession for the purposes specified in subsection (1).  Therefore, if the State in the first instance could not establish the reasonable suspicion, the proof, which is a defence at subsection (2), would not arise for the simple reason that it would not be required.  It would not be required for the equally simple reason that the State had not made out its case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chathaoirligh, this is the first time that this section has been debated in either House of the Oireachtas.  It is a fundamental matter.  It represents a complete reversal of the normal process of justice in this State because the burden of proof is on the defendant, not on the State.  This is a very serious issue, a Chathaoirligh, and with all due respect to you I am quite prepared to pursue it for a while if the Minister will not at least admit what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would defend what he has done and not pretend that he has done nothing, we could at least have a serious debate about it.  The Minister has said that he is prepared to send people to jail if there is in the court's eyes nothing more than a reasonable suspicion that the person <Col N="947" /> is up to something.  That is what this section states; it does not state that the State can prove that the person has it for a purpose of committing an offence but that there is a reasonable suspicion. That is the burden of proof on the State and the Minister fudges this the whole time because he rushes on to list the serious offences. We know they are serious offences.  If it simply stated that people had in their possession articles which could be proven to be for the purpose of committing an offence, I would be quite happy with this section and we would all agree. However, the State is not proving that they are going to use them; it is proving that there is a reasonable suspicion.  That is all the State must prove and that is a long way from the way the criminal justice system operates.</P>
    <P>I am fascinated by the concept of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that there is a reasonable suspicion.  That is an easy thing to do because a reasonable suspicion is a vague concept.  That is all the State must do.  Then the defendant must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecution is wrong.  This is where the difficulty and the repetition is creeping in, a Chathaoirligh, because the Government states that this Bill does not contain any provisions whereby people are guilty until proven innocent.  This section states that the presumption is one of guilt and a person must prove his or her innocence.  That is a complete reversal of the traditions of our criminal law.  The Government has managed not to discuss this extremely draconian section in either House or in public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to labour the point.  Clearly, the State would have to prove that circumstances exist which give rise to a reasonable suspicion that an individual had an article or articles in his or her possession for the purposes of committing a very serious offence.  That is the bottom line.  It must be clear at this stage that it is a matter in the first instance for the State to prove that those circumstances exist.  The State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the ingredients of the offence, by reference to the terms of what constitutes an offence, are present. It is only when the ingredients of the offence are proven that the onus or burden referred to by Senator Ryan shifts to the accused.</P>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions <i>v.</i> Foley 1995, Irish Reports, page 267, which dealt with the effect of an analogous provision under section 27 (1) (a) of the Firearms Act, 1964 states: &ldquo;. . an accused is entitled in the first instance to call on the prosecution to prove its case . .&rdquo; In this instance the prosecution has to prove that the ingredients of the offence set out in section 7(1) must be established.  The court went on to say &mdash; we are talking here about the accused:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prima facie his [the accused] situation is that he does not have to give an explanation or give <Col N="948" /> evidence.  But if proof of guilt is forthcoming &mdash; if circumstances are laid before the court that point to the guilt of the accused &mdash; then the accused must attempt to rebut the prosecution case by evidence or suffer the consequences.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it is clear from that passage that the burden only passes to the accused when proof has been established, at which point the accused would be expected to show that possession was not for the purpose specified in the section.</P>
    <P>The view that provisions such as this are unusual or extraordinary and that this is the first time they have been used is incorrect.  Similar provisions exist in Irish criminal law.  Under section 4 of the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, it is an offence for a person to make or possess an explosive substance under such circumstances as to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that he is not making it or does not have it for a lawful object, which equally provides that it would be a defence to show that it was made or in his possession for a lawful object.  Additionally, section 12 of the Offences Against the State Act includes a provision for an offence for the possession of incriminating documents; section 27 (1) (a) of the Firearms Act, 1964, provides that a person who has firearms or ammunition in his possession or under his control in such circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that he does not have it in his possession or under his control for a lawful purpose will be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Senator Ryan was a Member of the House when the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, was passed but I must inform him that section 9 of that Act provides that where a person has with him in any public place a knife or other article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed he shall be guilty of an offence. The section further states that it will be a defence for a person charged to prove that he has good reason, on lawful authority, for having the article with him in a public place.</P>
    <P>There is another crucial factor which Senator Ryan ignored.  In our criminal justice system the independent Director of Public Prosecutions decides whether a prosecution should be taken. In coming to a decision regarding whether a case should proceed, the question of an individual having a case to answer immediately raises its head.  The Director of Public Prosecutions does not initiate criminal cases of any kind, let alone serious criminal cases, against individuals unless he believes they have a case to answer.  There are protections and standards of proof which must be reached.  In the event that such standards are not reached, a case must, of necessity, fall.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to an amount of new material and I must reply to him.  Every <Col N="949" /> Act he quoted involves items which are, of themselves, inherently dangerous to other people, namely, firearms, explosives, knives, daggers and other weapons.  There is no such provision in section 7 which refers to &ldquo;any article&rdquo;.  All that is required under the section is a reasonable suspicion that an article is in a person's possession or under their control for a purpose &ldquo;connected with the commission, preparation, or instigation of an offence under the Explosive Substances Act, 1883, or the Firearms Acts, 1925 to 1990&rdquo;. This could refer to electronic or electrical equipment or a radio transmitter, but it is not yet a criminal offence to possess such equipment.  It is a criminal offence to possess explosives or firearms without a licence, but we are not discussing those items because the section refers to &ldquo;any article&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister repeatedly stated that there must be proof beyond reasonable doubt.  However, if this merely takes the form of a reasonable suspicion, it is not proof that an illegal act is about to occur.  The term &ldquo;reasonable suspicion&rdquo; is vague and the DPP will be obliged to decide if there is sufficient evidence to encourage a court to accept that such a suspicion exists.  That is the point of my objection.  People will be imprisoned unless they can prove their innocence, particularly if a court is satisfied not that there is conclusive evidence against them but that there is a reasonable suspicion that they are involved in questionable activity.  As a result, I cannot withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 8, lines 6 and 7, to delete &ldquo;which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;for the purpose of&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="950" /> If the last section was bad, this one is dreadful. This should be looked at with a degree of detachment without the peculiar focus of the Minister and the Department.  The section states &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person .&rdquo;&mdash; not a member of an illegal organisation but any person &mdash;&ldquo;. to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of an unlawful organisation of serious offences.&rdquo; Will the Minister tell me that a map, or textbooks explaining the ins and outs of modern electronics or radio telegraphy, or information compiled for a study on the cratering of Border roads are not likely to be of use to an unlawful organisation in the commission of an offence?  This is the most extraordinary, sloppy wording I have ever seen.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the Minister intends with this section because I could not find a debate on it in the draft reports of yesterday's Dáil proceedings. I do not know what it means.  It is an offence to posses anything which is likely to be of assistance to an illegal organisation.  My amendment proposes that it shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information for the purpose of the commission by members of an unlawful organisation of serious offences generally.  That means the State would have to prove that the information was collected, assembled or recorded for that purpose.  That apparently is what the Minister wants from this section.  The scope of it, as drafted, would do justice to the junta in Burma.  We were used to this in eastern Europe &mdash; criminal legislation which could be used to catch anybody at any time anywhere if they were causing trouble.</P>
    <P>Of course, we have a wonderful liberal defence. If one can prove any information in one's possession was collected for an innocent purpose then one cannot be convicted.  The Bill has a clear intent but was rushed and sloppily drafted and this is wrong.  It is extremely broad, poorly worded and will probably not stand the test of the courts because it is such an appalling interference with the freedom of citizens to collect information to which they are entitled notwithstanding what the Minister and the Department think.</P>
    <P>This is a free society in which citizens are free to assemble any information they want about anything.  That information might coincidentally be of assistance to an illegal organisation should not make it an offence to possess it.  It should be an offence only where it is proven to be for the purpose of assisting an illegal organisation.  My amendments attempt to restore the normal level of sanity that a free society has about the citizen's right to do whatever he or she likes about assembling information.  Having information about flight schedules in Dublin Airport in light of terrorist attacks on airlines is likely to be of assistance to an illegal organisation.  The Minister, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law <Col N="951" /> Reform and the parliamentary draftsman could have done better.  It is unworthy of them.  This section should be drastically amended because it is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Ryan.  In the previous section he pointed out how the burden of proof was shifted, with the onus being put on the defendant and questionable requirements of reasonable suspicion being required to prosecute and obtain a conviction.  Section 8 is the most questionable intrusion in normal criminal justice legislation.  It seems that at last the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has got what it has been looking for &mdash; a wide-ranging catch-all set of provisions in terms of procedure and offences.  Senator Ryan pointed out that under Section 8 (1) &ldquo;it shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful ..&rdquo;. The person may have no connection with a proscribed organisation but may be in possession of information of such a nature, however innocently, that would be useful for a paramilitary organisation in the commission of unlawful activity.  The information is likely to be useful but the question is whether it is used for that purpose.  This typographical error gives the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform the benefit of the doubt.  The words &ldquo;likely to be useful&rdquo; should read, &ldquo;likely to be used&rdquo;.  There is a mistake in grammatical terms and I think the Department really meant to insert &ldquo;likely to be used&rdquo; and this accords with the wording of amendment No. 10 tabled by Senator Ryan.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (2) is a repeat of section 7 where the onus of proof is shifted onto the defendant and states:</P>
      <P>It shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this section to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her. .. for the purpose of its being used in such commission of any serious offence or offences.</P>
      <P>The information can be entirely innocent but straight away the onus of proof is on the defendant not the prosecutor.  We have shifted the burden of proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subsection will apply to &ldquo;any serious offence or offences&rdquo;.  A serious offence is defined as an offence for which a person of full age and capacity and not previously convicted may, under or by virtue of any enactment, be punished by imprisonment for a term of five years.  It will apply to a general offence where the sentence is five years imprisonment and where the offence involves loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment or serious loss of or damage to property or a serious risk of any such <Col N="952" /> loss, injury, imprisonment or damage.  In this section we are extending the Offences against the State legislation beyond scheduled offences, such as membership of proscribed organisations, into the realm of ordinary criminal law.  We are placing the burden on the defendant to prove his innocence in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>These provisions have been sitting on the shelves in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for many years and at last the appropriate legislation has been found where they could be inserted quietly, in the hope that nobody would notice.  They could then use this legislation to cover all serious offences and it would put an onus on individual citizens to prove their innocence.  Perhaps the Minister can prove to the contrary but the terminology used to describe this serious offence, which was not part of any previous legislation, appears to be an attempt to get around the normal course of justice and include types of evidence that would not be acceptable in a normal court of law.</P>

      <P>I support Senator Ryan's amendments and agree with the comments made.  Subsections (1) and (2) of section 8 are of such a catch-all nature that I would be fearful of putting them into any type of legislation but particularly legislation the Taoiseach has called draconian. We now know the reason for that.  A basic reading of the first paragraph shows the extraordinary nature of these measures.  Items such as computers, particularly laptop computers which are in common usage, and mobile phones are useful, to use the terminology in the legislation, in the commission of a particular kind of serious offence.</P>
      <P>The second paragraph is obnoxious also because it places an extraordinary burden on the accused person.  I will be brief in my comments considering the late hour but I strongly support Senator Ryan's amendments.  Emergency legislation in particular should not contain measures of such a catch-all nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Members referred to the fact that the Taoiseach called these measures draconian. He was right.  Neither he nor I pretended that these measures were anything other than harsh. They are harsh but they are framed to tackle a serious problem.  In so far as it has been possible to do so, we have done what we can to ensure innocent people will not get caught up by the legislation.</P>
      <P>I have expressed the view on more than one occasion that the legislation is constitutional and that it comes within the parameters of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I did not express that view easily but that was the advice available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8, as drafted, provides for an offence of collecting, recording or possessing information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful in the commission by members of any <Col N="953" /> unlawful organisation of serious offences.  It provides for a defence for a person charged to prove that the information was not being collected, etc. for the purpose of being used in the commission of such offences.</P>
    <P>Under the amendment as proposed, it would have to be proved that the information was for the purpose of members of an unlawful organisation. If that amendment were accepted, the defence which is allowed for would not be necessary. That in turn would mean that the section would not be of any use.  Let me explain why.  It would be virtually impossible to prove that the information was going to be used by members of an unlawful organisation for the commission of an offence.  If that could be proved there would probably have been no need for the offence to be in the legislation in the first instance because the person could be charged with conspiracy or aiding and abetting an offence.</P>
    <P>What I am proposing here is already contained in UK legislation.  It is designed to get at circumstances where a person is gathering particular sorts of information.  I will give an example of that.  Let us suppose the Garda Síochána found someone who had in his or her possession details of the movements of members of the RUC and literature on bomb making equipment.  They might not be able to prove this information was in the possession of the person concerned for the commission of a particular offence, but the person could be charged with an offence under section 8.  The person would then have to show that the information was not being collected for the purpose of the commission of an offence by members of an unlawful organisation.</P>
    <P>I stated at the outset that the measures in this legislation are harsh.  However, in the light of the realities involved nowadays in combating the ruthless activities of terrorist organisations, the provision as it stands is reasonable and balanced. I oppose the amendments which would more than likely deprive the section of any effect whatsoever.</P>
    <P>Finally, with regard to Senator Costello's allegation that this provision was lying around in the Department of Justice for years and officials just wanted to slip it into some Act or other, I have been in the Department of Justice for over a year now and nobody ever said to me that this provision was lying around and that they wanted to slip it into some Act or other.  The truth is that the officials in the Department of Justice were given a task by the Government.  They did that task to the best of their ability.  If there is culpability in relation to the legislation, in relation to its provisions, it lies with those who directed the policy, not with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister because on this occasion he has been a good deal more frank than he was on section 7.  He has accepted that this is an outrageous section but he believes it is necessary. <Col N="954" /> That at least is a start.  Having accepted it as outrageous he could begin to justify it not by some vague utterance about the need to do something about the Real IRA but about the section itself.  I have no problem with making it an offence to compile information about the movements of senior members of the Judiciary with a view to carrying out an offence.  I have no problem with using the assembly of information as corroborative evidence in a conspiracy case.  I have a problem with the fact that any citizen in the State, with no other suspicion attached to them, who has information which is likely to be useful to an illegal organisation, is guilty of an offence unless they can prove an innocent purpose. That is what this section says.  It does not refer just to suspected members of illegal organisations, convicted criminals and people with criminal records but to every citizen.</P>
      <P>If somebody had detailed information on flight schedules or records of air traffic control at Dublin Airport or information about which Border roads were more accessible and which less so, is the Minister suggesting that such information would not be likely to be useful to an illegal organisation?  Would the possession by me and many of my colleagues in the Institute of Technology, Cork, of textbooks on electronics not be information which would be likely to be useful to an illegal organisation?  If the Minister suggests it would not be likely to be useful, will he explain by what legal test he makes that judgment?  It appears a vast amount of information is likely to be useful.</P>
      <P>It is not my job to combat the entire wisdom of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the parliamentary draftsman on the drafting of this section.  It is their responsibility, and that of the Minister and the Government in particular, that they put together legislation that, because they are lazy or incompetent or they have a sinister intent, is so sloppily drafted as to potentially brand every citizen of the State who has any information of any significant character in his possession as suspect of a criminal offence with a potential sentence of ten years imprisonment. It is an appalling section.  The Minister was honest when he said that if the section was tightened, it would be no good.  However, he could explain how he will ensure that it is not used to make life difficult for every citizen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should be careful about citing British precedent.  In case he has forgotten, I remind him of the Guildford Four, the Birmingham Six, the Maguires and others who were victims of the appalling Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain.  I used to boast that Ireland was a more free society than Britain because we would not allow that type of legislation to be introduced.  The Minister has given me no cause to believe that there is a reason for the section other than it is contained in the British legislation. That is a dreadful reason for doing anything <Col N="955" /> and he has accepted that it is wide open to interpretation.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to tell me the position regarding the items I cited, such as train and aeroplane timetables.  It should be noted that the section does not mention unpublished information. It covers any information, including published information.  It could be the details of President Clinton's schedule.  What about a misfortunate man in Ballybunion who happens to have a record of membership of the IRA?  He may have in his possession some information about President Clinton's plans to play golf in Ballybunion because he may be involved in it. This most manifestly would be of interest to illegal organisations if they had negative intents regarding the President of the United States.  Is that individual guilty of an offence?  Must he go to court and prove that he received the information from a legitimate source, such as the Taoiseach's protocol department?  This is what the section states.  It is the most extraordinary provision.</P>
    <P>I hoped the Minister could explain it and he confirmed that it involves precisely what I thought.  It is a catch-all provision which will be used to detain and charge anybody.  The Bill amends the Offences Against the State Act, every section of which is now covered by the Bail Act. This means that for any of these offences, the State can legitimately seek to have people denied bail on the grounds that it is a serious offence. Therefore, it is a serious offence to have information which is likely to be useful to an illegal organisation.  One can be arrested, charged and refused bail and that is called a free society.  It is the end of a free society; it is appalling legislation.</P>

      <P>I will not repeat the arguments which were well articulated by Senator Ryan. Will the Minister clarify section 8(1) which states that it shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is &ldquo;likely to be useful&rdquo; in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences?  Is there a typographical error?  Should the text read &ldquo;likely to be used&rdquo; in the commission of serious offences?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, the section is everything we suggested.  It is a catch-all provision. Various information and equipment which can be used for a variety of legitimate purposes could be useful in the commission of an offence.  Subsection (2) states that it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence to prove that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question was not being collected or recorded by him or her, or in his or her possession, for the purpose of its being used in the commission of a <Col N="956" /> serious offence.  There is a need for clarification. As the section stands, no protection is provided. The Minister should reconsider to ensure the burden of proof is not shifted on to the defendant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>If we were to substitute the word &ldquo;used&rdquo; for &ldquo;useful&rdquo; the section would read: &ldquo;It shall be an offence for a person to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be used in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation of serious offences generally.&rdquo;.  That would be a different offence.</P>
      <P>This section is geared towards those who commit an outrageous act.  Senator Ryan and, to a lesser extent, Senator Costello do the authorities and the Government a great disservice in advancing the argument that the law enforcement agencies and the Government would utilise this legislation to go after innocent citizens.  This does not stand up.  The legislation is geared towards those who are trying to subvert the democratically expressed wish of the people through a referendum, North and South, held on 22 May.  To suggest that the law enforcement agencies and the Government would pursue innocent citizens because they had in their possession flight schedules, air traffic information or information about roads is disingenuous.  What we are talking about is information which could be useful in the commission by members of an unlawful organisation of a serious offence.</P>
      <P>A serious offence is defined in this legislation as an offence which is punishable by imprisonment for a term of five years or by a more severe penalty.  In addition, it must also be an offence which involves loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment, serious loss of or damage to property, or a serious risk of any such loss, injury, imprisonment or damage.</P>
      <P>I did not think I had to go back over the argument which I advanced in the debate on the previous amendment, which was that in the first instance the State must prove that an individual had information of a nature likely to be used in the commission of the kind of offence&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Likely to be useful in the commission of a serious offence, such as those I have outlined, by an unlawful organisation.  Once that proof has been established, it is open to the defence to establish that that was not the position and that the information was not in fact being collected or recorded by the defendant for use in the commission of serious offences nor was it in the defendant's possession for that purpose.  I thought that was clear and that it would be accepted that this section, as with other provisions in the Bill, is geared towards those who would commit terrible atrocities.  That is why the legislation is as tough as it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="957" /> It is equally disingenuous for Senator Ryan to put words in my mouth.  At no stage &mdash; he should check the record &mdash; did I say that this or any other provision in this legislation was &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo;, to quote Senator Ryan.  I said it was harsh and draconian, and on one occasion I described it as some of the toughest and most severe legislation in the history of the State.  It is all those things, but it is not an attempt to somehow convict innocent people and Senator Ryan should not try to tell people it is.  That is not what this legislation is about.  It deals with a very serious situation, with people who committed a horrific offence and with those of like mind.  I make no apology about that.</P>
    <P>Senator Ryan called those who drafted the legislation lazy and incompetent.  When making such comments, he should address the motives of those who brought the legislation to the House, from the draftsmen to the public representatives. This is not an easy business; it is a serious and difficult matter.  That is why this legislation has been drafted in this way.  The offence referred to in this section, which Senator Ryan has so much difficulty with, is targeted not at innocent citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does it say that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but specifically at those who may not be involved directly in acts of terrorist violence, but who play an essential part in their planning or preparation by collecting information used for identification or selection of targets for terrorist attacks or otherwise in such attacks.  Terrorist groups cannot and do not operate without the active assistance and involvement of such persons who must, therefore, also bear some of the responsibility for the use to which the information they collect is put.  Again, I stress that with the offence of possession of articles for purposes connected with firearms or explosive offences, it would equally be open to a person who has been proved to have information of such a character to show that at the time of the alleged offence the information in question had not been connected or was not held for that purpose.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to envisage a situation where an innocent person would have flight schedule in his possession and not be able to establish it was held innocently.  I repeat that the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is charged with bringing a prosecution, is independent in the exercise of his functions and will not bring before a court cases which he believes will not stand up.  That is the first protection.  The second protection is that when a case goes before the court the ingredients of the offence set out in the section must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and even then, as is only right, the defence is open to a person.  The defence as set out in this section is as clear as it is in the other section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> If somebody wants to believe the provisions of this legislation are not meant for the purpose which I, the Taoiseach and other members of the Government have said they are for, there is little I can do about it.  I say categorically that this legislation is geared towards the people I mentioned. I firmly believe that is precisely what will happen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since some of the things I said gave offence, I apologise.  I did not mean to accuse people of being incompetent or stupid, it was just a phrase which slipped out.  I accept the Minister did not use the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo;.  What I intended to say was that the cumulative effect of the number of admissions he made about the nature of this section made it an outrageous section. I did not intend to attribute the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; to him and if I did, I apologise.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go through a cross-examination, but a flight schedule is a classic example. Does the Minister not accept that if an illegal organisation wanted to shoot down an airliner, the first thing it would need would be the flight schedule and, therefore, it would be likely to be useful?  If somebody wanted to assassinate me, they would need my home address.  That information of itself brings people under suspicion.  I know it is not the Minister's intention to pursue thousands of innocent citizens but there is not a clear divide between what various Governments classify as subversion and the rest of society &mdash; there is a large overlap.</P>
      <P>For instance, those involved in the H-block campaign were on the margins of activities.  Many of them had their homes raided during that campaign and the most extraordinary things were taken away, including in one case large quantities of condoms, on the grounds they were suspicious under the Offences against the State Act.  The connection still escapes me, but it was done.  The problem is that when pressure is applied these sections will be used.  If somebody is arrested and charged under this section, they can be remanded in custody because this is an offence which is regarded as serious enough to be covered by the provisions of the constitutional amendment on the right to bail.  This can be used to detain people.  I accept that if innocent people are charged with this offence they can prove their innocence, but the Minister has accepted something that the Government consistently denied up until tonight, that there are sections in the Bill in respect of which people will have to prove their innocence and that they will be guilty until proved innocent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get involved in a slagging match with the Minister.  It seems the offence is to possess something that is likely to be of use to an illegal organisation in the commission of serious offences.  The defence is to prove that <Col N="959" /> one had something for an innocent purpose.  That seems to put the burden of proof on the suspect, not on the prosecution.  Senator Costello was correct in saying that if the word was &ldquo;used&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;useful&rdquo;, we would not be having this argument. We may be having a slight argument but it would not be as broad-ranging.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister believes and intends this provision will be used only in the appropriate circumstances, but the Offences against the State Act has been ruled by the Supreme Court to be legitimately used by the gardaí wherever it can be used to deal with offences.  It is no longer used to deal only with terrorism and subversion.  It can be used on the judgment of the Supreme Court on a wide range of issues.</P>
      <P>The person responsible for this legislation is the Minister and this is extraordinarily sloppy drafting.  It is unworthy of a democratic society not because we will be all locked up tomorrow, but because it shows a considerable disregard for the principles on which democratic society organises itself, one of which is the right of free citizens to assemble information they are legally entitled to assemble.  Phrases to the effect that &ldquo;if people had some unpublished information&rdquo;, &ldquo;restricted information&rdquo; or &ldquo;information about individuals not normally in the public domain&rdquo; could have been used, but the Minister chose the least precise definition, &ldquo;information which is likely to be useful&rdquo;.  All information is likely to be useful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister keeps answering the wrong question. I know thousands of people will not end up in jail because of this for no other reason than the prisons are so full that there would not be room for them and because the Minister does not intend that, but that is not the way we do things <Col N="960" /> in a free society.  I should not have to say this in the second Chamber of a very democratic State. It is worth pointing out that there are only four states in Europe that have a longer history of continuous democracy in this century than this State. We are one of the more venerable democracies of the 20th century.  The issue is that this is not the sort of legislation that we should have, even in draconian circumstances.  The Minister and his Department are capable of doing better and they should have done better.  We all agree the Omagh bombing was a horrific offence and the people who did it deserve to be locked up for a long time, but that offence does not give the Minister <i>carte blanche</i> in this regard.  We need to remind ourselves where we live.  To do things like this is to allow the Real IRA to redefine our democracy, and that is not something any of us would wish. That is why I repeat my proposals in these amendments and I will not withdraw my amendment.</P>

      <P>We have come to the clear conclusion that this is perhaps the most draconian section of the Bill.  It is a classic example of why emergency and repressive legislation should never be rushed through.  A simple change of the word &ldquo;useful&rdquo; to &ldquo;used&rdquo; in the section would rid it of its more offensive aspects.  The phrase &ldquo;likely to be useful in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation&rdquo; should be changed to read &ldquo;likely to be used in the commission by members of any unlawful organisation&rdquo;.  The Minister said the original drafting is not a mistake and I accept his word.  However, if the word &ldquo;used&rdquo; was inserted, the section would read better.  It is odd that &ldquo;used&rdquo; appears in subsection (2).</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) This section shall not apply to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) information which would be exempt from disclosure in proceedings in a court on the ground of legal professional privilege or any other privilege recognised at common law or under any enactment, or</P>
      <P>(ii) information kept for the purposes of, or obtained in the course of the carrying out of, professional medical or psychiatric duties or social work by a health professional.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) In subparagraph (ii), &lsquo;health professional&rsquo; means a medical practitioner, within the meaning of the Medical Practitioners Act, 1978, or a member of any other class of health worker or social worker for the time being designated by the Minister for the purposes of that paragraph, after consultation with such (if any) other Ministers of <Col N="963" /> the Government as the Minister considers appropriate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment relates to the new offence of withholding information which might be of material assistance in preventing the commission of a crime and failing without reasonable excuse to disclose the information as soon as is practicable to a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that this new offence is across the board in its application.  There are circumstances in which information can be validly withheld.  We have specified two areas and there may be others.  The legal profession would at times be in possession of privileged or confidential information which could not be divulged to the Garda if a legal practitioner is to carry out his duties in a professional manner.</P>
    <P>The question of mandatory reporting of medical information relating to child abuse or child sexual assault covers the whole range of medical practice, be the practitioner a GP, a social worker, a nurse or a psychiatric worker.</P>
    <P>The subsection suggested in the amendment in relation to those two items should be introduced. That would exempt those two professions from the consideration of withholding of information as a serious offence because they are doing so for recognised professional purposes.</P>
    <P>It might be true that we should extend the subsection to cover other areas.  Politicians can find themselves in possession of information which could be of a serious nature in a domestic situation. Such information could be considered privileged and confidential.  Teachers could be in the same position.  We want to draw to the Minister's attention the danger of having a blanket offence of withholding information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 9 it is provided that:</P>
      <P>A person shall be guilty of an offence if he or she has information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance in&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence, or</P>
      <P>(b) securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for a serious offence,</P>
      <P>and fails without reasonable excuse to disclose that information as soon as it is practicable to a member of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>We tried to ensure this offence was drawn as tightly as possible and so defined a serious offence as being one to which a penalty of five years' imprisonment applies and which involves loss of human life, serious personal injury, false imprisonment and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During consultations on the Bill, it was suggested to us by the Labour Party that the definition as it stood, through its reference to serious personal injury, might inadvertently introduce <Col N="964" /> mandatory reporting in certain sex abuse cases. The House will be aware that the question of mandatory reporting is a very complex one; the mandatory reporting of child abuse is one of the commitments contained in An Action Programme for the Millennium, one which the Taoiseach has stated will be fulfilled in the lifetime of this Government.  To ensure the best possible legislation is enacted, the Government has given approval to the drafting of a White Paper on mandatory reporting.  In this context, notices appeared in the national newspapers on 11 August 1998 seeking submissions from any interested parties, including members of the general public who may wish to give their views prior to the publication of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>It would clearly be inappropriate in the context of a Bill designed to address very specific threats to the State to pre-empt what is to be done in regard to mandatory reporting in sexual abuse cases.  In the circumstances, the amendment made in the other House yesterday makes it clear that the reference to personal injury will exclude an injury which constitutes an offence of a sexual nature.  The House will appreciate that making this exclusion is not intended to minimise the gravity of sexual abuse cases.  It is simply intended to recognise that it would be grossly inappropriate for An Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill, which is being introduced in a particular context as a matter of urgency to attempt, however inadvertently, to deal with the issue of mandatory reporting in such cases in one way or another.  I am sure the House will appreciate the thinking behind the official amendment and the reasons for tabling it.</P>
    <P>In tabling the amendment, I was conscious of Labour Party reservations about the section as it stood and although we adopted a different approach to the form of the amendment, I believe it fairly addressed the Labour Party's main concerns. The current amendment tabled by Senators Costello, Gallagher and O'Meara is too widely drawn.  I do not accept there should be a blanket exclusion of various members of a particular profession from an obligation to report the matter if they were aware a murder was about to be committed. In regard to the position of members of particular professions, the offence contains the concept of &ldquo;without reasonable excuse&rdquo;.  That is a sufficient and appropriate protection in regard to the interests of particular professions.  I hope Senators can accept that the amendment made to the Bill yesterday went a long way towards addressing their concerns and, for the reasons I have outlined, I hope they will withdraw this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response and for the action he took in seeking to address the concerns we expressed.  His amendment went some way towards addressing those concerns in exempting any personal injury other than one which constitutes an offence of a sexual nature from being considered an offence.  If the <Col N="965" /> term &lsquo;offence&rsquo; is limited to an offence of a sexual nature, one might equally refer to a medical practitioner in regard to a domestic assault on a child or any other offence of a physical nature.  This is clearly a further category which should be included.  The same could apply to the teaching profession or to public representatives.  The amendment does not address the issue of legal, professional privilege in dealings with clients.  I accept the Minister's attempts in his amendment but it is limited in its application.</P>

      <P>In page 9, to delete lines 5 to 32 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) (a) Where a member of the Garda Síochána arrests without warrant a person (&lsquo;the arrested person&rsquo;) whom he or she, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed a serious offence, the arrested person&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) may be taken to a Garda Síochána station, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station has, at the time of the arrested person's arrival there, reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence, may be detained in that station for a period or periods authorised by subsection (4A).</P>
      <P>(b) Without prejudice to paragraph (a), where a member of the Garda Síochána suspects an arrested person of having committed a serious offence, that person may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i) be taken to a place of detention, and</P>
      <P>(ii) if a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector who is not investigating the serious offence has, at the time of that person's arrival there, reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the serious offence, be detained in that place of detention for a period or periods authorised by subsection (4A).</P>
      <P>(4A) (a) The period for which a person may be detained under subsection (4) shall, subject to the provisions of this subsection, not exceed 6 hours from the time of his or her arrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may direct that a person detained under subsection (4) be detained for a further period not exceeding 18 hours if <Col N="966" /> he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
    <P>(c) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may direct that a person detained pursuant to a direction under paragraph (b) be detained for a further period not exceeding 24 hours, if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
    <P>(d) A direction under paragraph (b) or (c) may be given orally or in writing and, if given orally, shall be recorded in writing as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>(e) Where a direction has been given under paragraph (b) or (c), the fact that the direction was given, the date and time when it was given and the name and rank of the officer of the Garda Síochána who gave it shall be recorded.</P>
    <P>(f) The direction or, if it was given orally, the written record of it shall be signed by the officer giving it and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) shall state the date and time when it was given, the officer's name and rank and that the officer had reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention was necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned, and</P>
    <P>(ii) shall be attached to and form part of the custody record (within the meaning of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) Regulations, 1987) in respect of the person concerned.</P>
    <P>(g) (i) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may apply to a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court for a warrant authorising the detention of a person detained pursuant to a direction under paragraph (c) for a further period not exceeding 72 hours if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.  On an application under this subsection the detained person shall be present in court and may make submissions or have submissions made on his or her behalf before the court.</P>
    <P>(ii) On an application under subparagraph (i) the judge concerned <Col N="967" /> shall issue a warrant authorising the detention of the person to whom the application relates for a further period not exceeding 72 hours if, but only if, the judge is satisfied that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>(h) (i) An officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent may apply to a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court for a warrant authorising the detention of a person detained under a warrant issued pursuant to paragraph (g) (ii) for a further period not exceeding 48 hours, if he or she has reasonable grounds for believing that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned.</P>
    <P>(ii) On an application under subparagraph (i) the judge concerned shall issue a warrant authorising the detention of the person to whom the application relates for a further period not exceeding 48 hours if, but only if, the judge is satisfied that such further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously.</P>
    <P>(4B) On an application under subsection (4A) the person to whom the application relates shall be produced before the judge concerned and the judge shall hear any submissions made and consider any evidence adduced by or on behalf of the person and the officer of the Garda Síochána making the application.</P>
    <P>(4C) When issuing a warrant under subsection (4A) the judge concerned may order that the person concerned be brought before a judge of the Circuit Court or a judge of the District Court at a specified time or times during the period of detention specified in the warrant and if, upon the person's being so brought before such a judge, he or she is not satisfied that the person's detention is justified, the judge shall revoke the warrant and order the immediate release from custody of the person.</P>
    <P>(4D) If at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section there are no longer reasonable grounds for believing that his or her detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence to which the detention relates, he <Col N="968" /> or she shall, subject to subsection (4E), be released from custody forthwith unless he or she is charged or caused to be charged with an offence and is brought before a court as soon as may be in connection with such charge or his or her detention is authorised apart from this Act.</P>
    <P>(4E) If at any time during the detention of a person pursuant to this section a member of the Garda Síochána, with reasonable cause, suspects that person of having committed a serious offence other than the offence to which the detention relates and&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the member of the Garda Síochána then in charge of the Garda Síochána station, or</P>
    <P>(b) in case the person is being detained in a place of detention, a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of inspector who is not investigating the offence to which the detention relates or the other offence,</P>
    <P>has reasonable grounds for believing that the continued detention of the person is necessary for the proper investigation of that other offence, the person may continue to be detained in relation to the other offence as if that offence was the offence for which the person was originally detained.</P>
    <P>(4F) To avoid doubt, it is hereby declared that a person shall not be detained pursuant to this section for more than 168 hours from the time of his or her arrest, not including any period which is to be excluded under section 4(8) of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, in reckoning a period of detention.</P>
    <P>(4G) Nothing in this section shall affect the operation of section 4 of Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>(4H) (a) The Minister may make regulations prescribing specified places as places where a person may be detained pursuant to subsection (4) (b), and a place for the time being standing so specified is referred to in this Act as a &lsquo;place of detention&rsquo;.</P>
    <P>(b) Section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and any regulations made thereunder shall, with any necessary modifications, apply in relation to places of detention as they apply in relation to Garda Síochána stations.</P>
    <P>(4I) Every regulation made under this section shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which that <Col N="969" /> House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>My amendment seeks to include in this Bill similar provisions to those found in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act where there is a provision to extend detention up to 168 hours in special cases.  Senator O'Donovan informed us on Second Stage that under the various criminal codes a person can be detained for three different periods.  Initially detention can last for up to six hours, then 48 hours under the 1939 Act which will now go up to 72 hours, and under the drug trafficking Act it goes up to 168 hours.  Earlier I said we should establish fair periods of detention. What I say now will contradict my earlier comments on the matter.  One has to be very careful in relation to periods of detention and the judicial interventions required to extend the period of detention.  First, second and third extensions are usually on the warrant of a superintendent or Garda officer of that rank or higher and then after that one needs judicial interventions to get further extensions.  However, I would like to hear what the Minister has to say on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for his brevity and lucidity.</P>
      <P>This amendment seeks to provide powers in relation to detention which apply under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996 to what are called &ldquo;serious offences&rdquo;.  Serious offences does not appear to be defined.  It seems clear the Senator has in mind offences by members of an unlawful organisation.  The legitimate question has been raised as to why the Bill does not allow for seven day detention as is the case in relation to drug traffickers under the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996. That argument may for some have a certain attractiveness but this matter was given serious consideration in devising the package of measures before the House.  I assure the Senator that if the Government had concluded that increasing powers of detention up to seven days was a necessary and appropriate response to the threat which we are trying to address then we would have had no hesitation in introducing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we need to remind ourselves there were two specific justifications put forward for allowing seven day detention in the case of drug trafficking.  First, we needed to have a longer period of detention to cope with the problem of people who had ingested drugs so that there would be sufficient time for the drugs to leave their bodies.  Second, we had an international drug trade to deal with and the necessary inquiries by the Garda could take considerably more time than would generally arise in the commission of other offences.  Different considerations apply in relation to the type of offences <Col N="970" /> we are trying to deal with in this legislation.  The considered view of the Garda authorities is that seven day detention would not confer on them significant operational benefits in the context of the type of offences at issue.  Instead they favoured the more limited extension of the periods of detention provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>While I understand why Senator Connor has raised this matter I am sure he will accept that where the security advice available to the Government is as I have outlined, proceeding with such a proposal would be a reaction which would be designed for reason of appearance rather than substance &mdash; I know the Senator does not intend that to happen.  The option of seven day detention will be kept under review, as will other measures.  I hope the House will be able to accept that the course adopted by the Government in relation to the increased detention powers is the correct one in all of the circumstances.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 10, lines 14 and 15, to delete &ldquo;, a prison or some other convenient place&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I expect the Minister will graciously and gratefully accept my amendment which proposes the deletion of the words &ldquo;a prison or some other convenient place&rdquo; for a period of 24 hours from the time of arrest.  A person could be detained under warrant pursuant to section 30 of the 1939 Act in a Garda station, a prison or other convenient place.  What place could be more convenient than a Garda station if they are arrested by a garda?  It is not as though Garda stations are hard to find.</P>
      <P>There are Garda stations dotted all over the country.  There is no reason we should have such an extensive list of possible locations where somebody would be detained for 24 hours.  Any such stipulation is outrageous.  I would have thought the legislation would be determined on the basis of people being arrested, whether detained for 24, 48, or 72 hours or for 24 hours under warrant in a Garda station.  Perhaps the Minister will agree to this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Senator Costello drawing attention to this matter.  It is not the practice to detain someone arrested under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, 1939, other than in a Garda station.  As currently worded, that section allows a person arrested under section 30 to be brought to a Garda station, prison or some other convenient place.  It would not have been possible in the context of this Bill <Col N="971" /> and in the timescale associated with it to set about completely recasting section 30 as it stands.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Bill deals with rearrest under section 30 of the Act.  It essentially provides that a person may not be rearrested under section 30 of the 1939 Act in respect of an offence for which he or she has already been detained, except under the authority of a warrant issued by a judge of the District Court who is satisfied with information supplied on oath by an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda Síochána as to the suspected participation of that person in the offence for which the arrest is sought.</P>
      <P>The provision goes on to apply the provisions of section 30 to arrests under this section and it is in the context of a restatement of part of the existing section 30 that the reference to the detention in custody in a Garda station, prison, or some other convenient place occurs.  The provision has no greater significance than that and it would have been incongruous to provide for different arrangements for a further period of detention than apply at present under section 30.</P>
      <P>I accept that if we had started with a plain sheet of paper in relation to section 30 generally we would have had to re-examine whether the reference to places other than Garda stations would be appropriate.  However, as I explained, it would not have been possible in the context of this Bill to set about completely recasting section 30, which could have involved extensive rewriting of other provisions of that legislation.</P>
      <P>In that context, I remind the House of the commitment contained in the British-Irish Agreement to carry out a wide-ranging review of the Offences Against the State Acts generally.  I will establish such a review mechanism shortly by way of the establishment of a special committee under independent membership, with the participation of Government and outside experts.  It will be in their remit to consider whether section 30 should be retained and, if so, in what format.  Obviously an issue which will fall to be considered in that context is the one raised by Senator Costello's amendment.  I assure him his amendment will be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:</P>
      <P>In page 10, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="972" />&ldquo;(1) For the purposes of this section &lsquo;firearm&rsquo; shall have the meaning given to it in Section (4)(i)(a), (d), (e) and (g) of The Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will not delay the House on this amendment. For a great deal of time I have been tickled by the peculiarities of legislation where a firearm is defined as a crossbow, stungun etc.  I am intent as often as I can on raising this as legislation should not sound ridiculous to ordinary people.  To define a crossbow as a firearm is ridiculous.  Furthermore, in the context of this legislation to suggest that to train someone in the use of a stungun, airgun, including an air rifle or an air pistol, or a crossbow, is an equivalent offence to showing someone how to use a sub-machine gun or explosives, seems to be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  This amendment suggests gently and without rancour that it would be better, in terms of this legislation and the penalty it contains to confine the provisions of this section, the principle of which I agree with, to the objective of the Bill, which is to deal with those who use bombs and guns to kill people and to commit serious offences.</P>

      <P>I appreciate what the Senator is trying to achieve.

It would be more appropriate to deal with it in the context of specific legislation on firearms.</P>

Many people in rural areas have legally held weapons for pest extermination and so forth.  It should be made explicit that, subject to the law, it will not be any more difficult for an average citizen on a farm to train his children in the safe use of legally held firearms.  There should be no obstacle to such training.</P>

I do not wish to get involved in a debate about firearms at this juncture but if the Senator's amendment were accepted it could be used to defeat the purpose of the section.  If a component were removed from a firearm in order to render it incapable of discharging a shot, for example, it would not be covered by the amended section.

      <P>When the Constitution was amended regarding the right to bail the citizens were assured that the new legislation would only apply to serious offences.  It was not intended to deal with minor offences.  Not all the offences listed in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill are serious even in the eyes of the people who drafted it because some of them carry a maximum penalty of three months in prison.  We are now invited to accept that every offence under this Bill, including those which have a maximum penalty of three months in jail, are serious offences.  The Minister says that the Attorney General has advised him that every section of this Bill is constitutional. However, I understood the constitutional amendment was concerned with serious offences. Now every offence under this Bill is covered. One could see the State seeking to refuse bail to someone charged with an offence carrying a maximum penalty of three months in jail, which is less that the maximum penalty for being drunk in the street.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), line 37, after &ldquo;14&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, 16&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I have reluctantly concluded that the amendment to the Constitution with regard to bail is a fact of life and will never be repealed.  I am, therefore, very reluctant to have what is essentially emergency legislation, that is the Offences Against the State Act, permanently part of our ordinary legislation by virtue of section 16.  If, hopefully, we reach conditions in our society where sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 are allowed to lapse, then we should also allow section 16 &mdash; which inserts the Offences Against the State Act into the Schedule of the Bail Act &mdash; to lapse.  My amendment suggests that section 16 should be added as one of the sections that will lapse at the end of June 2000.  I cannot understand why we would want to keep it if we are hoping to review, and particularly to repeal, large sections of the legislation we are dealing with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment would provide that on scheduling of the offences created by this Act for the purposes of the Bail Act, they should cease to be in operation as from 30 June 2000, unless renewed.  I am advised that it is not necessary to provide for this.  If offences under the Act are not renewed the automatic effect would be that they are no longer scheduled for the purposes of the Bail Act.  Equally, it is fair to say that if it was decided to renew the offences it would be unthinkable that they would not be <Col N="976" /> regarded as offences that should be scheduled for the purposes of the Bail Act.  I trust that explains the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not completely.  I understood that the sections in this Bill will lapse.  However, all other sections of the Offences Against the State Acts, which are classified or definable as serious offences, will remain on the Schedule of the Bail Act.  They were not there before and there must have been a reason for not having them.  Hopefully, we are moving into a period of peace in the State with an end to paramilitary violence.  I do not see why we should keep the Offences Against the State Act if that legislation is to play no further role in future.  I do not see why, therefore, the Minister does not at least accept the possibility of section 16 lapsing.  After all, if he changes his mind, all he has to do is persuade both Houses of the Oireachtas not to do it.  I do not understand the apparent determination to retain the Offences Against the State Act in the Schedule of the Bail Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained that the whole question of the Offences Against the State Acts will be considered by an expert group.  The people, in their wisdom, made a decision in November 1996 in regard to the question of bail and decided that, in respect of serious or indictable offences carrying a certain term of imprisonment or more, a court would be entitled to refuse bail if the court felt it was likely that the individual before the court was likely to commit a further offence if granted bail.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's intention to implement the Bail Act next year in respect of all the offences which would be caught in its net. Obviously, that would include some of the offences which currently exist under the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1985.  In so far as the offences in this legislation are concerned, if this legislation should lapse on 30 June 2000, nobody could be charged with an offence under it.  Because of that fact there would not be any applications for bail.</P>

      <P>In page 12, subsection (1), lines 38 to 40, to delete &ldquo;, unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that that section should continue in operation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the key aspects of legislation of this nature is its termination date, the length of time it will be on the Statute Book.  It is presented as draconian emergency legislation to deal with a particular set of circumstances.  Therefore, it is important that we determine at the outset how <Col N="977" /> we will terminate it.  The Labour Party's view is that the legislation should lapse unconditionally. It should cease after a specified time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has brought forward the contingent date from December 2000 to 30 June 2000, unless a resolution is introduced.  He has now further committed himself to implement a Fine Gael amendment which sought an annual review in the forthcoming Criminal Justice Bill.  All of that is welcome.  It is an indication of the Minister's intent.</P>
    <P>The British-Irish Agreement makes provision over the next two years for a total overhaul and examination of the Offences Against the State Acts and emergency legislation North and South. Rather than have a situation where there would be an ongoing review of legislation of this nature, if it is felt necessary to continue to have such legislation it would be best to consolidate the situation in the review which will take place and start afresh.</P>
    <P>My party's contention is that there should be a clean break and that the last part , which is &ldquo;unless a resolution has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas resolving that the section should continue .&rdquo;, should be deleted and we should look at the matter afresh at that time.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 45a seeks to ensure that if sections of the Bill are renewed they should be subject to an annual review by the Oireachtas.  I propose to meet Deputy Flanagan's point.  The official amendments will provide that where a provision is being renewed it shall be for a period specified by the Oireachtas and that before any such renewal takes place a report must be made on the operation of the relevant section.</P>
      <P>Having heard that promise to meet the proposal in this amendment in the other House, it did not go close to meeting it although the Minister would say otherwise.  However, we have had assurances from the Minister on the point at the commencement of Committee Stage.

      <P>I support Senator Connor's amendment.  This amendment was tabled in the other House and the Minister agreed to accept the point.  Therefore, Members were amazed that the Bill as passed by Dáil Éireann did not include reference to the annual review.  For that reason, we felt that the matter needed to be tabled again this evening.  We hope that the Minister can accept this provision because there are certain elements of the Bill about which one would have a number or reservations.  It would be in the interests of natural justice that the Bill be subject <Col N="978" /> to an annual review because legislation such as this is introduced for specific purposes.  In view of the climate and circumstances which arise in the country over any given period of time, legislation such as this should be reviewed.  It may be deemed that sections of it are not necessary or that the legislation is not necessary in the years ahead.  In the interests of justice and the protection of the citizen, it would be wise to include that.  I hope the Minister will be able to give us a firm and detailed assurance that this annual review will be included in a section of a Bill so that not alone will legislators know they have achieved this but it can be reviewed by the Oireachtas on an annual basis after 6 June 2000.</P>

      <P>The Bill as originally published provided that specified sections will lapse by 31 December 2000 unless renewed by the Oireachtas.  The effect of this amendment would be to provide that the Bill would lapse at a specified time.  In other words, if some of the provisions were to continue in operation new primary legislation would have to be introduced.  I do not accept the argument that there is a democratic deficit in approaching the matter by way of providing for the renewal by order in some of the sections.  Those orders have to be subject to positive resolutions by the Houses of the Oireachtas. This approach is similar to the one taken in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act, 1996.</P>
      <P>In response to concerns expressed in the Dáil yesterday about the provisions in relation to the sections lapsing, I made three amendments to the Bill as originally published: the original date of 31 December 2000 was brought forward to 30 June 2000; the provisions can now be renewed for whatever period the Oireachtas would specify in a resolution; and sections can only be renewed after a report is laid before the Oireachtas on the operation of those sections in the period prior to the renewal resolution.  I believe this represents a balanced approach to the concerns expressed.  In the circumstances, I am not disposed to accepting the amendment.  While I am of the view that section 18(2) allows for an annual review I gave an assurance earlier that the amendment to the criminal law Bill to be introduced will have the same effect as amendment No. 18 tabled by Senator Connor.</P>

In the interests of clarity it is now proposed that it would be provided that no resolution passed renewing the legislation would be for a period longer than 12 months.  That would obviously mean that following that 12 months a new resolution would be required.  That achieves the purpose of the amendment.</P>

    <P>We have already discussed this issue and I will not dwell on it to any great degree.

In that context, I must make it clear that both Governments are wholeheartedly committed to the human rights aspects of the British-Irish Agreement.  As Members may be aware, the British Government has made provision for the establishment of a Northern Ireland human rights commission in the Northern Ireland Bill and its legislation is well advanced.  Under the terms of the Agreement, the British Government is committed to establishing a human rights commission with a mandate and remit equivalent to that of the Northern Ireland Commission in addition to taking further measures to strengthen and underpin the constitutional protection of human rights in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>I have established a human rights division in my Department to deal with our obligations in this area.  A human rights commission Bill is in the process of being drafted and it is our firm hope that this Bill will be processed in the Oireachtas in the forthcoming session to enable the establishment of the commission to be completed by early next year.  However, I do not believe it is right to make a legislative connection between that and the terms of the Bill before the House.  It seems wrong in principle that if for any reason the Oireachtas was not in a position to finalise the necessary legislation, the provisions of a Bill aimed against those who represent a murderous threat to the community should lapse. Who would benefit from that?</P>
      <P>I hope the Senator will accept my assurances that we will do everything in our power to establish the commission within the timescale referred to in the amendment.  I am confident that timescale will be met.</P>

      <P>It is sad the legislation contains many provisions we are prepared to accept even though we may not be satisfied with their inclusion.  A number of sections, which could have been amenable to amendment if a reasonable timescale had existed, were not amended.  A proper and calm parliamentary debate would have resulted in considerable amendments to the section governing the possession of information. A number of sections would be better, more useful and more just if we had adequate time to debate and amend them.</P>
      <P>I oppose the idea of emergency legislation.  I am not persuaded that such legislation has anything to do with the urgency of arresting people because unless they are incredibly stupid those people will have already received the signals and will no longer be available to be placed under arrest.  Unfortunately, having heard the Minister's explanation for them, I cannot find sections of the Bill acceptable.  I do not, therefore, support the passing of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Obviously we support the legislation but we have concerns about certain safeguards in it.  I want the Minister to accept the need for electronic recording of all interviews in Garda stations relating to this legislation.  That safeguard is most conspicuous by its absence.  I wish the legislation was more focused so that it would be directed simply at subversive activities as is intended, and that it was clear when it would be terminated.</P>
      <P>This was difficult legislation for the Minister and he presented it well.  I thank him for the courtesy he showed and compliment him on his endurance throughout the day.  It has not been easy and he handled himself extremely well.  He responded to our questions and comments with courtesy and in great detail.</P>

      <P>Very few people regard this Bill as desirable but that is not the issue.  It is undoubtedly necessary however undesirable.  It is also necessary that it be passed expeditiously because the more time given to the type of people who perpetrated the outrage in Omagh, the greater possibility there is for them to escape justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stated earlier that whatever infringements in terms of civil liberties might be attached to this legislation, they are greatly subordinate to the greater right, which is the right to life and the pursuit of one's happiness and freedom.  That is <Col N="982" /> why, however uncomfortable we might be with certain aspects of the Bill, the aftermath of Omagh dictates that this Bill passes and that is why we on this side of the House support it.  I thank the Minister for the way in which he dealt in great detail with all the amendments tabled and the manner in which he attended throughout the day to deal with this important legislation.  All of us hope the purpose for which it was brought forward will be realised; that there will be no more atrocities such as that at Omagh and we will proceed to build on the peace process and consolidate the Agreement signed in Stormont on Good Friday.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister and his officials after a long, hard day.  This legislation is necessary and while it would be lovely to say it could have been avoided, it could not.  The events of two weeks ago propelled and accelerated the necessity for this Bill.  There are aspects of it with which other Senators were not happy, but it is balanced approach to a difficult situation.  The Minister, the Government and the Taoiseach must be complimented in pushing this forward because it must be put on the Statute Book.  I hope events will transpire in 18 months or two years when it will be subject to review so that it will not be needed again.</P>

      <P>On a point of order, it would appear very churlish if I did not echo the remarks of other Members.  I thank the Minister for his attention and time.  I compliment the Leader for the fact that there was no attempt to guillotine the debate.  I regret the Bill was not debated in the other House as it was here.  The debate finished on time and I thank the Minister for his presence at all times and for being forthcoming.  It was remiss of me not to say it when I spoke earlier.  I thank the Minister for his patience.</P>

      <P>I extend my deepest thanks to the Members for the courtesy afforded me today.  We had a very thorough discussion on this very important legislation.  It was inevitable there would be differences of opinion.  It is never a pleasure for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the Oireachtas with legislation in circumstances such as this, no more than it is a pleasure for a Minister to have to introduce measures such as are contained in this Bill.  Nonetheless the measures will stand the test of constitutionality, should that arise.  I believe also the measures are within the parameters of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I thank all Senators for their considered contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I extend my deepest appreciation to the very senior officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform who have been working assiduously on this legislation since the terrible <Col N="983" /> atrocity in Omagh, County Tyrone.  They have been working day and night on this extremely complex and difficult legislation, amending as it does the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939 to 1985, which themselves are extremely complex and difficult.  Sometimes the amount of expertise required of officials drafting legislation such as this is not realised.  We are very privileged to have officials of the calibre of those in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and in the security and law reform division areas.  The Government set them a task and they complied with the Government's wishes to the letter.  No more could have been asked of them and I know they would produce no less.</P>
    <P>I extend my thanks to all the staff of the House for the manner in which they have dealt with this matter.  I thank all Senators irrespective of the views they hold.  It is extremely important in a <Col N="984" /> democracy that everybody should be allowed to express his or her view and that is something we should always treasure.</P>
