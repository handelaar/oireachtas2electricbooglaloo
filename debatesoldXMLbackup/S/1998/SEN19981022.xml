      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to restore the two teachers lost to the inner city primary schools of St. Mary's Place, Dorset Street and the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, Dublin 1.</P>
      <P>I have also received notice from Senator Avril Doyle of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Agriculture and Food to address the concerns of the members of the Milk Rights Group in getting full compensation for losses arising from the failure of the Minister to recognise their quota rights in line with their farm modernisation plans.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by Senators Costello and Doyle as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is item 1, Committee and remaining Stages to be taken today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it proposed to have a sos between the end of Committee Stage and the start of Report Stage?  Could the Leader enlighten me as to whether there will be a White Paper or legislation on mental health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Colleagues will have seen the report from Naas court in the newspapers today of a clear instance of gazumping, a practice which is sadly becoming increasingly frequent in the building and housing market.  They will note the judge stated that the builder may have been legally right but was not <Col N="1226" /> morally right.  The Fine Gael Party recently introduced a Private Members' Bill to end the practice of gazumping but it was rejected by the Government. Will the Leader convey to the Government the views of all parties in this House that this practice cannot be ignored and must be tackled?</P>
    <P>I raised yesterday the question of the shortage of funding for the Free Legal Aid Board which is causing serious delays in its work.  I put down a motion on the Order Paper which draws attention to that and I propose an amendment to today's Order of Business: &ldquo;that item 25 in my own and Senator Connor's names be taken at the end of the Solicitors Bill today&rdquo;.  This is an important matter and as the Minister will be in the House we should be in a position to spend a couple of hours discussing a matter of great concern to many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Manning.  The Order of Business is short so it would be worthwhile to discuss an issue as critical as the absence of legal aid.</P>
      <P>There are still two building workers in jail.  The stench of illegality and less than happy practice in the building industry is beginning to be detected. Belated promises of voluntary codes of practice are hard to take when decency seems to have gone out the window.  People are in jail and young couples are being gazumped.  It is time the building industry realised that it operates in a civilised society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I second Senator Manning's proposal to amend the Order of Business.  Much concern has been expressed in the media at the unacceptable delays in the free legal aid service.</P>
      <P>I support the remarks made by Senator Ryan this morning and yesterday on the question of building workers.  This matter was also aired on the Pat Kenny radio show today.  I raise this matter under item 8 on the Order Paper, the Protection of Workers (Shops) (No. 2) Bill, 1997.</P>

      <P>I understand this matter will be before the courts this morning.  In those circumstances I request Senators not to pursue it as I would not wish the House to impinge on a matter which is within the ambit of the courts. Senator Ryan spoke in general terms about the building industry and I do not wish to have a discussion on a particular matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure you, a Chathaoirligh, that I too will speak in general terms about the regulation, or should I say the non-regulation, of the building industry.  For years the trade union movement has been demanding that the building industry put its house in order.  That has not happened. A case was heard in the courts yesterday of a person who put a deposit on a house only to have it sold to another bidder.  I raise the question of gazumping and of re-zoning.  People buy agricultural <Col N="1227" /> land and subsequently make a vast profit because of the lack of regulation.  The lack of health and safety standards has led to an enormous increase in the number of fatal accidents in the building industry.  Workers are now being forced to work under a contractor's unfair terms. Arising from this practice a court injunction has been granted and two people are in jail.  It is important that we address the lack of proper regulations in the building industry and that the Government has a responsibility to regulate the industry, if it cannot be done on a voluntary basis. Controls must be put in place so that those who wish to can extricate themselves from the black economy.</P>

      <P>Senator Hayes was unavoidably absent at the commencement of yesterday's sitting and he wishes to join in the tributes which were paid to the Nobel Peace Prize winners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you Sir, and to my colleagues for allowing me this privilege.  I was indeed late coming into the House yesterday. It is ironic, in view of the debate we had afterwards that I was delayed partly by Dublin traffic which does not yet qualify as an act of God, although it must be very near it.</P>
      <P>I join other Members in congratulating Mr. John Hume and Mr. David Trimble on receiving the Nobel Peace Prize.  The award is hugely symbolic and the Nobel committee did the right thing.  The prize could have been awarded to one or to many.  It is better seen as an award to those who contributed to the peace process at all levels. I was glad to hear my friend and former colleague, Senator Gordon Wilson, mentioned here yesterday.  Many people have laboured in that vineyard and recognition to a couple of them means the rest have been recognised.  The efforts of Mr. Gerry Adams, Senator Mitchell, the Taoiseach, the Prime Minister, former Taoisigh and former Ministers for Foreign Affairs should not go unnoticed.  All these have contributed in their different ways but there was a rightness and a symmetry in this double award because if it takes two to make a fight it equally takes two to make it up.  The British-Irish Agreement represented a coming together of the traditions in Northern Ireland.  The agreement was one between nationalism and unionism to share the area, to draw a line under the past and to face towards the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Hume is one of the great figures in Irish history and politics.  He is a parliamentarian in the O'Connell mould and tradition.  More than anyone he has been consistent in his cry for peace and his adherence to the principles of non-violence. Most of the seminal ideas in the agreement came from him.  Mr. Trimble has shown enormous courage and growing stature over the last <Col N="1228" /> months.  The best summation was made by Senator George Mitchell, a strong contender for the prize himself, when he said that without John Hume there would not have been a peace process and without David Trimbe there would not have been a peace agreement.</P>
    <P>The award has been given not only to recognise past deeds, but to encourage people in the future. I am sure it will do that.  It will encourage people to meet the difficulties that exist and which will arise in the future, but which the spirit of the Nobel Prize will help to overcome.  For that reason, I welcome the prize.  I congratulate those who received it both in their personal capacities and for what they represent as standard bearers for all others who were participants in the process. I, too, hope it brings about the reconciliation for which we all hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I read with interest this morning of a decision taken yesterday at a meeting of the main party opposite regarding regionalisation.  In view of that, I invite the Leader to make a statement on where the most peripheral areas stand. In particular what will be the position of the county furthest away and least well served by road networks in terms of Objective One status? I refer to the good county of Kerry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would welcome a debate on housing and development.  Everyone knows a booking deposit means nothing.  Solicitors must inform their clients that a booking deposit has no legal status.  Contracts should be signed by the purchaser and seller before a property goes on the market.</P>
      <P>I would also welcome a debate on the national lottery.  Since the price of playing the lotto has increased, the prize has tended to roll over from week to week.  When I was a gasúr going to fairs, I was always warned that I could never win from a trick-of-the-loop man.  The national lottery could be regarded as a trick-of-the-loop business. It promised to pay out £1 million in prizes each week.  Of course it did.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has no control over this matter and cannot debate it now.  The Senator should have sought a debate on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieFarrell" hpid="Mr. Farrell Mr. Farrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sought a debate on the matter because it is important.  When the main prize is not won the money should be divided among the match five and match four winners.  The current situation is scandalous and it is time it was taken from behind the smoke screen and aired in public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ShaneRoss" hpid="Mr. Ross Mr. Ross">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ross</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not here yesterday but I do not expect the same indulgence from the House as was afforded to Senator Hayes.  I wish to be associated with the remarks he made, or at least <Col N="1229" /> with most of them.  I congratulate both parties. The House should also recognise the role of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, in the process.  There are many others who might have won the peace prize.  The role of Deputy Reynolds has not been recognised and I say that as someone who was critical of much of what he did as Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>I worry when Senators Ryan, Manning, Costello and I agree on a matter.  The Butler case mentioned by Senator Manning is a serious matter for the building industry, but more so for young couples.  I cannot understand what a booking deposit is for, if it does not book a house at a certain price.  This seems utterly immoral.  I do not want the Leader to reply by saying the Government has referred the matter to the Law Reform Commission.  Everyone knows the Law Reform Commission is a wonderful hole in which to bury problems such as this.  In this time of economic boom some people are losing out and the Butlers are among thousands of others.</P>
      <P>What is needed is legislation.  In saying the practice is immoral, but that he could not do anything about it, the judge in the case was saying in effect that we need legislation.  It is a simple matter and, if the Leader wishes, I will draft the legislation for him in 20 minutes.  Let us not hear about the Law Reform Commission, rather let us hear of urgent action on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning sought a sos between the Committee and remaining stages of the Bill.  I suggest a 30 minute break.  The Senator has also proposed that the House take item 25 today.  I had no prior notice of this proposal, although I agree with his sentiments.  I ask him to accept a postponement of the matter until the week after next and I will include it in the business for that week.  The Whips can discuss the arrangements.</P>
      <P>Senators Manning, Ryan, Costello, Farrell and Ross sought a debate involving the Minister for the Environment and Local Government on regulating the building industry, particularly with regard to house purchasing, gazumping, health and safety, employment conditions and, I would add, training incentives in the industry.  I will contact the Minister this morning to seek a debate on those matters the week after next.</P>
      <P>Senator Coghlan sought, as always, the best possible deal for County Kerry.  I will pass on his views but, as he knows, the matter is being discussed at a high level and when I have an indication of progress on the discussions I will inform the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Farrell sought an urgent debate on the lottery.  I will make time available <Col N="1230" /> in the next few weeks for such a debate.  The lottery has been an outstanding success and many voluntary organisations and communities have received contributions from it which have made projects possible.  I will arrange time to discuss the lottery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I give that commitment.  Furthermore, the drafting of the new mental health Bill, with the assistance of the Office of the Attorney General, is at an advanced stage of preparation. It will replace the Mental Treatment Act, 1945, and amending legislation.  The Minister for Health and Children hopes to be in a position to publish the Bill before the end the year.</P>

    <Title>Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, 1998: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>SECTION 1.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (2), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(k) expressly or impliedly creates the impression that no fee whatsoever will be payable by a person unless the person is successful in a claim for damages.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 1 refers to certain conditions for solicitors advertisements.  They must not bring the profession into disrepute, must not be in bad taste, must not reflect unfavourably on other solicitors or profess a superior knowledge to other solicitors, must not be false or misleading and they must be published in an appropriate location.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that an advertisement must not create the impression that no fee will be payable by the client unless he or she is successful in a claim for damages.  It relates to the &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; practice.  The impression is conveyed in some advertisements that there is no downside to taking a legal action, that it is similar to backing a horse which does not win and getting one's money back.  This is grossly misleading.  In cases where there is a doubt or ones which are fought by a local authority or a supermarket &mdash; Senator Quinn said his has fought successful claims &mdash; a person could be liable for full costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1231" /> The Law Society is concerned about the &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; concept.  Hopefully this amendment will strengthen the Bill as it would help avoid creating the impression that no fee will be payable unless the case is successful.  That must be stamped out.  There is a possibility in every case that it may be lost and a person could be liable for costs.  My amendment will strengthen this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment which is appropriate in the context of this legislation which discourages the practice of misleading or false advertising.  As regards personal injury claims or portfolio claims, whether for Army deafness or social welfare benefits &mdash; as happened in the mid-1980s &mdash; the case is almost certainly won.  Solicitors get a considerable fee knowing there is little danger they will lose a case.</P>
      <P>It is important that this matter is dealt with specifically although it is probably covered in section (1)(2)(j) which covers anything which is contrary to public policy.  The &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; practice, as distinct from this legislation, is a good one.  Lawyers should have the flexibility, if a low earner or an unemployed person approaches them with a genuine grievance, to take the case and see it through on the basis that it is worthwhile and that there is a 50-50 chance of winning it.  The general practice must be preserved. However, as regards this legislation which specifically deals with improper inducements, it should be discouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of amendment No. 1 would be to prohibit &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; advertising by solicitors in claims for damages. At present, the Law Society's 1996 advertising regulations deems advertising which uses the words &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; or similar words which indicate that clients will not be required to pay the solicitor's fees unless they are successful in their action, to be in bad taste, false and misleading.</P>
      <P>Under the regulations, the advertisements should make clear that clients may be liable for expenses incurred by the solicitor and for the legal costs of other parties to the proceedings.  On Second Stage, Senator Cosgrave said the words &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; or other words of similar import act as an inducement to persons to engage in personal injuries litigation.  I appreciate the basis of the amendment tabled by Senators Cosgrave and Manning.  However, in the course of the preparation of the Bill, the question of such advertising was considered and the Bill addresses the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this regard, I direct the House's attention to section 1, in particular paragraphs (h) and (i) of the new subsection (2) which is to be inserted in <Col N="1232" /> section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954.  Paragraph (h) prohibits advertising which:</P>
    <P>expressly or impliedly refers to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) claims or possible claims for damages for personal injuries,</P>
    <P>(ii) the possible outcome of claims for damages for personal injuries, or</P>
    <P>(iii) the provision of legal services by the solicitor in connection with such claims, .</P>
    <P>Paragraph (i) prohibits advertising which:</P>
    <P>expressly or impliedly solicits, encourages, or offers any inducement to any person or group or class of persons to make the claims mentioned in paragraph (h) of this subsection or to contact the solicitor with a view to such claims being made,</P>
    <P>The advice available to me is that provision of the kind contained in amendment No. 1 is not necessary in the light of the clear provisions contained in the Bill.  Those provisions will prohibit &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; advertising in personal injuries cases.  On that basis, there is no need for the amendment.  Moreover, it will be open to the Law Society to make regulations which would cover the details of this and other prohibitions on advertising in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; is a misnomer. If a client loses a personal injury claim he or she will in all probability still be liable for the expenses incurred in the case &mdash; medical expenses, engineers' expenses etc.  He or she will normally also have to pay the fees and expenses of the defendant to the action, as the costs normally follow the result of the case.  It is often completely misleading to suggest that there will be no expense incurred when a client loses a case.  This legislation will ensure this matter is dealt with categorically and clarified once and for all.</P>
    <P>I thank Senator Cosgrave for raising the issue. I trust what I said will help clarify the matter.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Many solicitors outlay a great deal of money on cases.  The cost of an average case, including the cost of medical reports, engineers' reports etc., is considerable.  Solicitors, on instruction, must make a value judgment on whether a person has a case.  Sometimes one gets only one side of the story and a person may feel he or she is in the right.  Subsequent research, evidence or an abstract from a Garda report may clarify the case and indicate a probable outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister would have first hand knowledge that many offices take on such clients and could be considerably out of pocket on individual cases, perhaps by more than £600, particularly where medical, engineering or other specialised reports had to be obtained.  As to the <Col N="1233" /> first consultation being free, if the first thing a solicitor says to a person arriving in his office is that he needs money up front he would probably lose the client, because not everyone can produce a certain sum in the expectation of an award 18 months or two years later.</P>
    <P>I hope members of the legal profession continue to take on cases, as has been the practice. In this case, however, we are dealing with using certain forms of advertising to create an impression that there is no downside and that one cannot lose.  There are certain cases which a client is unlikely to lose, but how much damages he will win is another matter.  In other cases, it may be a matter of which witness is believed, or further evidence may be provided by witnesses and a solicitor may not receive the full picture from his first instructions.</P>
    <P>This provision is important because the section must deal with the glossy brochures which seem to indicate there is no downside.  I will, therefore, press the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister said, section 1(2)(h) and its various subparagraphs cover the matters mentioned in the proposed section 1(2)(k), but the amendment would put the matter <Col N="1234" /> beyond doubt.  Paragraph (h) is rather tentative &mdash; it mentions &ldquo;possible claims&rdquo;, &ldquo;the possible outcome of claims&rdquo;, etc.  &mdash; but the amendment is much more specific.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether paragraph (h) covers anything other than &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; cases, because the amendment would be a clearer substitute for it and no one would be in any doubt about how to present an advertisement.  Providing in legislation that one could not state that no fee whatsoever would be payable is as clear as can be, whereas the Minister's wording is tentative and its import is unclear.  While the Minister states that paragraph (h) covers every eventuality, the amendment would clarify matters.</P>

      <P>Section 1(2)(h) provides that a solicitor may not publish or cause to be published an advertisement which expressly or impliedly refers to various matters relating to personal injury damages, and section 1(2)(i) provides that no inducement can be offered to any person or group or class of persons to make the claims mentioned in paragraph (h) or to contact the solicitor with a view to such claims being made.  In other words, paragraph (i) specifically refers to the items listed in paragraph (h).</P>

      <P>This is a technical drafting amendment.  Section 2 makes it clear that the controls on solicitors relating to personal injury provided for in section 1 apply also to non-solicitors. Section 2(1) as it stands would operate without prejudice to section 56 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, which makes it an offence for an unqualified person to pretend to be a solicitor.  The amendment specifies that section 2 would operate without <Col N="1235" /> prejudice to section 55 of the Solicitors Act, 1954, which makes it an offence for an unqualified person to act as a solicitor.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 21, to delete &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;passing&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment proposes that sections 1 and 2 shall not apply to advertisements published not more than three months after the &ldquo;passing&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;commencement&rdquo; of the Bill.  Section 6 states &ldquo;This Act shall come into operation 3 months after its passing or on such earlier day as may be appointed by order of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform&rdquo;.  As specific times are given in the Bill, effectively sections 1 and 2 would not come into operation for six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we regard the prohibition of misleading and false advertising and other items listed in the section as an important and urgent matter now, why should we wait six months for it to come into operation?  It is important now and should be represented by immediate action rather than inserting the caveat that nothing will happen until three months after commencement of the Act. Once the Act is passed it should go into operation straightaway.  Section 6 (2) states that the &ldquo;Act shall come into operation 3 months after its passing&rdquo;. This is not desirable and undermines the purpose of the legislation.  It questions what we are doing.  Will this enable solicitors to run misleading advertisements for six months?  Are we saying it is all right for them to do it now and that <Col N="1236" /> they can keep doing it for this period, even though it will be prohibited in the future?  Why not prohibit it immediately and take the advertisements out of the <i>Golden Pages</i> or other publications carrying these improper and inappropriate advertisements?  It is unnecessary to add another three months in section 3 to the three months mentioned in section 6, thereby undermining the thrust and urgency Senators expressed on Second Stage.</P>

      <P>I understand where Senator Costello is coming from but I wonder about the practical aspects, particularly in a publication like the <i>Golden Pages.</i>  People have probably already entered into commitments in relation to the 1999 edition of the <i>Golden Pages.</i>  I presume that if the 1999 edition is published carrying such advertisements we are stuck with them.  It is unrealistic to think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This Bill may be passed and signed in the next week.  There are practical aspects in that people may have entered into advertising commitments or contracts for next year.  The reality is that if one looks up the <i>Golden Pages</i> next September, he will still see this type of advertisement.  It is not practical as people may have paid for next year's advertisement some months ago and may be contractually bound and they may not be able to get a refund. How does the Minister see this working in practical terms?</P>

      <P>Section 3 provides that it will apply to advertisements published three months after the date of commencement.  The amendment provides that the Bill should apply to advertisements which are published three months after the date of its passing.  Under provisions in section 1 which will become section 71(5) of the Solicitors Act, 1954, the Law Society will be required to make regulations in relation to the control of advertising.  These regulations will require the Minister's consent.  The issue of making regulations as allowed under the Bill was the subject of discussions between my Department and the Law Society while this Bill was being prepared. On the basis of those consultations, I am satisfied that a reasonable time frame in which the making of regulations can be accomplished is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 6 (2) the Bill will come into operation three months after its passing or on such earlier day as may be appointed by ministerial order.  By a combination of section 3 and section 6 (2) the legislation will begin to apply to advertisements published a maximum of six months after the date the Bill is passed.  Alternatively, assuming preparation of the regulations can be accommodated in a shorter time frame <Col N="1237" /> and the Bill is brought into force by a commencement order, it could apply to advertisements published on an earlier date.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied this is a reasonable basis on which to proceed.  The amendment could result in the process being unduly shortcircuited.  That leverage on the Law Society is not necessary. Accordingly, I am not disposed to accept this amendment.</P>
    <P>Senator Cosgrave said it was probable that we would be stuck with advertisements inserted in journals within the next six months.  If the position is not resolved within six months that is true. This would shorten the amount of time which would be available to people to insert advertisements in journals, etc.  It is true that advertisements which are published in journals in the interim will be with us for some time but they will be become illegal within six months of the passing of the legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement has confused the matter further.  If the intention of extending the period for operation of the legislation was to facilitate solicitors who have already entered into contracts, then the period should be such as to cover the calendar year.  With regard the <i>Golden Pages,</i> its calendar year is from January to December and a new edition is published the following year.  Anyone who would have contracted at this point or would have sought publication of such advertisements would have already entered into such contracts.  The period of six months is neither fish nor fowl; it is a limbo period. Six months is also the maximum length of time which leaves no scope for the Minister to extend it.  It may become operational before six months but it must become operational after six months.</P>
      <P>The Minister should also remember that the word is &ldquo;publication&rdquo;, not &ldquo;insertion&rdquo;.  The term &ldquo;publication&rdquo; means the actual publication as distinct from seeking to insert something in a publication. If there is another six or eight months outstanding on a contract for publication, solicitors could find themselves aggrieved by what would effectively be a breach of contract and then they would be able to take an action in that respect. Either the Minister makes provision for that eventuality or he brings it into operation straightaway. A six months period does not seem to serve any useful purpose.  It sounds like a figure that has been pulled out of the air.  I wonder why the Minister decided to insert three months here, to insert three months at the end of the legislation for the coming into operation, and allow time for the coming into operation of this section, which gives a cumulative of six months.  Is it related to any purpose, publication or contract?  What is the rationality for this measure?</P>

      <P>I will preface my remarks by stating that all advertising is not banned by this legislation, only advertisements of the kind which <Col N="1238" /> are specified by it which most people will support. The whole question of contracts being entered into, to which Senator Costello referred, is one of considerable interest and needs to be clarified. Let us say the Law Society regulations will be ready in three weeks, I am enabled to sign the commencement order for the legislation and it will not come into effect until three months thereafter. Any advertisement published in the meanwhile will not be caught by the legislation but an advertisement not published in the meanwhile but contracted for and published subsequent to the coming into place of the legislation would be caught by this legislation.  In those circumstances the kind of situation envisaged by the Senator does not arise.  It is the publication of the advertisement which is the important point not the date of the contract, otherwise we could have all sorts of contracts entered into up to the year 2001 and we would be unable to catch those advertisements by means of this legislation.</P>
      <P>If the Law Society's regulations are ready in a matter of weeks or less than the three month period, I will sign a commencement order for the legislation as soon as possible but that is the best I can do.</P>

      <P>This section deals with misconduct and anyone having direct or indirect connection, association or arrangement with any person whom the solicitor knows or upon reasonable inquiry should have known is a person who is acting or has acted in contravention of section 56.  Effectively this means that a person who has ever contravened section 56 of the Principal Act or section 2 of the Bill is banned forever from having any association with solicitors.  It is a total blanket ban.  My amendment seeks to introduce a level of flexibility where the ban would only operate for three years with an option of extending the ban if it was warranted.  The Minister's absolute ban seems harsh and it might be better to allow some degree of flexibility.</P>

      <P>Section 4 provides in part that any solicitor who acts with an unqualified person whom the solicitor knows to be acting in contravention of the Solicitors Acts shall be guilty of misconduct under those Acts including provisions in the Bill.  The effect of the amendment would be to limit the effect of that section 4 provision to cases where the unqualified person in <Col N="1239" /> question has acted in breach of the Solicitors Acts within the previous three years with the qualification that the Society may extend that period in a particular case.</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Solicitors Act, 1960, as inserted by section 17 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, empowers the disciplinary tribunal to conduct an inquiry into alleged misconduct by a solicitor upon the application of a lay person or the society itself.  The disciplinary tribunal which is appointed by the President of the High Court is independent of the Law Society.  In a case where the application is made by the Law Society the Senator's amendment will have the effect of interfering with the independence of the tribunal. If the application were made by a lay person the disciplinary tribunal would have to adjourn its proceedings to enable it to consult with the society to ascertain the law to be applied in relation to the case in question.  Again, that procedure interferes with the independence of the operation of the tribunal.  The amendment is flawed and, therefore, I cannot support it.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 7 has arisen on the basis of consultations between my Department and the Law Society.  It amends section 7 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1960, as amended by section 17 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994.  Section 7 of the 1960 Act sets out the procedures to be followed by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society when inquiring into the conduct of a solicitor against whom misconduct has been alleged.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on Second Stage, such allegations may be investigated by the disciplinary tribunal and may be found by the tribunal to be misconduct within the meaning of the Solicitors Acts.  The 1994 Act gives the disciplinary tribunal power, by way of order under section 7(9) of the 1960 Act, where they have found a solicitor guilty of misconduct, to advise, admonish or censure that solicitor and to order him or her to pay a sum not exceeding £5,000 to the compensation fund of the Society.  In addition it has the power to refer the matter, by way of report of its findings, to the High Court, which has the power, <i>inter alia,</i> to strike the name of the solicitor off the roll, suspend the solicitor from practice for a specified period of time or place restrictions on the solicitor's practice.</P>
      <P>The amendment is designed to strengthen the disciplinary tribunal's procedures; it rectifies certain procedural problems in relation to the preparation and service of documents by the tribunal; it makes a verbatim recording of proceedings of the disciplinary tribunal mandatory; it provides for wider service of documents &mdash; that is, the tribunal's report to the High Court and the tribunal's order under section 7(9) of the 1960 Act &mdash; to parties to the proceedings; and it amends the law governing appeals against an order of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the law as it stands the disciplinary tribunal is not required to keep a verbatim record of its proceedings.  The tribunal is only required, on completion of its inquiry into alleged misconduct by a solicitor, to embody its findings in a report to the High Court.  The report is required to only specify the nature of the application and the evidence laid before the tribunal and any <Col N="1242" /> other matter which the tribunal thinks fit to report.  Because the full transcript of the proceedings are not made available to the High Court it leaves open the possibility of challenge, by way of judicial review, by either the applicant or respondent solicitor, as to the accuracy of the tribunal's report.  New subsection (3)(b)(i) which it is now proposed to insert in section 7 of the 1960 Act makes it mandatory for the tribunal to include with its report to the High Court &ldquo;a verbatim note of the evidence given and submissions made&rdquo; to the tribunal in the course of its hearings. This will eliminate the possibility of challenge as to the accuracy of the tribunals report and minimise delays in the production of the tribunal's report and in the proceedings before the court.</P>
    <P>With regard to the service of documents in proceedings before the disciplinary Tribunal, the tribunal is at present only required to serve a copy of its report to the High Court and its order under section 7(9) of the 1960 Act on the respondent solicitor.  I am satisfied, in the interests of ensuring that all parties before the tribunal are dealt with equitably and that the tribunal's proceedings are seen to be open and transparent, that the Law Society, the applicant and the respondent solicitor in the proceedings should be served with the tribunal's order and report simultaneously.  New subsections (5) and (10) which it is now proposed to insert in section 7 of the 1960 Act provide for this.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (11) which it is proposed to insert in section 7 of the 1960 Act provides for amendment of the law relating to appeals to the High Court against an order of the tribunal in two ways.  First, it provides that the Law Society and applicant in the proceedings before the tribunal shall have the same right of appeal against the order of the tribunal as the respondent solicitor has currently.  At present the society or the applicant, under section 7(12), may only appeal in respect of the adequacy of the sanction imposed by the disciplinary tribunal or on the basis that in lieu of making an order the tribunal should have referred the matter to the High Court.  I am satisfied, in the interest of equity, that the society and applicants should have the same right of appeal as the respondent solicitor.</P>
    <P>Second, new subsection (11) provides that the period of appeal will run 21 days from the &ldquo;date of service of the order or the report, whichever is the later&rdquo; in place of the present provision which provides for the period of appeal to run 21 days from &ldquo;the date of service of the order&rdquo; only.  The tribunal's report, which contains the tribunal's findings and the evidence presented to it, is of singular importance in any appeal and of particular relevance to the parties contemplating an appeal against an order of the tribunal.  In view of the fact that the appeal period of 21 days is relatively short and that, in some cases, the tribunal's report may not be ready for some time <Col N="1243" /> after the issue of the order, I am satisfied that, in order for the parties to fully assess the tribunal's findings, the date of appeal should run from the date on which the full particulars of the tribunal's findings and its order are available to all the parties.</P>
    <P>I am glad to take the opportunity presented by this Bill to provide for the matters contained in this amendment.  They will help to improve generally the procedures of the disciplinary tribunal and I wish to put on the record of the House my thanks to the Law Society for highlighting the matters in question.</P>
    <P>Senators Cosgrave and Manning have proposed two amendments to my amendment No. 7 and, subject to the permission of the Cathoirleach, it might be helpful if I were to say something in that connection at this stage.  They are proposing that, in the fourth line of paragraph (b) of amendment No. 7, the words &ldquo;and not later than 21 days&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;possible&rdquo; and that in the fifth line of paragraph (c) of the amendment the words &ldquo;and not later than 21 days thereafter&rdquo; be inserted after the word &ldquo;possible&rdquo;. My amendment provides that the disciplinary committee shall furnish the parties to the proceedings before it with a copy of its report of the proceedings and a copy of its order &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; after they are available.  The effect of the amendments proposed by the Senators would be to require the disciplinary tribunal to serve its report and order on the parties as soon as possible but not later than 21 days after they are available. The purpose of these amendments is to set a time limit on the service of documents on the parties.  I consider that the time limit being proposed by the Senators is reasonable and I propose to accept the amendments.</P>

The purpose of this section is to streamline the operation of the disciplinary code of practice and introduce certain important elements &mdash; ensuring that verbatim reports are provided inserting a timescale &mdash; I agree with the amendment inserting a limit of 21 days which the Minister has now accepted &mdash; the registration by post and the entitlements of the respondent solicitor also within a specific period of time to go to the <Col N="1244" /> High Court and ensure that he or she gets justice if there is a grievance in that respect.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister on Second Stage if the Law Society was capable of policing and monitoring its own affairs and was is really necessary for us to introduce legislation to compel the profession to carry out its business in an appropriate, civil, dignified and responsible fashion.

    <P>&lsquo;(2) Where, on the completion of an inquiry by the Disciplinary Tribunal held under section 7(3) of the Act of <Col N="1245" /> 1960, the Disciplinary Tribunal have made an order under section 7(9) of that Act, or order, or notice of the making of the order and its effect, or any part of the report of the Disciplinary Tribunal or other detail of the inquiry, shall not be published by the Society until a period of at least 21 days beginning on the date of the service of a copy of the order or of the report, whichever date is the later, shall have elapsed or until any application made under subsection (11) or (12) of section 7 of the Act of 1960 has been determined by the High Court, and thereafter the notice of the meeting of the order shall not be published if the Court rescinds the order of the Disciplinary Tribunal or, in the case of an application made under the said subsection (12), the Court orders that one or more of the aforementioned documents shall not be published.&rsquo;, and</P>

    <P>&lsquo;(4) References in subsections (1) and (2) of this section to provisions of section 7 of the Act of 1960 are to those provisions as substituted by this Act and, where appropriate, by the <i>Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1998.</i>&rsquo;.&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>This amendment has arisen also on the basis of consultations between my Department and the Law Society.  It amends section 23 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994, to allow the Law Society to publish a summary of the disciplinary tribunal's report on its finding in a case against a solicitor for alleged misconduct.  At present, section 23 of the 1994 Act provides that the Law Society may, on receipt of an order from the disciplinary tribunal, publish the order of notice of the making of the order and its effect.  Such publication must not take place until 21 days after the making of the order or until an appeal to the High Court against the order has been determined.</P>
      <P>The publication of the disciplinary tribunal's order, or the making of the order and its effect, has undoubtedly a certain deterrent effect on solicitors. However, publication of the order, which often contains no more than the sanctions imposed by the tribunal or its effect, may not in all cases make clear the nature of the misconduct of which the solicitor has been found guilty or the significance of the misconduct.  Consequently, the deterrent effect of publication can be diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the disciplinary tribunal's report specifies the nature of the complaint against the solicitor, the evidence which is presented to it in the course of its inquiry into the complaint and its detailed findings.  The view of <Col N="1246" /> the Law Society, with which I agree, is that more disclosure should be made of the findings of the disciplinary hearings against solicitors.  Publication of such hearings will give rise to greater transparency and could also have a greater deterrent effect than simple publication of details of the penalty imposed on a solicitor.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following new subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Subsections (5) and (6) of Section 71 of the Solicitors Act, 1954 as inserted by section 1 shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform by order made on the request of the Society, appoints.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the discussions that have been taking place between his Department and the Law Society on the question of appropriate regulations?  While many advertisements are inappropriate, there are other aspects to advertising which do no harm, for example, the use of big hoardings by some firms, especially in the suburbs.</P>
      <P>What timescale does the Minister envisage for the implementation of the provisions in the Bill? It is important that regulations are acceptable to Members.  If there are to be guidelines, especially with regard to advertising, a number of factors will have to be considered.  There have been many discussions between the Department and the Law Society, which have gone well.  Has the Minister seen draft regulations and when does he expect them to be implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1(5) as it stands requires the Law Society to make regulations to give effect to the restrictions on advertising by a solicitor which are contained in the Bill.  By virtue of section 6(2) the maximum time limit for the coming into operation of section 1(5) is three months after the passing of the Bill.  The Law Society, with whom my Department has consulted, has not indicated any difficulty with that timeframe.  The intention of the legislation is to remove that maximum time limit and to enable the Law Society determine when section 1(5) will come into operation.  This would mean the society could decide when restrictions on advertising will come into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1(6) enables the Law Society to make regulations with the Minister's consent to prohibit the advertising of charges or fees where the Minister is satisfied the making of such regulations is <Col N="1247" /> in the public interest.  The Law Society would have discretion to do so at any time, provided the Minister agrees.  The effect of the amendment would be to provide that the section would come into operation only following the making of a commencement order by the Minister on the request of the society.  Given that the powers vested in the Law Society under section 1(6) are discretionary rather than mandatory, I cannot see the benefit to be gained by allowing it to exercise a right of veto over the commencement of subsection (6).  Again, under this amendment the society would decide the operative date for the provision in the Bill.  For these reasons, I cannot accept the amendment and I do not believe anybody could expect me to accept it.</P>
    <P>The introduction of legislation is a matter for the House, which then, in this instance, devolves power to the Minister of the day to sign the commencement order.  Nobody would expect it to be proper for a body outside the Oireachtas to exercise an effective right of veto on the implementation of legislation passed by this House.  That would fly in the face of all democratic tenets.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable level of consultation with the Law Society on this legislation. These consultations have been comprehensive and we have been as open as we could with the society.  The drafting of the regulations is a discretionary matter for the society and it is for the society to bring them forward in due course.  I have not seen the draft regulations but I am aware they are being prepared.  I gave an undertaking to Senator Costello that if they were ready earlier than the stated time limit of three months I would not be found wanting in signing the commencement order for the legislation, which would then come into play three months thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Law Society generally regulates the solicitors' profession very well.  I do not believe any other profession is as well regulated.  When this legislation is passed the regulation of the solicitors' profession will be greatly strengthened and there will be a far greater level of transparency in regard to disciplinary proceedings.  In addition, I believe undesirable practices that have developed as a result of allowing solicitors advertise, which was opposed by the Law Society, will assist the public and the profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree more with the Minister.  What he said is very appropriate.  I disagree with my colleague, Senator Cosgrave, whose amendment would effectively give a veto to the Law Society on when the measures would be introduced.  That would not be appropriate, although I understand he is trying to tease out the problems related to the timescale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the introduction of these measures, does the timescale take into account advertising contracts entered into or is it all or nothing?  If <Col N="1248" /> advertising has been paid for which will extend beyond the introduction of these measures, does that mean it will have to be stopped after the measures come into effect?  Advertisements in the <i>Golden Pages</i> are published on an annual basis.  This means advertising arranged by solicitors for 1999 and contractual arrangements for its publication must be ended.  There could be implications in that for the Minister and the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I would like to see a maximum time limit introduced.  I hope the matter can be resolved through consultation with the Law Society and agreed regulations made.  The enactment of this legislation would allow for greater transparency and accountability and improved practices in the law profession.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said and will not press my amendment.  I am glad to hear there has been ongoing discussion.  It is important the regulations are introduced as soon as possible.  I presume there will be a transitional period for their introduction because people may have entered into advertising contracts, such as with CIE, to have advertisements on buses for six months of 1999.  People may have already entered into an advertising contract with a magazine and money may have been paid.  Short of giving the money back, publishers of such magazines will be contractually bound to publish the advertisements. The Minister should accept a transition period in which no new advertisements would be placed but contracts already entered into would be fulfilled.  Senator Costello mentioned the <i>Golden Pages</i> which is published on an annual basis.  If people place advertisements in the 1999 <i>Golden Pages,</i> there is not much that can be done.  It is important that people who find themselves in this position are not penalised or subject to disciplinary measures.  Will the Minister elaborate on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious this legislation comes into effect at the earliest possible date.  The Law Society will have three months to put in place its advertising regulations as per the legislation. I encourage the society to introduce them at the earliest possible date because I wish to sign the commencement order as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the regulations are in place after the commencement order, it will be three months before the legislation takes effect.  It is possible in the interim for a person to enter into a contractual arrangement for the publication of an advertisement deemed illegal under the legislation.  It will be covered by the legislation if it is published subsequent to the same coming into effect.  Any advertisement in contravention of the legislation and published after it comes into effect will be subject to its provisions, irrespective of when the contract was signed.  It is possible for a solicitor to enter into a contract with the <i>Golden Pages</i> to <Col N="1249" /> carry an advertisement contravening the legislation prior to its coming into operation.  If it is published prior to the legislation coming into effect, it will not be subject to its terms, but it will be if it continues to be published after that.  If an advertisement were published in the <i>Golden Pages</i> prior to the legislation coming into effect, we would be left with it until the calendar year after the year of publication.  I am sure all Members agree the course I am adopting is the most pragmatic.  It was never intended that the legislation would ban all advertising by solicitors, but ban undesirable advertising.  It is to be hoped that, because of the legislation, such advertising will become a thing of the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not clarified the matter.  What will happen if the advertisement has been contracted but not published?  What will happen if a solicitor has already entered into a contract to have an advertisement in the 1999 <i>Golden Pages</i>?  The legislation seems specific and clear on the matter but, it deals only with advertisements which are published.  Even if the contract were entered into and the advertisements agreed, the legislation specifically prohibits their publication.  That would mean the solicitor in question must be breaking the law, irrespective of when he entered into the contract.  If the contract was entered into before it, one could say to that solicitor that once the legislation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas he would have due notice or that the regulations were being made by the Law Society.  However, somebody who, in good faith, entered into this form of advertising beforehand, surely has a case. The Minister should tease it out.  Perhaps he would agree that, before the Bill goes to the other House, it could be looked at again in relation to how this will be dealt with.  It seems to create some anomalies as regards how solicitors will cope with advertising or with the contractual arrangements and the various bodies with whom they deal.  What is considered misleading advertising under this legislation was not misleading when they entered into the contract.  While we all want to ensure the legislation comes into play as soon as possible, will the regulations operate on an all or nothing basis or will some flexibility be introduced?</P>

      <P>As I said before, once the commencement order for the legislation is signed, the provision of the legislation will come into effect three months thereafter.  From the passing of the Act, the Law Society will have three months to have its regulations ready.  Let us say that it will take the full three months, then the commencement order is signed and the Act comes into effect.  Three months thereafter, any publication which is put in place will be caught if the advertisement is in contravention of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1250" /> It is possible in the interim that somebody would enter into a contract, for example, to have advertisements placed next July.  That advertisement would be caught by the Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;even if they have already entered into a contract, because the publication of the advertisement would take place more than three months after the coming into effect of the Act.  In the meantime, an advertisement in any publication which is in place prior to the period, which is three months after the commencement of the Act, would not be caught by the legislation.  It is the date of publication of the advertisement which counts, not the date of the contract.  That is of considerable importance. Otherwise people could enter into contracts from now until eternity and we would not be in a position to have those advertisements subjected to the terms of the legislation.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello said it seemed to him that a person who enters into a contractual obligation to have an advertisement published after the period in question &mdash; that is, three months after the coming into effect of the Act &mdash; might have a statable case.  My answer is that there has to be a cut off point.  At some point we have to say this is the period and after that any such advertisement will be caught by the terms of the Act.  The period which has been allowed under the legislation and which was given very deep consideration, is more than reasonable.  Everybody has the opportunity of knowing precisely where they stand.  It is not as if this legislation is being kept under wraps or that nobody knows it is going through the Oireachtas.  Those who are affected by the legislation know it is before the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>I am not suggesting that solicitors should be given any greater laxity than the Minister. In fact, my amendment was to restrict it further.  However, I want to tease out the implications of what will happen.  The wording of the legislation says it should not apply to advertisements that are published.  What about the question of continuity?  Somebody could have entered into a 12 month or two year period for advertising. When the three months' grace after the commencement of the Act has passed, the advertisement is already locked in, but the continuity of its publication is there.  It is not an initial publication but a continuous one.  What is the situation concerning a continuous publication already entered into?  These advertisements were published <Col N="1251" /> last year and part of the agreement was that they would be published in the same form this year.  In three months time that will be all right, but after that period has elapsed the legislation says it will be illegal for such advertisements to be published.  How does the Minister get around that point?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The most practical example we could take is the <i>Golden Pages,</i> which has been adverted to on a number of occasions.  Let us say that a person enters into a contract with the <i>Golden Pages</i> to provide that there will be an advertisement in breach of the terms of this legislation &mdash; it would not, in other words, be in accord with this legislation &mdash; and the individual enters into the contract for three years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;if the advertisement is published within a period of three months of the commencement of the Act, then that advertisement is not caught by the legislation and that publication is not caught by the legislation. However, in the new <i>Golden Pages</i> for the following year, a different publication to the previous one although the advertisement may be the same, that advertisement &mdash; because it was not published within a period of three months of the commencement of the Act &mdash; is caught by the legislation.</P>
      <P>Let us take Senator Costello's example.  If a person entered into a contract with the <i>Golden Pages</i> two or three years ago to place an advertisement for three years, clearly, this year's advertisement, if published in the <i>Golden Pages</i> within a period of three months of the commencement order, is not caught by the legislation.  However, any subsequent advertisement, because it would be in a new publication published subsequent to the period of three months after the coming into operation of the Act, would be caught by the legislation.  I trust that sets out the actual position.</P>

If the Law Society comes forward within a matter of weeks with the regulations there is nothing to prevent me signing the commencement order and then the legislation would take effect three months after the date of the commencement order.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I have raised relates to two schools in my constituency &mdash; Plás Mhuire, or St. Mary's Place, Dorset Street, and the Central Model School, Marlborough Street, which is in the grounds of the Department of Education and Science and of which the Minister is the patron.</P>
      <P>This year each school has lost a teacher in spite of both schools having increased numbers. Numerous meetings have taken place between staff and parents, there have been protests outside the Department of Education and Science and the Taoiseach has been contacted.  These people are dissatisfied that such a situation should arise.</P>
      <P>Both schools were included in the Breaking the Cycle programme two years ago and they received additional staffing at that time.  That scheme was introduced on a five year pilot basis and it was intended then that the scheme would be evaluated after that period.  Now, midway through the scheme, it seems that the Minister is making it impossible for it to operate effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though Breaking the Cycle was introduced largely in the junior section of the schools, it continued into the first two years of the senior section.  Nevertheless, it had implications for every part of the schools and it was intended that <Col N="1254" /> the pupil-teacher ratio would be the same for the five year period, irrespective of numbers.  There was to be a maximum pupil-teacher ratio of 15 which could go as low as the case might be.  The advantages gained are now about to be lost.</P>
    <P>In the Central Model School one class has 26 pupils, a very difficult class to cope with in the circumstances.  There is a full class of ten pupils with special needs as well.  These are schools in areas which are very disadvantaged.  Both areas have high school drop out rates, enormous levels of unemployment, drug problems and limited infrastructure in housing, community facilities and employment.  The Minister should not have taken the sword to these schools and deprived them of their teachers.  If anything, he should have used the benefits of the present economic prosperity and given additional teachers to the schools.</P>
    <P>The Minister will say these schools already have preferential staffing arrangements.  There is no such thing as a preferential staffing arrangement in schools with such a multitude of problems. They have well chronicled results in terms of poor educational attainment, poor access to third level education, a huge drop-out rate and a high level of unemployment.  The pupil-teacher ratio in such schools can never be improved sufficiently. The staff and the available resources are being fully used but the schools labour under a huge disadvantage.</P>
    <P>Authority has recently been given for the building of a north inner city community college which will be situated across from the Central Model School in Marlborough Street.  The project is being planned in a holistic fashion as part of an integrated area development scheme.  The local authority is helping in the erection of a full-scale international size sports hall which will be open to the community as well as to the pupils.  It is hoped that pre-school, primary and secondary education will be integrated in a major campus which will include the third level Dublin Institute of Technology college in Cathal Brugha Street. If we lose out at primary level this plan will be undermined.  We hope to demonstrate to parents that if children are encouraged to make progress in primary school they can be guaranteed the same third level education and employment as young people in other areas.  The two primary schools in question will feed into this integrated system which is being planned by the local authority and the education authorities.  The Minister is aware of this plan so it is disappointing that two of the feeder primary schools involved are to lose teachers.  This makes it more difficult to provide the base level of education which would assist children to progress through the school system and break the cycle of unemployment and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>This is the time to be proactive and to use the extra money which is now available to assist the <Col N="1255" /> lowest tier of education and provide the maximum benefit for all.</P>

      <P>The Senator will already be aware that the staffing levels of primary schools is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year.  An agreement to this effect was made between the Government and the INTO in the 1980s and this agreement has been fully and rigorously adhered to since then.</P>
      <P>While the Minister is mindful of the fact that the schools in question serve communities which have many problems, the facts are that the overall staffing level at the schools are, in relative terms, quite good.  Therefore, he cannot authorise the retention of previous staffing levels at the schools.</P>
      <P>Both Scoil Plás Mhuire and the Central Model senior national school, as the Senator is aware, are two of the 33 urban schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle pilot project.  The Senator will remember that I granted funds for the rebuilding of the Central Model School in 1991 when the school had been ignored for many years.  The Breaking the Cycle project was introduced in 1996.  One of the main elements of the urban dimension of Breaking the Cycle was the implementation of a 15:1 pupil-teacher ratio in the junior classes of all schools in the project.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of the project all the selected schools have been allocated sufficient staffing resources to ensure that a maximum class size of 15 pupils applies in all junior classes.  The allocation of teaching resources to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle project is also determined by reference to the school's enrolment on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of Scoil Plás Mhuire on 30 September 1997 was 100 pupils.  An enrolment of 100 warrants a staffing complement of a principal and three teachers.  However, in addition to this staffing the school also has the services of a full-time remedial, a full-time disadvantaged concessionary teacher, a shared home school liaison teacher and an amalgamated concessionary teacher.  A member of the Department's inspectorate recently visited Scoil Plás Mhuire and reported that the school currently has an enrolment of 106 pupils.</P>

    <P>The enrolment of the Central Model senior national school on 30 September 1997 was 108 pupils.  An enrolment of 108 warrants a staffing complement of a principal and three teachers. However, in addition to this staffing the school also has the services of a full-time remedial teacher, a shared remedial teacher, a full-time disadvantaged concessionary teacher and a shared home school liaison teacher, a shared counsellor and a special additional assistant.  A member of the Department's inspectorate also recently visited the Central Model senior national <Col N="1256" /> school and reported that the school currently has an enrolment of 116 pupils.</P>
    <P>Even though Scoil Plás Mhuire and the Central Model senior national school have experienced a slight increase in enrolments for the current school year, this does not warrant the appointment of any additional teaching staff in either school.  Both schools are capable of being managed adequately with their current staffing within the maximum class size guidelines, including the 15:1 maximum class size guideline for junior classes which applies to schools participating in the Breaking the Cycle project.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances the staffing levels currently sanctioned to the schools are adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise the on-going concerns of the Milk Rights Group.  This group was established in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court decision in the case of Duff and others <i>versus</i> the Minister for Agriculture and Others.  Judgment in this case was delivered on 4 March 1997.</P>
      <P>The group seeks full compensation for all losses arising from the failure of the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, to recognise their quota rights in line with their farm modernisation plans.  That is their case in a nutshell.  It now comprises 1,200 paid up members from every county. The members of the group were encouraged, indeed induced, by the State through the auspices of the relevant development authority, ACOT, under EU Council Directive 72/159 to participate in the farm modernisation scheme.  They were encouraged to modernise their dairy farms in the interest of better efficiency through increasing milk output to a level projected under their &ldquo;development plans&rdquo;.  This was to achieve the desired policy objective of giving them an income from dairy farming comparable with the income achievable at the time from industrial activity.  All members of the group actively pursued their development plans and took all reasonable steps to meet their projected targets under such plans, including making substantial financial and personal investments which could only have been economically justified were the targets achieved. The output of milk targeted under the development plans would at least have had to be substantially achieved if the investment were to be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the introduction of milk quotas in 1984 the milk output projected under the relevant development plans was never realised.  This was primarily because it was frustrated by a mistake of law on the part of the Minister of the day as held by the Supreme Court in the Duff case.  In essence, the Supreme Court held that the Minister chose the wrong method to provide for development plan farmers under Article 3(1) of <Col N="1257" /> Council Regulation EEC No. 857/89.  The Minister chose to provide for such farmers under the &ldquo;flexi-milk&rdquo; system rather than creating a &ldquo;national reserve&rdquo; from which special reference quantities could have been allocated to them as required by a proper and true construction of Article 3(1).</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that, at the time of the introduction of quotas, Ireland sought and was granted an increase of 4.16 per cent on the gallons produced in the base year 1983.  This advantage was granted to Ireland on foot of the case it made to the EU institutions to have special recognition accorded to the productive capacity of its development plan dairy farmers.</P>
    <P>Ironically, development plan farmers did not become the beneficiaries of this increased milk quota allocation to Ireland as intended.  A subsequent agreement was reached between the Minister, his officials and farming interests, including the farm organisations and the co-operatives, to the effect that it was in the national interest that a national reserve should not be created.  This decision was contrary to law as enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Duff case.</P>
    <P>A wrongful decision was made to allocate an additional 3.6 per cent milk quota to established dairy farmers, regardless of the size of the dairy enterprise, through the relevant co-operatives without taking into account the special merits of the development plan farmers for the allocation of milk quota having regard to their targeted output.</P>
    <P>The Milk Rights Group's members suffered a grave injustice resulting from the wrongful decision and the mistake in law of the then Minister in 1984 in the matter of implementing the milk quota register.  The primary objective of the group is to seek compensation from the State for its aggrieved members in respect of proven loss and damages occasioned by the State's servant and agents.  It is a legal imperative that the group's members receive such monetary compensation for proven loss because they find themselves in precisely similar circumstances to the successful plaintiffs in the Duff case.  It must follow that equals should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>Farming organisations which have in the past represented the great majority of the group members' interests, other than the special interests represented by the group, must ensure that the State pays compensation to the group's members in respect of proven loss and damage and ensure that the Minister does not exercise his discretion to rely on a legal technicality to obstruct justice being done.</P>
    <P>We must support the demands being made for Ireland to get equal treatment with such EU member states as Finland and Austria in seeking the 8 per cent increase in milk quota under the Santer proposals.  It is respectfully and reasonably <Col N="1258" /> contended by those involved in the Milk Rights Group that, in contemplation of Ireland's application being successful, a national reserve should be created by the Minister out of which additional reference quantities could be made available to development plan farmers, among others, having regard to their targeted output under their original plans.  Justice must be done, albeit belatedly.</P>
    <P>In principle, development farmers are entitled to damages in the light of the Supreme Court's decision in the Duff case.  The Minister is entitled to rely on the statue of limitations and if it is applicable on the facts of a given case it would amount to a complete defence.  That point is not argued.  However, an action may be maintained even if otherwise out of time so that, all things being equal, a court could and would proceed to give judgment against the Minister unless he elected to raise the statute of limitations defence by means of a positive plea in his defence.  As a strict matter of law the Minister need not plead the statute of limitations and in that case the action would proceed in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the undeniable merits of the development farmers' cases and from the viewpoint of fairness and morality, the Minister ought not to plead the statute of limitations.  I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, to pass my request to the Minister, Deputy Walsh, not to plead the statute of limitations and to allow this case to proceed so that the farmers will receive equal treatment to those in the Duff case.  It is a decision solely for the Minister.  The development farmers have been treated unfairly by having their ambitions to increase milk output thwarted by the introduction of quotas and the lack of provision for them from a national reserve and it is up to the Minister to ensure that they are treated fairly and are recompensed for State interference in their development plans &mdash; plans initiated at the State's behest.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State, Deputy Davern, confirm to the House that the Minister will not plead the statute of limitations and so allow the Milk Rights Group's case to proceed in the same way as the Duff case?  The case concerns 1,200 farmers and their families drawn from every county.  They should get a just reward of compensation for their unfair treatment by the State.</P>

      <P>Legal proceedings, which were taken by a limited number of plaintiffs in 1990, are still the subject of litigation in the High Court following the Supreme Court ruling in their favour last year.  The judgment of the Supreme Court did not deal with the entitlements of individual plaintiffs but directed that the proceedings be remitted to the High Court to assess their damages.  The claims made raise complex issues still to be determined by the courts.  I do not have precise information <Col N="1259" /> as to when the High Court will hear these cases but we would welcome an early decision.</P>
      <P>While other persons who claim to have been following farm development plans on the introduction of the super levy regime in 1984 have made approaches to my Department in relation to this matter, no special provision has been made for any arrangements in respect of any persons or groups of persons who are not party to pending legal proceedings.  My Department has received legal advice to the effect that any proceedings as might now be commenced will, in any event, be barred by the passage of time.</P>
