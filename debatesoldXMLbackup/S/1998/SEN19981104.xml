      <P>I have notice from Senator Costello that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide adequate administrative staffing and resources for the distribution of the young people's facilities and services fund to successful applicants and for the evaluation and the supervision of its use.</P>
      <P>I also received notice from Senator Finneran of the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in consultation with the Garda Commissioner to address the serious public concern regarding attacks on the elderly and property break-ins in the western counties.</P>
      <P>I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is items, 2, 3 and 13, motion 26.  Committee and Remaining Stages of item 2 will be taken today. Second Stage of item 3 will be taken at 2.30 p.m. with contributions of spokesperson not to exceed 15 minutes and all other Senators not to exceed ten minutes.  Item 13, motion 26, will be taken at 6 p.m. and debate on items 2 and 3 will resume thereafter if not already concluded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the opportunity to reflect on what happen on the Order of Business yesterday and to read the Official Report.  I was very disturbed by what I found therein.  There was an unprovoked sustained personal attack on the integrity of a named person who is not a Member of this House and is not in a position to defend himself here.  It did not happen in the heat of the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Manning will recall that I stated it was not in order to name a person in the House who was not here to defend himself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for that comment but in my time in the House this has not happened under any other Leader.  It is one thing for a Member to make an attack in the heat of the moment but for the Leader to name and attack a person who is not in the House on the Order of Business is to my mind a serious abuse of power.  It never happened before and has debased the House.  It has seriously damaged the relationship between this side of the House and the other side.  The basis of trust and mutual respect which was there has been damaged.  I call on the Leader to withdraw the remarks he made yesterday and to apologise for what he has done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I would prefer if this matter was disposed of before continuing with the Order of Business because it needs to be dealt with.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">

      <P>Yesterday I endeavoured to ensure that all Senators would comply with the rulings of the Chair and with good order in the House.  There is nothing more the Chair can do, it is a matter for the Leader, when replying to the Order of Business, whether he wishes to accede to Senator Manning's request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervened in the hope the Leader might indicate that he wished to deal with the matter.  I would like to add to what Senator Manning said.  I also felt what went on yesterday was unacceptable and that I was misled by the Leader.  He particularly asked me before the Order of Business not to raise the Shannon River Council Bill on the basis that he had a report which he would convey to me in the course of the day.  I withheld from speaking on it only to find during his reply to the Order of Business that he had the two or three page report on his person.  I believe I was misled.  This is not the proper way to do business.  If there are difficulties on either side, the Leader should relate them to each other and deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope this matter is dealt with today.  I ask the Leader to make a generous response to the issues raised by Senator Manning.  I had my argument already with the Leader and it is past tense as far as I am concerned.  However, there is a need for the Leader to respond in a generous manner and to deal with the point raised by Senator Manning <Col N="1327" /> so we can return to proper working relationships as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianMullooly" hpid="An Cathaoirleach An Cathaoirleach">
      <NameTxt>An Cathaoirleach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to think that these matters could be resolved between the Leader, the leader of the Opposition and the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, the matter is on the record and it must be dealt with on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the matter raised by Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole, there was an unseemly situation in the House yesterday. However, there is no value in proceeding with it in the House.  It would be better if the matter was dealt with by the Leader, the leader of the Opposition and the Whips outside the House. This could be followed by a statement on the record.  This may be the best way to proceed.</P>
      <P>Education is mentioned in item 13, motions Nos. 2, 18 and 19 on the Order Paper.  I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to the House for a debate on education. Statements have been made about contributions and new initiatives in education.  There are major problems in relation to adult education and literacy and pre-schools.  A strike is ongoing in Waterford in relation to remedial education and there are problems in city and rural areas regarding the breaking the cycle initiative.  Before final decisions are made in the context of the budget, such as in relation to the major issue of student grants, a full scale debate in the House would be beneficial and would strengthen the Minister's hand in his negotiations with the Minister for Finance for a decent deal for education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader as a matter of urgency to pursue with the Minister for Agriculture and Food the fact that huge tracts of severely handicapped and disadvantaged land were inexplicably excluded from the recent announcement about fodder aid.  The amount of £300 is paltry in any event, but why is it denied to least well off farmers who are trying to eke out an existence on the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned yesterday the need for a debate on the Irish Wheelchair Association's proposals for the budget.  The Leader kindly agreed to arrange a debate but, unfortunately, he did not say when it would take place.  I have tabled a motion and I ask the Leader to accede to a debate this week or next week because the matter relates to this year's budget.  I hope the Leader will take note of that aspect in his response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the eccentric way in which business is currently ordered in the House, it was impossible for me to be present yesterday.  Will <Col N="1328" /> the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to investigate the way in which the Garda is being used by the Department to do the dirty work of the immigration section?  A total of 49 immigrants have been deported without public knowledge.  Immigrants are threatened that if they make a fuss they will be deported even more quickly and there was a spectacle over the weekend.  If the Minister does not take action to implement the Refugee Act, his Department will change from being a Department of Justice to a Ministry for racism and that will cause enormous problems.  The Minister should either sort out the problem or resign and allow somebody who has the will to solve it to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JarlathMcDonagh" hpid="Mr. McDonagh Mr. McDonagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's call for a general debate on various aspects of education.  Will the Leader ascertain from the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy O'Dea, when the Green Paper on Adult Education is likely to come on stream?  Many interested groups would be greatly appreciative if the Leader could indicate, perhaps on the Order of Business tomorrow, the tentative date for the publication of the Green Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I was not present in the House yesterday because of a sad event in my constituency.  The House recently discussed the issue of safety on the roads.  Following events at the weekend, I wish to raise the issue of safety at sea.  I ask for the Cathaoirleach's indulgence so I can pay my respects to the two fishermen in my community who tragically lost their lives between Saturday night and Sunday morning.  I knew both men and I knew the owner of the boat particularly well because I live in that community for up to four months every year.  No fisherman was more careful or efficient than the owner of that boat.  Unfortunately, a tragic accident took place in reasonably calm conditions.  This shows the necessity for upgrading safety, particularly on small boats.</P>
      <P>I compliment the rescue services on their work, particularly the local sub-aqua team which was on the spot immediately.  It located the boat and confirmed that the bodies were not there.  There is a need for much updating because, unfortunately, the skipper of the boat was not in a position to give any signal other than a very faint mayday.  The issue of alarms on older vessels, which could be used in emergencies, needs to be considered.  I welcome the inquiry announced by the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Woods, but I ask him to ensure that the emergency services remain in the area for the next week.</P>
      <P>The issue of student grants and the loss <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling, raised by Senator Costello, is causing great concern in the education field for many people in my constituency.  Most of the students in Northern Ireland are not receiving their fees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to correct a misunderstanding which arose yesterday with the Leader regarding a request that the Government should recognise that there are 422 days to the new millennium.  I said I did not want any more talk about the problems of the millennium bug, but the Leader understood I was seeking a debate.  I do not want a debate on that matter because action is needed.</P>
      <P>However, I want a debate on the euro, which is only 57 days away.  I thought there might have been an opportunity yesterday to discuss the advent of the euro, but it was much more attractive to discuss banking.  Ireland will be a member of the euro in 57 days but the country will not be ready to write euro cheques on 1 January.  The action of the Central Bank needs to be considered now because the way in which the advent of the euro is being handled is not necessarily in the best interest of the country.  I would welcome an urgent debate on the euro within the next fortnight.</P>

      <P>The issue of overseas development aid was raised yesterday.  I would welcome a debate on that matter as would, I am sure, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The points made in respect of the percentage allocated to overseas development aid are true.  It has been the objective of this and the previous Government to increase the percentage substantially.  However, the figure must be considered in the context of the growth of GNP.  An additional sum of £15 million was allocated to overseas development aid this year.  It is only because of the strength of the economy that the figure as a percentage of GNP has declined by a margin of 0.2 per cent.  This aspect should be borne in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the important issue raised by Senator Manning and Senator O'Toole, I can speak with a little authority on this matter because I fished for many years on Lough Sheelin and I know what happened to it.  It was virtually destroyed.  Given that the Leader lives close to the area, I understand why he would feel strongly about the issue.  It is a matter of record that there are court convictions in respect of pollution incidents that took place on Lough Sheelin.  It is also a matter of record that there was a possibility of contempt of court in respect of some of those cases.  Fine Gael would not condone illegality of any description in respect of those matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomHayes" hpid="Mr. T. Hayes Mr. T. Hayes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Hayes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader bring to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture and Food the problems in the area aid unit?  It is closed and telephone calls are not being answered. It is deplorable as a huge number of people await their annual payments and the cheques are not coming through.  When they make inquiries nobody answers the telephone in the unit.  The ACC, banks and building societies await payment from farmers but the money is not getting through.  There is major frustration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to the issue raised by Senator Coghlan.  The onerous task of drawing up the areas for inclusion should be given to Teagasc as it is the organisation which carries this out.  I wish the Senator would note that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike some colleagues who wish to dissociate themselves from the unseemly row yesterday, I wish to associate myself with it in any way.  I regret that I did not as I found it most enjoyable, stimulating and invigorating.  It brought life to the House and I felt there was real passion.  I congratulate the two combatants.  It was much better than people reading their dull, boring pieces of paper.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It was one of the high moments of this session and I am pleased to have witnessed it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Ryan raised the matter of asylum.  He may possibly also have been thinking of the Costina family.  I raised this matter yesterday and would be glad if we had an opportunity to discuss <Col N="1331" /> it.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for this, although I do not hold him personally liable.  My colleague, Senator Ross, pointed out that a series of reports from the European Parliament is listed on the Order Paper, one of which relates to the resolution on the death of Semira Adamu during her expulsion.  This was an appalling case in Belgium. We are moving in that direction and it is the responsibility of this House to ensure that such a tragedy never blemishes Ireland's record.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on Senator Dardis' remarks. Of course, it has occurred to everybody that one can put a spin on our contribution to overseas development by expressing it as an absolute quantity but the commitment of this country has always been to the expression of that debt as a proportion of gross national product.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ridge's request to have the budgetary concerns of the Irish Wheelchair Association debated, but I ask that such a debate be broadened to take into account the concerns of other agencies in similar situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan's request for a debate on immigration policy and practice.  Ireland is beyond the stage of needing a policy formulated by the Houses of the Oireachtas and a proper implementation agency given the current unsatisfactory arrangements between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda.  There is an unanswerable case for a separate immigration and naturalisation service.</P>
      <P>During the last session, there were a number of requests for debates on health issues, aside from the legislation brought before the House in respect of the Food Safety Authority.  I reiterate my request to arrange such a debate during this session at the earliest opportunity, particularly in the context of the budgetary crisis in a number of health boards which is forcing the closure of wards despite lengthening waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the views expressed by Senators Manning and O'Toole, I <Col N="1332" /> regret any personal imputation that may have arisen yesterday.  As Senator Dardis said, Lough Sheelin is in my own parish and I am aware of everything that has happened there through my own hard work with past Ministers of all Governments. I accept most of what Senator Manning said.  He is a long time Member, as I am, and that was not my intention.  During the debate on the Shannon River Council Bill, 1997, and especially, in light of the report that was issued a number of days previously and my knowledge about where much of it emanated from, I expressed a view in the House.  I hope this is accepted.</P>
      <P>Senators Ridge, Kett and Burke called for a debate on the Irish Wheelchair Association.  I will try to slot it in next week, and, if not, the following week prior to the budget.  Senators Ryan, Norris and Gallagher requested a debate on overseas development aid and the position of refugees and I will also make time available for this. Senator McDonagh called for a debate on adult education, as he has done previously, and I will discuss this with him following the Order of Business. Perhaps, he can have it debated during Fine Gael Private Members' time.</P>
      <P>I concur with Senator Bonner's expression of sympathy on the tragedy in Donegal.  Senators Bonner and Costello asked for a debate on student grants and I will make time available for it.  Senator Quinn again called for a debate on the euro.  This has been debated twice in the House and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Treacy, has been very generous with his time to discuss this.  If the House feels this should be discussed further, time will be set aside.  Senators Hayes and Callanan expressed their great concerns regarding area aid and cheques which may still be outstanding.  I will pass on the Senators' views to the Minister for Agriculture and Food.</P>
      <P>Senator Gallagher called for a debate on health issues and time will also be made available for this.  Senator Lydon requested debates on enlargement and human rights and I will allocate time for them during this session.</P>
      <P>Order of Business agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 25, after &ldquo;made,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;and upon the Court being satisfied that such certificate has been presented in accordance with this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the Bill which will facilitate this country in fulfilling its obligation to co-operate with international <Col N="1333" /> tribunals in relation to in particular the genocide which has taken place in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and to make sure that the people who are responsible for mass killings do not go unsanctioned, that they can be extradited to face trial and that they can be properly punished.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 1 seeks to improve the Bill with a view to ensuring its constitutionality.  It states that the Minister shall produce a certificate but that it shall be &ldquo;upon the Court being satisfied that such certificate has been presented in accordance with this Act&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The danger in the section is that the Minister would compel the court on production of the certificate to make an arrest order and that would be effectively shifting the power from the court to the Minister &mdash; the Minister would be compelling the court in that respect.  That would involve a mixing of functions.  It would be proper in legal and constitutional terms to allow for the court to be satisfied that such a certificate supplied by the Minister is in fact in accordance with the Act.  The point is quite simple.  That particular discretion being retained by the court in respect of the Minister's certificate would ensure that the constitutionality of this section would be respected and that there would be no question of legal action which might in fact overturn the Minister's certificate.</P>

The amendment is of a drafting nature.

      <P>I propose in these amendments to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo; in both cases. Again the principle is the same.  Section 11(3) states that the Minister may, by order, cancel the provisional arrest warrant and my amendment states that any arrest should be by order of the court.  It would be wrong for a Minister to cancel a court order; it should revert back to the court. The issuing of a cancellation order should be the entitlement of the court.</P>
      <P>Once again the Minister is intervening in what I consider to be the proper domain of the court.

In relation to warrants and matters of that kind, the Minister should not have a role.  For that reason, given the need to protect the principle of the separation of powers, the powers of the courts are the powers of the court and that should be clearly seen.  The powers of the Minister in other matters, of course, should be clearly seen also.  It is an important principle.</P>

      <P>The framing of section 11(3) follows the precedent established in the Extradition Act, 1965.  As I explained on Second Stage on 14 October, this Bill has been modelled closely on Ireland's general extradition legislation. Section 27(5) of the 1965 Act provides that where the judge issues a warrant for the provisional arrest of a person, he shall inform the Minister who may, if he thinks fit, order the warrant to be cancelled and the person arrested under it to be released.  This is pursuant to the Minister's general power to refuse extradition and to release a person from custody contained in section 35 of the 1965 Act.  The power given to the Minister in section 11(3) of the Bill follows from the general power to release given to the Minister in section 22.  The reason the power is given to the Minister is so that action to set a person free or to prevent him or her being arrested can be taken immediately such action becomes necessary, for example, <Col N="1335" /> if the Minister is informed by the international tribunal that it is no longer interested in the individual and will not pursue a request for his or her surrender.  The proposed amendments, therefore, are opposed.</P>

The 1965 Act should be amended to ensure that we do not have questionable law.  We should not extend this power, which is effectively a power reserved to the High Court under the Constitution, to the Minister.  The Minister might consider that aspect.</P>

In my view, it should be a matter for the Minister of the day.  That is the position under our extradition law, which has been tried and tested on many occasions in the courts.

      <P>Once the warrant is issued the High Court should not be compelled to impose a prison sanction automatically.  There should be discretion to allow a person to apply for bail.

      <P>Section 14 deals with the situation where the High Court is satisfied that the conditions justifying surrender of the person sought by the international tribunal have been complied with.  Once that happens we are obliged by the statute of the tribunal to carry through the surrender of the person unless there is a reason to invoke section 22.  For that purpose, as in an ordinary extradition case, he or she must be committed to prison to await surrender.</P>
      <P>This is a drafting matter.  The parliamentary draftsman has confirmed that the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is the appropriate word to give expression to the obligation imposed by the statute of the tribunal. As in an ordinary extradition case, on making the committal order the High Court will inform the person of the provisions of Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution and that he or she will not be surrendered except with his or her consent until 15 days have passed.</P>

      <P>Section 14 provides that the High Court shall make an order committing that person to prison. While the court might believe that a certificate should be issued to have the person arrested, the court should also be allowed to have the person come before it.  At that point the court should have discretion to decide what the appropriate action would be rather than the legislation simply providing for only one appropriate action.</P>

    <P>The right to bail is enshrined in the Constitution and in law.  This is an issue of personal liberty <Col N="1337" /> and there is no reason the discretion I mention should not be included in this section.

It is the language one might use in a command context.  The imperative nature of the position is expressed by the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.

      <P>I accept what the Minister has said.

      <P>To clarify the matter, as I outlined in my original reply, there is a provision pursuant to Article 40 of the Constitution to cover the type of situation envisaged by Senator Costello; it would be open to an individual to make such an application pursuant to Article 40 of the Constitution.  In an ordinary extradition case of making the committal order in the first instance, the High Court would advise the person concerned of the provisions of Article 40.  That, too, would cover the situation in relation to certain bail matters.  The Constitution provides a safeguard in this regard; therefore, the doomsday scenario envisaged by Senator Costello would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply raises a further question.  If, having been arrested, one comes before the courts and is informed by the High Court of the provisions in Article 40, the legislation effectively prevents Article 40 from operating because it makes provision for one course of action, namely, imprisonment.  Surely the person who is arrested would seek to use Article 40 to challenge the action taken by the court in immediately committing them to prison. The legislation as it stands almost overtly invites challenge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  I have explained that the statute of the tribunal demands that the language inserted in the legislation be used.  All legislation, irrespective of what language is used, is subject to interpretation and challenge in the courts.  The fact that one may challenge the order of the court pursuant to Article 40 is an adequate safeguard.  There would be a difficulty if Article 40 did not exist, but we are fortunate to have a good Constitution.  It is the <Col N="1338" /> right of any citizen to challenge his or her committal under the appropriate Article of the Constitution. In the circumstances, I do not see the difficulty envisaged by Senator Costello.</P>

Senator Costello mentioned the need to emphasise the right to bail.  There is no need to emphasise to the courts the right to bail; the courts understand the law on bail and are aware of the importance of ensuring that no individual is unnecessarily deprived of his liberty.  Irish courts are particularly zealous in guarding the freedom of individuals and this has been borne out more than once.  The legislation as it stands in no way attempts to under-state the individual's right to bail.  It merely states the law as it is intended pursuant to this legislation, recognising always the other laws or weights and measures which complement this legislation.  The courts are well aware of these laws and there is no need for the Legislature to be instructive to them in that respect.</P>

      <P>In page 11, lines 20 to 22, to delete subsection (5).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section seeks to limit the right of appeal. Section 14(5) states that no appeal shall be made against an order of the High Court except an appeal on a point of law to the Supreme Court. What we are seeking to amend are areas where <Col N="1339" /> the normal rule of law under the Constitution appears to be diluted.  In this case the right of a full blooded appeal to the Supreme Court is being denied.  All High Court decisions can be appealed to the Supreme Court except where it is specifically restricted by law.  Why then should it be simply restricted by law to a point of law in this legislation? Personal liberty is a very important issue. I cannot understand why someone whose extradition might be sought would not be entitled to the full rigours of the law and the full generosity of the law under the Constitution.  The Minister said this is an imperative under the legislation but no matter what any international body considers appropriate, it must abide by the Constitution. Any laws put forward should clearly reflect this as in the case put for the right to bail.  I ask the Minister to reconsider that the right of appeal should be a full right of appeal, not simply limited to a point of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>In existing law under the Extradition Act, 1965, the only appeal when arrested is on a point of law.  That seems to have worked reasonably well and in this instance there is an important parallel and precedent.  I cannot see the difference between what is in this Bill and what already exists in the Extradition Act, 1965. If a person, having been arrested, has constitutional rights, this legislation does not deprive them of any rights.  Consequently, the Bill as drafted should be accepted.</P>

      <P>I am a supporter of this legislation.  I am waiting to speak about the International Criminal Court and the need to introduce the legislation for that, something for which we have waited 50 years, but with all my enthusiasm for both Bills, I want to ensure that a full right to appeal is recognised for anyone, no matter how heinous their crimes.  We must recognise the right for a full and fair trial which includes the right to appeal to the very last resort.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposed to section 14 by the deletion of subsection (5) is opposed.  If that amendment fails the proposed amendments to sections 18 and 19 fall as a consequence. The deletion of section 14(5) would, as Senator O'Donovan pointed out, fly in the face of existing extradition practice.  Section 29 of the Extradition Act, 1965, provides that no appeal shall lie against the decision of the court committing a person to prison there to await the order of the Minister for his extradition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to similar orders under section 14 of the Bill, it was decided that, because of the nature <Col N="1340" /> of the international tribunals and the serious issues which could be involved, an appeal on a point of law should be allowed.  While an ordinary appeal, however, will not be available to the person who has been committed to await his or her surrender, it will be open to that person to make a complaint under Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution and he or she will have been specifically informed by the High Court of his or her right to make a complaint.</P>
    <P>The fact and the possibility of an appeal on a point of law constitutes adequate safeguards for a person.  I do not accept that anything more is needed.  There are two avenues open to the individual concerned: the avenue of an appeal on a point of law and the avenue of an application pursuant to Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution. Senator O'Donovan has correctly pointed out that this legislation does not infringe in any way people's constitutional rights.  In point of fact, it has been said that no legislation can infringe on people's constitutional rights.  If that were to be the case the legislation would be held to be unconstitutional and the Constitution is, of course, paramount and would take precedence.</P>
    <P>There is an established code of practice in relation to committals under existing extradition law.  People do not have the right to appeal to the Supreme Court on a point of law.  There is the right pursuant to Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution. This legislation in no way changes the existing position, it repeats it.  Extradition law has been tested on many occasions on various points. We are following a tried and trusted procedure which is appropriate and positive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment attempts to improve the legislation. The authority which the Minister takes upon himself to direct an application to the District <Col N="1341" /> Court for a search warrant be made by a member of the Garda Síochána should be replaced by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána initiating the request.  It is not part of the Minister's function to get involved in such matters.  This is the function of the Garda Commissioner and any order to other officers should come from him rather than the Minister intervening and directing someone not below the rank of superintendent.  I wonder how that complies with the separation of powers.  It seems improper for the Minister to get involved in day to day directing of whom is to carry out certain instructions. That should be left to the normal line of authority within the Garda itself.  I would like to know what the Garda has to say about this provision. Would the Garda Síochána be happy for the Minister to take over a role normally exercised by the superior officer, the Garda Commissioner in this case?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  It is unusual that the Minister should be put in the position to direct that a search warrant be issued. It is for senior officers of the Garda to make direction for such a warrant.  I would like to know in what other areas of the law the Minister has this power to make the direction for a search warrant and how often this is exercised.</P>
      <P>In relation to the points being made about the right to appeal and the interpretation that there can be an interference with the right to bail, these are fundamental points of one's civil and human rights.</P>
      <P>We can never lose sight of the principle that everyone is entitled to a full and fair trial, irrespective of what we think of accused persons who might find themselves under arrest for heinous international war crimes.  Political interference in this process is undesirable.  This provision smacks of giving unnecessary powers to the Minister. This House makes the law and the Minister oversees his Department.  However, matters such as applications for search warrants are for the Garda to decide having satisfied themselves that a search is necessary and seeking the warrant to carry it out.  This should not be the function of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an unusual provision and I can see from where my colleagues are coming. However, article 29 of the Statute of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and article 28 of the Statute of the Rwanda Tribunal require states to comply with requests from those tribunals.  The obligation is on the State so the duty is on the Government to take up that responsibility and act accordingly.  Consequent to that consideration, it would be normal for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to make this request. In normal circumstances a senior Garda officer would initiate a search warrant.  However, the tribunals already established impose an obligation on the State.  The Minister would not like to take this on board but he has no choice as an obligation <Col N="1342" /> is imposed on him.  The Bill is appropriate having regard to the tribunal legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator O'Donovan.  The provision that search warrants may be applied for only after a direction from the Minister follows from the fact that it is to the Minister that the international tribunal will address any requests for assistance and co-operation or for the surrender or provisional arrest of persons.  It is necessary that the Minister, the representative of the Government on whom the statutes of the tribunal impose the obligation of co-operation with the tribunal, should have a general supervisory role over action taken in aid of the tribunals.  If difficulties arise in connection with any requests for assistance from a tribunal, or if there is a need for further information or clarification, it is the Minister who should deal with the tribunals.</P>
      <P>This is not a new provision.  A similar provision exists in section 55 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which deals with search warrants regarding material sought in connection with investigations arising from criminal proceedings in other states with which we have judicial co-operation agreements. In section 55 of that Act, as in section 30 of the Bill before the House, applications for search warrants can be made only after a direction by the Minister given in response to a request for assistance from a foreign government.</P>
      <P>It is important to point out that article 29 of the Statute of the Former Yugoslavia Tribunal and article 28 of the Statute of the Rwanda Tribunal referred to by Senator O'Donovan, require states to comply with requests from the international tribunals for the production of evidence.  In effect, the Government has to comply with the request. In those circumstances, it is not only appropriate but necessary that the power be vested in the Minister.</P>
      <P>The power is not one to make an order for a search warrant.  The power provided in subsection 30(1) is that an application can be made to the District Court following a direction by the Minister.  The court makes the order, not the Minister. There is no intention that there would be any form of political interference in the judicial process. On the contrary, it is apparent that the power to make the judicial order is still vested in the courts.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied with the Minister's reply.  The request from the international tribunal goes to the Minister and that is appropriate. However, why should the Minister take it upon himself to choose a particular garda to carry out the application for the search warrant?  Why should he not transmit the request to the Garda Commissioner and leave the authority with the commissioner who is the appropriate authorised person to deal with all applications for search warrants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1343" /> The Minister referred to provisions in the Criminal Justice Act which are similar to those in the Extradition Act, 1965.  This provision does not improve that legislation.  We should be seeking to amend these provisions as there is no valid reason a Minister should take it upon himself to select a particular garda to make the application to the High Court for something as important as a search warrant.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any statistics to indicate how many applications for search warrants are refused?  I have not heard of any applications being refused by judges.  We are dealing with the execution of requests.  There is a process and a section of the security forces have been given the authority to act on these matters.  I would have thought that the Minister would have been anxious to remain at arm's length from the execution of the request and that once he had received it he would pass it to the appropriate person &mdash; the Garda Commissioner &mdash; who would deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>It is wrong for the Minister to direct a garda to seek a search warrant from the courts.  Nothing he has said could change one's view on this matter.  It is no good for him to say that he receives the request.  It is appropriate that he does so but he should then follow a particular process.  He should not get involved in day to day operational matters which come within the remit of the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Costello.  The excuse has been made that the Minister has to execute applications from the International War Crimes Tribunal and, hopefully in the future, from the international criminal court.  This is not the case.  It is appropriate that the Minister receives the applications but he should then pass them on to the institution which deals with these matters.  Everyone would recognise that the Minister should not have a direct role beyond that.</P>
      <P>I have not read the legislation passed in the House of Commons or the Bundestag.  The parliaments of countries which are party to this agreement have had to pass legislation and it would be interesting to read what they had to say on this issue.  I am sure we are going far beyond other states in this area.</P>

      <P>The Minister does not have any power beyond that described by Senator Connor.  The Minister can direct that an application for a search warrant be made to the District Court by a garda not below the rank of superintendent.  The Minister does not decide which superintendent will make the application. All he would do is pass on the request to the Garda authorities and the commissioner and direct them to make an application for a search warrant to the District Court.  There is nothing wrong with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the number of warrants which are refused, I do not have statistics on those and <Col N="1344" /> I feel sure it would be virtually impossible to compile them at short notice.  However, this procedure seems to be open and fair.  The Minister, after all, is the one to whom a request for a search warrant is made by the international tribunal; he merely passes the request on to the Garda who, in turn, make a request to the District Court.  It is entirely within the jurisdiction and discretion of the court to decided whether to grant the warrant, taking all of the circumstances into account. There is clearly no interference whatsoever by the Executive with the Judiciary in the making of the order.  The Minister does not directly seek the order; the Garda does that.  There is a chain of events here which is both correct and inevitable and I cannot see why there should be any objection to it.</P>

      <P>This is a drafting amendment which is intended to improve the situation whereby a Minister may make regulations following a declaration from any tribunal or court established by the United Nations.  The amendment seeks to extend that to cover any organ of the United Nations on the basis that the UN does not operate as a totality. Normally, the Security Council would make orders of this nature.  The amendment would make it more free and open for any of the appropriate organs of the United Nations to make the request to the Minister.</P>

      <P>The addition proposed by this amendment is neither necessary nor appropriate. I am not clear what &ldquo;any organ thereof&rdquo; means in this context.  The Bill envisages that the Minister may make regulations declaring any tribunal or court established by the United Nations to be an international tribunal for the purposes of the Act.  The two <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals with which we are dealing were established by resolutions of the Security Council and if further <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals are established, they will presumably be established via the Security Council also.  They will clearly be covered by the phrase &ldquo;established by the United Nations&rdquo; and nothing more is needed.  In those circumstances, I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>If further tribunals are established, it is to be expected that their statutes will follow the form of the statutes of the Yugoslavian and Rwanda tribunals.  This legislation can then be applied with minor modifications made by regulations, thus obviating the need for separate legislation.  That is the purpose of paragraph (b) which the proposed amendment, if accepted, would delete.  Any regulations made under the paragraph would have to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas before they could take effect.

      <P>The passage of this Bill brings to 18 the number of Bills passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas since I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform just 16 months ago.  I am not saying that to blow my own trumpet but I am proud of the achievement.  In completing our consideration of this Bill, Ireland will be honouring its international commitment to ensure that the authorities in this country will have the necessary legal mechanisms available to them to arrest, detain and hand over persons found in the State who are wanted by the Yugoslav tribunal sitting in The Hague and the Rwanda tribunal in Arusha.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach and his staff for the co-operation given to me during the passage of this Bill through the Seanad.  I would also like to thank all of the Senators who contributed in a very constructive and supportive manner to the debate on the Bill.  In particular, I thank the main Government and Opposition spokespersons for the constructive and detailed manner in which <Col N="1346" /> they dealt with this legislation.  As always, the Seanad lived up to its usual high standards.</P>
    <P>During the debate on the Bill, concerns were expressed <i>inter alia</i> about the effectiveness of the two tribunals.  The tribunals are moving at a slow pace but we must not lose sight of the fact that, in spite of that, they are bringing people to face justice and pay the consequences of the awful atrocities they have inflicted.  It is important we recognise that.  We would all wish for greater progress; I sincerely hope we will see many more evil perpetrators of human rights abuses brought before the tribunals.</P>
    <P>Since the Second Stage debate on 14 October, the diplomatic initiative has continued in Kosovo with the establishment of the Kosovo verification mission by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe.  Ireland has indicated its readiness, in principle, to contribute to the verification mission.  The detailed plans for the mission are still being prepared by the OSCE in Vienna.</P>
    <P>As a small nation, Ireland can be extremely proud of the contribution made by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces to peacekeeping work.  During my recent visits to Bosnia, Croatia and Cyprus, I had the opportunity to witness at first hand the invaluable work being carried out by the Garda contingents working with the UN.  I wish to compliment the members of the Garda Síochána who work so hard, very often in extremely dangerous circumstances, for the welfare of the human race and for peace in our time. It was my privilege to have been in a position to bring to them the greetings of the Government and the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Regarding the establishment of an international criminal court which will be based in The Hague, I understand 58 countries including Ireland have signed the statute adopted at the diplomatic conference in Rome last July.  Ireland has long been a strong supporter of an independent permanent court and Senators can be assured that we will continue to support the establishment of the court in any way we can.</P>
    <P>I thank Senators who contributed so well to the debate.  I pay special tribute to the staff of my Department who worked so long and hard to bring this legislation before the Oireachtas.  I feel sure the efficacy of the Bill over the coming decades will be a fitting testament to their dedication and commitment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in saying I am delighted this legislation has at long last been passed by the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister correctly pointed out that part of the problem has been the slowness in the establishment of the two <i>ad hoc</i> criminal tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  We cannot forget that as long ago as 1993 the United Nations Security Council approved the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal for Yugoslavia and as long ago as 1994 ratified the setting up of the tribunal for war crimes in Rwanda.  It has been a long time coming and I am delighted that at long last we have reached this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1347" /> There is unfinished business, something the Minister touched on.  I make a special appeal to the Minister and his Department to prepare legislation as a matter of absolute urgency to allow the country ratify the international criminal court which we agreed to on 17 July at the end of the UN diplomatic conference in Rome.  Since then we have signed the agreement, but signing is not enough: we must ratify it.  Sixty countries must ratify this statute before it comes into effect and I would like to see this happen by the end of 1999. There must be 60 countries in the civilised world which feel strongly enough about the establishment of this international criminal tribunal for which we have waited for 50 years.</P>
    <P>Immediately after the Nuremberg trials many influential people and parliamentarians all over the world said they should have been replaced by an international criminal court.  If we had an international criminal court many people such as Pol Pot and so many tyrants over the intervening years would not have embarked on their horrible trails of destruction, mass murder, etc., as they would have known there was a court <i>in situ</i> which would try them and that there would be no such thing as immunity, impunity or hiding behind the borders of their own country.</P>
    <P>There is an imperative on Ireland, which rightly occupies the high moral ground on these issues in an international context, to produce legislation, hopefully in the next term, to ratify the international criminal court.  Much of the work on the legislation must be included in the Bill we have just passed.  Much of the legislation must follow the lines of this Bill.  I urge the Minister and his Department to please ensure we are one of the 60 countries.  I am a member of an international organisation of parliamentarians which is campaigning to have it ratified before the end of 1999 or at least at the commencement of 2000.  I sincerely hope we will have the Minister's co-operation in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say Ireland is committed to participating in the Kosovo verification mission.  The former Yugoslavia is in a difficult situation in terms of dealing with the problems which have been arising and there has been a slowness in responding adequately.  Nevertheless, it is good to see movement in terms of the verification mission and I would like to see our own security forces, which have a proud record, involved in it.</P>
      <P>Regarding the international criminal court I was glad to hear the Minister say he expects some progress is being made.  We have always sought an independent permanent international criminal court.  As Senator Connor said, it would be a great deterrent for those in the world, even in recent decades, who have been involved in genocide of an appalling nature.  The sooner the court is up and running the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to let us know the current position regarding the Convention Against Torture <Col N="1348" /> Bill which I understood was promised and should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for his prodigious work. His Department has produced 18 Bills in 16 months which amounts to about 50 per cent of the entire Government output.  The Minister can take a bow in terms of the legislation he has produced, most of which is very important.  I also commend his staff for their good work.  I thank the Minister for his regular appearances in the House, for dealing with the legislation himself and for responding in a very courteous and detailed manner.  I think debates in the House have always been constructive.</P>

      <P>The Minister has introduced 18 Bills in 16 months, representing approximately one third of all legislation which has come before the House since the Government took office.  This is a great plaudit for the Minister.  He is honouring the commitment he gave in Opposition that when in power he would tackle crime and introduce legislation with great speed.  This is a great compliment to him and his staff.  The only difficulty I have is that if he maintains this impetus we will all be kept on our toes, especially those on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I compliment my colleagues on the other side of the House for the amendments they have tabled on various Bills and the contributions they have made.  A solid Opposition is very interesting and important.  Sometimes we agree and accept amendments and sometimes we do not.  Great credit must be given to my colleagues for their commitment and contributions.</P>
      <P>I again thank the Minister for his huge contribution in introducing 18 Bills in the past 16 months.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been changed from &ldquo;Children (Reporting of Alleged Abuse) Bill, 1998&rdquo;.  The question is, &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; I call Senator Jackman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State. When this Bill was first introduced as a Private Members' Bill by Deputy Shatter it was entitled &ldquo;Children (Reporting of Alleged Abuse) Bill&rdquo;, but has now been changed.  The Bill had a rather <Col N="1349" /> turbulent passage through the Select Committee on Health and Children and there was a lack of acceptance for some of Deputy Shatter's amendments. An article in last Monday's <i>Irish Independent</i> by Brian McDonald entitled &ldquo;Scandal of Abused Children Revealed&rdquo; showed the real picture of abuse and neglect.  It stated that a staggering 3,700 children are in care and over 100 appear before the children's court in Dublin every week, let alone what one might find in other health board areas.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, referred to the care system being &ldquo;over-run&rdquo; with neglected children.</P>
      <P>If Deputy Shatter were here today he would say that he sounded a warning throughout the passage of this Bill, which was first introduced in February 1998.  Since then there have been more cases of abuse reported in the media, particularly from adults who now feel free to shed the burden of abuse.  It is extremely important that this Bill passes as quickly as possible and that it be enacted very soon.  We cannot afford to neglect these problems any more.</P>
      <P>Nobody can say that there will be an immediate solution.  It may seem strange when one sees Ireland described as the Celtic tiger and as one of the most prosperous member states of the EU but, as stated in the <i>Irish Independent</i> article there are many other social problems, such as unemployment, alcohol and drug abuse, ignorance and poor parenting.  It is also clear that support structures are inadequate.  The article listed black spot areas, such as north Clondalkin in Dublin, where there is no post office or health care centre.  Limerick was also described as a disadvantaged area.</P>
      <P>This Bill does not demand any finance from the Department of Health and Children.  It is a vehicle for improving the legal position of those who wish to report alleged cases of abuse.  In that sense it only needs our co-operation to ensure it is passed as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Children must be a priority when the forthcoming budget is being prepared.  Many Departments are involved in this area &mdash; Education and Science, Health and Children, Social, Community and Family Affairs &mdash; but anybody asked for an opinion on a priority area would surely choose children in order to give them a fair chance and to give them adequate support to ensure they do not have a bleak future.  We do not have hearts of stone in this regard.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter when introducing his Bill stated that it facilitated the reporting of child abuse by any person who has reasonable grounds for believing that a child is at risk, and that it addressed an area of law which has been ignored for too long.  There are many issues relating to the implementation of the Child Care Act that need to be addressed and which need funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some changes have been made to this Bill since Deputy Shatter introduced his Bill in February. Amendments were accepted in the area of interpretation, and Deputy Shatter accepted that it was necessary that an &ldquo;appropriate person&rdquo;<Col N="1350" /> meant a designated officer or a member of the Garda.  Initially he had a broader reference but he accepted that a designated officer would be &ldquo; . an officer of a health board appointed under section 2 of this Act for the purposes of this Act&rdquo;. The other areas are fairly straightforward.</P>
    <P>Section 2 refers to the chief executive officer of each health board.  When the Bill is enacted, an officer or officers of the board will be a designated officer or officers for the purpose of the Act.  I read the Official Report on the Bill and Deputy Shatter and others, such as Deputy Shortall, would have preferred to have a more specific provision in certain sections.  However, in this case the chief executive officer or the deputy chief executive officer of each of the eight health boards, in accordance with the section of the Health Act, will be the person who will appoint one or more officers as designated officers.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the protection from civil liability of persons who have reported child abuse.  The Bill was amended to eliminate the reference in the Bill as initiated by Deputy Shatter to a child's health, development or welfare which was likely to be avoidably impaired or neglected. Section 3(2) states the reference to liability in damages &ldquo;shall be construed as including a reference to liability to be the subject of an order providing for any other form of relief&rdquo;, which is straightforward.</P>
    <P>Section 4 created a great deal of grief during its passage through the Select Committee and Report Stage in the Dáil, where it was considerably lengthened in regard to the protection of employees from penalisation for having reported child abuse.  The debate referred to the meaning of the reference to the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993.</P>
    <P>The section gives protection to employees and provide that &ldquo;an employer shall not penalise an employee for having formed an opinion of the kind referred to in section 3 and communicated it, whether in writing or otherwise, to an appropriate person if the employee has acted reasonably and in good faith in forming that opinion and communicating it to the appropriate person&rdquo;.  The provision that the person must have acted reasonably and in good faith goes right through the Bill as initiated by Deputy Shatter.</P>
    <P>There is quite an amount of detail in section 4 in regard to the decision of a rights commissioner. It states that a decision shall do one or more of the following:</P>
    <P>(a) declare that the complaint was or, as the case may be, was not well founded,</P>
    <P>(b) require the employer to comply with subsection (1) of this section, and, for that purpose, require the employer to take specified steps,</P>
    <P>(c) require the employer to pay to the employee compensation of such amount (if any) as is just and equitable having regard to all the circumstances, but not exceeding 104 weeks remuneration in respect of the employee's <Col N="1351" /> employment calculated in accordance with regulations under section 17 of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.</P>
    <P>This section was amended by the Select Committee and on Report Stage in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>The section also refers to the tribunal.  It states that if it is necessary to make an application to the Circuit Court, such an application should be made to &ldquo;the judge of the Circuit Court for the circuit in which the employer concerned ordinarily resides or carries on any profession, trade or business&rdquo;.  The section further states that nothing in the section &ldquo;operates to confer on the Minister for Health and Children any of the functions of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under the Act of 1994 and those functions shall be performable by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the purposes of the provisions of the Act of 1994&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the issue of false reporting of child abuse, which we hope would not be very common.  The section states that a person who states to an appropriate person that a child has been assaulted or ill-treated or that a child's health has been impaired, knowing that statement to be false &mdash; which is an addition to the Bill as initiated by Deputy Shatter &mdash; shall be guilty of an offence.  Such a person shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or to imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there are quite strict penalties for nosy parkers or busy bodies who would seek to cause problems for someone because of a vendetta or a family disagreement &mdash; we cannot know who might decide to make such a vindictive statement.  A person guilty of such an offence shall be liable on conviction or indictment to a fine not exceeding £15,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both.  It is important to have large fines for muddying a person's good name by making a false claim.  The section further states that &ldquo;notwithstanding section 10(4) of the Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, summary proceedings for an offence under this Act may be instituted within 12 months from the date of the offence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference is then made in the Bill to saving and the new Short Title, which it states may be cited as the &ldquo;Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act, 1998&rdquo;.  The Bill states finally that the Act shall come into operation one month after its passing.  It is unusual to go through the various sections of a Bill, but it was necessary for me to do so in this case because it is a Private Members' Bill.</P>
    <P>I had hoped to have more time to discuss the support structures for health boards in the whole area of child abuse.  I ask the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, to ensure the Child Care Act is implemented.  I had the privilege of being a Member of the Seanad from 1989 to 1992, during which time that Act was debated. It is extremely essential in the forthcoming budget, and in subsequent ones, for the necessary <Col N="1352" /> finances to be allocated to ensure that Act is totally implemented and monitored by health boards &mdash; the buck stops eventually with the Minister for Health and Children &mdash; rather than paying lip service to our supposed love of children in this country and our supposed protection of them.</P>
    <P>When I ask members of the Mid-Western Health Board for support for the cases which are brought to my attention, I am always told they do not have the money or personnel to implement sections of the Act.  They do not even have money to train social workers to deal with this particular issue, apart from all the other areas which cause tremendous grief in terms of the protection of children.  I appeal to the Minister of State to fight with the Minister, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister for Finance to ensure a proper allocation is made for the implementation of that Act.</P>
    <P>We have been given the impression over recent years that this issue will be addressed and that more money will be provided for child care. However, the <i>Irish Independent</i> printed devastating statistics in this regard, and newspapers only print facts.  Every time we think the lid has been put on paedophilia, whether in sports organisations or the Church, we then read in the newspapers about more instances of abuse and more people coming forward.</P>
    <P>For such a civilised and &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; country, it is appalling that we are still fighting here for the Child Care Act to be implemented.  The only way we can say we have done our job is by prioritising the essential funding for this.  If I were asked my priority for this budget, I would say it was the full implementation of that Act on a phased basis &mdash; I would not expect all the money to be provided in 1998 &mdash; and not just because I am my party's spokesperson on health and children.  I read one report that £100 million is available, and I am sure there is far more.  If we could ensure that money was spent over a three year period on ensuring our children were protected there would be no backlash for the Government in regard to the budget.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for the latitude you gave me and I hope this Bill will pass through the Seanad quickly to ensure that people are not frightened of reporting cases of child abuse and neglect to the appropriate authorities, which in this case are the Garda Síochána and the eight health boards.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Jackman for her introduction to the Bill and I would like to say how pleased I am to be back in the Seanad where I spent five very enjoyable years.  I agree with all Senator Jackman said as regards the urgency of dealing with the child care area. She was right to say that there are no instant solutions and that it is one of the difficulties given the magnitude and, indeed, complexities of the problems.  While we are not here to discuss that <Col N="1353" /> today, I appreciate her support in trying to get extra money for which there is a need.</P>
      <P>All Governments in the past have neglected this area.  As a result of the tragedies of the 1980s, the Kilkenny incest case, the Madonna House case and so on, there was a considerable increase in resources.  While I wish to remain non-political about this issue, the last Government in its last year in office reduced the allocation from £10 million to £5 million.  Last year we increased the amount to £13 million, although there is no doubt that there is a need for a greater amount of resources in this area and we must all fight to get those resources and the type of action we now plan.</P>
      <P>As you are aware, a Chathaoirligh, this is a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter, which the Government accepted in principle in February of this year.  We amended the Bill substantially during its passage through the Dáil.  However, before dealing with the content of the Bill I would like at the outset to outline a number of important developments in our child care services for the information of the Seanad to which I alluded.  In our programme for Government, An Action Plan for the Millennium, we committed ourselves to the introduction of the mandatory reporting of child abuse and the Government has approved the preparation of a White Paper on this issue.  This is not a policy which is to be lightly entered into and we are all aware that it is highly complex and arouses very strong emotions, particularly in those who expect that they will be charged with the implementation of the legislation once enacted.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that legislation can seem fine and workable in the abstract.  However, we must ensure that in an area such as child care and protection we are very clear and careful about what it is that we expect our legislation to achieve.  We must not make the difficult tasks which our excellent child care staff carry out, often under the most trying of circumstances, any more problematical when they come to implement the legislation.</P>
      <P>For these reasons, I am proceeding on a number of fronts to review current practices and procedures with a view to implementing our commitment to mandatory reporting in a cohesive manner which will have the broad support of those who will have to put the policy into practice. One of my priorities on my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children last year was to begin a comprehensive review of child care practices and procedures. This was necessary because of the rapid way in which child care services have developed over the years.  This, of course, is a reflection of the increases in resources which have been approved for services for children and families since the publication of the pivotal Kilkenny incest investigation report in 1993 in order to provide for the full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also conscious of the urgent need to expand family support and preventative services <Col N="1354" /> and to try to prevent the types of cases with which we are all too familiar from recurring.  One of my key priorities, therefore, has been to ensure that there are up to date national child abuse guidelines in place which all health boards can use.  In February I established a working group to review the child abuse guidelines.  I asked the group, to which I appointed an independent chair, Ms Maureen Lynott, the director of provider affairs at BUPA Ireland, to report to me with revised guidelines by February 1999.  The group is very representative and includes members of the social work and medical professions along with representatives of the health boards, voluntary organisations, unions, the Garda and relevant Departments.</P>
    <P>I have kept myself informed of the progress of the working group which has had a fairly tight schedule of meetings and presentations due to the complexities of the issues upon which it must agree.  I am happy to be able to tell the Seanad that the group is on schedule and hope to be in a position to report to me with revised guidelines in accordance with its deadline of February next.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the proposed status of the revised guidelines as national guidelines, I am anxious to ensure that other guidelines and codes which relate to the care, welfare and protection of children should follow the key elements of the national guidelines.  In other words, the national guidelines will set down agreed definitions and principles which should apply to all.  Individual health boards and other agencies, statutory and voluntary, can then develop their own protocols based on the national guidelines.  It is, of course, obvious that such over-arching guidelines are a prerequisite for the guidance of the many disparate groups involved with children.</P>
    <P>To ensure consistency of approach, I authorised officials of the Department of Health and Children to meet with officials and persons charged with the review of the guidelines relating to children in schools and the code of ethics and good practice for children's sport in Ireland.  I am pleased to be able to report to this House that both groups have decided to postpone publication of their documents pending finalisation of the national guidelines.</P>
    <P>The second course of action I wish to highlight is the creation of a social services inspectorate. The inspectorate, which will concentrate on the child care services initially, is being established on an administrative basis for the present and will be located in the Department of Health and Children. I am pleased to inform Senators that advertisements for the position of chief inspector were placed in local papers by the Department of Health and Children in July of this year and the interviews for the post will be held this month.</P>
    <P>The main function of the inspectorate will be the promotion of good practice and the development of quality standards in child care services. The inspectorate's key tasks will include inspection of health board residential homes for children under the Child Care Act, 1991; management <Col N="1355" /> of the organisation, operation and management of child care services; evaluation of the quality and responsiveness of services as experienced by users and carers and to improve standards; provision of professional advice and expertise to Departments on the formulation, implementation and review of child care policy and the effective and efficient delivery of services; development of strategies to give effect to recommendations of relevant inquiry and review reports and other such tasks as may be assigned.</P>
    <P>The post of chief inspector is a key post in the ongoing development of our child care services and I look forward to the appointment of a dynamic, caring professional who will be a force for real change and improvement of services to the vulnerable children in our community. Recruitment of the three additional inspectors will proceed as quickly as possible after the appointment of the chief inspector together with the appointment of administrative support staff.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Bill before us, having passed all Stages in the Dáil prior to the summer recess.  As I mentioned, this Bill was initially presented in the Dáil by Deputy Shatter in Private Members' time in February of this year. In recognition of the intention of the Government to deal with the issue of immunity from civil liability in the context of comprehensive legislation on mandatory reporting, it was agreed to accept Deputy Shatter's Bill in principle and to refer it immediately to the appropriate committee of the House to allow for the revised drafting of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I was pleased the Government took this decision and I complimented Deputy Shatter at that time and subsequently on his initiative in bringing forward this legislation.  I have no hesitation in doing so again today.  He has a proud record of bringing forward legislation in the general child care area which has had a lasting impact on our legislative framework and on our services.</P>
    <P>After Second Stage of the Bill was taken in the Dáil, I and my officials had a number of constructive meetings with Deputy Shatter at which we managed to achieve a large measure of agreement.  I wanted our discussions to reflect a spirit of co-operation and goodwill which would ensure that the best legislative proposals were brought forward so that people would be encouraged to report child abuse.  I consider that the amendments which I proposed and which were in the main acceptable to the Deputy, bar one important provision, strengthen and improve the Bill and ensure that it provides a comprehensive protection for persons reporting allegations and neglect.  Deputy Shatter did not agree with the creation of a new criminal offence of malicious reporting of child abuse. However, this, in my opinion, acts as a safeguard against false allegations.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go over old ground so I will not detail the provisions of the Bill before amendment, rather I will outline the main provisions <Col N="1356" /> of the Bill as it stands.  Section 1 gives a list of the definitions used throughout the Bill and is standard in such legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the chief executive officer of a health board to appoint specific personnel as designated officers to receive reports under the Act.  This is to ensure that reports are channelled to the appropriate officers of the health boards rather than, for example, to any officer of the health board which would be inappropriate. I point out that there was considerable discussion on this subject during the progress of the Bill through the various Stages in the other House.  I accepted an Opposition amendment at very short notice which I have been subsequently advised could present a difficulty in the future in that the appointment of such officers might be regarded as questionable.</P>
    <P>The wording in question is in section 2(1) and I will bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage.  I will also address in the same amendment one of the other principal concerns of Deputies who spoke on Committee and Report Stages that I be more prescriptive in terms of the types of persons to be appointed as designated officers.  In effect this will mean that the Minister will have the power to direct health boards to appoint particular categories of staff and that each member of their staff within these categories will be a designated officer for the purposes of the Act.  This will help to ensure uniformity of approach by the boards which is essential for the efficient operation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the protection from civil liability of persons who have reported child abuse.  In effect the section ensures that a person reporting under the Bill will not be liable for any relief or damages.  This means that it will provide full civil protection to a person who reports child abuse &ldquo;reasonably and in good faith&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the protection of employees from penalisation for having reported child abuse.  The section puts in place protections for employees who report child abuse in good faith from all discrimination in their employment up to and including dismissal.  The section provides an avenue of redress for such an employee by way of a complaint to a rights commissioner. In proceedings before a commissioner or the Employment Appeals Tribunal, it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proven, that the employee concerned acted reasonably and in good faith in forming the opinion and in making the communication involved.</P>
    <P>This section also provides that, in respect of an unfair dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts, 1977 to 1993, relief may not be granted to an employee in respect of that penalisation both under this section and under those Acts.  The rights commissioner shall give the parties an opportunity to be heard by the commissioner, to present any evidence relevant to the complaint and shall give a decision in writing which shall be communicated to all the parties. The rights commissioner may direct specific <Col N="1357" /> action to be taken by an employer who has contravened this provision, for example, he or she may direct the employer to reinstate or re-engage or pay compensation to an employee who was penalised by way of dismissal.</P>
    <P>I have provided for a total time limit of 18 months for the lodging of a complaint.  There is an initial time limit of 12 months from the date of a contravention followed by an extension of a further six months where the rights commissioner is satisfied that exceptional circumstances prevented the presentation of the complaint within the shorter period.  I have also made provision in this section for the hearings of the rights commissioner and the Employment Appeals Tribunal to be held in private.</P>
    <P>I consider that these are significant protections for persons who might fear victimisation by their employer up to and including dismissal if they were to report child abuse.  I compliment my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, and her officials in the Department for their co-operation in drafting this section of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 5 relates to the false reporting of child abuse.  In our response to the Bill in February on Second Stage in Dáil Éireann, both the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, and I were most anxious that the Bill when finally enacted would not become a &ldquo;whistle-blowers charter&rdquo;.  To this end in framing our amendments subsequently, we were determined to ensure that there was an essential element of balance in the Bill.  As a society in recent years we have become aware of more and more horrific stories of abuse and neglect.  The terrible deeds recounted in various court cases, inquiry reports and elsewhere have contributed to the opprobrium in which child abusers are held.</P>
    <P>There can be few more damaging accusations against anyone in our society than that he or she abused or abuses children.  Under our Constitution, a person is entitled to the protection of his or her good name.  Article 40.3.2 provides that:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court has held that the State has a duty under this Article by its laws to prevent the infringement of personal rights.  While I have said from my first day in office that the interests of the child are paramount, it is obvious that it is also vital to protect the personal rights of others, including, for example, parents, from unsubstantiated attack.</P>
    <P>Can one even begin to imagine the trauma suffered by a child's parent if an unfounded accusation is made against them?  We must strike the right balance in this Bill between the need to protect those who report child abuse with due care and in good faith and the need to protect the good name of citizens.  In introducing this amendment <Col N="1358" /> to the Bill and thereby creating a new offence of malicious reporting, I sought to protect the innocent from such attacks.  The section makes the malicious reporting of child abuse a criminal offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment. I stress that it will be necessary for the prosecutor to show that a person made a report of child abuse &ldquo;knowing that statement to be false&rdquo;.  In other words, a high standard of proof is required to establish that an offence has been committed.  This is a necessary balance.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will in any way curtail or restrict right minded individuals from reporting genuine concerns about child abuse or neglect.  It will, however, give some redress to individuals who at present are reliant on their own resources to seek redress through the civil courts when they have been accused maliciously.  Thankfully, this does not happen very often, but I am aware of a number of serious instances.  I hope that this provision will act as a deterrent to individuals who might be maliciously motivated to make such allegations in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 6 emphasises that the statutory immunity provided for in the Bill does not change in any way the defences already available under common law.  The section allows a person to use whichever defence would be most appropriate and beneficial taking account of the circumstances of each individual case.  In other words, the statutory immunity provided in the Bill does not limit people in any way in regard to defences already available under common law.  Section 7 deals with the Title of the Act and when it will come into operation.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the objective of this legislation is to enhance the protection of children by encouraging all members of the public to act responsibly in reporting child abuse.  During 1996 the Department of Health and Children carried out an extensive consultation process on the mandatory reporting of child abuse.  There was a wide divergence of views on this issue and on the detailed questions raised in the discussion document.</P>
    <P>However, one issue on which there was almost unanimous agreement was that irrespective of the introduction of mandatory reporting, immunity should be granted to all professionals reporting in good faith.  We will go further in this legislation by providing civil immunity to all persons who, acting reasonably and in good faith, report child abuse to the statutory authorities.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, child abuse has come to be understood by many people as sexual abuse and, while this is a serious problem, the extent of physical and emotional abuse and neglect is much more serious.  I emphasise that we are dealing with physical and emotional abuse and neglect as well as sexual abuse when we refer to child abuse.</P>
    <P>I already referred to the work in progress in my Department on reviewing the child abuse guidelines and the imminent establishment of the social services inspectorate.  I am confident that these measures together with this Bill will have a <Col N="1359" /> major impact in further strengthening our ability as a society to protect children at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House and, as other Members remarked, I wish he could get more money to implement all the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991.  I also wish child care facilities were given more positive promotion in other Acts.  For example, when the divorce legislation was going through this House I recall there was constant reference to the importance of the welfare of children, yet in the family law courts there are still no facilities for judges to obtain independent reports on families as required by many family law Acts and the divorce Act.</P>
      <P>I hope this is one of the first areas addressed by the Minister for State.  One judge told me that she felt she was involved in child abuse by not being able to get such reports on families because it is of great importance in family cases that an independent and objective report should be placed before the courts.  The practice of a judge visiting families to assess the situation themselves or having children visit them in their chambers is not desirable.  It is much better if an objective professional, such as someone from the Probation Service, prepares reports so that the court will benefit from them.  I hope this will be one of the Minister's priorities.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  A number of months ago we welcomed the Murphy report on the Protection of Children in Sport.  Sections of the Bill do not take account of the report because it suggested that complaints would be made within the swimming fraternity to people in the association, branch or clubs.  For example, chapter 12.6.1 states:</P>
      <P>The Association, Branch and affiliated clubs should follow guidelines and procedures for reporting suspected or revealed abuse.  Children, parents, teachers, coaches, officers and officials should be reminded that reporting suspected child abuse or an allegation of abuse is not the same as making an accusation. Reporting is not accusing.</P>
      <P>If these guidelines are followed, I do not see how the person reporting the suspicion of sexual, physical or emotional abuse will be protected.</P>
      <P>Chapter 12.6.2 states:</P>
      <P>Where there are grounds for an allegation or complaint of child sexual abuse, the procedures indicated at 3.5 above should be followed.</P>
      <P>Since there is no chapter 5 in this report I presume this is a reference to chapter 12.3.26 and 12.3.27.</P>
      <P>Chapter 12.3.26 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where complaints of child sexual abuse are made to any committee member that member should inform the officers of the club who should ask the coach to stand down (see 4.10 and 4.11 below) and should report the complaint <Col N="1360" /> to the IASA Child Protection Officer and to the health boards and/or Gardaí.</P>
    <P>That person or the members of the committee will not be protected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Chapter 12.3.27 states:</P>
    <P>Club Committees should ask persons in respect of whom complaints of sexual abuse have been made to step down pending examination of the complaint.  When a Garda investigation is initiated the person being investigated should be suspended (see 4.10 and 4.11 below). The affiliated clubs should consider and decide whether, in the interests of children, the coach should be dismissed.</P>
    <P>These are serious matters but I do not see how people who bring such complaints will be protected by the Bill.  I realise we do not want a whistle-blower's charter but, on the other hand, if the welfare of the child is paramount, we must make sure we are protecting people if they bring forward what they feel is a suspicion of child sexual abuse.</P>
    <P>At the back of this report the bibliography of publications and reports on child sexual abuse in Ireland over the past number of years is amazing and these are only the cases which have received major public attention including the Kilkenny incest investigation; the report on the Inquiry into the operation of Madonna House; the report of the Independent Review Group on the International Missionary Training Hospital, Drogheda; the report of the Working Party on the Legal and Judicial Process for Victims of Sexual and Other Crimes of Violence against Women and Children; the report of the Irish Catholic Bishops Advisory Committee on Sexual Abuse by Priests and Religious; the report of the Law Reform Commission, Preventing Child Abuse Supporting Healthy Families, a submission to Government by the ISPCC, and the list goes on.</P>
    <P>In many of these cases, I do not know how the person who initially brings forward the report will be protected.  I wish the provision had been broader.  I often wonder how many cases of malicious reporting take place.  Currently, if the person specified by a health board receives a complaint, it is mandatory for him to report it to the Garda.  Consequently, people may report a suspicion to the health board in order to get the Garda sent to a person's house, for example, a neighbour they dislike.  These cases are thin on the ground and I wish at least the Garda had been included.  It is heavy weather that a person must go to the health board to complain.  Are people involved in sport to refer to the recommendations in the Murphy report?  Are they not to report anything unless they go to a health board?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the reporting to the committees recommended in the report &mdash;<Col N="1361" /> the person who reports what they see at the side of the swimming pool as recommended in the report.  If he or she reports to the chairman of the club, is he or she still liable to criminal prosecution? Under the Bill, I believe he or she is, yet within a club this facility is worth putting in place where a suspicion that something is going on could be reported.</P>
      <P>Perhaps when the Minister of State replies he will say that my concerns are unfounded.  People may not feel they have a legal obligation to report but a moral obligation, and I like to think we are protecting those who are in the close confines of a swimming club and feel that a committee member should be told.  Under the Bill, it looks as if such people will not have any protection.</P>
      <P>The role of the State is discussed in Strengthening Families for Life and there is a good section on how important it is that the State should have a strong role in promoting certain models of family life.  The commission states that while the role is limited by the principles of family and personal privacy and autonomy, by practical limits as to what the State can achieve as far as certain difficult aspects of family life are concerned and by public expenditure constraints, there is scope for the State to have an active role in the life of the family.  Remembering how seriously and rightly we, in Ireland, take family privacy, the Minister rightly stated that we should not just think about sexual abuse; we should think of physical abuse, emotional abuse and neglect.  I am sorry that the gardaí are left out because fortunately they are quite close to most people in Ireland.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing I would ask the Minister to clarify when he replies is when emergency care orders come into place for these children, how long in general &mdash; I know it will depend on the circumstances &mdash; will it be before an investigation takes place?  I have not been able to find out this or, <Col N="1362" /> indeed, how many cases are reported annually. This must make an enormous difference on how much social workers will be able adequately to undertake to do.  I realise it is an area where it is difficult to get a continuity of social work care because the work is extremely stressful.  No matter how much one provides by way of finance, it is hard to build up a good corps of people who are prepared to stay in it for long enough.  One of the things I have found which is unfortunate is that by the time people have got adequate expertise in this area, it is time for them to be promoted, often to an administrative position.  Therefore, they are not there to do the ground work.  Perhaps the Minister will tell me a little about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister back to his old stomping ground in the Seanad where he left his mark in more ways than one.  I welcome the Bill for the protection of people who report child abuse because this affects a great number of people, not just the professionals but people who deal with children.  I am talking about teachers and people working in cre ches.  It is to give them some protection when they feel that a child in their care is under threat.</P>
      <P>The history of child care Bills in Ireland has been poor to put it mildly.  We operated until 1991 or 1992 under the old British 1908 Act, which was well out of date even in the 1950s and 1960s.  If I remember rightly, Second Stage of the 1991 Act lay on the Dáil table for about eight years before it could be broached.  It shows the attitudes in those days which is still evident towards legislating for the family and for the care of children in Ireland.  As the Minister said, it has taken a succession of horrific cases to move us along.  In fact, since 1991 we, the legislators and people in the general child care area, have embarked on an educational odyssey about the upbringing, care and education of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not consider myself to be an elderly gent but looking back on my textbooks in medical school little &mdash; perhaps only a few lines or paragraphs &mdash; was devoted in the ones which dealt with paediatrics to the emotional development of children or to child abuse outside the major traumas which were dealt with in the pathology textbooks.  These did not feature in the classes <Col N="1363" /> which we were given in child care and child development.</P>
    <P>It was not as if this knowledge was not in the public domain.  If one looks back to the middle of the last century when Oliver Twist was written by Charles Dickens, on one level that book can be read as a horrific catalogue of child abuse but because it was accepted as a novel, it was written off and nothing was ever done about it.  People who were working in the child care area then were marginalised and no notice was taken of them.  Children who were troublesome or difficult were put into the large institutions.  It is not that many of those institutions did not do good work but, when one thinks that there were over 800 boys under one roof in Artane at any one time, with minimal numbers of people, many of whom were poorly trained or untrained, to look after them, it is no wonder that we are reaping in the 1990s what happened in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  These things are beginning to come to the surface.  We are beginning to lift the stones of the neglect by other generations.</P>
    <P>I am not going to stand here looking back because hindsight is 20/20 vision.  We are now in a different era and we are dealing with things in a different context, but it behoves us to learn from the mistakes of those who went before us and to deal with them appropriately.</P>
    <P>This is a Bill to protect people who report child abuse.  I was glad that the Minister expanded on what he meant by child abuse because the abuse of children which gets the headlines is sexual abuse followed by physical abuse.  In my experience, the worst abuse of children is emotional abuse, where children are spoken down to and denigrated from the time they are born, and normally within the close family setting.  Their self-esteem and self-confidence is broken and taken away from them at every hand's turn.  It is no wonder there are problems in this generation.  I am speaking not about all children but about some, a small proportion who you, a Chathaoirligh, as a teacher, have seen under your care. Anybody working in the child care area would have seen these cases and asked &ldquo;what do we do about that?&rdquo; This is where we have embarked on an educational odyssey not just for the legislators and teachers but for the parents and those who are charged with the care of children.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome and long overdue.  Nobody could find much fault with it although there may be the odd quibble with the detail.  I am glad the Minister is approaching mandatory reporting with extreme caution because this is an area which is fraught with difficulties.  I do not know how we are going to surmount these difficulties.  On one side are the people at the coalface who are dealing with child care and child abuse on a daily basis.  They oppose mandatory reporting.  Should we listen to them?  On the other side are people in the public eye who have a high profile and who deal with child care and child abuse at one or two steps remove.  On radio and television news <Col N="1364" /> programmes calls are made, often in soundbites, for mandatory reporting.  Will mandatory reporting achieve anything?  The jury is out on this and even after so many years of dealing with children, I cannot decide which is the best option.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of designated officers.  Child abuse is so important, difficult and urgent to treat, that there must be specially trained officers whose only remit is to deal with it.  They will be able to expedite treatment.  If they are taken into the general maw of the health boards, they will get lost or become part of the machine and cases will only slowly reach the surface. It is only when something really horrific happens that a fast track approach will be taken to such cases.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of a social services inspectorate.  This is long overdue and should have been introduced 30 years ago.  The provisions in this regard will be dealt with in detail on Committee Stage.  However, I urge the Minister to consider, before Committee Stage, the inclusion of the Dublin Corporation school attendance department under the wing of the social services inspectorate.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, school attendance is treated differently from the way it is treated in other health board areas.  Children who mitch from school tend to have multiple problems themselves and tend to come from families which are dysfunctional or which also have multiple problems. These children need to be treated in a holistic manner.  The health board or the inspectorate would have the expertise to provide continuity of care to these children from childhood through to adulthood.</P>
    <P>Proving malicious reporting can be difficult under either civil or criminal law.  This provision in the Bill seeks to balance the good name of the accused with the rights of the child.  At the end of the day, when the law and family or individual rights collide, the law often wins to the detriment of the other.  This area must be examined carefully on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill.  It will be one of the building blocks for the future development of child care.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Shatter for initiating this Bill, Senator Jackman for introducing it in the Seanad and the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, for accepting it in the Dáil and making improvements in a number of key areas. That is the way politicians ought to approach their work when dealing with child abuse or any other issue relating to children,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one development in recent Irish politics of which I was extremely proud &mdash; unfortunately, it died an early death &mdash; was the concept of the Tallaght strategy.  Under this strategy, parties united on certain issues that were fundamental to the wellbeing of our country.  If ever there was an issue on which there ought to be a Tallaght strategy, mark II, it is the issue of how to deal with child abuse and neglect.  There ought not to be <Col N="1365" /> party political point scoring on this issue.  It is one to which all politicians should direct their greatest expertise in order to put in place the best possible legislation.  In addition, the best possible provision should be made to ensure the legislation has the intended effect.  That effect is to give maximum protection to our children from abuse and neglect of all types.</P>
    <P>The legislation before the House deals with a single issue.  It is a small measure but it is highly significant.  Its enactment is pivotal to improving our child care services and to providing the type of protection children need, particularly at this stage of society's evolution.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a major milestone on the road to the introduction of mandatory reporting. Mandatory reporting is a subject on which the majority of politicians have agonised long and hard.  There are strong arguments for and against its introduction.  However, if we as adults and responsible legislators must err, we must do so on the side of giving maximum protection to children.</P>
    <P>It is an outrageous indictment on our civilisation, based as it is on Christian principles which we profess and proclaim loudly, that child abuse and neglect is as rampant as it currently is.  We hear a great deal about high profile cases.  They are horrific and we shudder to hear the details. However, there are dozens of cases of horrendous, persistent child abuse and neglect about which we hear nothing.  One of the reasons we hear nothing is that people who are aware of its existence are afraid to come forward.  That fear has been a barrier to reporting.  The essence of this Bill is to remove that fear and to give conscientious citizens legal protection so they can report abuse to the appropriate authorities with a view to stopping it and providing proper care for children.  For that reason, I am particularly pleased to welcome this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the provisions of the Bill apply to all persons and not just to professionals in specific areas.  The civil immunity provided by the Bill extends to everybody who wishes to make a complaint or who makes a complaint in good faith and with valid and reasonable grounds for so doing.  That is how it ought to be.  Sometimes a family member might wish to make such a report. Sadly, child neglect and abuse happens in the home and often only family members who are non-professionals are aware of it.  Given the provision of immunity under this legislation, it is hoped that such people will have the courage to report such abuse to the appropriate authorities. The person who reports might also be a neighbour. Whoever reports child abuse deserves to have the protections in this legislation extended to them.</P>
    <P>I am also pleased that the Minister of State has included a provision to deal with malicious reporting.  Such reporting could be devastating.  In a way it could undermine the ultimate objective of the Bill.  It is important that there is a provision in the legislation which would act as a deterrent <Col N="1366" /> to malicious reporting.  There is often a desire for revenge or retribution in society and this must not be allowed.  I commend the Minister for ensuring that there is a provision in the Bill to prevent this happening.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a matter which is causing me some concern and, if need be, my party and I will raise it later by way of amendment.  I am concerned that this Bill was drafted before the publication of the Murphy report on the swimming scandal.  My party and I are concerned that matters that emerged in the context of this report are not covered adequately, or at all, in this Bill.  If this is so, the Bill is fatally flawed from the outset because persons who report abuse deserve to have the immunity envisaged in this Bill extended to them.  If it emerges that such persons are not covered by this legislation, my party and I will be submitting a relevant amendment to ensure the Bill provides for such exigencies.  My party and I want to ensure that the people whose behaviour was outlined in the Murphy report are brought to justice and that the type of immunity required to ensure they are reported are brought to justice is extended to those who report such cases.  I await the Minister's response in this regard.</P>
    <P>Whenever we discuss a Bill of this nature we inevitably broaden it a little.  Mostly we talk about child sex abuse but there are other types of abuse which are equally insidious and equally devastating in their long-term effects.  Our aim must always be to put in place the type of law and provision that will act as a deterrent to this sort of behaviour.  It is not enough to punish the perpetrator when the damage is done.  Damage done to young people by way of sex abuse or other abuse is almost always irreversible.  An abused child can be a damaged and wounded person for the rest of his or her life.  Our aim must always be to attempt to put in place the type of deterrent and culture that will provide proper protection for our children.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to provide dedicated officers to carry out this task.  Dealing with such a matter demands a particular kind of professional skill that must be in-built in in-service training for health board personnel.  It also demands a certain aptitude and personality.  It is important that dedicated people are appointed to ensure the best possible quality and continuity of care.  People who report abuse should not be sent from A to B to C with no developments and no proper continuity of care.  I commend the Minister on his efforts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I also commend the Minister's decision to set up a social services inspectorate.  Yesterday the principals of vocational and community schools published a devastating report on the numbers of young people not attending school on a regular basis.  This is happening because there is no tracking system.  There is no Department or State agency with responsibility for the welfare of these children.  Therefore, they are left crying in the wilderness, crying for help but no help is forthcoming. If there is to be coherence and continuity <Col N="1367" /> it is important that there be dedicated people in pivotal positions in the health boards with responsibility for the well-being of all children at risk; I include the eight and nine year old girls and boys who are and will be begging on the bridges of our cities between now and Christmas. That practice is appalling neglect and a dreadful indictment on society.  There must be a dedicated person in each health board region with the sole responsibility for putting in place a system to bring these young people into formal education and rescue them from the horrendous neglect to which they are being exposed.  The putting in place of a social services inspectorate is very important.</P>
    <P>I chaired a committee which published a report on juvenile justice.  We examined the position of children living in areas of great economic and social disadvantage and discovered that there were houses in this city and other cities to which at least eight different groups called on a weekly basis to provide assistance for the families &mdash; St. Vincent de Paul, social welfare and so on.  No group knew what the other was doing.  This meant there was no growth, no development and no improvement in the family circumstances.  This was very wasteful and resulted in a total lack of a coherent approach.  Therefore, the appointment of a social services inspectorate will bring a coherence to the designing and delivery of services.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will be a very minor but pivotal building block in putting in place a proper child protection system.  The Bill must also provide for the sufficiency of personnel in the health boards to deal speedily with reports of abuse.  Sometimes delays between the reporting of abuse and action being taken can be devastating and do nothing to encourage people to do the honourable thing.  These issues must be dealt with speedily.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will not delay much longer in introducing a juvenile justice Bill and that by the time they ask the electorate to take account of their stewardship this generation will be seen to have made much better provision for all our children.</P>

      <P>I want to concentrate on the problem of malicious reporting, in particular the area of sexual abuse allegations in divorce and separation cases.  I have received briefing material from people interested in this area.  I understand this material was made available to the working group but no response was received.  There seems to be no reference to it in the documentation and for that reason I propose to put as much as I can into the Official Report because it appears to be the case that approximately two thirds of allegations of sexual abuse of children made in the circumstances of divorce or custody cases prove to be false.  That is not just the situation in Ireland, it is supported by statistics from Canada.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have taken it up incorrectly. I do not want to make any allegations.  It may have gone astray or there may have been an interchange of which I was unaware.  That, however, does not matter.  What matters is that the issue itself is so serious.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the primary function of all this legislation is to protect children.  I have no difficulty with that.  The Minister wishes to protect professionals which I also find reasonable, but the balance struck is not quite right. There should be protection for those persons who are the subject of allegations which appear to be incorrect, particularly where these are used as part of a balancing argument in cases of separation or divorce which have a custody implication. They are frequently made by one or both parties.  In these circumstances the right of a person to be protected against the negative impact of false allegations should be copper-fastened, particularly when there is such a high degree of such allegations.</P>
      <P>After the publication of the Kilkenny incest report it was suggested that lists should be kept of people suspected of child abuse.  This is a dangerous area.  How long are these lists kept? Should they not be categorised under a much more neutral heading such as people under investigation? To put down that someone is suspected of abusing their own child is a terrible accusation, especially if it is not subsequently shown to be true.  There are sufficient grounds to suggest that a fair number of these allegations are not true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I start from the premise that the child is always the victim of any report of sexual abuse, whether it subsequently turns out to be true or not.  The child is penalised because they may have one parent removed from them.  That parent may be a decent and good parent if the allegation is false. The Dáil passed this Bill on 1 July 1998 and indicated that a malicious report will, of itself, lead to what could be described as child abuse where access or custody is denied to a child on foot of an accusation which may prove to be incorrect. The removal of one parent from the life of the child on foot of a malicious allegation constitutes child abuse as defined in section 5 (1)(b) and section 1 (1) of the interpretation of welfare, where it states that child abuse is defined as, among other things, impairing or neglecting the development or welfare of the child by compromising his or her emotional welfare.  I would argue that if a false allegation is made and the child is <Col N="1369" /> deprived of access to its parent, it is being impaired in a way which fits in with the description of child abuse.</P>
    <P>Access and custody cases where couples separate are particularly problematic because, by their very nature, people are looking for the best argument and may be tempted to fling false accusations. They can be made from the mother's side against the father or from the father's side against the mother's new partner or her family members. In many cases the threat to make an allegation of child abuse is sufficient to control the non-custodial parent, deterring him or her through fear from applying to the courts for access or custody.  By their very nature such cases seldom come to the attention of the courts or the health boards subsequently.</P>
    <P>I have just emerged from a legal case in which there was a certain amount of legal blackmail.  I was told I would be dosed with publicity if I did not cough up.  It worked out that having paid all the legal fees it would have been worth my while to cough up.  This just concerned property not children, but there is always this bargaining.  That is dangerous if there are going to be these sorts of allegations.</P>
    <P>These allegations are on the increase worldwide. I ask the Minister to contemplate their impact on the relationship between the child and parent if they turn out to be false.  In Ireland when parents separate, does the Minister have any information about the statistics involved?  Is there a statistical link between court applications for access or custody of children by one parent and the emergence of a subsequent allegation of sexual abuse from the other parent?  Do the health boards have such statistics?  Do they record specific statistics?  I point to the fact that in Canada they do have this information and it is very worrying.</P>
    <P>In a report from Ottawa, a member of parliament, Mr. Galloway, said that the Ottowa-Carleton Children's Aid Society conceded that of the 1,500 complaints received, 900 involved custody and access and, of these, 600 subsequently proved to be false.  That is something we should bear in mind.  There is widespread anecdotal evidence in the Irish circumstance that this is repeated here. We do not know unless the Minister is able to give us the information and statistics.</P>
    <P>Procedural safeguards are necessary to protect an innocent parent.  There are innocent parents &mdash; we know this.  The person making the allegation or report ought to be asked to sign the allegation after it has been written down by the official receiving it.  The reason for any refusal to sign should be duly noted in the report.  To my grief we are removing the right to silence from accused people but people who make these allegations do not even have to sign the report.  They must be asked to sign and if they do not, it should be noted and a reason sought.  At the moment the social worker compiles a written statement when meeting the person.  The person is not asked to sign the statement and, if subsequently pursued <Col N="1370" /> for making a false report, the person can claim that he or she did not say that, the person who wrote it down got it wrong.  That is not fair.</P>
    <P>Any person who is accused should be informed as soon as possible.  They should be the first person after the accuser and the alleged victim to know they are being accused.  Any person confronted by a health board with such an allegation should be given a booklet which explains the situation and gives specific details of the procedures which will be followed in the investigation and explains the safeguards in place to protect the rights of the accused, who must be presumed innocent while acting in the best interests of the child.</P>
    <P>The person so accused should also be given a written copy of the allegations.  When a report is made to several different agencies, the health board, Garda Síochána, social workers, family doctors and so on, a copy of each such allegation report should be furnished to the accused person.</P>
    <P>Where the accused person is summoned to any meeting or assessment interview, he or she should be advised beforehand of the specific nature of the proposed meeting.  He or she should be entitled to be accompanied to such meetings, make and retain a record, written or taped, and he or she should be advised of rights beforehand. Such interviews and assessments are the initial stages of a criminal investigation and will be used if a prosecution is taken against a person interviewed. The findings of any such assessment or interview carry overpowering weight in a subsequent criminal investigation and for that reason the steps I suggest should be taken.  All these reports should be made available.</P>
    <P>There is also the issue of the list of suspected persons which refers back to the Kilkenny incest case and the Child Care Act.  This points to an extraordinary state of affairs.  We need to examine the maintaining of lists of suspected persons, the precise system of clarification of the outcome of cases and procedures for the removal of names from the list.</P>
    <P>The timescale for investigations should be given.  I refer the Minister of State to an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in March 1998 in which Deputy Batt O'Keeffe criticised the delay in handling sex abuse cases, particularly as they impact on people who are wrongly accused.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new criminal offence of making a malicious report, but it will probably be rarely used.  It will be almost impossible to prove any report as malicious in court unless the health board issues a forthright finding.  For obvious reasons, health boards have steadfastly avoided issuing such statements, opting instead for weak general statements to the effect that sufficient evidence could not be found to support the report of an allegation of child abuse.  This leaves the status of the accused as not proven rather than as innocent.</P>
    <P>If this occurs in custody cases involving divorced or separated couples, a more effective <Col N="1371" /> approach would be for health boards to give a commitment to speak in such terms in a subsequent hearing regarding access and custody and for the courts to take cognisance of such statements. In other words, if an allegation is seen or felt to be spurious, instead of suggesting that they may possibly go after an individual in the long term on some criminal charge, the evidence should be introduced as part of the pleadings in the custody case so that it can be taken into account when assessing the suitability of a parent or guardian.  If someone makes wild allegations of sexual abuse simply to maintain custody of children, that should be taken into account when judging whether or not people are suitable.  The 12 month rule will not work and I will be proposing an amendment on this issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CamillusGlynn" hpid="Mr. Glynn Mr. Glynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Glynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am privileged to speak on this important legislation.  I wish to refer to some comments made by previous speakers.  Senator Quill stated that this should not become a political issue.  It is not a political issue.  If anything, it highlights the statesmanship of Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, in taking on this Bill and inserting important amendments.</P>
      <P>To a point I agree with the matters articulated <i>ad nauseam</i> by Senator Norris.  This is one of the reasons the Minister of State inserted the provision regarding malicious reporting.  It was important that he took this situation on board. This amendment was not accepted by Deputy Shatter but is now part of the Bill and I welcome that fact.  The abuser could become the accuser. If this provision was not included, someone who is guilty of abuse could say: &ldquo;I am not guilty and you cannot prove it.  It is a malicious allegation&rdquo;. There are welcome safeguards in the Bill for everyone.</P>
      <P>Senator Fitzpatrick referred to Dickens' great work &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo; and how it was regarded as just a novel.  However, every day in every town and village situations exist which resemble the story of &ldquo;Oliver Twist&rdquo;.  Fact is stranger than fiction and we are all aware of drug pushers who use young children as couriers.  We are also aware of the character of Fagan who exhorted young children to &ldquo;pick a pocket or two&rdquo;.  That is happening in reality.  At local authority level I have raised the fact that juveniles are on the streets at night.  They are young, impressionable people who are moulded when they fall into the clutches of Fagan-like characters and are easily exhorted to carry out illegal practices.  We all know what those practices can involve.</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the different types of child abuse.  There is a misconception about child abuse.  People accept that it usually involves sexual abuse.  However, there is also physical, emotional and other kinds of abuse.  There are also abuses involving children arriving home from school with no one in the house to meet them, or situations in which children are on the streets at night when their parents are in the pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1372" /> I wish to deal with the inspectorate which will be established.  This is a marvellous step forward. I will not go into it in any detail as it has been effectively dealt with by previous speakers.  The Minister of State also outlined the inspectorate's objectives.  When I attended Coralstown school, County Westmeath, it was a regular feature of school life for the local garda to inspect the roll. I am not saying that this practice should continue as this matter should be dealt with by the child care system rather than the justice system. However, there should be regular inspections of school rolls to ascertain the level of absenteeism. I recall children who brought notes to school which had allegedly been written by their parents, but there was a follow up system.  This should not be done under the auspices of the justice system but by the health boards.</P>
    <P>There should be no hiding place for abusers.  It is important to note that children who are abused often go on to be abusers themselves.  Children who are abused are often unaware of what is going on.  They know something is wrong and feel guilty as they believe they, and not the abuser, are responsible.  I have dealt with many such people in a professional capacity.</P>
    <P>I recall a lady who was admitted to our institution suffering from depression.  No causal factor could be established until it transpired that she had been abused by her father for a long number of years.  While on holiday in England, I met a care worker who was also abused for a long time by her father.  Her mother was aware of the abuse but was afraid to do anything.  The entire household lived in fear of the abuser.  That is something the Bill will tackle.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the health boards and the Garda have been designated to deal with this issue.  Initially, a number of organisations were outlined which, in my opinion, reflected the adage that &ldquo;too many cooks spoil the broth&rdquo;.  The health boards possess the necessary medical, nursing, social work, community welfare, psychological and child care staff to deal with these matters. It is important that the agencies best equipped to deal with them are given the responsibility to do so.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a full range of employment appeals where someone who reports abuse is victimised by his or her employer.  That is comprehensively covered in the Bill.  The title of the Bill has been changed to read &ldquo;Protections of Persons Reporting Child Abuse&rdquo; which clearly reflects what the Bill endeavours to do.  I welcome the Bill and commend Deputy Shatter for introducing it.  Society needs this kind of legislation.</P>
    <P>Nothing arouses greater anger and emotion than a child abuser but we must remember that a malicious individual who falsely accuses someone of committing child abuse is equally, if not more guilty than a person who perpetrates such horrendous acts.  This is one of the most important Bills to come before the House during my short time here and I commend all concerned.  I hope the <Col N="1373" /> Minister will take on board the observations made by Members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is welcome both in the manner in which it was proposed by Deputy Shatter in the other House and the manner in which the Minister responded to it.  It is an example of the way in which we should co-operate to ensure we serve our public to the best of our ability.  I thank Senator Jackman for introducing the Bill in this House.</P>
      <P>Legislation we pass in these Houses will never undo the damage, hurt or pain caused to the victims of any type of child abuse.  Our efforts are directed at ensuring that the number of dreadful experiences people have had will lessen in the future in so far as it is possible to reduce the opportunities for them.  If suspected or proven abuses occur, procedures will be in place to ensure they are dealt with quickly and effectively. I am conscious that this Bill deals with only one aspect of the issue and that there are wider implications involved.  I hope we will have an opportunity to comment on the various measures underway in the Department to address those at a future date.  I will confine my comments to the subject matter of this Bill.</P>
      <P>First, I wish to express my personal thanks, admiration and gratitude to those people who have been brave enough to speak out on this issue to heighten awareness of the terrible deeds which have been committed against children in our society in the recent and distant past.  These people have had the courage to have their photographs published in the newspapers, speak on television and radio and write books.  This not alone increases our awareness of the problem but also encourages other victims to speak out and ensure that abusers are taken out of circulation in so far as it is possible to do that.  Legislation alone will not solve the problem but we must provide political responses to the issues which have been brought to our attention and this Bill is an important part of that process.</P>
      <P>The Bill's general provisions were recommended as long ago as 1990.  I compliment Deputy Shatter on his initiative in putting those recommendations into effect in this legislation. We can all comment on mandatory reporting but the Minister is proceeding in the correct fashion in dealing with the issue and I compliment him on that.  I am confident that when the relevant consultation processes have been undergone, we will have a workable system which will stand to benefit the children in our society.  Some months ago, the Minister participated in a debate on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; with Senator Joe O'Toole and others.  While people may have had different understandings of what was meant by mandatory reporting at the end of the programme, everyone was agreed on the general objective.  I hope the measures currently in train will result in procedures and practices which child care professionals and others concerned with the welfare of children can agree on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> It is important we ensure that people who have reason to suspect children are being abused report their concerns to the appropriate authority. There is a greater willingness now than in the past to do that but the fear of possible litigation may still discourage some people.  When this Bill is enacted, it will do away with such concerns. It is traumatic for an individual who suspects or realises abuse is occurring as they are often unaware of what to do or who to turn to. It is imperative that such people can make their reports to the appropriate body in the full knowledge they will be immune from legal action after making the report.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have two meaningful and constructive effects.  It will protect people who report alleged abuse or ill treatment from legal action and will convey a clear message to the public that we are serious about protecting our children from the perpetrators of evil and damaging acts.  We need to create an entire culture in our society where the safety and protection of children is of paramount concern and where citizens feel safe if they report fears and concerns to the appropriate authorities.  This Bill will help to create that culture of openness.</P>
    <P>I followed closely the debate on this Bill in the Dáil and, notwithstanding my concern and that of other Members to provide protection to people who reported alleged abuse in good faith, I was very concerned about the entire area of malicious reporting.  I welcome the discussion which took place and I welcome the amendments introduced by the Minister.  However, I wish to raise some questions as to how this might proceed in practice.</P>
    <P>Like Senator Norris, I have been made aware of an individual submission which I understand was made to the departmental working group reviewing child abuse guidelines.  I was not told the submission had not been responded to.  There are some good points in it and I wish to address some of those which were not addressed in detail by Senator Norris.  Equally, I am using my own experience as a public representative in judging there is an increase in malicious reporting.</P>
    <P>The heightened awareness of child abuse in society has heightened readiness to make malicious reports.  We must always treat reports as if they are made in good faith and with the interest of the child at heart.  However, if it is subsequently found that reports were made for any other purpose we need make no apology for allowing redress to protect the good name of the person.  I welcome the Minister's comments in his opening speech in this regard.  However, it may be necessary to re-examine in our consideration of the Bill the provisions of section 5.  Notwithstanding the section as proposed it will be very difficult for somebody against whom a malicious report is made to defend their good name in court.  I will discuss this further and may propose further amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In my experience of dealing with constituents on an everyday basis I increasingly see in family <Col N="1375" /> disputes, discord and breakdown, custody disputes over children and separation and divorce cases reports which are found to be malicious, unfounded, incorrect, made for the wrong reason or in the heat of an emotional moment, which cause great distress and difficulty even prior to the allegation being made.  The majority of allegations are unsubstantiated.  Some are marked &ldquo;suspected but not yet proven&rdquo; while others are marked &ldquo;still under investigation&rdquo;.  There are thousands of people who are still &ldquo;under notice&rdquo;, to use a Garda term.  We should first try to quantify the problem and then take measures to deal with it where malicious accusations are made in family discord, separation and divorce cases and where custody is being sought.</P>
    <P>I have a query concerning the time limit of 12 months proposed in the section.  How will the person who may be the subject of an unfounded, malicious or vexatious allegation be able to seek redress in circumstances where the health board investigation can take longer than 12 months and perhaps two or three years?  I would like this issue to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>I am fed up hearing the term &ldquo;closure&rdquo; in public debate &mdash; we are adopting more and more Americanisms in public debate in Ireland &mdash; but the issue of closure is very important in terms of investigating child abuse, particularly from the point of view of the person against whom the allegation is made.  Last year I dealt with a case where parents came to me in a very distressed state.  They had been involved in disputes with neighbours in a housing estate.  One set of neighbours made in my view a malicious report to the health board which, under the relevant procedures, had to report it to the Garda.  Therefore, two investigations took place.  To its credit the health board conducted its investigation speedily, sensitively and informed the parents that from its point of view there was no need to take further action.  Unfortunately, the Garda investigation went on for quite a long time.  Senior officers had to be contacted to remind the officer assigned to the case to deal with it.  The officer concerned pleaded pressure of work and the family suffered tremendous stress for months.  This, in turn, caused further problems both in terms of the relationship between the parents and the relationship between them and their children. This underpins the importance of the issue.</P>
    <P>Regarding the child abuse register, I would like clarification in respect of some recommendations in the Kilkenny report.  It recommended a precise standardised system of clarification of outcome in every health board area in the country.  I would like to know if this is in place.  It also said that, in fairness to people against whom allegations would be proven to be untrue or unfounded, procedures should be put in place for the removal of names from the register of suspected or established child abusers.  I would like the Minister to clarify the progress which has been made in terms of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> Other speakers have referred to resources.  I know the Minister cannot address this matter on his own as he must get approval from the Minister for Finance and the Government.  However, it is important to point out to the public that, over the past number of years, there has been a huge investment of resources in child welfare.  I do not say that by way of complimenting any Government because for a long time there was a lacuna and we are still only catching up.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that the extra workload which will be put on professionals in the health services through the passage of this Bill and the culture of openness we are seeking to create must be met with extra resources.  A person making a report must be confident that somebody will deal with it quickly.  The person to whom the report is made must be confident that back-up resources exist in their organisation to deal with it quickly and effectively.  Whether the allegation is proven or unproven, the person against whom the allegation is made has a right to know the outcome as soon as possible.  In the Midland Health Board region there does not seem to be any undue delay, but I am aware of complaints in the Eastern Health Board area in this regard and I expect them to be addressed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In terms of resources we must also look after the personnel in this area.  It is a very demanding and stressful area of work and takes a lot out of people.  I am concerned about staff turnover. Many resources are invested in training people, inducting them and placing them in health boards.  However, there is evidence that within a short number of months people appointed in this area move on very quickly as other opportunities are opening up in the voluntary and statutory sectors. It is necessary to put in place measures which ensure supports and rewards exist for people working in this very difficult area to ensure that when expertise has been established and put in place, it can be availed of for many years in the future.</P>
    <P>For many years we ignored the growing problems in the area of child welfare.  The Government, like its predecessors, has been trying to catch up to put in place vitally needed services which were not provided when they should have been.  In some areas there are problems which are now close to being out of control.  In the process of catching up we are discovering increased demands in the various areas which we are not capable of meeting from current resources.  We must begin providing important new services and the significant resources I mentioned.  I am seriously concerned that we are not meeting the existing demand.</P>
    <P>Neglect is a huge and often unrecognised problem in regard to children in society.  In this context there is a need for adequate support for parents. We are doing very little in this area and we are faced with serious problems at a later stage. There is a danger of concentrating on a fire brigade type service and not doing enough in terms <Col N="1377" /> of prevention.  I hope to return to some of these issues during later consideration of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>In complimenting Deputy Shatter on bringing this Bill to the House, I congratulate the Minister on giving his total commitment and bringing the legislation to this stage.  This is an important Bill designed to add additional elements to current legislation, thereby giving greater protection to children at risk of abuse or neglect.  The objective of the Bill is to ensure no barrier exists which might prevent the reporting of child abuse or neglect to an appropriate authority. People in regular contact with children may, in certain circumstances, conclude that a child is at risk of or suffering abuse.  Many cases are brought to light by nurses, doctors, social workers and teachers, people whose professional work brings them into daily contact with children who may be at risk.</P>
      <P>It should be the objective of all of us to improve co-operation between agencies in helping to identify and respond to the needs of children at risk.  We have been shocked in the past by horrific reports of child abuse; many involve incidents from years ago, while other incidents took place in the recent past.  The most horrific element was the fact that many of those who committed these abuses were people in society we would have looked up to.  A great deal of bridge building will have to be done if we are to regain those people's confidence.</P>
      <P>Abusers are not a regular type of criminal.  One can deal with them daily without knowing they are evil.  I applaud the courage shown by those who have suffered these crimes and brought their pain into the open.  There is overwhelming concern to ensure that those types of abuses will never happen again.</P>
      <P>We must ask ourselves what we are trying to achieve in this Bill.  We recognise the objective of the Bill and the Government's commitment that every case of child abuse should be reported to an appropriate authority.  We must be sure that the health boards and other agencies have the necessary resources to deal with the problem.  An individual who is worried about the welfare of a child needs to know that the resources and services will be put in place to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public is deeply concerned about this matter and wants the Government, health boards and other agencies to implement policies to protect their children and to convict those guilty of perpetrating crimes against children.  This Bill will assist this process.  It does not give protection to those who might make malicious or false allegations of abuse, and that is very important.  The Bill will also protect people who genuinely report alleged abuse or ill treatment in good faith, and if it is to be successful the Bill must gain the confidence of the professionals who will be charged with responsibility for its implementation when it is set in stone.  If we do not have the confidence of doctors, nurses and others at the coalface, the <Col N="1378" /> Bill could fall flat.  We need to create a culture in our society where the safety and protection of our children is of paramount concern, as the Minister of State said.  Citizens must also feel that fears and concerns they report will not fall on deaf ears and that the appropriate body will deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>A great deal more needs to be done following the enactment of this Bill if we are to have a comprehensive child care system which is responsive to all the needs of children and which provides children at risk with the protection to which they are rightfully entitled.  Successive Governments have failed for decades in their responsibilities in this area, primarily due to the fragmentation of political responsibility among a number of Departments which were dealing with this issue. That led to a piecemeal, fire brigade response rather than a comprehensive approach.  Thankfully, children now have rights.  It is time we moved away from the mindset of children being seen and not heard and the adult always being right.  We must make the necessary resources available to make the passing of this Bill worthwhile.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnLeonard" hpid="Ms Leonard Ms Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Ms Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will facilitate the reporting of child abuse by any person who believes that a child is at risk of neglect or physical, sexual or mental abuse.  I have great admiration for those victims of abuse who have come forward and exposed themselves to public scrutiny. They do more to prevent abuse taking place and to encourage others to report abuse than any legislation we pass.</P>
      <P>Abuse in recent years has been highlighted by these cases, and we would all like to believe there will never again be any abuse of children.  I compliment the Minister of State on his handling of the mandatory reporting issue.  That was a buzz word over the last 12 months, and it causes great division among medical personnel, health board workers and others in this area.  The consultative route is the right approach and I wish the Minister of State luck.  I am not sure which side I favour as this is a very complex subject.</P>
      <P>My one worry about this Bill is the fear of reporting abuse, particularly in small rural areas. That is not the fear of a civil case so much as the fear of being isolated and ostracised in one's own community.  Many of these cases have taken place in small communities where the abuser is respected and well known.  Often the person who takes a case can feel very isolated, and reporting one's suspicions can result in closed doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very sorry for those who feel they have no options.  They do not want to go to a health board because everything must be put in writing and more damage can be caused to the individual being abused in the short term.  I am aware of cases in my area where individuals do not want to go to the authorities and would prefer to deal with matters on their own.  I do not know how that will affect them later.  This is still the case despite the media hype about abuse.  Any <Col N="1379" /> instance where there is concrete evidence that a child is being abused should be reported; that goes without saying.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing the offence of falsely reporting child abuse.  It appears that in cases of marital discord children are being used in a tug of war between parents, if not a tug of love.  One parent will make unsubstantiated allegations of abuse against the other. I presume such parents are very distressed and do not realise the damage they are doing to their child.  Parents distress their children by their marital breakdown but insinuating that the other parent is abusing a child is an even greater abuse.  I wholeheartedly welcome this addition to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I hope the necessary funding will be provided for the improvement of the child care services to ensure other cases of abuse do not take place or, if they do, that they are investigated speedily and that the proper support and counselling are provided for victims, their siblings and parents who were not involved in the abuse.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on what he has done so far and I wish him luck in his further deliberations on the child care services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryJackman" hpid="Mrs. Jackman Mrs. Jackman">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Jackman</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for staying for the whole debate.  The Bill was welcomed by all who spoke but every speaker expressed concern about the need for finance for the implementation of the Child Care Act.</P>
      <P>I did not refer to the United Nations because I was restricted by the time available.  However, I understand from a recent visit to Geneva that the UN is not too happy with our overall strategy for child care.  I ask again for the implementation of the recommendation for an ombudsman for children; this is extremely necessary in the context of everything we debated today.</P>
      <P>Deputy Shatter was very disappointed that some of his amendments were not accepted. Some of them were reincarnated today in requests by various Senators.  I think Senator Henry's concern that the Bill had not taken into account the Murphy report would have been satisfied by an amendment tabled by Deputy Shatter in this regard.  His amendment stated:</P>
      <P>A person, who, apart from this section, would be so liable shall not be liable in damages in respect of the communication whether in writing or otherwise, by him or her to a member or members of the governing body of a sport or of the committee of a sports club of his or her opinion that a child has been or is being assaulted, ill-treated or sexually abused by a member of or an employee of such governing body or sports club unless it is proved that he or she has not acted reasonably and in good faith in forming that opinion and so communicating it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it had been accepted that amendment would have covered the point made by Senator Henry <Col N="1380" /> in regard to the Murphy report and which was alluded to by several Senators this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter's concern about the amendment made by the Government in regard to penalties was that he saw it might be a deterrent, in terms of people worrying about which side of the law they might find themselves if cases were taken against them.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzpatrick, who is a practitioner, made a very interesting point about the social services inspectorate.  I hope the Minister of State will get plenty of replies to the advertisement &mdash; I think he said the interviews were ongoing.  The Senator suggested that school attendance in the Dublin area should be placed under the auspices of the social services inspectorate, and he ought to know what he is talking about as he is a practitioner.  It is important for that point to be taken on board.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris showed the importance of having a Seanad by drawing attention to the working group which is reviewing the guidelines on child abuse.  Senator Leonard referred to the fact that the children of parents of unhappy marriages or who are divorcing can be used in a tug of war rather than a tug of love, as the Senator eloquently described it.  The Minister of State should take up that issue.  He stated that the allegations in 600 out of 900 cases in New Zealand relating to such a tug-of-war were found to be false.</P>
    <P>Divorce has only been recently introduced in this country and we will have to watch this area very carefully and ensure children are not &ldquo;used&rdquo; in such situations.  The whole emphasis of the Child Care Act and this Bill is child centred.  Perhaps the Minister of State could find the relevant statistics for this country of reports of alleged child abuse by separating or divorcing partners.  I received many representations in this regard, even before the Child Care Act was enacted in 1991.</P>
    <P>Senator Norris also made the important point that a person who has been accused should be notified immediately.  He was also concerned about the 12 months issue.  Senator Gallagher said that not all health boards might be able to act expediently, not because they lack the will to do so but because they lack the necessary resources and personnel.  It is important to look at that point.</P>
    <P>Senator Glynn referred to the importance of consensus, as did Senator Quill who made the point very emotionally that it is extremely important for all sides of the House to unite on issues concerning children.  That was borne out by the flavour of the debate today.  There was no acrimony and Members made suggestions, not from any political motive but purely for the protection of children and those who have the sensitivity, concern and humanity to put the problems of others before themselves by reporting abuse. As Senator Leonard said, such people might be isolated in rural communities.  I understand what she said in that regard because the abuser might be the most respected member of the community or of a family.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1381" /> Tremendous credit must be given to people who report abuse.  It would be easy for them to turn the other cheek and mind their own business, but they are so concerned about cases of emotional, psychological, physical or sexual abuse that they do not want to walk away from the issue but instead put their reputations at risk, particularly in small communities where they might be just seen as busybodies, isolated and ignored.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Shatter were here he would be very pleased with the attention the Bill received today and the Minister of State's efforts.  This Bill is one of many issues which must be addressed but it will need a tremendous amount of funding for the health boards and for the training of personnel. We must provide funding to ensure we do not have to raise these same issues in the new millennium.</P>
    <P>Several amendments have been suggested.  I look forward to the Minister attending Committee Stage; whatever amendments are tabled then can only perfect the Bill, as happened in the Dáil. I thank the Senators who contributed and the Minister of State for his comments.</P>

    <Title>DTI Recommendations: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Whilst welcoming the recently announced investment in public transport for Dublin, Seanad Éireann deplores the slowness with which the non Luas recommendations of the Dublin Transportation Initiative are being implemented; and urges the present Minister to accelerate the process so that Dubliners do not greet the Millennium with gridlock.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and the opportunity to debate this motion.  We have approximately 422 days before the new millennium.  In recommending this motion to the House I do not want to mislead anyone, but it is vital to accelerate the introduction of the measures recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative.  If we do not go on thinking like dinosaurs and behaving like snails, we can avoid gridlock taking over Dublin streets.  Permanent gridlock is inevitable unless we raise the game we are playing.  I hope this debate will mark a first step in realising that and doing something about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even before we raise our game we must play the hand we have as well as we can.  It is obvious that we are not doing so at the moment.  Except for Luas little attention has been given to the overall recommendations of the DTI which were presented to us in a balanced package.  The non Luas recommendations are worthwhile and <Col N="1382" /> deserve to be implemented with energy and enthusiasm.  The large, expensive and glamorous has grabbed all the attention and the less glamorous and certainly less expensive projects have become orphans as a result.</P>
    <P>If anybody doubts that there has been a neglect of the non Luas ideas, let me mention quality bus corridors.  After all these years we have only one quality bus corridor in operation.  That hardly reflects a great deal of energy or enthusiasm.  I do not want to be seen as bashing the DTI but the initiative in this area was developed for a Dublin of a different era.  When the DTI report came out about four or five years ago the Celtic tiger was already stalking the streets but few of us realised it then.  Nobody realised the far ranging impact the Celtic tiger would have on the single most critical factor to traffic congestion &mdash; the level of car ownership.</P>
    <P>The explosion in car ownership together with the massive growth in our exports of manufactured goods rapidly created this situation.  It would be ungrateful to bash the DTI for not foreseeing this because we were all blind to it.  In fact, I compliment the DTI in that most of its strategy would still do more good than harm.  For the most part, it put forward good, sensible ideas which we should implement as an immediate stopgap; hence this motion calling to accelerate their implementation.  As I hinted, I see it as a launch pad only.  We will not solve the congestion we face by implementing the DTI proposals alone. These proposals were geared to deal with a situation which is now history.</P>
    <P>To deal properly with today's problems and with tomorrow's, which will be much worse, we need a new approach &mdash; radical thinking firmly based on a farseeing strategy.  Let me briefly explore what that strategy might be.  If we stand back far enough, Dublin's congestion has two main elements &mdash; traffic and the road network to carry that traffic.  Congestion happens when traffic is more than the road network can take. The growth in traffic has swamped the capacity of our network and in the future further growth in car numbers will increase that city traffic in step unless we change the name of the game in a radical way.</P>
    <P>Let us consider how flexible is each of these two key factors.  In one sense, the network is relatively inflexible.  We cannot address this problem with more roads.  The mantra of the 1960s and 1970s was build more roads but we have been there, done that and the scope for building more roads is very slight indeed.  Flexibility in the roads system will come from using the existing network more efficiently &mdash; for example, by using more space for vehicles and less space for stopped cars.</P>
    <P>Much of the present congestion arises because moving cars cannot use the roads properly so it is in our interest to force parked cars off the streets. The more off-street parking the better.  I do not subscribe to the crazy notion that off-street parking adds to the problem.  Off-street parking is part of the solution provided we use that parking to <Col N="1383" /> clear the streets and not only to offer more parking spaces.  By far the best way to use the existing network more efficiently is by increasing the density of people moving along the streets &mdash; in other words, more people per vehicle, and I have seen efforts made to get more people into each vehicle elsewhere.  At one end of the spectrum we have a private vehicle with one person in it while at the other end, a public transport vehicle with 200 people.  Even allowing for the different sized vehicles, the increase in passenger density is enormous. It is obvious that switching people to public transport is the primary way available to increase the efficiency of the road network.  Making that happen is the key to this problem and that is where we have gone wrong.</P>
    <P>Before I go into that, I would like to look at the other major factor in congestion &mdash; the number of vehicles using the streets.  What determines how many vehicles are in the city is how many private cars people own.  The more cars, the more traffic. As the number of cars has exploded so too has the traffic and this trend will continue.  Unless we change the equation, traffic will increase &mdash; although we are still below European levels of car ownership.  Putting these two elements together, we get a dilemma.  The main opportunity to increase capacity in the road system is by shifting people from private to public transport.</P>
    <P>The growth in car ownership has the effect of shifting people in the other direction, that is, using their own cars instead of public transport. The more people use their own cars, the worse the congestion becomes and the less attractive public transport is as an alternative.  If we are honest, we must admit that so far we have failed totally to move people from private to public transport, that nothing on the drawing board so far, including Luas, is remotely likely to cause a major shift in public transport and that our present central strategy of forcing people on to public transport by making their life as motorist hell is doomed to failure.  The psychology of this is simple &mdash; if traffic is hell, people would rather endure it in their own cars than on public transport. At present, travelling by bus is as slow as by car.  It is also less reliable because one does not know when the next bus will arrive.  One quality bus corridor or even a cluster of corridors will not change that.  If one travels by DART at busy times, there is a different type of congestion in the carriage.</P>
    <P>The psychology is simple but it has been completely ignored in traffic planning.  When people own cars, they choose to use them even if it is unpleasant.  We have only to look around to see the immensity of this reality and vision is needed to find a solution to the problem.  This has been lacking up to now.  While our goal of moving people from private to public transport is correct, the ways we have chosen to do it will never produce the desired result.  I ask the nation, the Government, the House and the city to accept my <Col N="1384" /> message that we cannot reach that result from this point.</P>
    <P>However, I suggest something can be done. The problem can be solved but the medicine will be hard to take and the only question is whether we are prepared to take it.  The medicine has two forms.  The first is that public transport is provided which offers a radically better way of getting from A to B to a motoring public that loves its cars.  The second is that it is made significantly more expensive for motorists to use their cars by making them pay for the use of city streets on a pay as you go basis.  I am very brave and courageous to make that suggestion in the city of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The two elements interact and are inseparable. The main precondition for attractive public transport is that it is fast and reliable.  This can only happen if a significant amount of traffic is removed from the streets.  Quality bus corridors will bring us only a tiny part of the way.  A mechanism which would cut the amount of traffic overnight is essential to get public transport to a point where it is an attractive alternative.  The only mechanism that will be effective is road pricing. The technology now exists to charge people for using particular streets or parts of a city.  I was in Singapore in June and I saw this system for the first time.  I understand it is also in operation in Hong Kong and it works.  It is not an untried idea. However, until now in Ireland it has been politically taboo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke) Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>What do they charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the exact charges but high technology is used.  Gadgets in cars are monitored by radio beacons and charges are calculated. The system works but I am not certain of the exact details.</P>
      <P>It is felt that people believe they have a God given right to drive where and when they like at no extra cost.  Our entire traffic strategy is based on that assumption and we see the dreadful consequences. The political taboo on road pricing is a hoary old myth waiting to be punctured.  The country is crying out for a new strategy.  I am certain that people would find a strategy of road pricing in the city centre acceptable.</P>
      <P>However, road pricing on its own is not a solution if no proper alternative to private transport is provided.  If road pricing is introduced, a fast, reliable public transport service to which people can switch must be provided at the same time. Otherwise, the pricing incentive has no effect except to increase the motorist's pain.  The beauty of this approach is that the two aspects complement one another.  Effective road pricing frees up space for public transport to work effectively and at the same time provides money to invest in quality public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More money will be needed despite the welcome investment in buses announced by the Minister at the weekend.  Charging motorists for <Col N="1385" /> the use of roads would be a quantum leap. However, the time has come to give it some consideration. This is what the House should be debating when we talk about traffic.  We should discuss road pricing, not the band aid solutions of light rail lines and quality bus corridors.  I hope I am not being foolhardy in putting forward this suggestion because it is political dynamite. However, it is worthwhile opening the debate.  It is a solution but it will only work if both elements are introduced in tandem.  The private sector should only have to pay if there is also a good, reliable public sector transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>We all agree there is a very serious traffic problem in Dublin and we all have our own methods of dealing with it.  I walk to work and the Garda Síochána has taken to horses. However, others have great problems getting in and out of the city.  While car owners are a serious problem, I must defend them to some extent. Some people must take their cars into town because they need them during the day to travel to work elsewhere.  It is essential that the situation is improved for such people.</P>
      <P>A major feature of the Dublin Transport Initiative is the road building programme.  As Senator Quinn said, it is well under way and it appears the plan will help.  However, if one listens to the AA report on the radio each morning, one would think that the Firhouse roundabout was the centre of the universe because it is mentioned at least three or four times between 7.30 a.m. and 9 a.m. The enthusiasm in that area when the road continues beyond the roundabout will be incredible.</P>
      <P>Roads in Ireland are built at a very slow rate. There are grave difficulties because they are not built on green field sites.  There are long delays with planning permission and obtaining property which may need to be demolished before the road building can go ahead.  I understand that in America roads are built with modern methods at a rate of approximately four miles a day.  How often in Ireland is the lowest tender considered for road building projects without the disruption that may be caused being taken into account?  A low tender may not have the best technology and equipment available and, therefore, work cannot proceed at night because it does not have floodlighting. This involves a cost to the community because modern technology is not used.  A great number of road works close down as soon as it becomes dark.</P>
      <P>If one considers the speed at which the Naas dual carriageway is progressing, the amount of disruption that is being caused and the cost involved, one wonders if there could have been a quicker method of completing the project.  Work on the Balbriggan and Arklow bypasses was much simpler because they involved green field sites.  The roads appeared to progress very rapidly but perhaps there is a need in more congested areas to use more sophisticated contractors to do the work even if the cost is greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> The Minister appeared puzzled when I mentioned the American experience.  A colleague of mine, Professor Frances Ruane, who is Professor of Economics in Trinity College, Dublin, wanted Dublin Corporation to know that the Santa Monica highway in California was rebuilt after the earthquake faster than the corner at the junction of Fitzwilliam Street and Baggot Street was fixed. Even economists are considering this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister announced that more money is to be invested in buses.  Senator Quinn mentioned the bus lanes.  The quality corridor from Lucan is now open and the Malahide corridor is due to open shortly.  However, there are very few buses in the corridors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Senator all about that aspect later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted about that because I carry out a one woman survey of buses.  I walk the route of the No. 10 bus from Nassau Street, up Kildare Street, down Baggot Street and around by Waterloo Road.  This takes me approximately 25 minutes but I do not see any No. 10 buses.  This could be at a time during the day when a bus lane is supposed to be in operation, for example, in the evening when people are going home.  There must be a dreadful backlog somewhere.</P>
      <P>If there are not buses or taxis in the lanes, hackney cabs should be allowed to use them.  This matter probably involves a dispute between taxi and hackney drivers rather than anybody else, but if bus lanes occupy half the road it would be advisable that as many vehicles as possible should be allowed to use them.  It is very disappointing that hackney cabs cannot use bus lanes.  Taxi drivers seem to be at loggerheads with the corporation about the number of plates that should be issued, but there is room for vehicles other than buses or taxis in bus lanes.</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business has discussed deliveries to retail stores. A small retail store can have approximately 150 deliveries per week, which is an incredible amount of traffic through one place.  Centralised distribution will reduce the seriousness of this problem but perhaps deliveries to retail stores should take place outside peak traffic times because they are causing a great deal of disruption on streets, such as Leeson Street, Baggot Street, etc.  where half the road can be taken up by delivery vehicles.</P>
      <P>The suburban rail network is to be maximised. I do not know if the Minister saw &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last night but it was hilarious.</P>

      <P>A film was shown of commuters coming into centre of Dublin from Castleknock in luggage cars.  Those interviewed said that people fainted on occasion; it was ridiculous.  CIE has <Col N="1387" /> said that these carriages are safe but I wonder whether that is so given the number of people who stand in them and have nothing to hold on to, unlike DART carriages.</P>
      <P>Serious consideration must be given to improving these lines.  I am aware the Minister has problems regarding finance and, apparently, all rolling stock is in use.  However, it is obvious commuters would use suburban rail lines in greater numbers if there was a better system.  I do not know why DART platforms have not been lengthened because, apparently, they could take more carriages if necessary.</P>
      <P>The introduction of integrated ticketing is very important.  It could be done in a flash.  I have been in numerous cities where one can buy a ticket which lasts for a number of hours so that one can travel freely.  Bologna is the best example.  The suggestion that 100 per cent tax credit be given to those who purchase annual transport tickets is good.  There is time for the Minister to suggest this before the budget.</P>

      <P>I have reminded the Minister.  It is unsafe for children to walk to school or use cycle lanes and that must be rectified.  I am able to walk around but footpaths need to be repaired to improve safety because many of them are still in a bad condition.  Competitions could be held whereby people would be given lottery tickets for walking the farthest distance.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Quinn that restricted parking has made a huge difference in our locality and clamping has had a miraculous effect in Baggot Street.  Three cars were clamped &mdash; one near Doheny and Nesbitt's, one a little further on and one at Baggot Street bridge &mdash; and the street has been clear since.  If the Minister could introduce integrated ticketing and a 100 per cent tax free allowance for annual ticket purchasers, it would be wonderful and would create more space.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Seanad Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the conclusions of the Transportation Review and Short-Term Action Plan published by the Dublin Transportation Office, supports the early implementation of its recommendations and welcomes the Government's speedy action to put in place necessary capital funding to implement the Plan.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate this issue, which has been provided through the motion tabled by the Independent group.  It is timely and relevant because this subject is on the lips of most Dubliners.  It is increasing in intensity and controversy not just for Dubliners but also for commuters from outside the city.  Nevertheless I support <Col N="1388" /> the amendment despite the terrible gridlock and difficulties on the city streets and the anger and frustration felt by motorists and public transport commuters.</P>
    <P>I heartily endorse the amendment as the only immediate, realistic short-term measure available to the Minister and the Government to tackle this rapidly escalating chaos.  I concur with many of the points raised by Senators Quinn and Henry and, while my analysis is similar to Senator Quinn's and others, I have extreme difficulty with one of the crucial planks of his solution to the problem, which is a road tax for motorists.  He would say that was because it would be politically unpopular but I suspect it would be blatantly unfair and it would discriminate terribly and forcefully against those who must of necessity bring their cars to work.  It would be a marvellous idea if it were possible to be so discriminatory as to identify those who do not have to bring their cars and could justifiably transfer to public transfer but I fear that is not the case based on Senator Quinn's contribution.</P>
    <P>Motorists continue to pay a huge amount of tax in terms of their contribution to the Exchequer. Figures published in last week's newspapers concur and support that fully and to impose additional taxes on motorists who already believe they are overburdened is a pill that would not be too palliative.  I agree with the measures proposed by Senator Henry.  Road works should be confined to off peak periods.  I also suggest to the Minister, and her colleagues with more direct influence in terms of Dublin Port, that it be opened at 5 a.m. and that all commercial vehicles should be barred from city streets between 7.30 a.m. and 10 a.m. That would lead to a significant opening up of the impossible, frightening nightmare gridlock which is contributed to substantially by commercial heavy goods vehicles during peak hours in the inner city.  That proposal merits immediate consideration in addition to those which have been endorsed and funded by the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>I fully support the Government's commitment to the accelerated implementation of the DTO's short-term action plan as an immediate part of a co-ordinated and integrated overall DTI policy. It is the only sensible way forward to take on and address the current nightmare on our streets.  I am satisfied the Minister, her colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, and the Government are fully committed to providing the necessary capital funding to implement the most important elements of the DTO plan as well as the more long-term DTI programme.  I am confident that the Minister will be making announcements tonight which will back up what I am saying.</P>
    <P>The original text of the motion called on the Government to ensure that the new quality bus corridors on approach roads to Dublin actually have buses on them.  The wording suggested a quick fix solution in that if one commandeered a significant number of additional buses and put <Col N="1389" /> them into service, one would significantly address the problems in the short term.  Perhaps I am unfairly misinterpreting that.  However, it would appear from Dublin Bus and independent media surveys that that is not the case because the roads are not ready yet for the additional buses, although they will be shortly.</P>
    <P>Although the motion and the amendment deal specifically with the Dublin traffic problem and I, as a Dublin politician and Member of this House, do not intend to diminish that, it should be remembered that gridlock is not just a recent Dublin phenomenon.  It is a phenomenon which has been occurred increasingly all over the country in recent times.  In fact, there are tailbacks and bumper to bumper problems in nearly every city and town and, in some cases, village around the country.  That is not a palliative for us Dubliners but at least it helps to put the matter in perspective.</P>
    <P>The growth in traffic, which is the fundamental point, associated with strong economic growth and development as well as the phenomenal growth in the population are giving rise to this massive congestion problem.  The problem is particularly acute in Dublin where traffic volumes are now at levels originally projected for the year 2001 and way beyond.  In the case of the morning peak, I am reliably informed that demand for travel in Dublin is now close to the levels projected for 2011.  The inevitable consequence of this increase has caused the present traffic nightmare.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution, particularly in Dublin. All experts agree that the centre of Dublin is guarded by the canals, whose bridges dictate to a huge extent the volume of vehicles which can gain access to the city.  On the main radial routes into the town vehicular traffic consisting of cars in the main has grown by up to 30 per cent in just over three years but increased access over the past 20 years has been as little as 2 to 3 per cent.  That is a frightening disparity.  This inevitably leads us to the conclusion that the only realistic approach in the short term is the accelerated implementation of the DTO's short-term action plan, namely, involving the bus project and the suburban rail, including the DART, project.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to welcome the commitment from the Minister and the Government to provide the necessary funds immediately &mdash; even the reallocation of funds from the Luas &mdash; for the bus project, suburban rail and the DART improvements and extensions.  No doubt when all these improvements come on stream by the year 2000 and the quality bus corridors, on which I did not have an opportunity to comment in detail but with which I am familiar from my local authority work, come on stream, a significant enhancement of the delivery of public service transport will be seen in Dublin.  As a result, no doubt there will be a significant increase in the numbers of people transferring from private cars to a higher quality public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Public Enterprise (Mrs. O'Rourke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senator Quinn and Senator Henry for proposing and seconding the motion and for giving me the opportunity to come here this evening.  As I have told you before, a Chathaoirligh, I always like coming to the Seanad.  I began my political career here and I was glad to do so.</P>
      <P>The debate was good.  I applaud Senator Quinn for his courage in talking about road pricing.  It did not form part of the motion so I know it was his idea.  It certainly would be an innovative way of looking at the matter.  The House will understand that I do not mind talking about roads but roads are not my brief.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, has developed his own strategy and we will work this together.  However, due to the nature of the debate I will be talking about roads as well as public transport.</P>
      <P>We are talking here about road pricing and we are working in the centre of Dublin but are we being hypocritical when we know we have free parking forever in the centre of Dublin?  We talk with vicarious pleasure about those who are clamped every day.  I saw four cars clamped behind the Setanta Centre this evening and they will not be on the street again for a while because £65 is a pretty hefty fine.  However, the measure is working.</P>
      <P>The area at Baggot Street Bridge close to where Senator Henry lives, has been freed up because the clampers have done their work and the illegal car parkers have gone.  As the Senators were speaking and I was thinking about it, I thought of us driving &mdash; although Senator Henry walks here and sometimes I do too &mdash; to the Houses and parking our cars for nothing forever. It bears thinking about.</P>
      <P>We want to get people out of cars and into public transport but there will be much pain in the form of clamping, etc., before that transfer takes place.  Initially when I saw the motion, which made reference to bus corridors and not buses on them, I had a good giggle because that was the situation.  Every Tuesday when we sit about the Cabinet table my colleagues tell me that there are no buses on the bus lanes and I have warned my colleagues that they cannot drive on a bus corridor because that is a sin which will not be entertained. We have taken steps to that end but, of course, I am not supposed to say all this until the Estimates are announced on Wednesday.  As the House will be aware, we received 50 buses from the decommitted Luas, along with other things to which I will refer and the DTI study recommended another 100 buses and so they will be supplied.  That will amount to another 150 buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The quality bus corridors must keep pace with that.  There is only one operational at present and another one is nearly ready.  Senator Henry spoke about them.  The corridor to Lucan is finished and working; the Malahide corridor is almost ready. Senator Quinn referred to the delay in implementing this measure.  Members of the local <Col N="1391" /> authorities will know that the bus corridors are delayed because people have put forward objections. These people must be listened to and brought along.  We just cannot implement this measure without going through due process.  I too sigh every so often because this is taking so long. Now I fear that if the quality bus corridors are not in place, all these new buses will be clogging the ordinary streets so one's last day will be worse than one's first.  The announcement next week of the 150 new buses will mean that there must be an almighty push with the quality bus corridors so that the two can come on stream in tandem.</P>
    <P>The Senator stated that we needed tough measures and I agree.  There will be other measures as well as clamping.  I do not know about road pricing but I will certainly convey what the Deputy said to my colleague, Deputy Dempsey.  Senator Henry defended the use of cars because some people must use them.  We cannot just strip the city of cars, but their use must be measured.</P>
    <P>Road building is slow.  At present work is being done at night but that is to lay telecommunications infrastructures all over the city.</P>
    <P>Tax credits for season ticket holders is a good idea.  I have been thinking about it but I have not conveyed my thoughts yet to anybody because the Finance Bill is some way off.</P>
    <P>Senator Fitzgerald made a comprehensive contribution. Obviously his knowledge of what his local authority is doing has come to the fore.  He considered road pricing unfair but he also said that gridlock is unfair.  It is unfair.  It is interesting to see so many cars with only one occupant.  I am at fault in this regard also.</P>
    <P>I talked to the British Transport Secretary, John Prescott, about this at a meeting of the Council of Transport Ministers.  In the English city of Leicester a copy of an American system of road management has been introduced.  Under this system a car with five occupants uses the fastest lane, a car with four occupants uses the less speedy lane, a car with three occupants uses the next slow lane and so on.  The system is a copy of an American experiment and Mr. Prescott was not sure it was working effectively.  It is extremely complicated to operate.</P>
    <P>Everybody wants to get other people out of their cars but nobody wants to get out of their own car.  It is that type of debate.  There should be a place, but not a dominant place, for the car in the transport system.  There has been progress with road construction.  The northern section of the motorway C ring has been completed and work is now in progress on the Southern Cross route.  More than 60 kilometres of cycle track have been built and there has been significant investment in traffic cells and traffic calming measures.</P>
    <P>The DART extensions to Greystones and Malahide are under construction and will open early next year.  More recently, the director of traffic has introduced wheel clamping and an <Col N="1392" /> improved towaway service.  Operation Freeflow has been a success and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform told me he will reintroduce the annual, more strictly enforced operation on 1 December.  The public hearings process for Luas has commenced and Judge O'Leary is currently taking depositions.</P>
    <P>Members are aware of the important statistics which contribute to the transport problem.  The population has increased dramatically as has employment.  Car ownership has increased drastically while passenger traffic in Dublin Airport has also increased.  These statistics allow us to congratulate ourselves on how well the economy is doing but the other side of that economic success is that peak hour traffic grew by 36 per cent between 1991 and 1997.</P>
    <P>The Senator referred to the lengthening of platforms.  The short-term action plan recommended a range of measures which include the upgrading of the Maynooth to Clonsilla line, improved DART signalling and the lengthening of station platforms.  These will be done between 1999 and 2000 with the decommitted Luas money which must be used in that period.  The action plan also recommended the purchase of additional DART and suburban rail rolling stock, bringing the total on order to 26 DART units and 47 suburban rail cars.</P>
    <P>All but one of the rail measures proposed in the action plan were included in the reallocation of the Luas funding and they will be put in place by the end of 2000.  This involves a total investment of £63 million.  Since the European funding for transport first came on stream in 1994, the EU contributed 65 per cent of it while CIE contributed 35 per cent from its resources.  In 1999 and 2000, the Government will pay the CIE share of the funding.  It is a huge change of policy which I will detail next week when the Estimates are released.  I hope it will free CIE to invest money in response to the safety report recommendations, which I hope to discuss in the House next week.</P>
    <P>Bus Átha Cliath is to acquire 50 additional buses and I expect to be able to make an announcement shortly on funding for another 100 buses.  They will provide 9,500 bus trips in the peak hour.  Hopefully, people will use the buses and the bus lanes will be free.  They will be new, smart buses because that is what is needed.  The action plan made proposals which Bus Átha Cliath itself could act upon.  The company is committed to replacing its old stock with 120 new buses. Over the next two years every bus will be a new bus.  That is an achievement, particularly when one considers the problems caused by the noxious fumes emitted by older types of transport.  Dublin Bus is still in negotiations with its unions about subcontracting school bus services and this would release another 60 buses to meet peak demand.</P>
    <P>Public hearings on the light rail system have commenced.  Today I established a light rail advisory action group which will oversee planning and implementation of the expanded Luas system. <Col N="1393" /> The group is chaired by Padraic White and its members include Donal Mangan, Tom Wall of ICTU, Gerry Duggan of ESB International, Caroline Gill, the Insurance Ombudsman, Oliver O'Connor and Pat Mangan, Assistant Secretary of the Department of Public Enterprise.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Gridlock&rdquo; is a frequently used word to describe traffic in Dublin and other cities.  When I was in Cork during the by-election campaign I travelled on the park and ride facility.  The man in charge said that because of my presence he would give everybody else on the bus a free ticket.  I did not know what to make of that or whether I would be accused of electioneering.  I did not ask him to say it.  In any case, we did not win the election.  The facility is on the north side of the city and it works extremely well.  Two more more park and ride facilities will be introduced for Christmas, one at Whitehall and one at Finglas.  Passengers can park their cars and get the bus into the city to do their shopping.</P>
    <P>In Cork I met the unions and management involved in Cork transport.  They are extremely dedicated and committed to working the system. Their last plan was successful and they are currently working on a new plan which they will bring to me shortly.  Other cities, such as Waterford and Limerick, are involved in similar work.</P>
    <P>If we can survive the pain of the change and implement these measures it will be worthwhile. The 150 new buses will come on stream at a rate of a certain number per month.  Obviously the order must be placed next week and buses cannot simply be taken off a shelf.  They must be manufactured. I look forward to seeing these buses being used by the public on the quality bus corridors. Hopefully, the many bright new buses packed with fare paying passengers will help the transport situation.</P>
    <P>People will not leave their cars unless they are sure of getting a bus or the DART or the Luas when it is available.  They will decide to struggle on in the car and to get up an hour earlier each morning.  As time passes they get up progressively earlier each morning to get into the city before everybody else.  However, everybody else is getting up earlier too, which results in a cycle of reactions to beat the clock.</P>
    <P>I appreciate Senator Quinn altering the wording of the motion.  I had a good giggle when I read it because it was what I was hearing every Tuesday at the Cabinet table.  Ministers saw bus corridors with nothing on them.  I thank the Senator for altering the motion to render it a little smoother.  However, I accept his point.  I will see what comes of the Senator's road pricing suggestion. The availability of an alternative to road transport is clearly our objective.</P>
    <P>Next year there will be an increase in bus traffic in the major cities due to the increased allocation of buses provided by the Government. The decommitted Luas funding will secure the upgrading of the Maynooth to Clonsilla line, the lengthening of the station platforms, the provision of more DART and suburban rail carriages <Col N="1394" /> and the opening of the new DART stations at Greystones and Malahide.  These developments will make a difference.</P>
    <P>I am aware of Senator Ridge's interest in the railway station in Adamstown.  A group of concerned commuters approached me in connection with the opening of the railway station at Adamstown and I informed them that Senator Ridge raised the matter in the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Luckily we are getting this provision for next year but it will only keep pace with the increased usage of the roads.  An old city such as Dublin with many narrow streets was not constructed to cope with the present volume of people, cars and buses.  All parties agree that more public transport is needed.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the fact that Dublin is a very old city with narrow streets. Poor old Molly Malone would not be able to wheel her wheel barrow through streets broad and narrow because there would be no room for her.  I do not take the Bernie Malone stance that Dublin is my city; it is not owned by anyone. Unfortunately we are all affected by this escalating traffic problem.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob, is weary, as we all are, of having to leave home two hours earlier than is necessary to reach our destinations.  I had a terrible experience recently trying to get to Blackrock. I thought I would be clever and travel through the suburbs.  My appointment was for 8.30 and I arrived at 9.30 having left home at 7.30. That taught me a lesson to stay on the main routes in future.</P>
      <P>We are discussing the provision of public transport, in particular buses, bus lanes and the lack of buses for the bus lanes.  I was pleased to hear the Minister announce the provision of an extra 150 buses.  This number was not certain until today.  She mentioned that 150 buses are not acquired in the same way as the weekly shopping. My information is that the buses will be introduced at the rate of ten per month.  I am not sure that the year 2000 is a realistic timescale for the introduction of 12 bus lanes given that it has taken five years to introduce one bus lane.  Consultations with residents and traders should have taken place before the plans were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the Irish motor industry has been very successful in the sale of new cars.  Yesterday a spokesman for the industry said that they had expected a decrease in sales. However, the figures have increased and this is a great tribute to past and present Governments. As a young person I believed I would never own a car.  Now I find the desire to own a car being <Col N="1395" /> rapidly replaced by the desire to access public transport.  Driving is no longer pleasant unless one is lucky enough to come from a rural area and travel on the by-passes being constructed around the country.  Driving in Dublin is horrendous. Last week the <i>Evening Herald</i> newspaper reported that the Dublin city marathon was run in approximately two hours 20 minutes.  An ordinary car drove the same route and I do not need to tell Senators who came first.  I appreciate we are not all runners but something is terribly wrong when a car takes as long as a runner to reach its destination.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the steering committee of the DTO.  The action plan for the DTO made these suggestions.  I agree with Senator Fitzgerald that no one foresaw the present increase in car ownership.  We must all share some of the blame in this regard.  Some families with young adults living at home now have four cars where at one time there was one car, usually a second-hand banger.  I attended a transport conference in Italy recently and they have small electric-powered environmentally friendly two-seater cars.  They even have single-seater cars that are no wider than a narrow motorcycle.  They can travel at 40 m.p.h. and take up no more space than the width of bicycle handlebars.  It is not a Rolls Royce but there is room to carry shopping or a briefcase. This type of transport should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bus needs more money to replace its fleet.  However, this will take a long time to achieve.  In 1986 Dublin Bus was allocated £15.5 million and this year it was allocated only £7 million.  I do not think the Minister is being realistic about improving the service while leaving Dublin Bus to raise its own finances.  That is not a realistic approach to ensuring a quality bus service.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I long not to be in a car.  There are days when you see a walker, whom you passed half an hour earlier, arriving before you.  All the initiatives should be considered.  No one wants to travel on buses and trains which are in such a poor state of repair.  Senator Henry described a television programme where the commuters from Castleknock were herded into a luggage van. They travel like that regularly.  There is no point waiting for a bus if you are midway between the outer suburbs and the city because it will be full by the time it arrives.  You will stay in your car, suffer the gridlock and the fumes and spend up to an hour looking for a parking space.  We are lucky that we have parking spaces here.  We are all of the opinion that this problem must be solved.  There is no point in apportioning blame but Dublin Bus is not well enough funded to do the job we ask it to do.</P>

      <Col N="1396" /> D'fhág mé mo theach cónaithe ar maidin ar fiche nóiméad chun a hocht agus shroich mé an ostán nua, Ostán Westpark, ar Bhóthar Nás na Rí amach timpeall deich nóiméad tar éis a naoi i ndiaidh 80 míle a thaisteal in uair go leith.  Bhí ocht míle le taisteal agam go dtí Teach Laighean ach níor shroich mé í go dtí cúig nóiméad chun a deich, 45 noiméad tar éis sin.  Ní bheadh éinne sásta leis sin.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be complimented on taking the initiative.  In my opinion she has taken control of a situation which should have been taken more seriously 20 years ago.  When you travel 80 miles in an hour and a half and then spend three quarters of an hour travelling eight miles, it defeats the purpose of the huge investment in improving the road infrastructure throughout the State.  Upgrading roads to motorway and dual carriageway standard is meaningless if there is then a bottleneck in Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is much to be done in this regard.  There is no single solution.  This report lays out a framework and if pursued with commitment it will improve the situation over time.  The quality of the bus corridors has been outlined by a number of speakers.  There is a need for such corridors and everyone welcomes the significant investment which is to be made in rolling stock in buses. The Minister understated the improvement which is likely to take place.  There are to be 110 new buses immediately, 50 of which are funded by the Minister, and a further 100 will follow after that, a total of 210 buses.  Obviously that is overdue.</P>
    <P>Investment in suburban rail is also long overdue. One hopes that Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann will rise to the challenge.  While I was travelling this morning I listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and one caller complained about delays at a station where a train scheduled to leave at 8.04 a.m. consistently over the last two months left up to 40 minutes late.  A service will not attract customers without quality.  I have raised this before but I have a fear that, given the past performance of CIE, Iarnród Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath, one could not be overcome with a great degree of confidence in their ability to deliver the quality of service essential to change people's habits.</P>
    <P>Senator Quinn outlined the necessity of the change from driving our own cars to using public transport.  There are ways to do this, including, as he mentioned, introducing disincentives for people to use their cars.  In tandem with any initiative taken must be a proper, efficient and upgraded public transport system upon which people can rely.  Anyone trying to get to work cannot afford to hang around at bus stops or train stations for 30 minutes past the time the vehicle is due to arrive.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a change in the culture of public transport management if improvement is to be achieved.  I would like to see competition. That is the yardstick and motivation for quality improvement in any service.  How that is to be achieved I do not know, but generating some <Col N="1397" /> element of competition into the Dublin transport system would be desirable and would provide a means to improve the existing system.</P>
    <P>The statistics are startling.  Public transport accounts for 50 per cent of the people transported in Dublin &mdash; a surprising level &mdash; but buses only account for 3 per cent of the vehicles on the street.  Cars account for 30 per cent of vehicles but a much lower ratio of the people travelling. The shift will require imaginative and innovative implementation.</P>
    <P>I do not disagree that people should pay for the miles travelled.  That would discourage people from using their cars.  I have, however, sympathy with the remarks made by Senator Fitzgerald. The motorist in this State is heavily taxed.  One of the benefits many people expected from our membership of the European Union was the harmonisation of motor taxation.  The vehicle registration tax overcame the Exchequer's difficulties with losing the revenue but did nothing to assist the motorist to find a more economic mode of transport.  If we are trying to reduce the number of miles driven, reducing tax might fly in the face of that but could be effective if the disincentive mentioned by Senator Quinn were introduced in tandem.  It could be coupled with adjustments elsewhere in motor taxation.  The take from the motorist could be reduced in one area and then the person who decides to use public transport could be rewarded.</P>
    <P>The increased number of taxis in Dublin is to be welcomed.  If you travel to other countries you are often impressed by the quality of the taxis. They are clean and in good condition.  It is hard to say the same of the Dublin taxis.  I drove behind one today, and although my own car was filthy and I was in no position to criticise, his car was at least as bad as mine.  If you are selling a service and trying to attract people, presentation is important.  Many cities have very distinctive taxis.  It would assist the process if an initiative was taken so that we have distinctive taxis which are well maintained, well presented, efficient and provide a better service than at present.  The number of taxis is the problem and some liberalisation is required.</P>
    <P>Some 5 per cent of people travel by bicycle. This is a fairly significant figure and higher than I anticipated.  Dublin is a fairly level city like much of Holland.  If we adopted the same propensity as the Dutch it would encourage many people to use bicycles.  People are health conscious and cycling would enable them to get around the city more speedily.  Much infrastructural investment is required.  A start has been made which must now be accelerated.  I compliment the Minister on the initiatives she has taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a mere citizen of Cork I probably should not be involved in this debate.  However, as I have criticised colleagues for turning the House into a greater Dublin county council by regularly complaining about the traffic, I should at least participate in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> There are short term details and fundamental questions involved in the issue of transport.  It is a profound issue in terms of the environment. Transport emissions are contributing to global warming, as is becoming more evident by storms which are causing damage on an unimagined scale.  Because transport is the cause of so much greenhouse emissions, I am glad that, for the first time in ten years, the rigid ideology of the Department of Finance has been got at and the State is funding some of the cost of the new buses and rolling stock for Bus Éireann.</P>
    <P>Like every other public service, public transport should be run to the same standards as those adopted by providers of other customer related services, such as those provided by Senator Quinn.  There are enormous external issues involved in private transport which make it appear cheap and make public transport appear expensive because the State has to provide the subsidy.  We have the least subsidised public transport system in Europe.  We will not get a good public transport system until we move away from the ideological fixation which demands that it should come close to paying for itself, and the use of criteria which do not include the contribution made by public transport to environmental and social quality.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with charging for road usage, increasing the price of hydrocarbon fuels or redistributing excise duties on cars in favour of those which are more environmentally acceptable. I have no problem with any scheme of incentives which encourage people to use public transport.  However, we must accept that no country has succeeded in running a good public transport system which is not heavily subsidised.</P>
    <P>I travelled around poor, impoverished Lisbon last week on a daily ticket which cost £1.  This allowed me to travel as often as I wished on the quite extensive and growing metro in that impoverished city.  The £1 fee is nothing like the commercial cost.  The benefit of the system is a considerably reduced level of traffic in Lisbon.  It also benefits the significant proportion of the population which cannot afford a car and who hopefully, as affluence grows, will be discouraged from using cars by the availability of a very good public transport system.  Unfortunately, we have to catch up with such a system but we will not do so if we only respond by occasional measures.  We have to accept that public transport is a public good which needs to be provided for from public moneys.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the fact that transport systems are publicly owned has become an excuse for complacency on the part of management and staff.  We need very rigid criteria for efficiency, performance and customer service.  Senator Quill may confirm that we have not got such standards yet.  What is supposed to be the country's premier train service between Cork and Dublin is going backwards.  It is inevitable that this will happen as the average age of the locomotives is 23 years and the average age of rolling stock is 13 years.  These <Col N="1399" /> vehicles get old like the rest of us and break down more often just as we do.  There is no way around this problem unless money is invested.  It is not long since we had a school of economics which wanted to close all railways.  We must be wary of those who look at limited perspectives.</P>
    <P>There are a number of shorter term issues which I am not sure we are yet addressing. Between July and September, the traffic situation deteriorated spectacularly in the part of Cork in which Senator Quill and I live.  Delays increased by up to 40 per cent.  This continued for six weeks until continuing protests led to Garda intervention. I do not blame the Garda as they can only take such measures when told to do so.  The situation has now returned to something approaching order.</P>
    <P>There is a difference between gridlock and traffic which moves excessively slowly.  Gridlock is caused by those who insist on driving across junctions for which they are not penalised.  It is also caused by people who park vehicles in such a way as to close a traffic lane.  It is caused by people who decide that in principle they are in favour of measures to improve the situation, but their business is so important that no one will mind if they leave their hazard lights flashing, even though they have blocked an entire lane of traffic.</P>
    <P>One lane of MacCurtain Street in Cork is permanently blocked.  In spite of the vigilance of a garda and a traffic warden, it is blocked for half the clearway period.  We have to enforce existing regulations.  This will not solve the problem.  Having driven into Dublin during the rush hour, I know that the reason traffic stops is because people block junctions, entrances and exits.</P>
    <P>Car ownership rates in Dublin are now 20 per cent higher than was forecast for three years' time.  Dublin port is handling twice as much traffic as forecast for three years time.  I am very enthusiastic about the middle and long-term plans, but we must regulate the situation which now exists.  This means providing extra funding to ensure that there are more traffic police available to enforce the law and to ensure that people observe the rules.  John Maynard Keynes said that in the long term we will all be dead.  We might be dead sooner because of the traffic.  We need to invest resources to regulate the existing traffic.  As was shown in Cork, this can make an enormous difference but it costs money and personnel.  We will have to spend the money to make an unsatisfactory situation a little less unpleasant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to take part in this debate and I commend Senator Quinn for introducing this subject.  I enjoyed listening to his elegantly crafted presentation at the outset of the debate.  I beg his forgiveness if I seek to broaden the debate and speak about public transport issues in general terms.  The problems he raised in regard to Dublin are experienced in every other city in this <Col N="1400" /> country, the only difference being the degree and scale of the problem.</P>
      <P>The Government must seek to confront and surmount the challenge of providing a proper public transport system.  Unless that happens, excessive motor car use and all its associated problems will persist.  It has been said time and again that people will not make the switch from private cars to public transport unless they can be guaranteed a reliable, clean and efficient service. If we can provide that kind of transport, we can justifiably go to the motorists and present them with an alternative.  We will then be justified in introducing any system of incentive or disincentive to take the huge numbers of private cars off our city streets.  Unless and until a viable alternative is available, we cannot do that.</P>
      <P>I have a great grá for railways and great respect for the Victorians who gave us such a fine network of rail lines and architecturally wondrous railway station buildings.  One of the major mistakes made since we gained independence was the closure of many branch rail lines.  Sleepers were taken up and clever farmers extended their fields over what were once railway tracks.  We should have had the vision to keep the railway network intact and left the possibility for a future generation with a different view on public transport to reopen the lines.</P>
      <P>With a few exceptions, principally on the intercity services, our public transport system has the neglected look of a Third World country.  People regard the Irish as a clever and intelligent people, yet they see our failure to implement and maintain a public transport system which keeps apace with developments in every other arm of the public service.  Telecom and other public bodies have improved their services, yet CIE and Bus Éireann seem to be stuck in a groove, gridlocked in their own minds.</P>
      <P>I travelled to Cork last Friday week to attend the by-election.  I had a quick cup of coffee in Buswells prior to getting my taxi to the station.  I had intended to have my breakfast on the train but half an hour after boarding, it was announced there was no dining car service on the train due to a shortage of staff.  In a country with approximately 9 per cent unemployment, this was unbelievable. Passengers, tourists among them, were filled with puzzlement.  That was bad management. A casual approach seems to have built up in regard to the transport system which I wish we could break free of.</P>
      <P>Not alone do we require massive new investment, we also require a change of attitude.  We need to put in place a quality service which is consumer-driven so that it will become smart and civic minded to travel by bus and train.  People could be proud to travel on clean and efficient public transport.  There must be a change in attitude on the part of the providers of public transport, as well as on the part of commuters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During school mid-term breaks I visited many cities which had fantastic tram services, cities whose GDP would only be a fraction of ours.  The <Col N="1401" /> various elements of public transport were linked together and it was possible to purchase a ticket at one's hotel or at a shop which took one from the tram to the underground and so on.  Because the service was efficient, people used it and the streets were not clogged with gridlocked traffic and polluted with car exhaust emissions.  There was a definite quality of life.  I am putting that idea forward not just as an aspiration but as a challenge which we, as a country, have the capacity to grasp.</P>
    <P>Putting a bus corridor here and there will not change anything.  There must be radical investment in the provision of proper public transport and a change in attitude.  In recent years in Cork, a park and ride system was introduced at Christmas to prevent our city centre streets from becoming clogged.  Parking space is provided at the entrance to the city in the west and a bus picks up passengers and transports them around the city for a standard fare of one pound, less than it costs to park a car for a couple of hours in the city.  That demonstrates that if a service is satisfactory and efficient, people will use it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator Quinn on tabling this motion.  Although I welcome the announcement of increased investment in public transport, the Minister's speech was inadequate in many ways.  There is no new thinking on transport policy, nor is there reference to using modern methods of communication to help people work at home.  Thousands of people clog up the motorways and public transport system every day of the week travelling to work in Dublin, Cork and other cities.  Many of those people could work at home as the first thing most of them do on reaching the workplace is switch on their computer. Modern technology and communications allow people to work from their homes and thousands could be working from remote locations. The Government has not addressed the matter in the debate.  There should be a very practical, realistic, pragmatic policy to encourage people to work at home, with tax incentives for companies to get employees to work from home.  There should be a dynamic within the Civil Service to encourage people to work at home through the use of modern technology and communication. They would be very happy to do so and our roads would have far fewer people on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area where the Government is lacking input is in getting people to work flexi-time in their workplaces.  The biggest problem is peak traffic hours, but these could be staggered if the time people come and go from work was staggered. In private enterprise there is much staggering of work times and there may well be examples of it in the Civil Service.  However, I have personal experience of one tax office which closes at lunch hour.  I would like to see much more dynamic action in the Civil Service in terms of flexi-time, with people coming to work early in the morning and working late in the evening.  This is what is required to break the gridlock.  Gridlock <Col N="1402" /> exists because everybody wants to get to work at 9 o'clock and get home at 5.  30 p.m. or 6 o'clock.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy towards investment in the regions is inadequate.  There is no policy of radical investment in the regions and to stop Dublin growing day after day, week after week, month after month.  We must spread our investments in industry and business and bring investment away from the Dublin region which can take no more people.  It cannot house those on the housing list and people cannot buy houses privately in the city.  The Government must encourage investment by companies in counties outside Dublin.  Counties such as Louth would be very happy to welcome such investment.  Five hundred new jobs in Dublin city means 500 more people clogging up the motorways.  However, there will not be the same impact on public transport and the motorways will not be clogged if the jobs are located in Drogheda, Dundalk, Mullingar, Athlone, Donegal, Tralee, etc.</P>
    <P>There are clear directions in which the Government has not yet moved.  It is time the Government got its act together and examined other ways of ending traffic jams and gridlocks.  Throwing money into Dublin is part of the answer but it is not the only answer.</P>
    <P>People are shifting their method of transport from private cars to railways.  I wish to acknowledge in particular the commitment of Iarnród Éireann to changing things.  It can only work with the tools it has and the money it is given.  I know the people in Iarnród Éireann are honourable and forward thinking.  However, the reality is that hundreds of people are standing on trains from Pearse Street to Balbriggan every day of the week as there is nowhere for them to sit.  I wonder why this is happening.  I welcome the fact the Minister is putting more money into rail transport, but the reality is that people are shifting everyday from private cars to public transport which is totally inadequate and downright dangerous.  If a train travelling from Drogheda to Dublin has an accident hundreds of people will be killed as an alarming number of passengers stand all the way.</P>
    <P>Trains are delayed at mainline stations because people are being packed into them.  We may not like this but it is the reality.  People can go and see this for themselves.  There is no point in being an armchair politician.  The situation must change immediately.  I welcome the increased investment in rolling stock.  People from my town who are coming to meet me tonight will spend over two hours on the road because traffic is chaotic.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment of the Government to park and ride facilities at locations outside the city.  It makes sense to have 1,000 cars stopping, for example, at Whitehall with people using the quality bus corridor to get to the city.  This makes sense and is good and positive.  However, the backlog every morning from Murtagh's pub in Lusk on the main Dublin-Belfast road right into Swords is not positive.  It is absolute madness that every week morning there is gridlock from 7.30 a.m. and that must change.  The Government <Col N="1403" /> must do its homework properly.  While I welcome the improvements, the public is very unhappy and they want change now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment which notes the conclusions of the transportation review and short term action plan published by the Dublin Transportation Office, supports the early implementation of its recommendations and welcomes the Government's speedy action to put in place necessary capital funding to implement the plan.  I also welcome Senator Quinn's thrust in bringing this before the House.  It is timely that we are discussing the motion prior to the budget.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a few short constructive comments. I welcome the news from the Minister that 150 new buses will be in place in Dublin in a very short time and that 60 new buses have been ordered by Dublin Bus.  I also note that the rail safety report was published in recent days.  It is my intention to have statements and a debate on this report within the next ten days.  It is something which must be discussed and on which we can make an enormous amount of progress.</P>
      <P>For 11 years I was the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on transport, energy and communications in the Seanad and I have done an enormous amount of research, particularly in Europe.  I was most impressed by the French rail system which is reliable, comfortable and safe.  This is what we are all looking for in an alternative means of transport.  As many speakers have said, much can be achieved on the roads through the great progress which has been made by the National Roads Authority and the investment made by former Taoisigh &mdash; I recall former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, returning with £8 billion from Edinburgh.  Those responsible for bringing in the money we have received from the EU are to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>For well over 14 years I travelled 60,000 miles per year as part of my livelihood and I know what the roads were like through the years.  I do not need anybody to lecture me on this matter as I know exactly what I am talking about.  However, I have also been to 27 countries and have seen how they have coped.  In many countries people have to wait quite a bit longer than we do to get to work in their capital cities.  It is not good enough, but it is happening in countries which are supposed to be prosperous and which have had civilisation, education and independence for centuries.</P>
      <P>The big problem created by the Celtic tiger is the enormous increase in transportation.  There has been an increase of 6 per cent per annum in the purchase and ownership of vehicles over the past seven years, resulting in 50 per cent more vehicles on the roads in a short period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commute between Dublin and Castlepollard every day.  In Boston there is a system where, in the morning, three lanes of four lane roads are used by traffic going to the city with one lane being used by traffic leaving the city.  In the afternoon <Col N="1404" /> three lanes are used for traffic leaving the city and one for traffic going in.  I have costed this bollard system and the wages of fewer than ten people could pay for it.  Workers in teams of two could change these bollards in an hour on all major routes into the city.  If this was implemented on a pilot basis from now until Christmas it could transform every city in Ireland. There is not that much traffic using the roads in and out of our cities, but management of that traffic does not seem to exist.</P>
    <P>Another option is the San Diego system, where three road lanes are used.  The inside lane is the slow lane and is for cars with one passenger.  The middle lane is for cars with two passengers and cars move slightly faster.  The fast lane is the outside one, but one needs more than two passengers to use it.  That system is reversed in the evening. There is no traffic gridlock in San Diego although there are more people living there than in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Let us have some common sense.  We do not have money to throw around just because of the Celtic tiger.  We should be reducing the national debt and looking after the underprivileged.  All of us who have cars are slightly privileged.  We do not need to send people to other cities to see how they deal with their traffic.  A common sense approach should be applied immediately.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to discuss with our city authorities the possibility of introducing this scheme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the thrust of this motion.  We will have statements on rail safety soon, and we can discuss what can be done for the Mullingar-Sligo and Mullingar-Westport lines, which are in urgent need of upgrading.  We must spend our money on the rail lines and work on the roads in the long term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Senator Quinn on this motion.  It is a timely debate as Dublin is paralysed for considerable periods every day by traffic chaos.  This sours people's minds, damages their health and undermines business.  The nation cannot afford it and it is hindering the development of the city of Dublin.  Dublin City Council discussed this matter last Monday and concluded that the Minister for Public Enterprise and the National Roads Authority had far more authority and power to deal with Dublin's traffic than the councillors or Dublin Corporation itself.</P>
      <P>It has been said that we have brought in quality bus corridors but that we do not have buses for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonnieCassidyFF" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a bit like asking how the figs are put into the fig roll.  The work Dublin Corporation is doing is very desirable, and the Minister's speech was excellent.  The Dublin Transport Initiative and Dublin Transportation Office are also doing good work.  The transportation review and the short-term action plan cannot be faulted. However, the problem is not going to lessen and <Col N="1405" /> the millennium will be well upon us before we are likely to see any change.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation is desperately trying to do something about traffic in as far as it can within its remit.  It has put in two quality bus corridors and there will be ten in all&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is functioning, though it is not finished.  One might say the Navan Road is not finished either, but it is open.  The problem is that it has been impossible to create a model by taking one quality bus corridor, and, through trial and error, determine the best way of dealing with the situation.  The quality bus corridor on the Navan Road, for example, has reduced the laneways.  It is now more difficult for commuter traffic to come in and there is a bigger pile up all the way out to Blanchardstown.  People are finding it impossible to get out of neighbouring estates and onto the road, and there will be more road rage in the future.  Dublin Corporation is doing this with the intention of providing better public transport, but it needs buses urgently.  I am glad the Minister is going to provide buses, as they are badly needed, but that is just one area.</P>
      <P>We have introduced clamping and towing of vehicles in the city centre, which are proving tremendously effective.  There are some hiccups in city centre areas where there are a lot of hotels and guesthouses, as no doubt Senator Cassidy will be aware.  People having breakfast at 8 a.m. on Saturday can find that their car has disappeared from in front of their guesthouse because clamping begins at 7 a.m. The service has eased progress through the heart of the city.  Cycle lanes are being introduced and we are also grasping the nettle regarding the taxi issue.  A huge number of new hackney licences have been given out, and, as was announced on the news yesterday, 300 more taxi licences will be given out this year, with 300 more to be given out in the next three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dublin Corporation has done all of this to clear the clogged streets, but it has no power to determine the full package of proposals and has no authority over the Luas project.  That is dealt with by ministerial order, the Minister deals with the matter.  The corporation has no authority over the port tunnels projects either, so these matters are out of the hands of the elected city councillors and the city manager, who have direct responsibility for the running of the city.  We urgently need to complete the eastern by-pass on the south side as there is little sense in having a port relief tunnel if we have not dealt adequately with traffic beyond that.  We must continue this by-pass to the south side and finish the C ring around Dublin so that it becomes a D ring.  There are no plans for <Col N="1406" /> that so it is not likely to take place, though we on the city council want to initiate it.</P>
    <P>We also need a Liffey tunnel from Heuston Station to the port.  Traffic coming into the port from Whitehall and the Swords road should be allowed quick access to the south and west of the city.  That traffic could pick up the motorway by Heuston and head for the Chapelizod by-pass. These areas must be addressed.</P>
    <P>We should also have authority to regulate the city's activities.  The city is a huge buzzing area with 1.25 million people living here.  There are vast members of people coming in to schools, offices, industries and businesses in the city.  Why should we not have the authority to stagger that huge mass of people who arrive at the same time every morning?  Everything in Dublin starts at 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m. &mdash; nothing starts at 8 a.m., 8.30 a.m. or 10 a.m. Anyone driving in the city last week when the schools were on holidays would have noticed how easy it was to get through the city.</P>
    <P>No matter how welcome the plans are, we will not have the necessary infrastructure &mdash; the Luas, the port tunnel or the quality bus corridors &mdash; ready in the short term.  We need a full package to manage the existing situation.  There is no reason we cannot manage it more effectively.  I do not see why the schools could not be given a choice between starting at 8 a.m. or 10 a.m. or why businesses could not be given a choice of starting between 8.30 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. There is no reason we could not decide that odd and even registration numbers should come into the city on different days of the week.  There will always be too much traffic in the city of Dublin because of the way the city has developed.  Most of the people migrating back to Ireland are lodging in Dublin or its vicinities.</P>
    <P>We must manage the existing situation much better in addition to our plans for the future.  If we are to be serious about this we must give a proper subsidy to public transport.  Dublin is at the bottom of the European league on public transport subsidies by national government &mdash; it is the 51st of 52 European cities, many of which are regional rather than capital cities.  Dublin is the capital city and must be taken seriously.  Far greater powers should be given to Dublin Corporation to regulate Dublin's traffic.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  I had experience on one occasion of being in a people jam, rather than a traffic jam, in Sao Paulo.  The police had to come because we were so jammed in that there could be no movement on the street &mdash; it was like coming out of a football match.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I tabled this motion, on which I appreciate the input of so many speakers, is that I believe we are in danger of taking too short term a view.  There is a very good document called the Short Term Action Plan by the Dublin Transportation Office; however, it is short-term rather than long term.  Some of the words I have <Col N="1407" /> heard tonight concern me because I fear we are still taking that short term view and there is a danger of us being accused of being ostriches.  We are burying our heads in the sand and hoping this problem will go away as a result of some of our tinkering &mdash; I used the term &ldquo;band aid&rdquo;.  We must be quite courageous on this occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Economist</i> devoted 17 pages in early September to an article on gridlock around the world.  It examined cities such as Mexico City, Sao Paulo, Kuala Lumpur and Atlanta and said they had become gridlocked because they had not taken action.  It then examined some other cities and said they had succeeded.  The Leader of the House referred to San Diego, which may have been one of them.</P>
    <P>I tabled this motion in order to open the debate on road pricing.  <i>The Economist</i> took the example of Singapore, a city I visited not so long ago.  The Minister, Deputy O'Rourke, asked me to describe how road pricing operates there.  I was not able to answer offhand but I now have the answer with me.  The article states:</P>
    <P>Every car in Singapore now has a small transponder installed just behind the windscreen, designed to hold the driver's pre-paid cash card.  Since April, motorists using the East Coast Parkway in the morning rush are debited with a toll as they pass beneath electronic gantries: S$2 between 8 a.m. and 9 a.m. and S$1 just before and after the peak period.  The rest of the day is free.</P>
    <P>That is quite clever.  It is not disastrous and it encourages people to do exactly what Senator Costello talked about, which is to come earlier or later into the city.  It does not need the Government to tell people they must go to work early or late.</P>
    <P>Senator Walsh spoke about the possibility of using this money to reduce motor taxation.  It would certainly help to restore the balance about which so many Senators spoke.  Senator Quill spoke about the need for a good public transport system.  If we establish a good public transport system and, at the same time, create a deterrent against coming into the city at peak times, we will achieve that balance.  There would be a disincentive to use cars and an incentive to use buses because the traffic would be moving as a result. As Senator Fitzgerald said, a bus carries hundreds of people but it is possible for a car to carry only one person &mdash; there is no comparison.</P>
    <P>Senator Cassidy spoke about San Diego and the one, two and three bus lanes.  Those are great ideas but it is not possible to do that on most Dublin approach roads and we cannot build new roads.  We cannot do any more than tinker with the existing situation.</P>
    <P>I fear we are adopting the ostrich approach and are tinkering with rather than solving the problem. We have seen other cities fall down in this regard.  I am disappointed the Government has tabled an amendment to the motion because I <Col N="1408" /> think the original motion is worthy of support. I welcome the recently announced investment in public transport for Dublin.  I urge the Minister to accelerate the process.  I thought the motion was worthy of support and that I had worded it so that there would not be an amendment.  Perhaps the Leader will consider not pressing the amendment because I would hate to see it go through.</P>
    <P>I will give another instance of why I am concerned. I had a visitor to Dublin the week before last.  He came to Dublin to visit hotels because he was considering the possibility of holding a convention here in June 2000.  I think we lost that convention of 1,500 people for two reasons: first, he was jammed in traffic and asked me if this was how we live, and, second, he could not get a taxi because there were not enough taxis around.  It is not only in our own interest as citizens to ensure our capital is a city which works, but it is also our responsibility as legislators.</P>
    <P>When the question of toll bridges arose none of us would have said we should have to pay to use bridges.  However, look at what has happened. The East Link and the West Link toll bridges are busy because people have a choice &mdash; they can go another way for free but they opt to pay 60p or 80p to use the toll bridge because it pays them to so do.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the Government to note the words spoken here tonight by so many Senators and I appreciate their input.  We should grasp this nettle very soon.  We have very good short-term measures, on which I compliment the Government.  However, instead of taking band aid approaches we must take the long-term approach of facing up to the problem and recognising that we can become a city in which the traffic works rather than one with gridlock.  I want to ensure Dubliners do not face gridlock in the new millennium but we must take immediate action if we are to solve this problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and how we will administer and operate it once it is up and running.  The Minister of State will know the background and the amount of money the Government has very generously made available to deal with drug abuse and young people at risk. By and large, the money will be channelled back into disadvantaged areas under a number projects. Various committees, particularly local <Col N="1409" /> development committees, and groups have been trying to put together projects.</P>
      <P>There has been much interaction with the City of Dublin VEC in relation to the work being done in Dublin and also with the local partnerships in terms of looking at projects and consulting with people to come up with the best submissions. Most of that work has been done under the aegis of the development groups, the submissions have been presented to the national assessment committee and work is being finalised.</P>
      <P>The question which remains is, what criteria will be used to distribute the funds to the various groups?  That is an important question because obviously there will be a far greater number of bodies and individuals looking for funding than is available to be spread around.  Once the distribution takes place, how will we assess and evaluate its implementation and use?  What support mechanisms will be put in place to ensure people who will operate in a voluntary capacity have a degree of professional expertise to back them up and to ensure those in a supervisory role spend the money properly?  In the context of the European Union, the question of accountability arises. Accounts will have to be presented and properly audited returns will have to be made indicating where the money has been spent.  As I said, most of the services about which are talking will be in the area of youth and, by and large, in the backstops &mdash; the deprived and disadvantaged areas in the city.</P>
      <P>Clearly some support structure is required.  The obvious support, monitoring and accounting structure is the vocational education committees because they have a particular role in relation to the youth services board, Comhairle Le Leas Óige, the body which has been doing most of the work to date.  It is a body with a particular remit as regards the provision of grants and services, particularly to young people at risk, in the areas of leisure and recreation.  If this is the case, and it would be desirable because it has the network in place, adequate resources should be given to it.  It should not be expected to go into the breach without extra personnel and financial resources.</P>
      <P>We will have to monitor the implementation of the fund and how money is spent.  Accounting can be a very tedious and time consuming function but an important one but it is now essential given what is required of us by the European Union.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister of State's thinking on the appropriate body, whether the vocational education committees or the partnerships?  Who will be responsible for the operation and supervision of the funds and who will be accountable?  How does the Minister intend to go about this?  Does he plan to provide extra staff and resources to enable this to be done properly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy) Frank Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Mr. Treacy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Senator has raised this matter as it gives me an opportunity to explain the position as regards the <Col N="1410" /> £30 million Young People's Facilities and Services Fund which was established by the Government earlier this year.  In addition to the provision of treatment and rehabilitation services, this Government is committed to focusing on the development of preventative measures as part of its overall drug strategy.  A long-term solution to the drug problem must have as its core a strategy of prevention.</P>
      <P>The Young People's Facilities and Services Fund is the centrepiece of the Government's programme for young people at risk.  The purpose of the fund is to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities and services, in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop, with a view to attracting young people in those areas, at risk of becoming involved in drugs, into more healthy and productive pursuits.  The primary aim of the fund is to support a variety of capital and non-capital projects in disadvantaged areas over the next three years.  Some £20 million is being targeted at those areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.</P>
      <P>The guidelines for the operation of the fund in the local drug task force areas provide for the establishment of an assessment committee and local development groups in each of the task force areas.  The assessment committee is chaired by the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation and includes representatives from relevant Departments, the national drugs strategy team, the National Youth Council of Ireland and the voluntary and community sectors.  The committee will assess all plans on the basis of the criteria established and will make recommendations via the interdepartmental group to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.</P>
      <P>The development groups comprise a representative from the relevant vocational education committee, the local authority and the local drug task force.  These groups were charged with preparing a single integrated plan for their areas. Essentially, the development groups were asked to profile the area with a view to identifying the gaps in youth services facilities provision for the target group and to develop a plan which was clearly aimed at meeting identified needs.</P>
      <P>The development stage involved consultation with groups and organisations such as the local drug task forces, youth organisations working the area, statutory agencies operating in the area, the local area partnership companies and community development projects.  A minimum level of funding of £1 million per local drug task force area over the three years of the fund is being made available subject to the submission of plans that meet the overall objectives of the fund and the eligibility and evaluation criteria set out in the guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional £7 million which is the difference between the £20 million set aside and the £13 million committed to the 13 task force areas will be allocated to projects which clearly meet <Col N="1411" /> identified gaps and needs in the area or across a number of task force areas and meet the objectives and criteria as set out for the fund.</P>
    <P>The assessment committee is currently meeting with development groups and has commenced the process of assessing their plans.  As soon as the committee is a position to do so, it will make recommendations through the interdepartmental group, to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion as regards the allocation of funding to support the implementation of these plans.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the funding arrangements in which £20 million is being targeted at the areas particularly affected by the heroin problem.  Of the remaining £10 million, funding is being allocated over three years to support a number of initiatives, including projects for children at risk which is the responsibility of my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.  Some £1.8 million is being allocated to support strategies in the major urban centres of Waterford, Cork city south, Galway and Limerick aimed at preventing the target group from becoming involved in drugs.  Some £0.5 million has been set aside to assist voluntary organisations with a national or regional remit, to deliver education/prevention initiatives to the target group on a global basis.</P>
    <P>In the case of the four urban areas, the Cabinet committee on social inclusion decided that the relevant vocational education committees should take the lead in preparing strategies, in consultation with community and voluntary groups and other State initiatives in these areas to meet the objectives of the fund.</P>
    <P>Pending the assessment of the plans by the assessment committee, it is not clear what staffing resources will be required to administer the fund. In this regard, it should be borne in mind that this remit will not be the sole responsibility of the Department of Education and Science or agencies under the Department.  However, it appears from the role envisaged for statutory agencies under the guidelines that a review of resources available to these agencies is desirable.  This matter can be considered when the detailed arrangements regarding the draw down of funds has been clarified by the assessment committee.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education and Science is obviously anxious to ensure that the plans are implemented smoothly and that suitable systems are put in place for the monitoring and review of expenditure and compliance with Government accounting procedures.</P>

    <Title>Attacks on the Elderly.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinneranFF" hpid="Mr. Finneran Mr. Finneran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finneran</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and thank him for attending to respond to my matter which deals with the need for him, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, to address the serious public concern regarding attacks on the elderly and property break-ins in western counties.  I do not intend to imply that there are no break-ins in <Col N="1412" /> other counties.  However, it is my responsibility to highlight the public concern that exists in the counties across the Shannon, particularly County Roscommon from where I come.</P>
      <P>As the Cathaoirleach is aware, there has been a series of attacks on the elderly during which their savings were robbed.  This has been an ongoing problem for a number of years and in addition, there have been many break-ins. However, the problems have come to a head recently.  There have been many attacks and break-ins in recent months and there is a great sense of worry and apprehension in the community, particularly in remote rural areas.  Elderly people are very worried and concerned and some are very frightened about the possibility of break-ins at night.  They are worried about their belongings being taken but also that they may be assaulted and injured in the attack.</P>
      <P>Many small business people in rural areas, including in Roscommon town, have approached me because of the high number of break-ins recently.  Almost every village in County Roscommon has been attacked and almost every shop in some villages has been broken into.  From information supplied to me, it appears in so far as it can be established by the Garda that the people carrying out the attacks, particularly the break-ins, are not amateurs.  They have expertise.  In one raid recently, security systems were rendered ineffective.  I understood this could only have been done by people with expertise.</P>
      <P>I am extremely pleased with the Garda approach.  I know most of the people in the Roscommon section personally and they are doing an excellent job.  I compliment the officers in rural stations who visit the elderly perhaps once every couple of weeks and reassure them and also the people involved in the community alert scheme.</P>
      <P>There is a need to get the upper hand on the gangs who come into the area in high powered vehicles and who are able to evade the Garda in car chases.  One of the solutions first suggested by the Cathaoirleach is that the bridges on the River Shannon would be manned during the winter with, if necessary, Army back-up.  Last week there was an incident where the Garda had to use the spike system on the road between Athlone and Roscommon to stop a car.  The people involved escaped into the woods but they were found with the assistance of the Garda helicopter.  The Garda should be complimented on that success.</P>
      <P>The Army has an important role to play.  This is in conflict with some of the comments made recently on a popular radio programme that the Army should be disbanded.  This suggestion is totally out of order.  Such statements about the Army which has served the country so well are naive and irresponsible.  I dissociate myself from those remarks which were made by an individual whose family may have had a greater allegiance to a different army.  However, that matter is for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, to consider whether any <Col N="1413" /> further response can be made to appease and address the great public concern among the elderly, particularly in view of the long, dark winter nights ahead.  It has been mentioned to me that the provision of checkpoints on the bridges over the River Shannon would not only counteract crime in the west but also in the east.  A buffer zone is created and the Garda can operate on the basis that criminals cannot get in or out of the area.  This is important.  Confinement is possible because there is no opportunity for people to move from one province to another.  It is a more focused approach.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that dealing with the serious crime of attacks on the elderly and break-ins to premises is an operational matter for the Garda.  I am the first to admit that fact and I do not wish to attempt to tell the Garda how to do its job. Members of the force are professionally qualified and have been very successful in dealing with serious crime in recent years.  They have addressed the problem of attacks on the elderly and break-ins to shops and other premises.</P>
    <P>However, there is a great sense of public concern and worry among the elderly, particularly in remote rural areas.  Some of these people have premises in small towns and villages and they feel they are very vulnerable to roaming gangs.  I look forward to the Minister's response.  I hope that, following consultation with the Garda Commissioner, he will be in a position to reassure the people in County Roscommon, County Longford and other remote areas in the west.</P>
    <P>I thank the Cathaoirleach for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to deal with it.  I look forward to his response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue) Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. O'Donoghue)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Senator for raising this matter.  I am sure I speak for all sides of the House when I say that I am appalled by any attack on the elderly, whether it takes place in an urban or rural area.  Attacks on the elderly are cowardly crimes and I am aware, as someone from a rural area, of the lasting effects one such attack can have on the victim of the crime and those living in the immediate vicinity.</P>
      <P>I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that considerable resources are concentrated on dealing with such incidents and bringing the perpetrators to justice.  These take the form of special operations at regional, divisional and district level, support of community alert schemes, liaising with local community groups and giving crime prevention advice via local crime prevention officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime in the western Garda region as a whole, comprising Galway, Roscommon, Clare and Mayo, decreased by 4 per cent in 1997; the Senator may be interested to know that in the Roscommon district the crime rate actually decreased by a very significant 35 per cent in 1997.  There are 144 Garda stations in the western region and I reassure the Senator that, with the <Col N="1414" /> northern region, it enjoys the lowest crime rate in the country.  In 1997 anti-crime initiatives such as Operation Méabh, which targeted mobile criminals and those perpetrating attacks on the elderly, contributed to the overall reduction in crime. Operation Oisín commenced last month.  This operation involves all districts in the region and is based on a series of carefully chosen checkpoints at strategic locations.</P>
    <P>In the Roscommon/Galway East division, a special unit investigates break-ins and attacks on the elderly.  Attacks of this nature are closely monitored and receive the appropriate Garda attention.  While I fully appreciate that widespread fear can be felt among the elderly when these crimes are reported, such attacks are rare and the fear of crime is a more real problem.  For example, an analysis of all indictable offences recorded in the entire western region during 1997 indicates that seven offences were recorded where the injured parties were aged 65 or over and were subject to injury or threat.</P>
    <P>Statistics for 1998 have not yet been published, but I understand that six such offences have been recorded in the western region this year.  I will launch the report of the National Crime Forum in the next two to three weeks.  While I have not seen the report yet I am informed that the need for a greater focus on crime prevention and to address the fear of crime are two issues which came across strongly during its deliberations.  The Government cares about the elderly and through the scheme of community support for elderly people commonly known as the &ldquo;alarms for the elderly scheme&rdquo; a sum of £5 million is available this year for alarms and security devices.</P>
    <P>I wish to praise those involved in Neighbourhood Watch and Muintir na Tíre for their valuable work in the support and organisation of the 3,500 schemes throughout the country.  In rural areas Muintir na Tíre alone has over 1,100 committees. A research project evaluating the operation of the schemes is nearing completion and I look forward to receiving its recommendations. This evaluation was carried out on foot of a recommendation contained in the Report on the Task Force on the Security of the Elderly.</P>
    <P>The five development officers which Muintir na Tíre employs are in the process of organising 175 seminars throughout the country to advise people of the introduction of the euro and the implications of keeping their savings in their homes bearing in mind the currency changeover. I am pleased that my Department will continue funding Muintir na Tíre in 1999 and I hope to increase their funding above the 1998 level.  I am aware that Senator Finneran will welcome that.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the safety and well being of the elderly remains a top priority and, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, I will continue to ensure that all necessary measures will be taken to prevent, discourage and tackle this type of crime.  While the number of attacks in the western region was relatively small where the people concerned were subject to injury or <Col N="1415" /> threat, I regard even one of these offences as being too many.  I wish to emphasise that any person found guilty of assaulting or injuring an elderly person will not receive early release if sentenced to imprisonment.  It is a message which <Col N="1416" /> must be sent out very loudly and clearly and I am glad the opportunity has been afforded me to do that tonight.</P>
    <P>The Seanad adjourned at 8.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 November 1998.</P>
