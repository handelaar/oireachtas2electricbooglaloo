    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's Order of Business is item 2, The Radiological Protection (Amendment) Bill, 1998, Order for Second Stage and Second Stage; and item 3, the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill, 1998.  I propose that we take all Stages of the latter Bill today.  In each case, I propose 15 minutes for spokespersons and ten minutes for other speakers.  Speakers may share time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to.  I have no difficulty taking all Stages of the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill which is straightforward legislation.  The sooner it is on the Statute Book the better.</P>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader make inquiries with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the case of Professor David Lowry, which was reported in yesterday's newspapers?  Professor Lowry is a graduate of Queen's University and an academic lawyer of some distinction.  However, things have not gone very well for him because he has been held in prison in Lisbon for the past year where he faces fraud charges.  For a full year after his arrest he was not charged and it appears the case will drag on indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I know it is not appropriate to intervene in the judicial affairs of any state, particularly a friendly foreign one, but this case does give cause for concern.  Professor Lowry is being held in a small cell with 12 other people.  There is strong <i>prima facie</i> evidence that there may well have been a miscarriage of justice in this case. Obviously, we cannot make any judgment on that, but a number of leading authorities say that this may be so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One way or the other, Professor Lowry has been held in fairly appalling conditions for a very long period.  Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to inquire from our embassy staff in Lisbon if they would investigate the circumstances of the case, which could be conveyed to us if there is cause for concern?  All I am asking in this case is that this person be at <Col N="850" /> least given access to a speedy trial rather than being kept indefinitely in fairly appalling conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is acceptable and the time allocation for speakers seems to be in order.</P>
      <P>I wish to raise some more local matters with the Acting Leader.  It is time we gave a signal to the rest of the world that we have grown up as a society and have become a bit more civilised. Given that we are entering the season of good will and all that goes with it, we should as a nation accept that we are old enough to decide how long we want to stay out and at what time we want to return home, as well as how much we want to drink and when.  The licensing laws in this city and country are antediluvian.  The lack of a taxi service for people to get home is equally bad.  It is time we started deregulating some of these areas which are creating a safety hazard for many people during this season.  The Acting Leader should raise with the Government the deregulation of the licensing laws and the arrangements for transportation, including taxis and hackneys, which nobody understands.  These arrangements are leading to unsafe habits among road users at night.  People are taking a risk when driving as others are standing out in front of cars fighting for taxis.  People do not know where they are going and the Garda Síochána is being used as a force to put pressure on the Government to change the licensing laws by embarrassing publicans and everybody else.  I would ask the Acting Leader to look at those matters if he would not mind doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Senator O'Toole for organising a very fine lobbying session for politicians this afternoon.  I wish him and the INTO well in their campaign for better facilities, resources and pupil-teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>Item 19, motion 25, on today's Order Paper calls on &ldquo;the Minister for the Environment and Local Government to obtain an independent assessment of the health effects of microwave transmitters being erected on masts throughout the country&rdquo;.  People from Donegal to Wicklow and Kerry, and their public representatives, are concerned about this issue.  It will not go away despite the reassurances given by the different companies which are seeking to erect microwave transmitters on these masts.  The fact they are located beside Garda stations, which are close to community facilities, makes them more suspect in people's view.  I ask the Leader for an early debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is increasing concern about masts.  In Killorglin there is a mast within 50 feet of the national school.  Every time a child has an unexplained illness, and there have been a few, there is heightened concern among parents, teachers and the public.  I join with Senator Costello in calling for a debate on this issue.  The <Col N="851" /> Leader should ask the Government if there is definitive information on these potentially hazardous objects which are being erected throughout the country and, if not, urgent steps should be taken to obtain it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThereseRidge" hpid="Mrs. Ridge Mrs. Ridge">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Leader to arrange for an urgent debate on child care.  We have all heard about the Celtic tiger.  However, the Celtic tigresses, or young mothers, are furious at the lack of provision of child care facilities and meaningful tax relief in the budget.  That applies to both women working inside the home and those who put their children into care outside the home.  I ask the Leader to ask the relevant Minister to attend to this matter because it will not go away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>Item 19, motion 34, states:</P>
      <P>That Seanad Éireann expresses its concern at the continuing difficulties being experienced by asylum seekers and refugees in this country and requests the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give an explanation to the House.</P>
      <P>Members on all sides would agree this is a serious matter.  It was raised in <i>The Examiner</i> and taken up by other newspapers with the suggestion that officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform were trying to flush out and expedite the deportation of asylum seekers.  That is worrying.  It is a peculiar time of the year to start doing it.  They have not received the Christmas message in any substantial form.  In the absence of the full implementation of the Refugee Act, it is worrying that officials in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are the first point of contact for asylum seekers when they are being interviewed.  This is grossly unfair and is not good practice.  It would be welcome if the Minister came into the House to give an explanation.</P>
      <P>I was interested in what Senator Manning said about Professor Lowry.  I am aware of this case.  I understand Professor Lowry is ill and has received the support of an important professor of the law of evidence, a type of forensic expert.  It is worrying that someone should be held in prison for such a long time without being charged.  It may turn out that he is innocent and then he will have suffered a serious penalty.  However, one hesitates to get involved in these matters, particularly before the trial takes place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur with what my colleague, Senator O'Toole, had to say about drink.  Of course grown up people should be allowed drink whatever they like as long as it does not land on my doorstep.  I hope when we have a proper liberalisation of these laws we will also scrutinise the grossly immature behaviour of Irish people, particularly Dubliners.  We could waterski down O'Connell Street half the evenings around this time of year. I find this behaviour absolutely disgusting, barbarous, <Col N="852" /> unsanitary and I do not see why we have to put up with it.</P>
    <P>Finally, Senator O'Toole is correct about taxis and that there should be deregulation.  It is nonsense to see queues of people and no taxis.  We also see the specially adapted invalid taxis for wheelchairs and we know that while they are parked at a taxi rank at St. Stephen's Green they are refusing to take people with wheelchairs.  We need to examine the entire system.  I was due to take part in a programme for RTÉ.  They sent a taxi for me at 6 p.m. but it arrived at 6.35 p.m. which was beautifully calculated so I could miss the first half of the film I was supposed to review. That experience has given me a particular edge with regard taxis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to reply to Senator O'Toole's suggestion of deregulation of the licensing laws.  I agree with him that there is a problem with taxis at the moment.  However, while a person may have to wait two or three hours for a taxi I have never witnessed anyone having to wait more than two minutes for a pint of stout.  Since public houses can accommodate almost 140,000 people, there is no need for deregulation of the licensing laws.  They are too free at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Before calling the next speaker on the Order of Business I will take this opportunity to welcome Chief Anyuoaka, Secretary General of the Commonwealth and his party.  On my own behalf and on behalf of Seanad Éireann I extend to your a most sincere welcome to this country.  I hope you will find your visit to Ireland to be both interesting and successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome Chief Anyuoaka, Secretary General of the Commonwealth and his delegation.  Perhaps it would be in our interest to join that organisation.</P>
      <P>First, I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole on the licensing laws.  I, with Senator Bohan, was a member of a subcommittee which carried out a very comprehensive review of our liquor licensing laws and we presented a voluminous report to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We made very worthwhile recommendations but there has not been any action on them since.  Will the Acting Leader raise this matter with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?  We would like to see legislative changes brought about as a result of our hard labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In light of events in London surrounding the detaining of General Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, and the dilemma now faced by Mr. <Col N="853" /> Jack Straw, British Home Secretary, there is no proper legal framework to enable people like Pinochet who have accusations made against them to deal with them on an international stage. However, Ireland agreed to the setting up of an international criminal court in a UN sponsored agreement in Rome last July.</P>
    <P>We freely agreed to this.  We need to enact legislation so that Ireland can ratify its membership and participation in an international criminal court.  Some 120 countries signed that agreement, but seven or eight countries, including the United States, did not.  It needs to be ratified by 60 countries in order to come into force.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on behalf of this House to ensure the legislation to allow Ireland ratify participation in this convention is enacted as soon as possible? This would be simple legislation, similar to that which was enacted a couple of weeks ago to govern the <i>ad hoc</i> committee set up to allow war criminals in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia to be brought before the <i>ad hoc</i> court in the Hague.  This country should take the lead in this regard.  We should be one of the first countries to lodge papers of ratification on the basis that these Houses have passed the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson for the Opposition on such matters, I assure the Leader there will be no opposition to this as long as the legislation meets the requirements.  This legislation could pass all Stages in one day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaBonner" hpid="Mr. Bonner Mr. Bonner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bonner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Costello's request regarding the matter I raised last week.  I have my own opinion on health hazards in this regard.  However, I am more concerned about what happened and the necessity for a large Garda presence.  Consultation resolves most problems but there was very little consultation in this instance.  There should be local consultation regarding these masts.</P>
      <P>Will the Leader ask the Tánaiste to address this House on the unfolding events in Fruit of the Loom?  There have been problems there for two or three years.  The workforce heard yesterday on the local radio station that they were about to be laid off for three or four weeks.  There are many rumours circulating that this may be the beginning of permanent lay-off.  It is not good enough that as late as this morning workers have still not received official notification of lay-off.  The factory in Dungloe closed over a week ago, yet the labour force have not received a redundancy offer.  This is an abuse of employers' power and a very sad day for labour relations.  The Tánaiste should make a statement on the matter in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will withdraw my request for a debate on the euro.  The reason for this is that I had the opportunity to go through the plans for the changeover drawn up by the changeover panel.  I congratulate the panel for the work it has done.  There are only 23 days to go before the <Col N="854" /> first steps will be taken towards this changeover. A debate will be necessary at some stage, but not immediately.</P>
      <P>The Leader should not accede to the request for a debate on General Pinochet.  I was unaware of the information made available to us by Senator Connor recently.  I have no love for the former Pinochet regime.  However, I am concerned about us debating the possibility of putting someone in jail for crimes committed.  The delicately balanced peace in Chile could be upset by action taken in this part of the world.  There is now peace in the North.  If some of those who committed crimes in the past 20 years, and who are now allowed to walk free, were arrested in South America and it threatened the fragile peace in the North, we would not be in favour of it.  We should find other means of handling this. Perhaps the suggestion by Senator Connor is the correct way rather than debate it here and give rise to problems elsewhere in the world where there is a fragile and delicately balanced peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we are talking about the lawful consumption of pints in the early hours of the morning, paying for them in euros and going home by taxi.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning raised the matter of Professor Lowry and it was also mentioned by another Senator.  I am not familiar with the case but naturally I will bring the Senator's concern to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. As the Senator stated, it would not be appropriate for us to intervene in the legal process of another State but we would be concerned about any infringement of Professor Lowry's human rights or basic rights.  I will ask that that be conveyed on our behalf.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Toole, Senator Bohan, Senator Norris and Senator Connor made reference to the licensing laws.  I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is at an advance stage in the preparation of legislation to deal with this issue and that should come before us in the new year.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Chamber of Commerce stated this morning that 90 per cent of their firms were waiting for a considerable period for taxis when they ordered them.  I sympathise with what the Senators said in that respect.  I understand Dublin Corporation made some advances yesterday evening in dealing with the issue.</P>

      <P>I am also pleased to note that the great tradition of socialists dining in the Shelbourne Hotel has continued to the present day.  I am sorry I could not be there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello and Senator Bonner raised the matter of the microwave transmitters. I realise the matter is on the Order Paper as a Private Members' motion and we could see if time could be devoted to discussing it.  I would agree strongly with Senator Bonner that there should be consultation at local level on these matters. It would be entirely inappropriate to have a large, heavy handed Garda presence where protests take place before these masts are erected.</P>
      <P>Senator Ridge will be aware that child care is a complicated area.  The Minister for Finance indicated as much in his budget speech and said he is awaiting the report of the working group on it.  I hope there will be progress when that happens.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Senator Norris's concern at the way asylum seekers might be treated.  It would be totally contrary to the traditions of this country that people who come here in unfortunate circumstances would not be dealt with humanely and sympathetically.  From that point of view, I would share the Senator's sentiments. I will raise the issue with the Minister to see if something can be done.</P>
      <P>I agree with Senator Connor that we should have legislation on the international criminal court as soon as possible and I will also contact the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on that matter.  It is worth recording that we are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights. Within that context, I am sure it would also be appropriate to consider that matter.</P>
      <P>The Fruit of the Loom issue, which was raised by Senator Bonner, is something about which all the Members of the House would be concerned, particularly the way in which the workers appear to have been treated &mdash; they did not know what was taking place and they have been getting a drip feed over a period.  It is wrong that they should have been dealt with in this way and that 1,200 people should be laid off for three or four weeks coming up to Christmas.  I will contact the Tánaiste to see if she would be able to come to the House to discuss the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn mentioned the euro.  Senator Connor mentioned General Pinochet.  I note the motion on the Order Paper regarding General Pinochet.  This comes back to a Portuguese issue.  Traditionally we do not interfere with the legal process in another EU member state.  I understand what Senator Quinn is trying to achieve and he is correct.  Irrespective of what the crimes might or <Col N="856" /> might not have been, and they seem to have been very serious, we must be aware of the implications for those living in the country in question before we say anything which might affect them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Public Enterprise (Mr. Jacob)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to introduce this Bill which is comparatively short and of a technical nature.  It provides for amendments to certain sections of the Radiological Protection Acts, 1991 and 1995, specifically those relating to the regulatory licensing role of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Before speaking on the details of the Bill I would like to outline by way of background the functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The institute was established in April 1992 under the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, and replaced the Nuclear Energy Board.  The main functions of the institute are enshrined in the provisions of the 1991 Act and include providing advice to the Government, the Minister for Public Enterprise and other Ministers on matters relating to radiological safety; monitoring developments abroad relating to nuclear installations and radiological safety; monitoring, measuring and assessing radioactivity contamination of the environment, including the seas around Ireland; controlling by way of licence the custody, use, manufacture, importation, transportation, distribution, exportation and disposal of radioactive substances, irradiating apparatus and other sources of ionising radiation; informing the public on any matters relating to radiological safety and supporting the development and implementation of national plans for nuclear and radiological emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The institute is responsible for all activities in this State involving ionising radiation which include hospitals, dental practices, veterinary surgeons, laboratory instruments, industrial operations, distribution of irradiating equipment, industrial radiography and research laboratories. There are over 1,000 licensees.  Many of these licensed activities are carried on quietly and <Col N="857" /> efficiently.  However, they are potentially hazardous to workers, patients under medical and dental care, and members of the public if not operated to high standards of radiological protection.  The institute has a key role as regulator in ensuring that acceptable standards of practice are maintained. The amendments proposed in this Bill concern the regulatory activities of the institute currently enshrined in the Radiological Protection Act, 1991, which I will refer to as the &ldquo;1991 Act&rdquo; in the rest of my contribution.</P>
    <P>In essence, the Bill makes provision for the strengthening of the institute's licensing powers relating to the use of X-ray equipment by practitioners and the elaboration of powers to fix licence fees.  It also creates new offences to enhance the institute's regulatory role drawing upon the institute's experience since the 1991 Act was enacted.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for amendments to section 30 of the 1991 Act.  Section 30 of the 1991 Act is the main legislative basis for the institute's regulatory functions and essentially provides for the institute to regulate, by licence, the custody, control and use of radioactive substances, nuclear devices or irradiating apparatus.  The main provisions in section 2 of the Bill relate to the institute's power to licence persons for the use of X-ray equipment and the Minister's power to prescribe by regulation the institute's licence fees in respect of its regulatory activities.</P>
    <P>Under section 30 of the 1991 Act, the institute is empowered to licence persons for the custody and use of X-ray equipment.  However, neither the 1991 Act nor the 1993 order made under it, empowers the institute to satisfy itself as to the competence of the licensee to use such equipment. In fact, section 7(2) of the 1991 Act, which was amended by section 26 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1995, restricts the institute's role to the supervision and care of the X-ray equipment and to ensuring that the equipment is properly calibrated and maintained.  The institute has, in its annual reports of the last two years, highlighted this narrow focus as a potential cause of concern, particularly in relation to the regulation of chiropractors.</P>
    <P>The European Communities (Medical Ionising Radiation) Regulations, 1988, which are enforced by the Minister for Health and Children, set out the requirements relating to the competency of persons engaged in the use of X-ray equipment for medical and dental purposes.  In summary, articles 5 and 6 of the 1988 regulations provide that a person cannot carry out a medical or dental treatment involving ionising radiation unless he or she is a doctor or other practitioner or a dentist deemed by the Medical Council, or the Dental Council, as the case may be, to have the required competence in terms of radiation protection and radiation techniques.  However, chiropractors, unlike doctors or dentists, are not recognised by the Medical Council.  At present, an anomalous legislative situation exists whereby the institute can license a chiropractor for the custody and use <Col N="858" /> of X-ray equipment despite the fact that under the separate 1988 regulations mentioned above, the chiropractor is not entitled to use the equipment as he or she is not recognised by the Medical Council.</P>
    <P>Section 2(b) of the Bill will rectify this anomaly. It will amend the 1991 Act to provide that the institute cannot grant a licence for the use of X-ray apparatus unless the institute is satisfied that the person satisfies the requirements of articles 5 or 6 of the 1988 regulations.  The amendment will also empower the institute to revoke an existing licence where the licensee does not meet the same requirements.  It will be the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that the users of such substances, devices or apparatus for these purposes meet the requirements of the 1988 regulations.</P>
    <P>The other main amendment in section 2 of the Bill relates to an amendment to section 30(7) of the 1991 Act.  The existing section 30(7) of the 1991 Act empowers the Minister for Public Enterprise to prescribe by regulation a fee which the institute may charge in respect of the issue by the institute of a licence.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to section 2(d) of the Bill will elaborate on the existing fee fixing powers relating to licences issued by the institute. It is designed to confer maximum flexibility on the Minister so that the institute's licensing administration costs will be recovered in a fair and equitable manner.  For example the institute will be empowered to retain fees or a proportion of fees paid to it in respect of the licensing process in circumstances where the licence applicant does not ultimately qualify for a licence.  All these fee fixing changes will be important to the new regulatory powers of the institute under a EURATOM directive to which I will refer later.</P>
    <P>Section 2(e) of the Bill provides that the institute will not perform the licensing function where the prescribed fee has not been paid.  It also provides for the institute to recover any money owing to it from the person by whom the money is payable in the event that a proportion of a licence fee is payable following the grant of a licence.</P>
    <P>Section 2(a) and 2(c) of the Bill is a textual amendment to section 30(4) and (5), respectively, of the 1991 Act which has the effect of reinforcing certain licensing powers of the institute.  Section 3 of the Bill amends section 40(1) of the 1991 Act by the addition of a provision which will make it an offence for a person to knowingly or recklessly make a false statement when applying for a licence under section 30 of that Act.  It also makes it an offence for a person not to comply with a condition of a licence granted pursuant to section 30.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill amends section 41 of the 1991 Act, as amended by section 65 of the Food Safety Authority of Ireland Act, 1998.  The amendments are merely technical amendments to clarify the summary prosecution powers of those relevant Ministers, the institute and the Food <Col N="859" /> Safety Authority of Ireland identified in section 41 of the 1991 Act, as amended, in respect of offences created under section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I would now like to speak about an important EU directive in the area of radiation protection and then to refer to the Government's policy in regard to nuclear safety and radiological protection. First, Council Directive 96/29 of Euratom, which was adopted on 13 May 1996, lays down basic safety standards for the protection of the health of workers and the general public against the dangers arising from ionising radiation.  This directive replaces a previous basic safety standards directive and applies to all practices involving ionising radiation and to activities involving naturally occurring radiation sources.  In so far as Ireland is concerned the directive would apply, for example, to hospitals, dental practices, veterinary practices and universities where radiation is used.  It will also apply to any industrial activities where radioactive sources would be involved.</P>
    <P>The directive, unlike the previous directive, will cover work activities involving exposure to natural radiation, for example, radon in the case of show caves, and cosmic radiation in the case of air crew.  The directive lays down a number of obligations for which member states must legislate. These include identification of work activities; introduction of radiation exposure levels; introduction of radiation protection principles for intervention in cases of radiological emergencies or lasting exposures and the need to have emergency planning in place to cover radiological emergencies and accidents.  I should point out that a number of the requirements of the directive are already provided for in existing national legislation.</P>
    <P>This is an important directive which will profoundly influence radiological protection in member states for a considerable time.  It represents a significant step forward in radiation protection. As I mentioned, member states are required to transpose the directive into national legislation by not later than 13 May 2000.  I intend to meet this deadline.  To this end, my Department is currently finalising a consultation paper which will set out how Ireland intends to implement the directive. The objective of the consultation paper will be to draw upon a wide spectrum of opinion and expertise within the country before finalising the legislative proposals.  I intend to have the consultation paper available in early January.  It is the intention that the directive will be implemented into Irish law by way of an order made under section 30 of the 1991 Act.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the Government's policy in regard to nuclear safety and radiological protection and its continuing campaign against the UK nuclear industry.  Public and political opinion in Ireland is opposed to the use of nuclear power for energy purposes.  The Government shares the concerns of the Irish people about the implications for Ireland of nuclear facilities, particularly those in the UK and, <Col N="860" /> notably, Sellafield.  The Irish Government's policy, therefore, places heavy emphasis on nuclear safety and radiological protection and is firmly committed to its campaign against the continuation and any expansion of the UK nuclear industry. Sellafield, because of its proximity to Ireland and its complex nuclear operations, has long been a source of grave concern to successive Irish Governments and the Irish public.  The main factors driving the Irish Government's opposition to the Sellafield operations is the risk, however remote, of a catastrophic accident, the aging Magnox reactors, the continued reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel, the storage of high level radioactive waste on site and the impact of radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>I will briefly outline some of the more recent actions which the Government has taken in pursuit of its campaign against Sellafield.  Since assuming the nuclear safety brief, I have attempted to influence UK Ministers on their Government's nuclear policies and have left them in no doubt about the strong feeling on this side of the Irish Sea.  In November 1997 I had my first formal meeting with the UK Minister for the Environment, Mr. Michael Meacher, MP, and outlined to him the Government's continuing concerns about the Sellafield operations.  At the meeting with Mr. Meacher I called for the decommissioning of the aging Magnox reactors, an end to radioactive discharges and the speeding up of the vitrification process in respect of the high level liquid waste stored at Sellafield.  These concerns were also raised at a meeting in June this year between officials of my Department and the relevant UK Departments.</P>
    <P>As a follow up to the November 1997 meeting, I have been in correspondence with Mr. John Battle, MP, the UK Minister of State for Science, Energy and Industry, regarding my concerns about the high level waste storage arrangements at Sellafield.  In my correspondence with Mr. Battle I emphasised the need to give priority to the acceleration of the waste vitrification process to facilitate a much earlier target date than 2015 for clearance of the backlog of waste.  I also asked Mr. Battle to exhort British Nuclear Fuels to release to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland detailed technical information, including probability risk assessments, relating to the waste storage tanks.  This information had been sought by the institute from BNFL to enable the institute to make its own judgment of the risks involved. Discussions are continuing between the institute and BNFL on this issue.</P>
    <P>In tandem with my own personal contact, both formal and informal, with the UK Ministers, my Department has made two submissions to the UK Environment Agency, one concerning the proposed mixed oxide &mdash; MOX &mdash; fuel fabrication plant for Sellafield and the other concerning a proposed variation by the agency of the Sellafield discharge authorisation certificate.  In essence, the submission on MOX detailed the Irish Government's objections to the proposed plant and <Col N="861" /> pointed out that the claimed economic benefits of MOX do not in any way outweigh the detriment to society in terms of increased risk to public health, the environment and security.</P>
    <P>As regards radioactive discharges, the submission restated Ireland's concerns about such discharges into the Irish Sea, particularly discharges of technetium-99 which have grown significantly since 1994, and its desire to see a cessation of all such discharges.</P>
    <P>I mention at this point an important and positive development as regards to radioactive discharges into the marine environment.  I am referring to the commitments made at the meeting of the OSPAR Ministers in Portugal in July last which I regard as a significant step forward in the Government's campaign against Sellafield.  At that meeting a strategy on radioactive discharges was adopted which committed all OSPAR Ministers, including the UK Ministers, to the virtual elimination of such discharges into the sea by the year 2020.</P>
    <P>I gave a great deal of attention to the preparation of Ireland's strategy in the OSPAR meeting and I believe the eventual outcome was a vindication of the efforts which I and my officials made in this process.  Additionally, UK Ministers, at the same meeting, promised to take account of concerns raised by Ireland and other countries about technetium-99 discharges into the Irish Sea. I, therefore, intend to ensure that UK Ministers honour those commitments speedily and in a way which addresses legitimate concerns about the impact of such discharges on sea-based livelihoods and the enjoyment of the amenities of the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>In the light of the OSPAR commitments, I very much regret the recently announced draft decision prepared by the UK Environment Agency concerning a variation in the Sellafield discharge authorisation.  The agency's proposed decision, while it involves a reduction in the permitted, levels of technetium-99 discharges, is totally unacceptable to the Government as the proposed technetium reductions are completely inadequate.  I regard the proposed decision as effectively a breach of the undertaking entered into by UK Ministers at the OSPAR ministerial meeting.  However, UK Ministers have the final decision making powers relating to this matter and the Environment Agency has merely announced draft decisions.  The agency has referred the proposed decision to UK Ministers for their consideration as to &ldquo;whether they wish to direct the agency to make a different decision or to issue further policy guidance to the agency&rdquo;. In other words, the buck stops with Ministers.  As far as I am concerned, UK Ministers must be seen to observe their OSPAR commitments now. Their handling of the technetium-99 discharges issue will be a measure of how seriously they take those commitments.</P>
    <P>On the same day as it announced its proposed decision on radioactive discharges, the UK Environment Agency also announced its proposed <Col N="862" /> decision to give the go ahead to the MOX plant. Again, this proposed decision has been referred by the agency to UK Ministers for final decision. On the day the Environment Agency announced these proposed decisions, I wrote to the relevant UK Ministers expressing the Government's strong objections to them.  I will do everything possible to ensure the proposed decision on MOX is rescinded and the one on radioactive discharges is modified to reflect the commitment given at the OSPAR ministerial meeting.  As the Taoiseach stated in his address to the recent Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis; &ldquo;Ireland objects strongly to any new MOX plant or to any continuation of Sellafield pollution&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A number of important international conventions have been adopted over the past two years which will enhance nuclear safety worldwide.  The Convention on Nuclear Safety, to which Ireland was among the first signatories, came into force in October 1996.  Its aim is to ensure all land based civil nuclear installations are safe, well regulated and promote a high level of nuclear safety worldwide.  The convention requires each contracting party to take adequate national measures to ensure nuclear safety and to report to other contracting parties on the measures taken.</P>
    <P>The convention will present Ireland with a unique opportunity to participate in a nuclear safety peer review process every three years.  The first such review will take place under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency next April.  The review will assess how participating countries are complying with the obligations of the convention.  Furthermore, it will provide Ireland with an opportunity to query the country reports of the UK and others regarding their compliance with the convention.  The country reports in respect of a number of contracting parties have already been circulated by the IAEA, and all such reports will be discussed at the review meeting next April.  Ireland sees this convention as a major breakthrough in fostering a global nuclear safety culture and providing a forum for extensive information exchange on nuclear safety matters.</P>
    <P>In September 1997 Ireland was among the first signatories of a new Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management.  This convention places new and extensive obligations on contracting parties.  These include provisions relating to general safety requirements, siting, design, construction and operation of facilities and disposal of spent fuel and radioactive waste. The convention also establishes a peer review process similar to that applicable to the Convention on Nuclear Safety.</P>
    <P>A significant feature of the joint convention in which Ireland was active in negotiating relates to the inclusion within its scope of reprocessing facilities such as those at Sellafield.  Contracting parties can make a voluntary declaration that reprocessing is an intrinsic part of spent fuel management. <Col N="863" /> I welcome the UK's commitment to the effect that it would voluntarily extend the convention's scope to reprocessing activities.  Thus, from an Irish perspective, it will be possible to address public concerns about UK reprocessing facilities, especially the THORP plant at Sellafield, during the peer review meetings.</P>
    <P>The new joint convention also obliges neighbouring countries to consult countries in close proximity on the siting of proposed facilities. These consultation obligations are relevant to Ireland's long standing objections to the siting of any new radioactive waste disposal facilities in Britain.  On entry into force, the convention will give firm backing to consultations by the UK with Ireland on such facilities.</P>
    <P>Ireland played an active role in the negotiation and conclusion of the new international conventions negotiated under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency.  They will enhance nuclear safety worldwide and represent the type of significant international commitment which Ireland and other non-nuclear states have been trying to establish for many years to ensure that states which espouse the use of nuclear energy have an obligation to ensure the highest standards of safety and radiological protection are employed.</P>
    <P>Radon, a naturally occurring odourless radioactive gas found in soil and rocks, can access buildings and domestic dwellings.  I am aware of various research which has concluded that radon gas may be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, in 1992, initiated a national survey to measure radon concentrations in domestic dwellings.  The institute's survey which has been completed in respect of 24 counties to date is due for completion early next year.  Of the houses measured to date some 1,500 have been identified as having radon measurements in excess of the national reference level of 200 bequerels per cubic metre.  This is a level above which the institute would recommend that radon remediation works be undertaken by the householder. When the survey is completed the institute intends producing a map showing the areas most affected by radon.  The Government is making every effort to address the problem of high radon concentrations in dwellings.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and Local Government published revised technical guidance documents relating to building regulations which incorporate explicit requirements for radon preventative measures in the construction of new dwellings from 1 July 1998.  More elaborate radon protection measures are specified for new houses in the high radon areas identified in the institute's survey.  At the request of the Minister for Education and Science, the institute has recently initiated a comprehensive nationwide radon measurement survey of schools to ensure problems with radon are identified.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> The EU Basic Safety Standards Directive, which I referred to earlier, includes specific provisions relating to exposure to natural radiation sources and, in this context, the exposure of workers and members of the public to radon in the workplace is specifically addressed.</P>
    <P>The Government is firmly committed to its policy of nuclear safety and radiological protection and to its campaign against Sellafield.  Earlier this year, it established the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear Safety.  The committee, which I chair, comprises the Ministers of State at the Departments of Marine and Natural Resources, Foreign Affairs, Health and Children and Environment and Local Government and officials from the Office of the Attorney General, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the above mentioned Departments.  The committee's terms of reference are broad and encompass nuclear and radiological safety issues and the campaign against Sellafield.  Its objective is to co-ordinate nuclear safety policy, to complement the work of the various Departments and State agencies in developing and implementing radiological protection policy and to give added impetus to the Government's efforts in the area of nuclear safety and radiation protection.  The committee has met on four occasions since its establishment.</P>
    <P>When speaking about the Sellafield threat, I mentioned the ever-present risk of an accident at the plant.  The same risk is there for other plants in the UK and elsewhere.  The Government has a plan of action in place in the event of a nuclear accident.  The national emergency plan for nuclear accidents is designed to provide a rapid and effective response to accidents which involve the release, or potential release, of radioactive substances into the environment which could give rise to radiation exposure.  The national emergency plan outlines the measures to assess and mitigate the effects of nuclear accidents which occur in the UK or elsewhere which might pose a radiological hazard to Ireland.  As Minister with responsibility for nuclear safety matters, I am responsible for the emergency plan and for ensuring the co-ordination of the respective responsibilities and functions of relevant Departments, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and local authorities.</P>
    <P>Following a simulated nuclear emergency exercise in November 1996, in which Ireland participated, a fundamental review of the plan was undertaken by my Department and the institute in consultation with the other relevant Departments. Arising from the review, a number of procedural and practical improvements to the plan were identified and these have now been approved by Government.  These include the establishment of a committee of Ministers from the appropriate Departments which would give policy direction on recommended countermeasures as necessary; the reinforcement of the co-ordinating role of the existing emergency response co-ordination committee, which comprises representatives from key Departments and <Col N="865" /> Government agencies; the establishment of a consultative committee comprising senior officials of relevant Departments and Government agencies to exchange views on the plan, including its organisations and testing and to make decisions on necessary actions relevant to their respective areas and an upgrading of the accommodation, communications equipment and public information services within the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  The new arrangements also provide for the exploration of the possibilities of North-South co-operation in the context of an accident or emergency affecting or potentially affecting the island as a whole.  These arrangements take immediate effect but I hope to publish an updated plan in 1999.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I wish to refer to the County Louth residents legal action against British Nuclear Fuels.  As the House will be aware, the Government approved an offer of financial assistance of £400,000 to the residents towards the cost of research work to be undertaken by them. This offer was made despite the fact that the State is a co-defendant in the residents' action.  A number of payments have been made to the residents on foot of this offer.  The Government also approved, in December 1997, a package of assistance relating to defined areas of work by the residents' legal team in assessing research work.  This package was outlined by me to the residents that same month.  However, the residents have yet to confirm that they are in a position to accept this offer.  I emphasise that, despite the fact that the State remains a co-defendant in this case, the Government has, at all times, endeavoured to be as helpful and as co-operative as possible to the residents.  The commitment of not insignificant resources by the Government is indicative of its willingness in this regard.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government will keep under review the question of taking legal action against BNFL in respect of the risk to Ireland from Sellafield.  However, litigation against Sellafield raises many complex technical and legal issues.  The Government will continue to draw upon the best scientific and legal advice before deciding on litigation of such a challenging nature.</P>
    <P>I have endeavoured to paint a picture of the Government's efforts to promote nuclear safety and radiological protection and the actions being taken by the Government to protect the citizens of Ireland from the environmental hazards of nuclear power activities in the UK and elsewhere. Over the past ten years or so, the tide of public opinion in Europe has moved against nuclear power.  Ireland, through successive Governments, has played a large role in this process and, as far as the Government is concerned, will continue to play a leading role in highlighting the risks associated with the nuclear energy industry and ancillary activities.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing the contributions of Senators.</P>
    <Col N="866" />
    <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG" hpid="Mr. O'Dowd Mr. O'Dowd">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dowd</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this important legislation.  The Minister of State's contribution was all encompassing and dealt with a number of issues not covered by the Bill.  I will refer later to a number of the points he raised.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State indicated, we must ensure that anyone who is licensed to possess medical equipment must be medically qualified to use it.  At present, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland &mdash; RPII &mdash; must grant a licence to anyone who proves they can use equipment rather than proving that they are medically qualified to use it.  A number of chiropractors are using X-ray equipment under licence from the RPII but they are not medically qualified in its use.  The legislation will ensure that the Irish Medical Council will be in a position to decide who will use such equipment in the future, particularly where it is used on human beings.  That is an important and welcome development.</P>
      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute does an excellent job.  From its chief executive, Dr. Tom O'Flaherty, down, the institute has provided a first class service to me and its staff is willing to provide information and help.  The institute is carrying out work of great national importance in this and other areas.</P>
      <P>On Thursday next, the Leader has arranged time for statements on Sellafield.  The Minister of State's contribution touched on a number of issues relating to that debate.  Unfortunately, I did not know in advance what he intended to say and I did not bring with me some of my notes for Thursday.  However, I will refer to a number of points I intended to raise on that date.</P>
      <P>The RPII has responsibility for a large number of areas, many of which have become cause for concern.  People living in Counties Donegal, Louth and Wicklow are concerned about the masts being erected at Garda stations.  Members of the public throughout the country, despite the raft of scientific evidence provided by the RPII and academics, are not satisfied with the erection of such masts at Garda stations which are situated close to schools or residential areas.  I am open to correction, but I understand that in countries such as Australia these masts must be erected at least 1,000 metres from schools.  However, many Garda stations are situated at the centre of communities or source of greatest activity which is often not the best or highest location in geographic terms. It is a matter of great concern to the public that these masts are located in low lying areas rather than at the highest possible point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government to immediately provide clarification on this matter.  I am aware that meetings are taking place in respect of it as we speak but the Government should insist that masts should not be erected on Garda stations.  If they must be erected, masts should be situated in the highest location and at the greatest possible distance from human habitation.  They should not be situated at the core of community life.  People do not want them because they are unsightly and the health risks attaching to them have not been <Col N="867" /> fully quantified.  As far as members of the public are concerned, we should be extremely conservative in respect of this matter.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State's comments in respect of radon gas.  The Radiological Protection Institute has an efficient testing system.  The RPII will test radon gas levels in people's homes for a fee of between £20 to £25.  The staff who carry out these tests supply householders with readings in addition to providing technical information in respect of making structural changes to their homes to ensure their safety.</P>
    <P>The position relating to the number of people dying as a result of cancer caused by radon gas in certain parts of the country is becoming clear.  In County Louth, large areas of the Cooley Peninsula, Clogherhead, etc., have been identified as dangerous by the RPII and the local authority insists that when new houses are being constructed works must be carried out to ensure that radon gas is vented and that it does not permeate into the core of the houses.  Given the increasing thermal efficiency in homes, radon gas is being trapped in houses which is the opposite of what is required.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State comprehensively addressed the issue of Sellafield and I welcome a number of the comments he made.  I welcome his personal commitment to continue the fight against British Nuclear Fuels, which was initiated by the previous Government and taken up by the current Administration.  The Minister of State has used the arms of the State, nationally and internationally, to make Ireland's case in as strong, forceful and effective a manner as possible.  I support the contacts he and his Department have had with the British Government and the Ministers &mdash; John Battle and Michael Meacher &mdash; to whom he referred.  This is what the people want.  However, they want further action.</P>
    <P>The RPII has been extremely helpful in disseminating information to the public in a way that can be easily understood.  This debate can be scientific and technical and to discuss this matter properly one would need a scientific education.</P>
    <P>The health issue in County Louth is a serious one.  There is a higher incidence of death from respiratory and cardiac illnesses in County Louth than in any other county.  The North-Eastern Health Board has begun an analysis of deaths in County Louth and will compare these figures with nationally available statistics.  This important survey will not be completed for perhaps another two years.  The health board view is that these deaths are caused not by Sellafield but by the high incidence of smoking in the county.  Nevertheless, people in County Louth are worried about these health matters.  The health board is examining causes of death in each electoral division in the county, it will map this survey and attempt to discover why so many people in County Louth are dying from cancer.  The incidence of death from cancer is also higher in County Louth than in any other county.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> The fire in Windscale in 1957 ranks with the Chernobyl explosion and the Three Mile Island affair as one of the greatest health risks at a nuclear reactor.  That fire, which was an incident of major significance, occurred within 100 miles of the Irish coast.  I compliment the STAD group on taking their legal action against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.  They are doing what Governments should have done.  With great courage they fought a long battle in the Irish courts, including the Supreme Court.  They funded their campaign with the help of communities throughout the country.  They deserve our support. Fianna Fáil, in its election manifesto, promised to fund the STAD case fully.  There was no ambiguity in that undertaking.  I do not speak for the STAD group but I believe the promise to fund their legal action must be honoured.  However, the Minister said today that &ldquo;the residents have yet to confirm that they are in a position to accept the offer&rdquo;.  It is clear, therefore, that the Government's offer of financial assistance has strings attached with which the group is not happy.  The Government has made a commitment to support the County Louth residents which it must keep. The Minister's offer of help does not go far enough and I fear the Government is back-tracking on the extent of its financial commitment.  We cannot put a price on health and safety.  The Fianna Fáil Party is committed to taking every possible action but has not yet done so.  There must be no more equivocation in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister assured the House &ldquo;that the Government will keep under review the question of taking legal action against BNFL in respect of the risk to Ireland from Sellafield.  However, litigation against Sellafield raises many complex technical and legal issues.  The Government will continue to draw upon the best scientific and legal advice before deciding on litigation of such a challenging nature&rdquo;.  Could any litigation be more challenging and more beneficial to the citizens of Ireland than to force the closure of Sellafield? Could anything be more worthwhile?  The Government is equivocating and allowing the people of Ireland, and particularly of my own county, to wage the battle against BNFL.  Let us wage this battle together.  The people want nothing less.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a major agricultural country and an exporter of food.  We have a green image and have an interest in protecting our environment. An accident at Sellafield could destroy Irish agriculture for centuries.  We do not know what might happen at Sellafield but the experts tell us the greatest risk in Sellafield is that of a nuclear accident which could contaminate our environment forever.  Discharges from Sellafield are already destroying the Irish Sea which is the most radioactive sea in the world.  Technetium-99 has been found in seaweed on the Irish coast and we must use every resource to stop the damaging activities of BNFL.</P>
    <P>At the most recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Public Enterprise and Transport I proposed <Col N="869" /> that the committee invite British Nuclear Fuels Limited to explain their case to us.  While we fight the company on the legal front we must debate this issue in the Houses of the Oireachtas. From speaking to representatives of BNFL it is my understanding that the company is prepared to talk about the issue of nuclear discharges with an Oireachtas committee.  My proposal was that we invite BNFL, the RPII and Greenpeace to have a long, detailed and scientific debate on all issues relevant to this matter.  I will pursue this matter at the next meeting of the joint committee. It is a matter which could be effectively dealt with by the committee system.  We must consider every possible action in our drive to close down Sellafield.</P>
    <P>We inhabit the earth for only a short time but the radioactive contamination of the environment can continue for thousands of years.  We hold our environment in trust for future generations and if we allow it to be contaminated we destroy the lives of future generations.  We must continue this battle on every front.  We must support STAD, fight for the closure of Sellafield and take our own legal action as a state and as a government, and we must do this and do it now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MargaretCox" hpid="Ms Cox Ms Cox">
      <NameTxt>Ms Cox</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister and compliment him on his obvious commitment to X-ray nuclear research.  In the short time that he has been responsible for this portfolio he has addressed this matter and has made considerable progress on many issues.  The Government's policy is to minimise and, as far as possible, eliminate the adverse implications to Ireland of the nuclear facilities and acitivities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.  The Government is assisted in its work in this area by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  This is a professional body which provides an excellent and much needed service.  It is grant aided by the Government and provides advice to the Government on nuclear matters and information to the public on matters relating to radiological protection.  It is responsible for the licensing, custody, use and transportation of radioactive materials.  It also has responsibility for a national survey on the incidence of radon.  To this end, we are here to strengthen the licensing powers of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland relating to the use of X-ray equipment by practitioners and to extend the powers of the Minister for Public Enterprise to fix licensees in respect of licences issued by the institute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a technical but important Bill.  It is vitally important to ensure the proper operation of X-ray equipment which we see more and more in dentists', doctors' and chiropractors' surgeries, as well as in hospitals and veterinary clinics. When one visits a hospital or other area where X-ray equipment is being used, the proposed facilities must be in place to protect those using the equipment as well as those being examined and anyone accompanying them.  Pregnant women must be warned not to enter the radiological <Col N="870" /> department of a hospital to avoid exposure to radiation from X-ray machines.</P>
    <P>In its annual report the RPII identified the necessity for the institute to have powers to assess who should be licensed to use such equipment. We are addressing that anomaly through this legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State raised the important issue of nuclear energy and nuclear waste.  It is frightening to think of our closeness to the UK and the possibility of our exposure to a nuclear accident.  Such accidents have occurred before, at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in 1986.  Thanks to the commendable work of Adi Roche, we can see on an annual basis in various parts of the country the terrible damage that has been done to the people of Chernobyl and others in the Ukraine and in Belarus, particularly children.</P>
    <P>We have seen the results of nuclear accidents, but many Irish people who live far from the east coast probably do not realise there is a possibility, however remote, that this could happen to us.  Do we want to live in a land laid waste by a nuclear accident?  Do we want our children to grow up with horrific injuries and other medical problems? They may not grow up at all if they are exposed to a nuclear accident.</P>
    <P>There is a growing recognition that major difficulties are associated with the disposal of 50 years of radioactive waste.  That is one of the biggest problems we have to face.  The Minister of State has been very smart in his approach.  It would be too easy to go in with all guns blazing and tell the UK authorities they must shut down Sellafield immediately.  We must be realistic about what can be done.  There are reasons we cannot stop everything now.  That will never happen.  We have to work towards a target in a very measured way. That means what will be done will address the problem and remove the risk and danger to us.  It is vitally important that we work on all fronts to achieve that goal.</P>
    <P>The Government is working internationally with the organisations involved in nuclear policy to minimise the risk to the rest of the world involved in the production of nuclear energy. There is a grave onus on nuclear powers to ensure citizens of other countries are not killed or injured as a result of nuclear accidents.  It needs to be said repeatedly that the onus is on the nuclear powers to ensure we are safe.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State mentioned that the Government has been working with international agencies on the adoption of three new international conventions.  The Convention on Nuclear Safety, which came into force in October 1996, was ratified by Ireland, the UK and other countries.  The Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management, which Ireland, the UK and others signed, came into force at the end of September 1998.  The protocol to amend the Vienna Convention on Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage and a new Convention on Supplementary <Col N="871" /> Compensation for Nuclear Damage have also been adopted.</P>
    <P>The Minister rightly expressed his concern about Sellafield, including the proposed changes that have been mentioned.  The Government is not happy with that matter.  In a measured and focused way, the Minister of State has made his feelings known to the relevant Ministers in the United Kingdom.  I hope they will listen to what is being said and realise they cannot infringe our rights in that area.  The Sellafield nuclear plant represents an unnecessary risk to the health and safety of the Irish population.  It has to be closed through a proactive approach over time.</P>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is undertaking some excellent work on radon gas.  Senator O'Dowd stated that County Louth has a high exposure to radon gas.  In the west, counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon also have high levels of radon gas.  However, we have a very low level of awareness about it, which is one of the matters that concerns health authorities in the Western Health Board area.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive map has already been published showing areas that are exposed to radon gas.  Householders in those areas should ask the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to carry out tests to identify if radon gas levels are a cause for concern in their dwellings.  This is not intended as a scaremongering tactic.  It would certainly not do any harm, however, to make sure anyone at risk to contamination from radon gas is aware of it.</P>
    <P>The nationwide survey has almost been completed. To date, 1,500 houses have been identified as having excess levels of radon gas.  I particularly welcome the initiative by the Minister for Education and Science on the survey of radon gas in schools.  As Senator O'Dowd said, we are not here for a very long time and we hope to leave the country and the world in a sustainable state for our children and our children's children.</P>
    <P>The national plan for nuclear safety is like an insurance policy &mdash; we must have it, but we hope we will never have to use it.  I wonder who will be going into the little cement bunkers throughout the country.  Maybe that information in on a special list in a safe somewhere.</P>

      <P>We might get our names on it.  The Government is firmly committed to a policy of nuclear safety and doing what needs to be done to make sure that if the worst scenario occurs, we might have some hope of coming through it. I welcome the establishment of the ministerial committee on nuclear safety, which includes representatives of all the relevant Departments.  The committee's terms of reference are broad but its aim is to make sure that if a national nuclear emergency were to occur, we would at least know what to do and be able to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> As regards the recent controversy about masts, I have great sympathy for people in areas where mobile telephone masts are erected at Garda stations close to schools and local community facilities.  I followed this debate from the beginning and I am reassured by the bulk of international evidence which shows that radiation from such masts is less than that which comes from hand held telephone units or microwave ovens.  However, we cannot be too complacent about this issue.</P>
    <P>I recognise the fears and rights of local communities to object to what happens in their areas. However, we must not get carried away by people's hysteria.  There will always be those who will feed on a community's fears or generate hysteria for political or other reasons, which are not always linked to people's safety.  We must be careful not to get carried away on that tide.</P>
    <P>I commend the people of County Louth for taking their courage in their hands and proceeding with their campaign.  It is a courageous step for any group to go to the High Court and then to the Supreme Court, particularly if it is not sure it will be able to pay the huge bills involved.  The Minister is committed to working with this group and to ensuring that everything necessary is done. The Government cannot pay money continuously to line the pockets of barristers and solicitors in court actions.  While it is vitally important that we accommodate and support these people in their court case, which is for the good of the entire country, we cannot write a blank cheque.  People on both sides acknowledge that writing a blank cheque is not the way forward.  I commend them for their courage in taking a case against British Nuclear Fuels Limited.</P>
    <P>I support Senator O'Dowd's idea of bringing all the parties together at an Oireachtas committee meeting.  The General Council of County Councils, in association with a number of organisations in the UK, funded a survey on Sellafield which came up with amazing results.</P>
    <P>While this technical Bill gives us the opportunity to discuss many issues relating to the nuclear industry and the culture of nuclear power, it also deals with the licensing of X-ray equipment operators.  The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is doing a fine job, but there is an obvious need for control.  People have been contaminated by emissions from X-ray machines in a number of cases.  We must ensure the safety of those who use X-ray equipment and those exposed to X-rays for health reasons.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House and congratulate the Minister on the fine work he is doing in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing this valuable legislation which will strengthen the licensing power of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  This will ensure that only properly qualified people are licensed to use X-ray equipment.  I acknowledge the good work being done by the RPII.  It is an <Col N="873" /> extremely important body with responsibility for the health and welfare of the people.  Its task is to monitor and control by way of licences industry, hospitals and other bodies which use ionising radiation equipment.</P>
      <P>Our immediate concern is with the microwave radiation from masts located throughout the country.  People are concerned that this form of radiation is dangerous.  There are conflicting views on the health risks associated with it.  Many scientists believe there is no risk to people's health, yet communities are convinced that not enough research has been conducted and that little is known about this area of industry to determine the short term or long-term dangers to health.</P>
      <P>A few days ago the community in Kerrykeel in County Donegal decided it would not allow a microwave transmitter to be erected on a mast at the Garda station.  However, an ugly confrontation took place between the people and a large number of gardaí.  I agree with Senator O'Dowd that locating such masts at Garda stations is highly questionable, particularly as they are almost always located close to housing schemes, shops, schools, hospitals and recreational facilities. If one was to choose a location for a mast, that would be the last place.  They should be in isolated areas where there is little contact with people or animals.</P>
      <P>This problem stretches from one end of the country to the other.  Communities are up in arms because they feel they are not getting adequate information and they are worried about the impact these masts may have on their lives and that of their children.  I concur with the view that a moratorium should be placed on the erection of further masts at Garda stations and that a review of the industry should be undertaken.  There should be an independent assessment of the effects of microwave radiation before any further progress is made.  It may be too late if we proceed against the wishes of communities which do not seem to be consulted.</P>
      <P>It is time for action.  I ask the Minister to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  If residents continue to confront the gardaí, there will be uproar throughout the country and the Government will find it difficult to maintain its numbers in the other House.</P>
      <P>Second, the Minister of State referred to the EURATOM directive 1996 which we have to implement by May 2000.  I am glad he said we will reach that date.  Can he outline the progress he has made so far to ensure we have the nuclear safety and radiological protection directive introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of radon causes a lot of concern throughout the country.  We are now beginning to get an idea of how extensive it is; it may affect thousands of homes.  We do not know how much is in our schools because we have only carried out a preliminary analysis.  We have not put in place a mechanism to eliminate the effects of radon in <Col N="874" /> the areas it has been discovered.  We should be far more proactive.  We should have a comprehensive inventory of all buildings, particularly in the west where radon levels are excessive along the Border counties and up to County Louth where a line of abnormal levels of radon can be found.</P>
    <P>Where it has been discovered, financial incentives should be given to home owners and to the owners of any other premises &mdash; community, educational, etc &mdash; to enable them to take the necessary measures to eliminate radon.  We should embark on a nationwide policy to ensure that, where new homes are being built, radon levels are not excessive.  We need to be far more proactive than we have been with regard its elimination. A grant aided scheme would be very worthwhile.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been through bad experiences with regard to nuclear waste and nuclear processing. Many years ago we adopted the policy that we would not establish a nuclear energy station here. This was done against the wishes of the then Government and Minister for Industry.  We also stopped the station at Carransore and, thankfully, we have never looked back.  We have witnessed what happened at Three Mile Island in 1979 and at Chernobyl in more recent years.  The effects of the latter have become very evident thanks to Adi Roche and the excellent work she has done for the children of Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>Sellafield nuclear power station is on our doorstep. Senator O'Dowd spoke eloquently about the residents of County Louth and I applaud them for the work they have undertaken.  The residents had to take such action because successive Governments were not prepared to adequately support them and take the initiative to lay down a marker and stand by it, when it came to the discharges from Sellafield.  The OSPAR countries agreed in Portugal that it would be 2020 before we would move towards eliminating discharges into the European Union waters.  That is almost 22 years away and anything can happen between now and then if discharges remain at the same level.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is getting progressively worse.  It is the most radioactive body of water in the world.  We have to be far more proactive than we have been to date.  I want to see every assistance in terms of research and legal expenses given to STAD to ensure they are able to bring their action against British Nuclear Fuels to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <P>There is also scope for plenty of cross-Border co-operation on this issue.  The North and South do not have any nuclear equipment, either as weapons or for producing energy.  That is something to be admired.  We can also co-operate to seek a reduction in nuclear power, particularly for weapons to which we are totally opposed.  We should also be moving towards the reduction of nuclear power for energy purposes.  It would be worthwhile if everyone on this island could take the initiative and try to persuade our nuclear <Col N="875" /> neighbours in Europe and elsewhere to take action on that front.</P>
    <P>I commend this legislation.  I hope we can implement the European directive as quickly as possible and that we will renew our actions in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jacob.  I acknowledge his incisive and timely interventions in the ongoing controversy relating to the outflow from Sellafield and the potential health risks it poses for the people on this island.  He has not been reticent when national interests have been threatened.  Recently they were threatened by the most outrageous cavalier comments made by a representative of Sellafield but the Minister of State replied to these comments in his own inimitable Wicklow manner.  I also wish to acknowledge everyone who is at the cutting edge of keeping this issue in the public arena.  This issue is not just the concern of people living along the east coast.  It is of major concern to everyone on this island.  I am baffled that a friendly Government should allow its policy in this regard to override what are potentially very great health risks.  I encourage the Government and the Minister of State to maintain the line they have taken because I am sure they have the overwhelming support of everyone on this island.</P>
      <P>I welcome this legislation and it has been welcomed by all sides of the House.  This Bill is technical by nature but it affords us a short debate on the implications for our people in what is becoming an increasingly complex area.  We are surrounded by various types of electricity.  As a result of the development of the mobile telephone service we find that even the smallest community is exposed to modern technological innovation. It is right that not only should we have radiological protection but there should be continuous monitoring of technological innovation in this area.  Legislation should also be introduced, where necessary, on a rolling basis to ensure we are in a position to respond legally where health is concerned.</P>
      <P>This debate has afforded me an opportunity to raise the issue of mobile telephone masts.  I do not mean the debate that has been taking place. The weight of international evidence indicates that there are no potential health hazards from the siting of these masts.  Ironically, any evidence about health problems relate to the use of mobile telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned at the concentration of antennae in specific areas and the possibility that this results in increasingly higher doses of radiation. To put the matter in context, the process began with Telecom Éireann being awarded a specific mobile phone line &mdash; 088.  It was then awarded an 087 line and Esat was awarded an 086 line.  There is now a third mobile licence operator &mdash; presumably an 085 line.  It has been brought to my attention that instead of these antennae being <Col N="876" /> concentrated on one band, they emanate their power on separate bands.  Wherever there is a concentration of antennae &mdash; mostly in urban areas because that is where there is a large density of population &mdash; a very high concentration of power emanates from those antennae.  They are not concentrated on one band, they are separated and spread across four bands.  Perhaps other mobile phone operators will be granted licences which will extend this even further.</P>
    <P>I raised this question with the medical expert attached to the Department of Public Enterprise. Sadly, I did not get a specific response, but it was acknowledged that this was a valid point.  That was approximately two months ago.  Perhaps the Minister's officials will take note of what I have said and reassure people that the extension of mobile telephone licences throughout the country will not involve a health hazard.  People who live close to a high concentration of antennae and the power that emanates from them should be assured they are not a potential health hazard.</P>
    <P>A matter was brought to my attention recently by a technician who works in the telephone industry.  I will not say where this incident happened because I do not wish to cause panic &mdash; this is anecdotal evidence.  The person concerned was using a particular type of equipment for a certain purpose and the needle on the spectrum went over what he considered the acceptable amount.  I brought this incident to the attention of the Department and I would be grateful if it would consider the matter in the context of this debate.  I do not want to cause panic in relation to mobile phones.  However, while people perceive there is a health risk involved, this incident is sufficient evidence for me, as a public representative, and my colleagues to raise this concern.</P>
    <P>It has not been definitively stated there are no health risks involved.  Until this matter is cleared up, there will be a continuation of what we saw in Donegal and in my part of the country, Carrick-on-Shannon. Two groups of people have been protesting in rain, snow and frost on both sides of the Shannon &mdash; one group in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, and the other in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Roscommon.  The chairman of this group was up at 7 a.m. this morning to continue the rota which has been in place for 14 months.  I cannot understand why there has been no move to reassure people there is no risk involved.  Why should the general public, specifically this group of concerned parents, have to give up much of their time on a voluntary basis to protect the potential health of their children?</P>
    <P>This problem has arisen because the ESB has given a contract to Telecom Éireann in County Leitrim and to Esat in County Roscommon to erect masts beside schools and residential areas. Although this is not the Minister's brief, the question arises as to why the guidelines issued have not been adhered to.  I am glad of the opportunity to raise this issue and perhaps the Minister would inform us of his views on the matter.  We are dealing with something which is potentially very hazardous <Col N="877" />&mdash; particularly in relation to X-ray equipment. This was brought home to me very forcibly this summer when my six year old son had to have a series of X-rays because of a particular condition which I hope will be cured.  Questions were raised as to whether the X-rays would benefit him in the long term.  We as parents had to be reassured by a very caring medical staff in Temple Street Children's Hospital that there was no potential risk involved and that they were aware of the impact of continuous X-rays on a small body.  My experience puts this legislation in context. I can readily understand the importance of the legislation and I welcome it.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I thank Senators for their excellent contributions.  I am glad Senator O'Dowd welcomed the Bill.  He spoke at length about telephone masts.  Other Senators, including Senator Mooney, voiced their concerns.  These masts do not involve ionising radiation.  I will not comment on the matter because it is the responsibility of another Department and another Minister. As a public representative I can relate to the concerns of Senators O'Dowd, Cox, Costello and Mooney on this issue.  I will relay what has been said here today to the appropriate Minister and Department.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd mentioned Sellafield and promised to speak again on the subject later in the week.  I thank him for his comments.  It is good to know one's efforts are appreciated.</P>
      <P>The RPII was the subject of much favourable comment.  It is right that it should be complimented on the great work it is doing.  Its expertise, scientific knowledge and experience in this field are invaluable to me, my Department and other Government Departments.  It is fitting that it should be recognised and lauded in this House and the Senators who spoke here today did just that.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd and others spoke about the STAD group.  I appreciate Senator O'Dowd's interest as the group is located in his constituency. The Government has offered it funding of £400,000.  I am most anxious to facilitate those people.  I have great regard for the courage and commitment of the four people concerned, two men and two women.  I have met them regularly. I assure Senator O'Dowd and other Senators that the Government will honour its commitments relating to funding.</P>
      <P>Senator O'Dowd mentioned an invitation he extended through his committee to BNFL, Greenpeace and the RPII.  I have met representatives from Greenpeace regularly; I find it useful to meet and talk with these people.  If the Senator and his colleagues on the committee wish to meet and speak with BNFL, it is clearly a matter for the committee.  What better way is there of seeking information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Cox also mentioned STAD, to which I also referred.  She rightly identifies the main purpose <Col N="878" /> of the Bill.  It is vitally important that radiological protection is ensured in hospitals and industry.  This was particularly clear from Senator Mooney's personalised contribution about his six year old son.  Strong and effective regulation is essential and that will be brought about through what is contained in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox also referred to the horrific accident at Chernobyl.  If it did nothing else, it raised an air of urgency in Ireland.  It has alerted us to the concern we should have about the risks of nuclear power generally.  No matter how remote the possibility of a Chernobyl type incident closer to our shores, we need to be alert at all times. That is the up side of that extraordinary and terrible incident at Chernobyl.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Cox that the onus is on the nuclear industry to prove that it is safe.  I have made that point and will continue to make it.  All Senators stated that we should keep pressure on UK Ministers.  That pressure has been applied and it will continue to be applied.</P>
    <P>Senator Cox and Senator Costello spoke about radon gas.  The RPII is doing its best to stimulate public awareness which is important.  It will co-operate with everybody who wishes to have a survey carried out in their homes.  Senators referred to other actions taken by the RPII, to which I referred in my speech, particularly the initiative taken by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Martin, with regard to schools.</P>
    <P>I noted Senator Costello's views on radon gas. He spoke about a grant-aided scheme.  Personally, I would welcome such a scheme but that has not been possible to date because of Exchequer constraints.  I propose to continue to seek such a scheme.  In the meantime, we will do everything possible in conjunction with the RPII and the Department to ensure the public is made thoroughly aware of the dangers and the possible hazards involved, particularly in those areas where radon gas is found.</P>
    <P>Senator Costello expressed the desire that we have a proactive approach to the campaign against Sellafield.  I assure him that I have been extremely proactive on this matter.  I would point to the OSPAR meeting in July of this year at which ground breaking progress was made.  It will be invaluable in securing the virtual elimination of discharges in time.  We want to build on that and expedite that process.</P>
    <P>Senator Mooney spoke about the telephone masts which concern everybody.  I appreciate why the Senator, like his colleagues, raised the matter. Non-ionising radiation does not come within the scope of the RPII or of this Bill but there is an onus on all of us to highlight the situation and allay the fears of the public.</P>
    <P>I thank the Senators for their contributions and look forward to interacting with them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It gives me great pleasure to bring before the House an historic Bill that seeks to honour the fine work of a friend of Ireland.  The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund Bill acknowledges the efforts of a man who has contributed much to the cause of peace on this island.  Simultaneously, it brings into existence a scholarship fund which will enrich the lives of young people for generations to come and strengthen the close bonds between Ireland and the United States of America.</P>
      <P>I am sure we have all heard of the Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University.  In almost a century of existence, it has allowed some of the world's finest minds to live the Oxford experience and to circulate in an educational ambit of which they might otherwise have been ignorant.  It has consistently proved itself of immense benefit to the individual scholar, his or her Oxford college and to society as a whole.  Its prestige is unrivalled.  Former recipients include world leaders and some of the most eminent writers and thinkers of our time.</P>
      <P>I am proud to bring before the House a Bill to establish our version of the Rhodes Scholarship &mdash; the George J. Mitchell Scholarship.  Once in operation, this programme will allow young American scholars to experience the Irish higher education system and to contribute their energies and talents to it.  The individual scholar will benefit, the Irish higher education system will benefit and the ties between Ireland and the United States will be further strengthened.  All of these benefits will accrue, while establishing a permanent reminder of the good works of Senator Mitchell on our behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>George Mitchell has had a celebrated career, not only as a senator and lawyer, but as a peacemaker. His was the guiding hand behind the Good Friday Agreement.  His principles set the tone for that Agreement and the peace process in Northern Ireland bears the stamp of his integrity. Through his efforts, and those of General de Chastelain and Prime Minister Harri Holkeri, we have seen unprecedented change in the way our two traditions regard each other and in the way they regard themselves.  We have seen Unionist and Nationalist come together at the table of <Col N="880" /> Government.  We have seen the leader of unionism standing side by side with the Taoiseach on the steps of Government Buildings.  In addition, Prime Minister Tony Blair became the first British Prime Minister to address the Oireachtas. These were historic moments, images without precedent in the course of Irish history.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland have endorsed the Good Friday Agreement as the only legitimate charter to guide and direct our efforts now and for the future as we seek to build a new agreed Ireland, North and South.  The voice of the people, spoken by the living representatives of the two great traditions of this island, has redefined Ireland.  Their collective verdict transcends not just the Anglolrish Agreement but the whole 1920-21 settlement.</P>
    <P>The endorsement of the people allows us all to approach the new millennium with hope and optimism that we have bridged the divisions of the past and that we can now begin the work of building true and lasting peace and prosperity together on this island.  Bertrand Russell said the only thing that would redeem mankind was co-operation. It is precisely that realisation, together with the resilience and vision of Senator Mitchell, that has brought us to where we are today.  The idea that Nationalists and Unionists could sit together in the same chamber as part of a putative power-sharing arrangement, would have seemed farfetched only a few short years ago. Yet, there is an assembly in Northern Ireland, there has been an agreement and there is a First and Deputy First Minister.  Co-operation is on the agenda and redemption is within reach.</P>
    <P>It required people of vision to advance the North from 30 years of stalemate to a position of hope.  Visionaries on both sides of the politicocultural divide have seen the opportunity for progress and, guided by Senator Mitchell's tenacity, have taken us to the cusp of a new era.  Uniquely, he has helped us to help ourselves and the people of Ireland, North and South, have every reason to be grateful to him.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that we honour the good works of Senator Mitchell with the establishment of this scholarship in his name.  In the same way that he has helped us to seek out the best in ourselves, this scholarship will reward the best, mostrounded young people of their generations, cementing the bonds between Ireland and the United States.  It will also be seen as a declaration &mdash; a statement that we have learned from the errors of the past and that we are prepared to embark on a new era of co-operation, internationally and at home.  I commend this Bill to the House in the name of tolerance, progress and reconciliation.</P>

      <P>This Bill will be greeted with enthusiasm on all sides.  It was born of happy and hopeful circumstances and is one of the appropriate ways to honour the contribution of Senator George Mitchell.  He has been a great benefactor to the Irish people, North and South.  He has taught us a great deal, not least about the arts of conciliation, compromise and negotiation and the great quality of patience.  He has been prepared to listen and to let all sides make their case to prove that even in the most unhopeful circumstances, there can be, and often is, common ground.</P>
      <P>It is good to know these scholarships will be another lasting legacy to Senator Mitchell as a person and a statesman.  The Minister mentioned the Rhodes and Fulbright scholarships.  I might have some reservations about Cecil Rhodes, particularly after the recent television series. However, in the case of Senator Fulbright, scholarships are solid and lasting legacies to the memory of these people.</P>
      <P>As someone with personal experience of scholarship exchanges, I know how lasting can be the value of such exchanges.  I had occasion to work in Paris and Florida on exchanges.  It is not just the contribution that one makes coming from one's own country but the friendships, insights and values that one brings back which make a lasting contribution.  They are important in cementing understanding and friendships which last a long time.</P>
      <P>State funding for the scholarship is generous but not overly so.  However, the scheme would not be possible without this funding which will continue.  It is envisaged that private funding for these scholarships will be welcome and significant. There will be no shortage of such funding as the scheme has gripped the imagination of many corporate bodies and will be on a sound financial basis from the outset.  I hope corporate Ireland will be as generous as it appears some of the major US groups will be.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that private and corporate funding, particularly for third level education, is becoming a crucial element in the overall picture. I pay tribute to some of the Irish benefactors of recent years.  These people may come in for criticism in other walks of life, some &mdash; perhaps much &mdash; of which, is legitimate.  However, they have led by example in ploughing back their money into the development of higher education.</P>
      <P>Dr. A. J. F. O'Reilly is an example of such a person.  I do not approve of much of what happens in some of his newspapers or his policies in the last election.  However, he has been a major benefactor to third level education.  The O'Reilly Institute at Trinity College and the O'Reilly Hall in UCD, at which the Minister was a recent guest, are significant contributions to the work of universities and there are many other areas which benefit from Dr. O'Reilly's funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Michael Smurfit has made an endowment to the graduate business school in UCD and another major endowment at UCC.  I am sure other <Col N="882" /> endowments will follow from him.  Lochlann Quinn recently donated £3 million for the development of the commerce undergraduate school at UCD.  Senator Edward Haughey has and continues to make a significant contribution to the development of veterinary sciences at UCD.  I am skimming the surface as all our universities have been recipients of large donations from Irish people.  It has not only been a case of receiving funding from abroad, there have been significant contributions from Irish leaders of industry.  Contributions of this sort would have been unheard of ten or 15 years ago as they were not part of our culture.  Happily they now are.</P>
    <P>I become impatient at some of the carping reactions to contributions of this sort.  I spent some time trying to raise such funds at UCD.  It was often dispiriting to put forward carefully worked out proposals and go out with a begging bowl seeking large contributions only to see the motives of those contributing frequently sniped at and misrepresented.  In every case I can think of, the motives of those who gave funds were up front, clear and without any hint of hidden agendas.  It is good that we have reached a stage when the Irish corporate sector and wealthy Irish individuals are thinking more of how they can put back into society some of what they have derived from it, particularly with regard to third level institutions.</P>
    <P>In my experience much of the effort in the fund raising operations of Irish third level institutions overseas is wasteful and duplicated.  I speak only of third level institutions as that is the area I know best.  The same people are targeted over and over again.  The overall interests of Irish third level education might benefit from a greater sharing of resources and an approach similar to that of the Ireland Fund.  It should not be too difficult for those in Irish third level &mdash; as a small number of institutions are involved &mdash; to decide their main targets and objectives and have one central headquarters in the United States which could have a list of people to target who might be in a position to contribute rather than all of them targeting the same people.  This can create a sense of irritation when the same people are asked over and over again.</P>
    <P>I discussed this idea with the Ireland Fund some years ago and it made small progress but did not get any further.  It could be revisited. People may say it is better to have competing groups.  However the size of the Irish diaspora in the United States is so huge that the number of Irish people now coming into positions of prominence is enormous and greater than at any time in history.  Therefore the resources needed to reach these people are large.  If third level institutions pooled their resources, they might be able to extend the range of their potential targets and the overall result might be better.  Many people have no loyalty to an individual institution.  They want to invest in the progress of this country and they are more likely to be impressed if there is a more co-operative approach.  I want to mark the <Col N="883" /> fact that much of the funding for these scholarships will come from the private sector.  I welcome that very much.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on the speed with which he brought the Bill to the House.  The Bill is brief and to the point.  It covers all that is necessary. I look forward to this scheme being a great and lasting success.</P>

      <P>I thank Senator Manning for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister to the House.  I welcome the Government providing funds for the George Mitchell scholarship and I welcome the amendments.  They are appropriate. They extend the remit of the Bill, not just into the university sector but to other appropriate third level institutions.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, no other American has made a bigger contribution to Ireland in terms of hands-on application over a considerable time.  It is very important and welcome that we honour and recognise that contribution to peace on this island.  Senator Mitchell's qualities contributed so much to the Good Friday Agreement and to bringing about that which seemed to us to be irreconcilable for so many centuries.  That required the inordinately finely honed skills of Senator Mitchell.  His negotiating skills, determination and vision all contributed.  He was the American in Belfast who, with the other American in Washington, made a tremendous contribution.</P>
      <P>A few years ago who would have thought the United States could have made such a contribution to peace on this island?  It was unthinkable. Who would have thought the Prime Minister of Great Britain could have made such a contribution?  We must also acknowledge the contribution of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It helps to take the cynicism out of politics.  We are so used to hearing that all politicians are self-seekers and have nothing on their minds other than satisfying their own personal ambitions and needs that it is great to see somebody can make such a lasting and self-effacing contribution to a very important solution to a conflict.  It reminds one of Plato's theory that politics is the high point of wisdom and the pinnacle of the achievement of citizenship and that by reaching a high level of wisdom one should be able to enter politics and be in a position of leadership.  We must seek this type of target to get away from the debasement of the description and perception of politics and the portrayal of politicians in the media.  Senator Mitchell has substantially contributed to putting politics on the pinnacle in terms of his vision and ability to deliver the goods in a difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we recognise this educational foundation, fund and scholarship as the vision that brings about a resolution of this nature and that it is the highest point of education.  As Senator Manning stated, it is also important that we involve the private sector as much as possible so that the State is not always the only body <Col N="884" /> responsible for putting funds into education.  I commend the Minister for being good at doing that &mdash; establishing a scientific fund &mdash; and inviting the private sector to contribute.  It would be welcome if we could get a social guarantee from the business community &mdash; this happens in many other countries &mdash; where a small percentage, even a fraction of 1 per cent, of annual profits is directed into worthwhile community projects or education.  Education is the most desirable of all community activities into which it could be directed.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we are marking the legacy of Senator Mitchell in this fashion.  It is the right way forward.  Perhaps in the fullness of time we might establish a George Mitchell professorship on this island to deal with conflict resolution and reconciliation. It could be a beacon for the world.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome the Minister to the House and congratulate him for bringing this fine Bill before the House to establish the George Mitchell scholarship fund, an acknowledgement and recognition of the work of this fine Senator who came here in difficult times.  His qualities of patience and determination and his sense of humour in understanding the Irishness of how we work came into play to bring the two traditions together in the peace process and form the Good Friday Agreement.  This Bill is an acknowledgement of his achievements.  It is great we are acknowledging the work of this fine man.</P>
      <P>This is about educating post-graduates.  I welcome the concept of bonding the two countries closer with post-graduate research work.  This will be acknowledged and popular in America where our education is system is widely acknowledged.  I was delighted to read the candidates will come from selected universities.  That is important.  It is also important that the research will be of merit to them and to this country.  Very often post-graduate work does not contribute much.  I would hate to think we would not get good value for our money.</P>
      <P>This is a worthwhile project and I commend the Government for acknowledging George Mitchell's contribution so quickly.  I endorse the Minister's speech he said it all.  I commend the Bill.  It is great that we are here to honour such a great man.</P>

      <P>This is a good Bill which will be of enormous value to graduates from abroad.  It will give them an opportunity to broaden their horizons and get a greater understanding of other societies.  The implementation and operation of the fund should be examined.  I ask the Minister to ensure it is not availed of by only a privileged few.  I am sure the criteria and parameters for <Col N="885" /> qualification for the scholarship have been set down.</P>
      <P>The Bill acknowledges the tremendous work of George Mitchell in the peace process.  This is a fitting tribute to him and I congratulate the initiator of the Bill.  George Mitchell has had an outstanding career as a lawyer, Senator and peacemaker.  He was the guiding light of the Good Friday Agreement as the Mitchell Principles set the tone for it.  He brought about an accommodation of opinion and belief which, without his abilities, would not have been possible. We must be forever grateful for that.  We are in a tentative position as we speak.  However, I hope we can all find our way through the impasse and that the good work done by George Mitchell will not go to waste.</P>
      <P>George Mitchell brought a great range of talent to the peace process.  He showed kindness and tolerance in all circumstances.  He gave of his time to everyone equally and treated everyone with equal tolerance, even when points of view, which conflicted with his own, were outrageous in the extreme.  Those virtues might be seen as outdated today.  However, he was be able to maintain a dialogue even at the worst of times when people were poles apart.  It took a man of a special calibre and tolerance to maintain his objectives without losing sight of them &mdash; peace and reconciliation in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate that his good work is honoured today with the establishment of this scholarship in his name.  I hope that, among the great people benefiting from the scholarship, there may be another George Mitchell who will bring to bear the same virtues and abilities he has shown, to our benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister, the speed with which he introduced this Bill and with which he spoke today.  I have a major problem with the Bill which should not stop me from welcoming it in general terms and paying a sincere tribute to George Mitchell.  The best praise one can offer is that at the end of the process, he emerged in the eyes of everyone involved as an impartial broker who added immeasurably to the results achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, that is not the way it started, it started completely differently.  At the beginning, George Mitchell was viewed with suspicion by Unionists as a kind of an American trojan horse with Irish republicans inside.  Some Unionists saw him as the manifestation of strong arm tactics by the United States Government, which many Americans saw as taking sides in the Northern Ireland question.  Having started with such perceptions against him from one side of the divide, it was a remarkable achievement, and one we cannot help but praise, that he was able to destroy those perceptions and gain the confidence <Col N="886" /> of everyone in the process.  I would love to know how he achieved this &mdash; there are lessons to be learnt by all of us.  He achieved a great deal given the point from which he started.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a scholarship fund in honour of George Mitchell is a great idea.  However, the Minister drew a comparison with the famous Rhodes scholarships, to which Senator Manning also referred.  I would not push that analogy too far.  In <i>Scramble for Africa,</i> Thomas Pakenham told a story about Rhodes.  He was a bit of a rogue and I am not sure whether George Mitchell would be pleased to be likened to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say anything about that &mdash; Rhodes was a rogue.  I will now explain the problem I have with the Bill in its present form. I hope I will be able to convince the Minister to think this through.</P>
      <P>Some Government amendments have been put down as a result of the debate in the Dáil last week.  The Bill as originally drafted envisaged that the scholarship recipients would pursue research only in the universities named in the 1992 Act &mdash; universities in the Republic.  In the other House, the Minister generously accepted the argument that this should be extended to all institutes of higher education, not just universities. I compliment him on his readiness to amend the Bill in response to representations.  I have no problem extending the remit of the Bill in that way.  I congratulate the Minister for listening to and accepting those suggestions.</P>
      <P>However, I am shocked at what we are left with.  Under the Bill, even as amended, scholarships will be restricted to educational institutions &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;, a phrase used twice.  American students will be able to pursue their studies in any higher education institution provided it is in the Republic.  This is astounding &mdash; a scholarship fund which honours the work of George Mitchell with a specifically partitionist remit.  A student who wishes to pursue research into conflict resolution in a Northern Ireland institution will be disqualifed by the Bill we are about to pass from getting a scholarship.  Even if they want to undertake part of their study in the North, they will not be funded.  I do not understand how this can be envisaged.  There must be a way around it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no legal reason the scholarships should not also be tenable in a Northern Irish institution. There is no territorial invasion involved.  Every university in the world has scholarships funded from abroad, as Senator Manning said.  No one raises an eyebrow when universities accept scholarships <Col N="887" /> from abroad.  We should not use legal advice as an excuse for not doing this.  We can and must do it.  I am not sure how the Minister will find a way around this.  It would be against the meaning of George Mitchell's work to make education partitionist in this way.  Otherwise, we are undermining the entire basis of George Mitchell's work for Ireland.  He succeeded in bridging the two traditions.  Should we honour him by creating scholarships which deepen that divide? Of course not.</P>
    <P>We should also look at this from a practical point of view.  It is likely that many American students interested in researching conflict resolution in Ireland may want to carry out their research in Northern Ireland.  That after all is where the main trouble has been for the past 80 years.  Many people attracted to the subject would think of going to Northern Ireland first &mdash; it would not be an unusual choice.  That being so, how will the reputation of these scholarships fair when candidates discover that built into this scheme is a geographic bias which reflects exactly the divisions of our island and which the peace process is designed to address?</P>
    <P>My mother came from County Armagh, my father came from County Down and my cousins are all in the North and do not recognise a boundary in so many different ways.  I have huge problems with those furthest from the Border and who seem to think that Border exists.  I am not suggesting the Minister has a partitionist attitude but a partitionist attitude is almost ingrained in people in the South.  We must work hard to ensure that does not happen.  It would be simple to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>With such a restriction, it will be very difficult for the scholarships to achieve the reputation and the standing I hope for them and which they clearly deserve.  The achievement of George Mitchell demands of us that we think again on this point.  It is not as if it would be hard to fix, and I would rely on the Minister's advice.  We would have to replace only the now long list of institutions to read &ldquo;an institution of high education in Ireland&rdquo; and in the Long Title, to replace the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo;. Surely we could take out the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; and replace them with &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; or just take out the words &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; and not limit it to that this afternoon.</P>
    <P>How can we tell students that if they are coming to Ireland to study, they should not go across the Border because their funding will be stopped? We are building into legislation a partitionist attitude which is against everything for which Senator Mitchell stood.  With one stroke of the pen, we could remove this absurdity and put in place a system of scholarships which reflect fully the greatness of Senator Mitchell's contribution.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to take that step which I believe he can take.  I do not believe there is a simple solution with which we could come up by putting heads together for a few minutes.  I worry <Col N="888" /> when the Minister looks at me with concern because I know he is a man who loves a challenge and I am sure he will grab this one in the next ten or 15 minutes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and agree with the great praise paid to Senator Mitchell who was such an important catalyst in the peace process.  I would also like to mention Trina Vargo, the woman whose idea this scholarship fund was and whose energy, enthusiasm and, as some Senators will know, use of the e-mail spurred us into doing a little work towards this scheme.  From the time she began to take an interest in Ireland, she could see the advantages of getting more people in America to take a deeper interest in Ireland, and this she felt was the best way to progress this.  I compliment her on the work she did not only when she was in Senator Kennedy's office but, subsequently, working on the fund.</P>
      <P>While the fund is for American students, it is really a method for making friends for Ireland because that is what will happen.  The younger the age we can make these friends, the better.  Friends who have reached this stage intellectually and educationally in the United States are bound to be extremely influential at a certain stage.</P>
      <P>Research is extremely important in education and the more we co-operate in this regard with America, Great Britain or on the two parts of this island, the better.  I share Senator Quinn's concern. I thought the scholarships could be taken up in the universities in Northern Ireland but apparently that is not so.</P>
      <P>It is a pity this island does not try to co-operate more, outside this scheme, as regards research but blocks are put in the way.  While I speak for the medical and scientific areas only, if people in Northern Ireland raise funds locally, they are often given more government aid if they co-operate with another British university rather than with one south of the Border.  These simple solutions to cross-Border concerns should be addressed rather than getting into the complications about which we sometimes hear blocking the way to the peace process.</P>
      <P>As president of the Irish Association, I have been involved in cross-Border initiatives funded by the peace and reconciliation fund with money from the European Union involving co-operation and discussions between second level schools from both traditions on both sides of the Border. We have got groups together to talk and try to understand each other's aspirations and fears, which is extraordinarily worthwhile.  This is a process with which we must go on.  So often when we think bridges have been crossed, we find large gaps and we must go back over the process again. Anything which encourages co-operation among people from educational institutions in this State and elsewhere and among cross-Border institutions, must be encouraged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be good if the Minister could accept Senator Quinn's amendment.  The idea of excluding Northern universities from this scheme seems <Col N="889" /> unusual.  Looking at the Minister's puzzled face, he will probably tell us there is some reason he cannot do so.  I congratulate the Minister on the speed with which he brought this Bill forward and I know Trina Vargo is delighted with it.</P>

      <P>Failtím roimh an Bille seo agus fáiltím freisin roimh an scoláireacht atá in omós d'fhear a dhein cion fir ar son na hÉireann agus ar son gach éinne ar an oileán seo.  Im thuairimse do chruthaigh George Mitchell arís an dlúth-bhaint agus an cáirdeas a bhí idir na Stáit Aontaithe agus an tír seo.  Is deá-scéala é i slí agus is deá-chomhartha é freisin gur cuimhneachán oideachais seachas leacht chuimhneacháin atá i gceist.  Molaim an tAire mar gheall ar sin.</P>
      <P>The abiding image I have of George Mitchell is one of a man of innate decency &mdash; a wily but benevolent negotiator who used his skills for the betterment of a country not his own.  That is a wonderful demonstration of the great links which exit between the United States and Ireland.  We all saw him as a man of dignity and of determination. All these qualities made an important contribution to the solution which emerged from the negotiations.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased a monument of stone was not suggested to commemorate and celebrate what George Mitchell did for Ireland because an education type project has an organic dimension which will grow and develop with time.  When the beneficiaries of the scholarships embark on their chosen careers, I have no doubt they will continue, in many ways, to talk of George Mitchell and to emulate his skills and goodness.  There is not a person on this island who could genuinely say that without George Mitchell we would have been as successful in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement.  Another person may not have had the patience which Senator Mitchell demonstrated.</P>
      <P>It is very easy at this stage to forget the difficult times.  As we watched television bulletins and got the pessimistic assessments of where the negotiations stood, we all felt that they could end in a cul-de-sac.  At all times, the confident smile and reassuring stature of George Mitchell tended to come to the fore and give a new impetus to those negotiations and discussions.  It is to be hoped that recent hiccups will be short term and that perhaps in the coming days we will see the fruition of what George Mitchell attempted to achieve.  Many said he was attempting the impossible because at times it seemed so against the background of decades of difficulties and troubles and centuries of history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>George Mitchell was not in his tender years when he came to Ireland.  He already had a brilliant political and legal career behind him.  He must have realised he was entering the lion's den and that it was not going to be an easy task.  It would have been easier for him to have refused the request of the President of the United States, to have lived a more comfortable and easier existence and not to have come to Ireland and <Col N="890" /> tempted fate with the challenges awaiting him here.  This was an indication of the greatness of the man because he had little to achieve personally. He obviously had no political focus when he first came here.  It was evident from the offers made to him subsequently in his own political circles in the United States and which he declined that he had no outstanding political ambitions. Therefore, one must assume he came here with the purest of motives &mdash; to help in a very difficult situation.  He had a negotiating background and had been successful in other arenas.  In those, the difficulties were not always as clear or as long standing as those in Ireland.  A man who could gain the credit and admiration of all traditions on this island as he did had to be an especially good negotiator.</P>
    <P>Listening to his farewell speech, no one could be in any doubt that he had developed a certain affection for the country.  He has returned to Ireland on a number of occasions since and it can be sensed at all times that, in terms of Ireland's welfare, he has a desire that it should succeed and that the historical obstacles which prevented further progress should be removed.  The introduction of a Bill to create a scholarship to honour, commemorate and celebrate George Mitchell is what he would have desired.</P>
    <P>It also sends another potent message by helping to underline the vibrancy of education in Ireland.  I have always felt proud when travelling abroad when people say we have one of the best education systems in the world and that anyone who comes through Irish education and travels abroad is able to hold their own with the best in any walk of life or career.  Therefore, to suggest a memorial rooted and integrated in that status of Ireland is good for Ireland itself.</P>
    <P>We all rejoiced at, and were relieved by, the success of the Good Friday Agreement and are optimistic for the future.  That percolated not only through the communities on the island but also to the millions of people of Irish extraction abroad.  We were not exercising or performing within the small, restricted arena of the island but were being watched carefully and closely, not only by the millions of Irish extraction but also by the many friends of Ireland throughout the world who wished us well in this regard.  I hope no one prevents that movement forward.  Each person who voted in the referenda and all who lent their support to the Good Friday Agreement does not want to return to what existed prior to George Mitchell's involvement.  The greatest memorial we could develop and erect to him would be to bring the Agreement to fruition.  The House should send out that message at every opportunity because we owe it not only to those who suffered in the past and who were affected by the tragedies but also to future generations.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, especially the scholarship project, because there could be no better memorial to celebrate and commemorate George Mitchell.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is an appropriate commemoration of the contribution made by George Mitchell, the extraordinary dexterity he showed throughout negotiations about which people can only have nightmares, how he brought them to a conclusion and the manner in which he wound up the debate.  Great tributes have been paid in this debate to him and to his skill.  His last contribution to the final plenary gathering under his chairmanship during which he remembered without notes every single contributor, even predecessors of people in office at the time, such as Foreign Ministers, Ministers for Justice and junior Ministers, showed an extraordinary completeness and inclusiveness.  Anyone would feel privileged that a scholarship has been established in their honour and Senator Mitchell's reaction when it was announced by both Presidents during the year bore witness to that.</P>
      <P>This is a hugely important step forward.  The importance of study as a tool to understanding, greater progress and for moving forward ideas is something of which we have lost sight.  Boston College recently organised for members of the Assembly in Northern Ireland to attend a series of seminars about which the Minister is aware and in which he played a role.  I spoke to people responsible for giving the seminars and they felt they had learned a great deal.  The seminars were organised in such a way that they did not know who was on what side of the political divide.  They dealt with them as a group trying to address and focus on something.  What is attractive about the scholarship is that an outsider, who will by their nature be objective, will focus on the multi-faceted jewel of Irish culture and try to come to terms with it.  They will undoubtedly miss some aspects but they will develop others and create a new awareness for us.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have seen this happen before have learned from it.  One of my greatest pleasures since entering the House 12 years ago was meeting the IPA interns attached to our offices, asking them their views on Ireland when they arrive &mdash; what they felt before they arrived, what were their first impressions &mdash; asking them what they were after six months here and seeing the growth and development of thought, understanding and ideas.  When I saw this legislation, I thought it was a good way of moving matters further forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It comes down to the value of words.  We talk about people wanting a united Ireland, what is a united Ireland?  The number of people in Northern Ireland who have answered that question &mdash; even in their own minds &mdash; is miniscule.  It does not enter their vocabulary.  They are not sure what it is they are looking for or are opposed to when discussing a united Ireland.  Is it a unity of minds, a political unity, a cultural unity or some sort of apartheid?  Studies of this nature could bring about attractive methods that could be useful in the North.  The idea is to bring to bear outside perspectives which will look at new models and put forward proposals for new protocols, new <Col N="892" /> apparatus and new structures of Government to create debate on our approach to the problems in the North.  We as politicians, more than anyone else, must know that at the end of each day all argument, strife and war concludes through discussion on a particular topic which requires concentrated thought and people who will assimilate information, make judgments and move forward.</P>
    <P>What we have not been doing, and could do, is taking a structured approach to problem solving. We should define the problem &mdash; something we, as politicians, are not good at because very often the so-called problem is dumped in our laps &mdash; understand it and put together all available and related information which could have a bearing on the matter.  We could then look at the alpha and omega of the problem, taking into account the possible alternatives, options, routes, directions or ways of moving it forward.  Finally, we must exercise judgment in deciding the best or most appropriate solution to reaching the determined objective.  That kind of intellectual approach to problem solving, particularly political problem solving, does not happen because no group is required to do so.  Politicians are forced by the day-to-day exigencies of political life to find quick solutions and to move things forward.</P>
    <P>The idea of a considered, studied approach to issues by people who avail of the funds and scholarships available under this Bill is hugely attractive. There is a sense of excitement among us all at the idea of taking fresh minds, objective and detached people to study Irish life and report on it.  We will find they will look through a different pair of spectacles or take a different perspective. We have turned the telescope on each other; we are looking through a different lens.  This is hugely important.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to comment on my next point &mdash; I presume it arises under article 2. While I would hate to see the Bill's intention being narrowed in any way, it would be useful if what might be the most appropriate issues of study are dealt with by way of schedule.  I do not want to see the introduction of another American scholarship to work out the 24 million interpretations of what Joyce meant in Ulysses or some aspects of Anglo-Irish literature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I would hate to think this scholarship would be set at such a high intellectual level that it would not inform American citizens and people visiting this country of <Col N="893" /> the multi-faceted nature of Irish society.  I want to endorse that point which was well made by Senator O'Toole.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on it.</P>
      <P>My first reaction to the points made about replacing the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; with &ldquo;Ireland&rdquo; is that we are a sovereign State and have initiated this wonderful innovative legislation.  We cannot legislate for Northern Ireland or extend this legislation to it.  This is a constitutional issue, but I am sure the Minister can deal with it.</P>
      <P>I was particularly interested in the reference by the Minister to Rhodes scholars.  Some of my colleagues who contributed earlier referred to the fact that President Clinton is a Rhodes scholar. Another famous gentleman, Kris Kristofferson, who shares one of President Clinton's non-political interests, country music, is also a Rhodes scholar.  He is now recognised as one of the finest songwriters in the American folk genre.  His songs have been rerecorded right across the musical spectrum.  If those two illustrious gentlemen, President Clinton who, coming from Arkansas, is an avowed country music fan and Kris Kristofferson, who is a country music writer, got together it might open up a whole range of possibilities. Perhaps the Minister could include a cultural input in the Bill by way of schedule or it could be done by the committee set up to oversee the scholarship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was anxious to contribute to this debate because I felt it was important that as many Members as possible should be on record acknowledging the outstanding contributions made not only by Senator Mitchell, to whom this Bill relates, but by the entire American political establishment to the peace process.  It is easy for us to have a cosy, self-satisfied, smug attitude about American involvement in the peace process. The fact is that until President Clinton assumed power no previous American President had taken such a hands-on, proactive involvement in Irish affairs &mdash; not even the much vaunted John Fitzgerald Kennedy &mdash; simply because of what was called the &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; between the American State Department and the British Foreign Office and American-British history which started, not in 1776 but as recently as 1939 and the World War II experience. That special relationship, while it is maintained and I have no wish to disparage it, has also been moved side of stage to allow the very real aspirations of the people of this island to be heard in the office of the most powerful political personage in the world.  From that point of view, we should acknowledge the wider American contribution and the continuing involvement by President Clinton, the American political establishment, not only at White House level but in both Houses of Congress, and the fine Irish-American Congressmen and Senators who have continued to put the Irish agenda to the forefront of American politics.  In some cases no political advantage was gained but in others advantages were gained. Contributions have also been made by Ben Gilman <Col N="894" />&mdash; an American who has a strong interest in Middle Eastern affairs &mdash; not only because of his position as chairman of the Foreign Relations Commission but because a number of his staff are Irish and because of Congressmen, like Peter King and others, who have kept the Irish agenda to the fore.  This debate involves more than George Mitchell, a fine and wonderful man, it involves an acknowledgement of the continuing American involvement in Irish affairs.  Long may that involvement continue because America has been an influence for good.</P>
    <P>I am a former emigrant and I have strong links with Irish groups in America.  The members of those groups see themselves as being American first but Irish at heart.  They are proud that their President and members of the US Congress are proactively involved in Irish affairs and they have worked for centuries to keep the Irish agenda at the forefront of American political life.</P>
    <P>The George Mitchell Scholarship Fund will have tremendous advantages.  I understand that up to 24 students may come to Ireland to study Irish affairs at any one time under the scheme.  I foresee a long-term political advantage &mdash; I say this in the party sense &mdash; for Ireland in this because it has already been indicated that once President Clinton is no longer centre stage there may be no guarantee that Irish interests will have the same influence on Capitol Hill which they enjoyed in the past six years, despite the fact that Vice-President Gore, heir apparent to the Democratic Party's presidential nomination who may eventually serve in the White House as President, has a strong interest in Irish affairs due to his upbringing in Tennessee.</P>
    <P>We are setting in train something with much wider implications than mere intellectual or academic advantages; we are initiating a process which will bring people involved in American academia to this country.  When these people return home &mdash; having completed their research and been awarded with degrees &mdash; to enter the wider world and earn a living, they will have a strong sense of place.  They will gain this in much the same way President Clinton gained his early political education at college in Oxford.  Mr. Clinton has repeatedly stated that he became involved in anti-Vietnam demonstrations in London during his stay in Britain in the late 1960s. That action was held against him by his political opponents when he first campaigned for the Presidency.</P>
    <P>I would like to believe that the Minister's initiative will create long-term benefits for Ireland in the higher echelons of political, business and social life in America.  While we may bemoan the loss of a good friend in President Clinton and hope that his successor will have a similar impact on Irish affairs, I believe this initiative will make an important contribution to ensuring that Irish affairs remain at the forefront of American establishment thinking across the various areas to which I referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> The Minister is to be complimented for introducing the legislation.  I have not dwelt to a great extent on the merits of George Mitchell because they have already been commented upon more than adequately by other Members.  However, I must point out that Mo Mowlam, Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in my presence at a plenary session of a British-Irish body in York paid tribute to George Mitchell by providing an insight into the nature of the man.  She stated that on one occasion she entered his office totally frustrated by what she perceived as a lack of progress. She stated in her own way &mdash; everyone is aware of Mo Mowlam's temperament &mdash; that her frustration was beginning to manifest itself physically when she entered the office.  George Mitchell, who was sitting behind his desk with a pleasant smile on his face, listened to what she had to say before saying, in a calm and reassuring voice, &ldquo;Mo, sit down and we'll talk about it.&rdquo;.  Dr. Mowlam stated that it was a measure of the man that he could see through her frustration and impatience and was able to cut to the chase.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin) Micheál Martin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. Martin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions to the debate and for the warm and deserved tributes they paid to Senator Mitchell.  I will take on board a number of the points they made.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning made a fair point about the need for the universities and other higher education institutions to reflect on how they raise funds, particularly in the United States and the international arena.  He also stated that a more collective effort in terms of satisfying strategic objectives, both of the country and the sector, might bear more fruit.</P>
      <P>To a certain extent, the recently announced R&amp;D initiative which will involve an investment of £75 million from the State and £75 million from the private sector is aiming to take that route.  The universities will be surrendering money they raise individually to a collective pool and the international panel will assess the projects which come forward from the various universities, which must be in accordance with their strategic objectives, etc.  As already stated, some of the money will go into a collective pool and whoever meritoriously wins, will do so in terms of the value of their project.  The Senator's point about five or six people being obliged to knock on the same doors is valid.</P>
      <P>Senator Costello made a fair point about pursuing a social guarantee, which could be teased out further.  Senators Ormonde and Mooney are correct in stating that there are important by-products of the scholarship scheme, particularly in terms of the continuation of the strong relationship between Ireland and the United States.  People who come to this country on scholarships could, when they return to the US, play an important role in public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="896" /> Senators Kett and O'Toole asked if the Department will restrict areas of research.  I am totally opposed to ring-fencing the scheme because it must be as broad as possible.  We will establish management committees, etc., to oversee the scheme.  There will be basic criteria laid down but, in my opinion, all areas of inquiry and research are valid.  It would be wrong to try to direct people to take certain routes.  We will consult with Senator Mitchell to see if he wants particular emphasis placed on a number of areas of research.  However, I am opposed to ring-fencing the scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to Senator Quinn's proposed amendment and Senator Henry's support of it, there is no desire to exclude anyone or any institution in Northern Ireland from participating in the scheme.  There is no hidden agenda to try to exclude institutions in Northern Ireland. However, the Attorney General's advice is clear: we cannot presume to legislate for institutions in another jurisdiction.  There are many areas concerning North-South relationships which appear logical and simple.  However, one need only consider what has happened since the Good Friday Agreement came into being in terms of the establishment of cross-Border bodies and arriving at solutions to what should be relatively simple areas of co-operation.  The House cannot legally legislate outside of this jurisdiction and there are only a few areas of criminal law where this happened in the past, and that was with prior agreement.</P>
    <P>In addition to the George Mitchell Scholarship Fund, Secretary Riley and myself announced the establishment of Project Citizen during President Clinton's visit.  This project will involve Ireland investing £500,000 and the United States investing $1 million to fund civic projects involving children and schools, North and South.  Negotiations took place at that time with the Northern Ireland authorities but they were not in a position to come on board.  However, that avenue remains open to them.  Education has been a sensitive issue in terms of North-South relationships and it did not figure prominently in areas targeted for joint co-operation.</P>
    <P>I must act delicately and sensitively in this area. The two Departments work well together.  The European reconciliation studies programme involves a joint initiative.  It is not rooted in stone that we should establish the scholarship in the precise terms set out in the legislation.  If we can encourage the British Government or the new Northern Ireland Assembly to come on board, we can amend the legislation if necessary.</P>
    <P>I accepted the amendment relating to the Irish School of Ecumenics in the Dáil because that institution specialises in conflict resolution and its courses would be attractive to students interested in pursuing post-graduate scholarships in conflict resolution or peace studies.  That institution would lend itself to that kind of study.  There is no reason a recipient of a scholarship could not study at that college and travel up and down to <Col N="897" /> Northern Ireland for field studies.  Likewise, NUI Galway, has recently established a centre for human rights, one of the first universities in the country to do so.  There is no reason people could not study there and travel to the North to do research.</P>
    <P>Before coming to the House I consulted the Attorney General on this question.  His view is that we cannot presume to legislate for institutions in Northern Ireland.  I will give an undertaking to the House to begin negotiations with the Northern Ireland authorities and with the British Government to persuade them to co-operate with this scholarship scheme and to facilitate the participation of universities in Northern Ireland.  The issue of jurisdiction is an important one which impinges on legislation and of which we must take account.  We would all like to see universities in Northern Ireland becoming involved in this programme.</P>

      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), to delete all words form and including &ldquo;in the State&rdquo; in line 27 down to and including line 29, and substituting the following:&mdash;</P>

      <P>(e) a university in Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the House will consider the possibility of not coming to a final conclusion today and perhaps taking Report Stage at a later date so that we can return to this matter.  I do not understand my amendment to mean that we are legislating for Northern Ireland.  The wording of my amendment may be rushed and my reference to &ldquo;a university in Northern Ireland&rdquo; may not be the best way to achieve my objective.  Amendment No. 1 <Col N="898" /> to amendment No. 2 proposes to substitute the words &ldquo;in Ireland&rdquo; for &ldquo;in the State&rdquo;.  I cannot believe that presents any problem.</P>
    <P>We are discussing funding.  When we fund overseas development we do not ask countries for permission to give money to projects in their territory. We did not ask permission of Honduras or Rwanda when we allocated funds to be spent in those countries.  We did not legislate for Honduras or Rwanda.  We must not place a barrier on these funds by telling students they must not cross the Border and this is what we do if my amendments are not accepted.  I am not convinced that this amendment is necessarily the correct way to proceed.  It may be that the Attorney General is correct when he says that to use the term &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; in this legislation is wrong.  However, I do not understand why it could be.</P>
    <P>I have accused others who do not come from near the Border or who do not have family on the other side of the Border, of not going close to the Border often enough.  A colleague was aghast when he saw me buying Irish linen because it was manufactured in County Down.  I had to coax him into accepting that County Down was part of Ireland.  In my company we place a shamrock symbol on merchandise manufactured in Ireland.  I have been surprised at the number of people who ask if we should put these symbols on goods which come from one of the six counties of Northern Ireland.  We should not even think of asking that question.  The belief persists that Northern Ireland must be kept separate from us.  I know that is not the Minister's intention and I realise that the Attorney General has advised that we cannot legislate for Northern Ireland.  I am not suggesting that we legislate for Northern Ireland.  I simply ask that we not exclude it.  This money is to be spent on education. If a student decides that as part of that education he or she wishes to study across the Border, we should not debar him or her from doing that.  I do not believe that constitutes legislating; it is merely the allocation of money, just as development aid is.</P>
    <P>The motive behind this amendment encapsulates everything for which George Mitchell worked.  We are setting up an institution which creates a void between the two sides of the conflict while he worked to bring them together.  If my amendments are not the solution to this problem, then let us seek a better one.  We are passing legislation to set up a scholarship which will enable students from the United States to study in Ireland but at the same time telling them they can only study in one part of Ireland and not the other.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider my amendments. If he cannot accept them on Committee Stage, let him take advice from the Attorney General and seek a solution to the problem he sees.  I am sure his heart is in the same place as mine.  Both amendments have the same objective, to make sure we do not debar students coming <Col N="899" /> to study in Ireland from spending some of their funding north of the Border.</P>

      <P>Senator Quinn has raised a fundamental point, one which did not occur to me although it should have done.  I am sure there is no disagreement among Senators with what Senator Quinn seeks to achieve.</P>
      <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's argument about presuming to legislate for Northern Ireland.  Let us look at what will happen in practical terms.  A board will be established which will be responsible for the disbursement of the scholarships. If a student decides that an institution in Northern Ireland is best suited to his or her purpose the granting of a scholarship to that student could not be seen as presuming to legislate for another jurisdiction.  In my view the Attorney General's interpretation is not merely unduly but almost unreasonably restrictive.</P>
      <P>We live in a difficult age where litigation arises very easily and where people are prone to take constitutional challenges.  I accept that the Minister is right to be very sensitive.  Someone in Northern Ireland could challenge this legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General is a former student of mine which makes me feel very old.  In this regard he is being unduly restrictive and common sense must be brought to bear on this question.  For example, let us say somebody from the United States comes to UCD to study Celtic studies.  They may be told that the expert in one aspect of Celtic studies is in Wales, Brittany or Sweden and they would have to spend part of their time there.  If one of the terms of the scholarship was that the person could pursue a necessary part of their studies outside the jurisdiction in Sweden or in Brittany, no one would say that the French or the Swedish Governments would presume we were legislating in their jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Quinn has raised a fundamentally important point.  I know the Minister is in a hurry and he will get every co-operation from us.  I do not wish to obstruct or delay the legislation in any way, but I suggest that we postpone Report Stage, even until tomorrow.  The Minister will have full co-operation from us, but I would like to hear other opinions on this matter.  Given our role in scrutinising legislation, we would be remiss if, on a <Col N="900" /> point where we all want the same objective, we did not postpone Report Stage.  The common sense approach, which all of us can see straightaway, is one which could be legally copperfastened.</P>
    <P>In light of today's debate, I would like the Attorney General to look at this matter again and perhaps other legal advice could also be sought on it.  It would be a pity if we missed such an opportunity in a Bill as important as this.  We all want the same thing and, as Senator Quinn rightly said, the spirit of what George Mitchell did embraced all the cultures of the entire island. If the Minister can persuade me on reflection that there are hard reasons, I will not be obstructive. However, I would like to have 24 hours to reflect on this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>

      <P>I know, but we are now asking to spend money.  Therefore, it could look as if we are being ungenerous in that we would not fund scholarships to an institution in Northern Ireland. This is the paying out part.  We are offering to give something so that, instead of being spent here, money could be spent in Northern Ireland. Senator Quinn has made an extremely important point.</P>
      <P>In all the earlier discussions, I thought I heard the words &ldquo;Queen's&rdquo; and &ldquo;the University of Ulster&rdquo; mentioned at some stage.  I was obviously wrong, but I thought there would be some consultation with Queen's about the possibility of people going there.  The fund is paying for people; it is not as though someone is being asked to give us something.  Some of the universities are being very generous about allowing fees, but no university is obliged to do that at the moment.</P>
      <P>We should adopt the approach Senator Manning put forward and let his pupil have a night's sleep to think about whether we could not also encompass the Northern institutions.  It would be worthwhile to do so.</P>

      <P>There is pressure of time on this legislation in the sense that if we postpone any Stage of the Bill it will not pass through both Houses of the Oireachtas before Christmas.  It is as simple as that.  We have the Technological Bill coming back, etc.</P>
      <P>Senator Manning made an interesting point, concerning someone who goes to UCD and discovers that the expert in Celtic studies is in Brittany. The person could travel to Brittany, but that person could still be based at UCD.  The scholarship would be based at UCD, but universities and other institutions often make bilateral arrangements to facilitate joint approaches.  There are practical ways out of such situations which would facilitate people having access to experts.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, we would require the agreement of the British Government because we are passing legislation.  It would be all right if it was just a fund.  I mentioned this point already in connection with Project Citizen which ran in tandem with this initiative at the time of President Clinton's visit.  We went through the full round of consultations but only two Governments coughed up for Project Citizen &mdash; the United States and the Republic.  That still extends to students on both sides of the Border, but no legislation is required.  It is a matter of co-operation and funding joint initiatives.</P>
      <P>Our ambition is that this will serve a number of fronts.  It is wrong to raise the spectre that somehow this is a partitionist Bill.  That is a very unfair appellation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was certainly inferred that people who were far away from the Border had a certain partitionist view of life which somehow found its way into this Bill.  That was not the background to this.  As the situation evolves we can accommodate and incorporate the views expressed by Senator Quinn and others.  In time we can bring in the Northern higher education institutions, but I do not think we can do so this week or next week.</P>
      <P>We are due to take all Stages of the Bill in the Seanad today and it goes to the Dáil next week. We want the funding in place to get the scholarship up and running.  I have no problem with the desires articulated by Senators.  It should be within our capacity to work out ways of accommodating them and having them come on board, with the agreement of the authorities in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom.  We can work that out.  As I said, it is important to have the funding in place to get the scholarship up and running.</P>
      <P>I accept the bona fides of what Senators are proposing and their desire that all institutions on the island would participate.  However, there are legal restraints on what we can legislate for.  That is the advice I have been given.</P>

      <P>I apologise if any words I used gave the impression I was suggesting it was a partitionist <Col N="902" /> attitude.  I did not intend it to mean that.  I meant the outcome of it was sending a message to those in the North who might think they are not being looked after or that they are being debarred from the scholarship fund.</P>
      <P>I have huge difficulty with the Minister's belief that because we do not restrict where this money may be spent we are legislating for something else.  I took the example of development aid. When we allocate something for development aid, we do not have to seek the nation's approval for using that money where a hurricane might strike next.  In this case, we are talking about spending money.</P>

      <P>We have a very full day tomorrow, but I do not think there is any great problem in allocating a quarter of an hour or a half an hour, if the Minister is in agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be glad to defer it on condition that I definitely get time because I have to go to the Lower House with the Bill next week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being obstructionist.  I think it is a wonderful Bill and I am anxious to get it through the House.  I would like to have my mind at rest that every aspect has been checked to see what opportunities there are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just worried about my time scale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an assurance on behalf of my party that there will be no obstruction.  In fact, the Bill will go through very quickly tomorrow. It is an important point, however, and I would like to hear the legal advice.  The Minister may not wish to answer this question, but was the British Government asked if it would like to participate? What is the position concerning the all Ireland organisation of university heads?  Were their views sought and, if so, what were they?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will check the latter.  I was hoping we could organise this through that body because the director and the heads of the various universities meet on an all Ireland basis.  There were consultations at the time of President Clinton's visit.  I have already spoken about how far we have progressed.  Different people are slower to come on board in relation to certain initiatives. We can discuss tomorrow what can be done in terms of contacts with various groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to clear up any misinterpretation which may have arisen.  There is no dissent on this side of the House; we empathise with the general thrust of what Senator Quinn and Senator Manning said.  As someone who comes from a Border county, I would not wish to be seen as acquiescing in legislation which would be interpreted as being exclusive rather than inclusive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergalQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Senator's point and I apologise if any of the words I used suggested otherwise.  That was not my intention.  This is a worthy Bill which the Minister wants passed.  If the House considers Report Stage tomorrow, I will withdraw my amendment.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, subsection (1), lines 27 to 29, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;at an&rdquo; in line 27 down to and including line 29 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;at&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) a university or college to which the Universities Act, 1997, applies,</P>
      <P>(b) the Dublin Institute of Technology,</P>
      <P>(c) an educational institution to which the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, applies, or</P>
      <P>(d) the Irish School of Ecumenics, situated, for the time being, at Milltown in the city of Dublin.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) states that the &ldquo;Fund shall be managed and controlled, in the United States, by such person or persons (other than the Minister) as the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, considers appropriate.&rdquo;. Does the Minister have any firm views on the type of body which will take overall control of the management of the fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Henry mentioned a person in the United States who is central to this issue, Ms Trina Vargo.  We will discuss with our American counterparts the type of people who could <Col N="904" /> be brought on board in terms of the management and control of the fund.  We are open to suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Senator Henry about the qualities of Ms Trina Vargo.  However, I have a conflict of interest in that I am on one of her boards as, I understand, is Senator Henry, although she did not declare her interest in this matter.  There may be a reference to the ethics committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>That will get by the tabloids.  I join with Senator Henry in paying tribute to the work of Ms Trina Vargo, who has been a driving force in this area and a great friend to this country for many years.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Sections 3 to 7, inclusive, agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">TITLE.</P>
      <P>Government amendment No. 2:</P>
