      <P>I have notice from Senator Chambers that, on the motion for the Adjournment today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</P>
      <P>The need for the Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources to outline the plans and proposals he has for the development of the seaweed industry along the western seaboard.</P>
      <P>I regard the matter raised by the Senator as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and it will be taken at the conclusion of business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Today's proposed Order of Business is item 1, Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997. I am proposing that spokespersons will have 20 minutes each while other speakers will have 15 minutes.  Senators may share their time.  Business will be interrupted at 2 o'clock.  From then until 4 o'clock we will take statements on the Middle East crisis, in particular the situation in Israel and Palestine.  I am proposing that as regards the order for the first rota of speakers, each group will be taken in turn and thereafter the ordinary rota will apply.  This was done for the statements on the nuclear testing in India.  In that way each group will have an opportunity to make a contribution. I am suggesting that spokespersons will be given 12 minutes and other speakers will be given eight minutes.</P>
      <P>If item 1 has not concluded by 2 o'clock, it will resume when the statements finish at 4 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Order of Business is agreed to, in principle.  Will there be a <i>sos</i> between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock?</P>

      <P>When is it proposed to bring before this House the amendments to the Tribunals <Col N="1058" /> of Inquiry Bill, as promised by the Taoiseach in the Lower House yesterday?  I understand it is to be introduced in the Dáil next week but it appears that it might be introduced simultaneously in this House.  Will the Acting Leader inform me if that is the case?</P>
      <P>I also wish to raise the matter of rail safety.  In one of last Sunday's newspapers there was a report that the Minister for Public Enterprise and Iarnród Éireann now have a consultant's report on sections of rail track that are deficient or dangerous.  I understand from reading the report, which I presume was leaked, that the results are pretty worrying.  Will the Acting Leader request the Minister to publish this report as soon as possible?  The Leader, Senator Cassidy, has promised a debate on rail safety.  It would be valuable if that report was available to us ahead of any such debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Acting Leader a commitment that was given to me on three occasions by the Leader to have a debate on industrial relations.  I know he gave a similar commitment to Senator Costello and others in the House.  I have raised the question of TEAM Aer Lingus on three or four occasions and that matter is now coming to a very uncertain conclusion. We should examine these issues.  Yesterday we discussed the question of a new industrial relations programme and what will happen at the end of the current programme.  The House needs to be informed about these matters.  This matter should be dealt with as soon as possible.  Commitments were given during the last session and through the early part of this one but we are now half way through the session.  I insist that such a debate should take place.</P>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader pass on the congratulations of the House to the non-privatised ESB which is running such a good and effective operation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is a job he will be delighted to do on behalf of his party.  The ESB is now selling electricity to its consumers more cheaply than the British system which was privatised eight years ago.  I plead with politicians on all sides of the House not to take the populist line and object to decisions to increase costs which were taken properly by a company that we are asking to act in the best interests of the whole country.</P>
      <P>My final question to the Acting Leader is similar to that of Senator Connor's.  Where are we now in relation to legislation on tribunals and what are we facing into?  What are we likely to be dealing with over the next couple of weeks in this area?  What is the Government trying to achieve? This House needs to be clearly informed about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator O'Toole in regard to item 8 on the Order Paper which relates to workers' rights and industrial relations.  An increasing number of industrial disputes are taking place, of which the Garda pay dispute is just one example. The Minister for Public Enterprise seems to be engaged in a showdown with TEAM by telling employees they must act in accordance with her wishes.  There have also been a number of craftwork disputes in the various health boards and local authorities.  A thorough and early debate is required on this issue.</P>
      <P>I want to raise the issue of the very serious attacks on the elderly which have taken place recently.  An elderly man from St. Bricin's Park in my constituency died in the aftermath of a burglary. Another elderly man died in Killaloe following an attack and a Limerick priest was also attacked.  This problem is widespread in rural and urban areas.  We should hold a thorough debate on the security and care of the elderly and outline the steps being taken on a national and local level, legislatively and otherwise, to address the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonagh</NameTxt>
      <P>When will the Education Bill come before the House?  Is there a possibility that so much pressure has been exerted on the Minister in regard to amendments to the legislation that the Bill may never arrive in this House in its current format and that a completely new Bill will be drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EddieBohan" hpid="Mr. Bohan Mr. Bohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bohan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader ask the Minister for Public Enterprise to examine the issue of press reporting?  The press has been having a field day on publicans for the past week, alleging they have increased prices when no increases have, in fact, occurred.  A pub with which I am associated was reported to have increased prices when this was not the case. When the journalist in question was approached on the matter, her attitude was that she was merely doing her job.  I do not object to journalists doing their job but I do object to blatant lies being printed in the press.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulCoghlan" hpid="Mr. Coghlan Mr. Coghlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coghlan</NameTxt>
      <P>What, if any, co-ordination exists between Departments in regard to the threatened ecological disaster on the world famous lakes of Killarney?  The lakes, which are a prime national asset, are in the care of the National Parks and Wildlife Service under the aegis of the Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands.  The Department of the Marine and Natural Resources should also be involved in their upkeep.  Tonnes of rock phosphate were recently dropped from the air on coniferous forestry in the catchment area of the River Flesk's tributaries. The rock phosphate has been flowing into the lakes and it appears there is no State co-ordination <Col N="1060" /> in regard to this.  Will the Acting Leader address the matter as one of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanRyan" hpid="Mr. B. Ryan Mr. B. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Acting Leader facilitate a debate on the relationship between business and political parties in this State?  We are all beginning to be embarrassed by the drip-feed of leaks in regard to large amounts of money which were donated, primarily to the Fianna Fáil Party. However, Fine Gael has also managed to eliminate a debt very quickly on occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I wish to move an amendment to the Order of Business:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Order of Business be amended by taking item 11 in regard to the compellability of witnesses prior to other business.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the light of recent revelations, I believe it is time the Oireachtas gave itself the power to oblige people to come before its committees.  This motion has been on the Order Paper for weeks but has not been moved.  We must insist that people, particularly those who bring these Houses into disrepute, should be brought before them and compelled to explain themselves to their peers with the same privileges and rights of a court witness.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeachas a ghabháil don Chathaoirleach as ucht an óráid a thug sé i Loch Garmán ar an Domhnach seo caite.  Those in attendance were impressed both by the substance and eloquence of his delivery. The Cathaoirleach did this House proud.</P>
      <P>I call on the Acting Leader to give some consideration to how the House might appropriately mark the forthcoming retirement of the US Ambassador, Jean Kennedy-Smith, who made very pivotal contributions at critical junctures throughout the peace process.  It would be appropriate for this House to recognise her excellent contribution in some way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Connor raised the issue of Irish railways.  I am sure the Acting Leader and Members of the House will join with me in conveying sympathy to the German Government and people on the horrific rail crash which occurred in northern Germany yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1061" />
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought clarification from the Acting Leader yesterday on the matter raised by Senator Ryan.  Senators Costello, O'Meara and I have a similar item on the Order Paper since February. Given that clarification was not forthcoming yesterday, I support the amendment to the Order of Business.</P>
      <P>Could the Acting Leader give some indication of how soon the Parental Leave Bill will be introduced here?  The deadline for the introduction of the Bill has passed.  There is a great deal of talk about child care and it is important to enable parents to take better care of their children.  It is unfortunate that Ireland has been seen to be dragging its feet on this matter.  I would welcome the early introduction of that legislation.</P>
      <P>I note the nomination of the members of the Independent Commission on Policing in Northern Ireland and hope the lack of concord between the Governments in putting the commission together will be something they can now put behind them.  I wish the commission well in its important work and I wish our colleague, Senator Hayes, well in his participation in it.  The commission's work must be seen to be independent and impartial.  Its deliberations will have a crucial bearing on the success of the Northern Agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Senator Ryan's amendment but hope it would not preclude the discussion requested by the Leader of Fine Gael yesterday in regard to the possible establishment of a press council and the obligations of the press.</P>
      <P>Senator Bohan expressed his concern about an aspect of the drink trade.  I would like the Leader to give us an undertaking that this House will have a wide ranging discussion on the operation of the drink trade.  The citizens of Galway have had to introduce local legislation to curb behaviour late at night.  We may be close to that in this city.  I told the House two years ago that if the operations of four enormous shebeens in the O'Connell Street area were not curbed there would be murder.  There have been repeated murders related to the activities of the operators in the period since I made that statement.  We owe it to young people to have a wide ranging discussion in which responsible publicans like Senator Bohan could make the case for his group but also so that the crimes of other people can be highlighted to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankChambers" hpid="Mr. Chambers Mr. Chambers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Chambers</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Gallagher congratulated Senator Maurice Hayes on his appointment to the policing review group in the North.  I join in those congratulations and I know he will make a fair and positive contribution to that development. It is a great honour and responsibility for him.  He has a great knowledge of the legal process and of the feelings of the people there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Ridge</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Leader notify Minister O'Rourke of the concerns of this House regarding the problems disabled people have accessing public transport?  There was a report recently that new buses cannot take wheelchairs without a great deal of manoeuvring.  It is ridiculous that there was no consultation beforehand to allow a normal size wheelchair to be measured and the situation corrected before it became a problem.  I am concerned about the lack of attention paid to the needs of the disabled; it is such a simple matter. I ask the Leader to request that the Minister reports to this House on the situation regarding the new bus fleet with access for the disabled as a part of the normal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaschalMooney" hpid="Mr. Mooney Mr. Mooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Senators Gallagher and Chambers must be on the same wavelength as I am.  In congratulating Senator Hayes, I draw the attention of the House to the press release, which I assume was issued by the Northern Ireland Office, which appeared in my newspaper this morning.  It made no reference in the lengthy and impressive CV of Senator Hayes that he is an active Member of the Upper House.  I do not know who is to blame.  Perhaps the paper regurgitated the press release from the Northern Ireland Office.  If that is the case we should not be too surprised that it did not want to highlight the fact that Senator Hayes is a distinguished Member of the Upper House if he is to deal with the police commission reforms in an even handed matter.  I put on the record that we are proud of the fact that not only is he a Member of this House but also has been appointed to this important commission which will have far reaching effects on the search for stability in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of tribunals of inquiry and the related matters of ethics in business and the relationship between business and politics were raised by Senators Connor and O'Toole. The Tribunal of Inquiry Bill will come before the Dáil next week.  It will be the intention of the Dáil to deal with that quickly and to have it come through this House as soon as possible.  It is a piece of legislation which will be with us shortly. Several of the issues raised this morning can be dealt with on Second Stage of that Bill which will seek to extend the scope of the Flood Tribunal to deal with some of the matters of public controversy at present.</P>
      <P>As soon as the consultant's report on rail safety is published it will be useful for the House to debate it, but there is a large number of items which Senators want to debate.  There is a large legislative programme to get through between now and the recess and there will difficulties in accommodating everyone.  We will attempt, however, to deal with that matter as it is serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator O'Toole mentioned industrial relations.  Again this is a result of the pressure of business.  The Senator was given a commitment <Col N="1063" /> and I will ensure that commitment is honoured.  I note his insistence in this important matter.  I join in his congratulations to ESB and will convey them to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.  There are aspects of the activities of ESB which are already subject to private enterprise.  The Senator will be aware that, under EU rules, when the peat burning power station is built in the midlands, power generated there will be sold to the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware of that.  That is the sort of competition which ESB will be able to handle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnDardis" hpid="Mr. Dardis Mr. Dardis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dardis</NameTxt>
      <P>Senator Costello mentioned attacks on the elderly.  I share his view that it is appalling that elderly people who have worked all their lives should be subjected to these mindless attacks.  I congratulate the Garda for apprehending and charging people for the attack on the priest in Limerick.  It would be useful to discuss the security of the elderly.  There is a community role in this; individuals in areas where elderly people live have a responsibility to keep an eye out for them and inform the Garda of suspicious behaviour in the area.</P>
      <P>Senator McDonagh raised the Education Bill. The Bill is at present with the Select Committee. Once it leaves the Dáil it will be sent to the Seanad.</P>
      <P>Senators Norris and Bohan again called for a debate on the establishment of a press council. We will try to find time for that.  The price of a pint is something which concerns all of us and we note the comments made by Senator Bohan about the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the co-ordination of Government Departments in Killarney, the Office of Public Works and other agencies involved will co-operate fully to ensure pollution and other incidents which affect water will be dealt with.  I am an angler myself so I have an interest in this.  It is unacceptable that phosphates should be spread on bare land and find their way into the watercourse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> Senator Ryan raised matters which can be dealt with on Second Stage of the Tribunals Bill.  I cannot accommodate him on the matter of item 11. The Dáil has not taken this motion either.  It has to come into force within a month of being moved in the Dáil and then it will come before this House.  It has been dealt with by the Dáil subcommittee on Dáil reform.</P>
    <P>I also congratulate Senator Hayes on his appointment.  He will bring gravity and experience to the police reform body.</P>
    <P>Senator Gallagher raised the matter of parental leave.  That will come before us on Second Stage next Friday.  I hope Senator Norris met plenty of people on the tour of his drawingroom this morning, to which I was listening on my way here.</P>

      <P>I agree with Senator Ridge that there is a lack of access for people with a disability. However, first, these and some other matters would be more appropriately dealt with on the Adjournment and, second, if Senators have points which they wish to raise with Ministers, I suggest they write directly to the Minister rather than ask the Leader to convey the message on their behalf.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to be in the Seanad for the Second Stage debate on the Roads (Amendment) Bill, 1997.  While this is a short and somewhat technical Bill, it deals with a number of important issues.  The Bill has already been considered by the Dáil and was examined in Committee.  During its passage through the other House, Deputies from all sides participated in a positive and constructive debate.  I know that the same will be the case in this House.</P>
      <P>The Bill has four primary aims: to clarify the power of local authorities, as road authorities, to compulsorily acquire a substratum, that is an underground slice of land, for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel as part of their powers under the Roads Act, 1993; to amend the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, to provide a similar power in legislation relating to a tunnel for light rail development; to regulate procedures for judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and roads-related environmental impact statements and to confirm the legal status as motorways of a number of proposed public roads.</P>
      <P>This is the first Bill to amend roads legislation for five years.  The Roads Act, 1993, is the basic legislation which governs how we construct and maintain our road network.  It provides a comprehensive and modern legislative framework for road development.  Preparation of that legislation involved considerable research and drafting work and there was extensive scrutiny of the Bill in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For these reasons the Roads Act, 1993, will stand the test of time as the legislative basis for the development of Ireland's road network.</P>
      <P>However, it was inevitable that in the course of experience of the legislation some matters would come to attention which, if added, could benefit the legislation or on which clarification of the law would be desirable.  Three such matters have arisen which are the subject of this Bill.</P>
      <P>Senators will be aware that the proposed Dublin port tunnel is one element of the Dublin Transportation Initiative's strategy for the city. In the course of the planning of the project by Dublin Corporation legal doubt has arisen over the powers of the corporation, as road authority, to compulsorily acquire the land required for the tunnel. The corporation proposes that the land to be acquired for the project should consist of the underground section &mdash; or substratum &mdash; necessary for the tunnel and should not involve the compulsory acquisition of all of the land above or below it or of any buildings located on the land. The essence of the legal issue was whether the land acquisition powers contained in the Roads Act, 1993, allowed the corporation to acquire only the necessary substratum of land as it proposes. Differing views were expressed on this issue.</P>
      <P>Having considered the matter, the Government came to the conclusion that it was desirable to ensure that there was no legal uncertainty over the powers of local authorities generally to compulsorily acquire substrata of land necessary for road tunnels. Accordingly, section 3 of the Bill amends section 47 of the Roads Act, 1993, in a number of places to provide that a motorway scheme made by a road authority may specify any substratum of land which it is proposed to compulsorily acquire for the purposes of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Bill amends section 52 of the 1993 Act to provide that when the Minister approves a motorway scheme, the road authority will thereupon be authorised, under section 52(1), to compulsorily acquire any substratum of land specified in the scheme and that the general law in relation to compulsory purchase will also apply to the acquisition of a substratum of land. Similarly, the new subsection (7) to be inserted in section 52 confirms that any reference to land in the compulsory purchase code includes a reference to a substratum of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point I should emphasise that the purpose of this part of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for the acquisition of land for road tunnels generally. It is not the intention, nor will it be the effect, of this new legislation to take away from the statutory procedures which must be followed before any road tunnel project can proceed. In particular, the Bill does not authorise the construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel. Whether the Dublin Port Tunnel project goes ahead, and in <Col N="1067" /> what form, will be decided, <i>inter alia,</i> through the statutory motorway scheme and environmental impact assessment procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993.  A full motorway scheme and a comprehensive environmental impact statement will have to be prepared by the corporation and submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The public will have to be given an adequate opportunity to make submissions on the project and on its environmental impact.  A public inquiry will have to be held at which all views can be heard and a report will have to be prepared on the inquiry and submitted for decision.  A final decision on the port tunnel will, therefore, be made another day and as part of a different process.  For that reason this debate should not be a forum for discussion of the merits and demerits of the port tunnel project.  It will not be possible for me to enter into any such discussion in the course of the debate or elsewhere in view of the quasi-judicial functions which the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is likely to be called upon to exercise in relation to the project at a later stage.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second purpose of the Bill, which is the proposed amendment to the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, which is contained in section 6 of the Bill.  The 1996 Act is similar to, and based to a large extent on, the Roads Act, 1993.  Amendment of the 1996 Act is also required in so far as it relates to compulsory acquisition of a substratum of land and this is being done in the current Bill.</P>
    <P>During the passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas of the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, concern was expressed by many Deputies and Senators that the underground option was being excluded because the legislation as drafted did not refer to it explicitly.  In order to allay these concerns the then Minister of State agreed to amend the Bill to make it explicit that the underground option was not being ruled out. It now appears, however, in light of the position as it has emerged with regard to the roads legislation, that these amendments may not have been sufficient to achieve their intended purpose.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill, therefore, provides that under section 10(2) of the 1996 Act a light railway order may specify any substratum of land the acquisition of which is necessary for giving effect to the order.  Section 6 goes on to provide for the compulsory acquisition of substrata of land under section 13(1) and (2) of the 1996 Act.  The new subsection (3) in section 13 of the 1996 Act confirms that any reference to land in the compulsory purchase code which is to be used for light rail land acquisition includes a reference to a substratum of land.  The amendments to the light rail legislation now proposed in this Bill will, therefore, copperfasten the intent of the light rail legislation. This is all the more important now since the Government in its recent decision on the light <Col N="1068" /> rail project decided to proceed with a network which includes an underground section in the city centre.</P>
    <P>The W.S. Atkins report convinced the Government of the merit of proceeding with a substantially surface-based light rail system.  Of the 25 kilometres already designed by the CIE team on the Tallaght and Sandyford lines, only a small section will need to be revised to accommodate the 2.5 kilometer long underground section which is proposed to run from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone.  The underground section will address two issues raised in the Atkins report &mdash; disruption during construction and potential longer term capacity constraints in the central area as the network is extended.</P>
    <P>On roads matters and the third purpose of the Bill which concerns judicial review, the 1993 Act contains no specific provisions relating to judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes or on roads-related environmental impact statements.  This is in marked contrast to other legislative codes.  For example, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, and the Waste Management Act, 1996, contain specific provisions governing judicial review of decisions under those codes.  It is desirable there be clear provisions applying to judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and roads-related environmental impact statements.  These should be framed in a way which is broadly similar to other comparable legislation.  Accordingly, section 5 of the Bill introduces three new provisions.  First, an action challenging the validity of a decision of the Minister on a motorway scheme or on a roads-related environmental impact statement will have to be by way of an application for judicial review.  Proceedings will have to be instituted within two months by motion on notice to interested persons. Second, the High Court will not grant leave to apply for review unless it is satisfied there are substantial grounds for contending the decision challenged is invalid or ought to be quashed. Third, the High Court's decision will be final unless it certifies that its decision involves a point of law of exceptional public importance, in which case appeal may be made to the Supreme Court. It is important to emphasise that these new provisions will not restrict the right to institute proceedings challenging these decisions.  They are intended merely to ensure that any such proceedings can be brought to finality as expeditiously as possible, bearing in mind the importance of having final and conclusive decisions on major road development proposals within a reasonable timescale.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was amended in the Dáil to confirm that it will only apply to legal proceedings initiated after the passing of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fourth and final provision of the Bill is intended to put beyond doubt the legal status as motorways of a limited number of proposed public <Col N="1069" /> roads.  The Roads Act, 1993, substituted new motorway scheme procedures for those in the Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974, the repeal of which was provided for in the 1993 Act.  The procedures under the 1974 Act had two elements.  Firstly, a motorway scheme was prepared by a local authority, then a public inquiry was held and a ministerial decision was made on the scheme.  Secondly, where a motorway scheme was approved by the Minister, another separate ministerial order was required declaring the road the subject of the approved scheme to be a motorway.  By contrast, the 1993 Act provides for a single motorway scheme procedure which involves only one formal decision by the Minister.  That Act also contained transitional provisions aimed at catering for situations where motorway schemes had been made by local authorities under the 1974 Act but the procedures under that Act had not been completed at the point when the Act was repealed.</P>
    <P>Subsequent experience with these transitional provisions suggests that they may not be sufficient to make good the absence from the 1993 Act of the previous power of formally declaring to be a motorway a road which had been the subject of an approved motorway scheme made under the 1974 Act.  Three approved motorway schemes are involved &mdash; the Southern Cross route, Dunleer-Dundalk and the Kildare town by-pass.  Section 7 of the Bill, therefore, provides for the making of orders by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in these specified circumstances to declare these roads to be motorway.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate from this short overview that this is an important Bill.  I look forward to hearing the views of Senators and I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House and thank him for introducing this Bill. The purpose of the Bill is to amend and extend the Roads Act, 1993.  That Act gave local councils the authority to compulsorily acquire lands for road-making.  It was not anticipated at the time that it would be necessary to clarify the powers of local authorities as roads authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum of land &mdash; by this I mean an underground slice of land for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel. Members will be aware that the proposed Dublin port tunnel project is one of the major elements of the DTI strategy for Dublin in order to solve its traffic problems.  In the course of the planning of the project by Dublin Corporation, legal doubts arose over its powers as a roads authority to compulsorily acquire land for the tunnel.  The land required would consist of an underground section or substratum necessary for the tunnel and would not involve the compulsory acquisition of land above or below it or any buildings on the land.  That is why this issue is different from normal <Col N="1070" /> compulsory acquisitions.  The question then arose of whether the acquisition power contained in the Roads Act, 1993, would be sufficient to allow Dublin Corporation to acquire all the necessary substratum of land.  I understand there were different legal views on this issue and, as a result, the Bill now clarifies the position.  Section 3 amends section 47 of the Roads Act, 1993, to provide that a motorway scheme made by a local authority may specify any substratum of land which it must compulsorily acquire for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The Dublin port access tunnel is an important part of the Dublin Transportation Initiative recommendations for Dublin and I strongly support it.  For commercial reasons it is imperative that we continue to develop Dublin port in the manner it has been developed for several years. It was one of four ports selected for funding under the European Regional Development Fund.  The objectives set out by Government for the ports in receipt of EU funding until 1999 were: to increase traffic by more than 11 million tonnes by 1993, to increase passenger traffic by not less than 5 per cent in the same period and to reduce combined port costs by 15 per cent.  I understand that by 1997 Dublin port on its own had contributed more than its share towards achieving these objectives and targets.  The port has increased tonnage by 6.7 per cent, has increased passenger numbers by 12 per cent and has reduced the price of tonnage by 10 per cent. This year it is expected to exceed all previous throughput records and the throughput of any other Irish port.  I commend the staff and management of Dublin port who have contributed to the significant development of the facility in recent years.  Going by the figures I have quoted, there is no dispute about the need for a port access route.  It is vital for the future of Dublin port and for the future of Dublin.  The basic minimum requirement of the port in terms of access is an effective road system to serve the industrial needs of the city, and a new port relief route is essential by the year 2000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning and construction of Dublin port tunnel is strictly a matter for Dublin Corporation. There has been wide consultation relating to the route the tunnel should take and the scheme has been incorporated by way of variation to the Dublin city plan.  There was a long debate in the city council relating to the variation and it was passed by a substantial majority.  The variation was put on display for three months, representations were then examined and it was then put on display for a further month.  An amendment was made at that stage.  An environmental impact statement has been published but, as an amendment has been made to the scheme, it is necessary to prepare a new EIS and this work is in hand.  As soon as this is completed, the motorway proposal, consisting of acquisition documents, etc., will be submitted to the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1071" /> and Local Government.  By law, he must hold a public inquiry which will give a further opportunity for people with anxieties about the tunnel to make representations on the scheme.  The outcome of the inquiry will then be submitted for a final decision to allow the scheme to commence.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, to provide a similar power relating to the authorisation to compulsorily acquire a substratum for the construction and maintenance of a tunnel in connection with light rail development.  When the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, was debated in the House it did not indicate the detail of how the light rail project would be implemented.  Since then the Government has made a decision that part of it should go underground and, given this, section 6 provides that a light rail order may specify any substratum of land the acquisition of which is necessary to give effect to this order.</P>
    <P>The revised Government proposals for the Luas light rail system have been the subject of a debate in the House and I do not intend to enter into detail on the matter again.  Suffice it to say that I sincerely hope the EU funding for the Luas programme which cannot now be drawn down will be used for other traffic management measures to solve Dublin's traffic problems, such as quality bus corridors and the implementation of various measures which the Government has accepted as essential to the successful implementation of the Luas development.  These include the construction of the Macken Street bridge, the Mercer Street link, the Cork Street-Coombe bypass and the North King Street route, together with the development of a network of environmental traffic cells.  Furthermore, there is no point having quality bus corridors without having sufficient clean rolling stock.  I ask the Government to make provision for capital funding for Dublin Bus to allow it purchase new buses.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Act contains no specific provision relating to a judicial review of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes.  I am pleased to note that the Government deems it desirable that there should be a clear provision applying to judicial reviews of ministerial decisions on motorway schemes and roads relating to environmental impact statements.  Section 5 accordingly introduces three new provisions to bring this about.</P>
    <P>This Bill reflects the capacity of the Oireachtas to respond to difficulties in legislation which arise with changing times and practices.  If the issue concerning the port tunnel had not been cleared by this legislation, the process would have been delayed by legal disputes.  I am glad the problem has been cleared and I hope construction of the port tunnel will commence as soon as possible to relieve one of Dublin's major traffic problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Flood, and also the Minister of State, <Col N="1072" /> Deputy Dan Wallace, who was present a short while ago.  The Minister and Ministers of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government are such frequent visitors to the House that we should acknowledge that, apart from keeping us busy, they are busy themselves in bringing forward legislation relevant and pertinent to the implementation of policy.</P>
      <P>This Bill is simple and straightforward.  It is a housekeeping exercise in that it clarifies that there are certain powers which local authorities have to enable them to undertake much needed infrastructural development which they are obliged to construct in the interests of the public. The clarification of the powers of local authorities to compulsorily acquire substratum is important in the instances mentioned in the Bill, which include any tunnelling undertaken with regard to light rail or roads.  It will become increasingly necessary for these issues to be addressed.  There have been debates about the Luas light rail system in Dublin.  Anyone who commutes in Dublin will be well aware of the need for significant improvements in traffic management in the city. While this is independent of the planning process it is, nevertheless, important that the legislative underpinning of the powers of the authority is well founded to ensure that there are no undue delays.  In that regard I compliment the Minister on bringing this Bill forward.</P>
      <P>The Bill also deals with the substratum for motorways.  Section 5 contains the welcome provision that leave to apply for a judicial review shall not be granted unless the High Court is satisfied that there are substantial grounds for such a review.  It is important that schemes which involve very heavy capital expenditure by the State on infrastructure which is long overdue are not held up by frivolous or minor complaints. Section 6 deals with light railway orders which may specify any substratum of land the acquisition of which is necessary for giving effect to the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 7 deals with the regularisation of the status of certain motorways.  I welcome the placing of the status of roads on a correct basis.  There is a need to accelerate the development of motorways. As president of the Irish Road Hauliers Association, 15 years ago I put a proposal to the Minister for motorways from Belfast through Dublin to Rosslare and from Dublin to Cork. Since then progress on those routes has not been significant and is not sufficient for the volume of traffic on them.  Thinking in the Department is too short-term and fails to recognise that more than 90 per cent of goods are transported on national primary routes.  Anyone who drives on these roads incurs undue and unnecessary delays. Investment in motorways and by-passes has given a good return in terms of economic development. As an aside to my comments on Second Stage, I suggest that development of motorways and dual carriageways be accelerated.  These projects are <Col N="1073" /> costly but money can be wasted on short term measures which often become redundant when the necessary long-term development takes place. There is no point building roads to deal with traffic growth in the next ten or 15 years.  Roads should be built to last into the second half of the next century.  Hitler has been criticised for many things but the autobahnen which were constructed under his rule in Germany are still serving the economy of that country well.  I would like to see a significant improvement in the provision of motorways.  The Bill will enable such an accelerated programme to be well accommodated and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much welcome this Bill because it is in two parts, one dealing with the road tunnel and the other with light rail.  The Government has been criticised on the basis that it was using the sophisticated new plan for Luas with a centre-city underground element as a method of avoiding reality and was planning to make the project so expensive that nothing would be done.  Those of us who continue to believe the Government have been looking out for evidence of action.  We have today some evidence of this action.  The Government has introduced the enabling legislation empowering it to acquire land and do various technical, legal things which are prerequisites of developing the underground section.  I obviously welcome this Bill because I tabled the amendment to the Light Rail Bill, 1996, which raised the question of the underground effectively for the first time.  I am naturally glad to see progress on this.</P>
      <P>My second point is a rather technical one.  I seek reassurance from the Department.  Tunnelling is not as hazardous a matter as people imagine.  It is engaged in more and more frequently, there are more and more sophisticated methods of doing it and there is a number of alternatives.  However, I am chairman of the Friends of the Library of Trinity College Dublin and they are embarking on a massive building project of another new library.  They are exercising their minds lest the route of the underground section of Luas should pass beneath College Park and beneath the library at the point where they are engaging in building operations.  In order to be helpful I am signalling to the Department that this substantial building operation will take place in College Park which will require foundations. Quite a lot of this building will be underground and by shifting the Luas line a hundred yards or by leaving it where it is and reassuring the library, difficulties might be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the Government has accepted one of the points made during the debate on the Light Rail Bill when we advocated the necessity for tunnels in some areas.  The Minister says that the corporation proposes that the land to be acquired for the project &mdash; the port access tunnel &mdash; should consist of the underground section, or substratum, <Col N="1074" /> necessary for the tunnel and should not involve the compulsory acquisition of all of the land above or below it or of any buildings located on the land.  One of the great advantages of a tunnel of this nature and quality is that it can be made without the level of surface disturbance required for the building of a road through an urban area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the residents may not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how the tunnelling is done.  I know that residents are worried about subsidence.  We read from time to time in newspapers of old coal mines collapsing and buildings disappearing in parts of England, but with new methods of tunnelling that danger is held to a minimum.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill for the reasons I have stated. It is increasingly obvious that something must be done about traffic throughout the country and not just in Dublin.  Anyone who travels throughout the country knows that surprising bottlenecks occur in places like Ashbourne and Carlow.  In the city of Dublin it is just appalling.  I ask a question which is not directly germane to the Bill but has some relation to it.  When will we do something simple, sensible and practical about traffic in Dublin?</P>
      <P>Coming to the House today I saw tour buses double-parked and CIE buses belching rotten black fumes with a thumbs up sign on the back asking people to be courteous.  I do not notice much courtesy on the part of bus drivers, particularly when I cycle and they seem to want to flatten me against a taxi.  There are four or five principal sources of double parking, including those delivering linen and mineral water and booze to pubs and the gardaí turn a blind eye.  One hears about zero tolerance yet I got a ticket for parking outside St. Patrick's Cathedral on a Sunday afternoon when I dropped off my 100 year old aunt.  I was not going to pay the fine because I wanted an opportunity to go to court to complain about someone attending an AIDS service the previous year who had her car towed away from a space to which she had been directed by the gardaí.  Is that zero tolerance or does somebody in the gardaí object to religious practice?  Perhaps militant atheism is creeping into the traffic section.</P>
      <P>Traffic in Dublin is a serious problem and this Bill will go some way towards resolving it. However, there are simpler methods to prevent double parking.  Specific times should be stated for deliveries.  This is not a new idea; many of us have said it for years.  Deliveries should be made in the early hours of the morning before traffic builds up.</P>
      <P>I know that usage has crept in everywhere, but as a pedant it grieves me to see a split infinitive in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1075" /> The primary purpose of this Bill is to clarify the power of local authorities as road authorities to compulsorily acquire a substratum.</P>
    <P>It would be much more elegant to put &ldquo;acquire compulsorily&rdquo;.  I appeal on behalf of the infinitive which has been split to distraction, that we observe the decencies of grammar.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AnnOrmonde" hpid="Ms Ormonde Ms Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Ms Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and the Ministers of State, Deputy Wallace and Deputy Flood, for bringing forward this necessary legislation to alleviate traffic problems.  This Bill is welcome because it is surprising how traffic has damaged the infrastructure of Dublin in the past number of years.</P>
      <P>This Bill allows local authorities to acquire substratum of land which is necessary for the progress of the Dublin port access tunnel.  A huge number of trucks come into Dublin every day. We must look at the best way to link the tunnel, the port and the M50.  This has been our aim since I started serving on Dublin County Council in 1985.  In the 14 years I have been a member we tried to get the Southern Cross route built; this is only happening now because of the political implications every time we made a decision.</P>
      <P>We are now tidying up the loose ends of previous legislation; this is welcome.  There was a possibility under the 1993 Act that members of the public could hold up the progress of a project because they owned a piece of land.  I am pleased that Dublin Corporation can now plan the port access tunnel, which is a small part of the jigsaw.</P>
      <P>Section 6 deals with light rail.  I welcome the light rail system from Tallaght to St. Stephen's Green which will also include Sandyford and Dundrum.  This is an integrated approach to travel from the outskirts to the city centre.  Substratum of land will need to be acquired from St. Stephen's Green to the northside of the city. Local authorities now have the power to acquire land and there will be no dispute about the political implications.  I welcome that decision and I appreciate the amount of work and time that went into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 puts a time limit on recourse to the courts.  We have become a litigious society and going to court is used as a delaying tactic.  The Southern Cross project was conceived long before 1985.  Since then we have had the planning application, consultations, a public inquiry, oral submissions and a decision by the Minister that the route would go ahead.  However, some people were still not happy, although the silent majority was.  The decision did not suit a few people who had the money to take the matter to the High Court and the Supreme Court.  A route that should have been built between 1981 and 1989 is only starting to be built now because of that court action.  The extension of the M50 to the south-east <Col N="1076" /> is also planned and I have no doubt some people will try to stop its progress by going to court.</P>
    <P>In the meantime Dublin has been choked by traffic.  We cannot move outside our doors, never mind trying to get to the city centre.  The two month time limit to challenge a ministerial decision in court is welcome.  The High Court can then decide if there are substantial grounds for an action going ahead.  This is the best legislation I have seen for quite a while, and hopefully, it will help to create a new infrastructure in Dublin in the next couple of years.  We will then be able to say that public representatives are not such a bad crowd and that we can fight the public's cause.  I do not deny a person's right to bring a grievance to court.  People still have that constitutional right, provided there are substantial grounds for taking a High Court action.</P>
    <P>This legislation is welcome and, hopefully, when the other pieces of the jigsaw are put together &mdash; the linking of the tunnel, the port and the M50 &mdash; in a couple of years we can be very proud of our city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We support the Bill which is enabling in nature and will prove a support for other measures, particularly in the context of roads.  It is interesting that this is the first Bill to amend road legislation for five years.  Successive Governments have been tardy in relation to various aspects of such legislation.  The Bill provides for support and enabling legislation for Dublin Corporation in the context of the light rail system, motorways, etc.</P>
      <P>At times statutory procedures, judicial delays and various existing mechanisms do not help the system.  While not directly related to the Bill, the Minister might take on board my comments in relation to further amending legislation concerning the manner in which various statutory authorities, including local authorities, carry out their business on a day to day basis.  Those who use the roads in Dublin in particular, and at times other areas, realise the city is gradually coming to a halt.  Many parts of the city constitute an obstacle course through blockages.  At times there appears to be no overall co-ordinated plan, leading to a situation where the corporation can carry out work one week followed by the gas company, the ESB or Telecom Éireann.  There seems to be no co-ordinated approach, apart from putting diggers in place and putting down cones.  Gradually, roads become blocked.  Sometimes even when a job has been completed cones are left in place.  It can take a long time for obstacles to be removed resulting in further problems and the potential to cause accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In considering further legislation the Minister should take note of the fact that local and statutory authorities should not be allowed to simply put down cones and cause all types of chaos. Every mile or so in the city the number of lanes <Col N="1077" /> in operation are reduced through works being carried out and, for example, diggers at junctions. Gradually the business of the city is being brought to a halt.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to accept my comments in relation to this and future legislation.  The problems must be looked at, as must the fact that local and statutory authorities have an onus in this context. At times roads seem perfect before work is carried out and one wonders what exactly is being done or what is being achieved.</P>
    <P>Another issue is safety on the roads.  Enough cannot be done in the context of road safety and enforcement.  Speed is obviously a critical issue which must be examined.  Some roads are better than others and a person travelling on certain dual carriageways at up to 85 miles per hour &mdash; which is over the speed limit &mdash; in a reasonably sized car will not necessarily cause too many problems.  The difficulty is that some people are not used to driving at that speed and some cars should not travel at that speed.  Every weekend, particularly bank holiday weekends, the issue is how many more pedestrians, motorcyclists and motorists have been killed.  Speed has a certain amount to do with the problem.</P>

      <P>I support the Bill and hope its provisions will help alleviate the ongoing delays concerning roads planned many years ago which have not yet come to fruition, particularly the Southern Cross route and the south eastern motorway.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielKiely" hpid="Mr. D. Kiely Mr. D. Kiely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Kiely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which is long overdue.  It should have been before the House a long time ago, particularly in the context of the construction of the Lee tunnel in Cork. Perceived complications in that case should have been handled at the time.  However, I am delighted the legislation, which will benefit Dublin city and the entire country, is now before the House.</P>
      <P>Some years ago I put a proposal to Kerry County Council in relation to building a tunnel under the Shannon from Tarbert to Kilrush. People thought I was daft but tunnels seem to be the way forward and I am delighted that Luas will be going underground in the inner city area, particularly O'Connell Street, in an effort to maintain the beauty of the city.</P>
      <P>Most of those coming to Ireland want to come to Dublin city, something proved by the number of new hotels being built, to see its beauty and enjoy its scenery.  However, a boom in tourism can result in problems with tour buses and traffic problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> I am delighted the necessary money is being made available to try to alleviate the very serious traffic problem in the city.  I compliment the Garda, who did a tremendous job, on the manner in which they kept traffic moving during the Christmas period.  I will speak on other parts of the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Account has to be taken of the additional number of registered cars in the city and country over the past couple of years.  The number will increase further as a result of the large decline in unemployment, which will lead to more traffic problems.</P>
    <P>The way to travel is via a rail system.  From the time the DART was introduced much traffic was taken out of the city and many people are using rail to travel to and from work.  I am sure the new system on completion will alleviate all the problems in the city and that the people of Dublin can feel secure about the legislation which will take us into the next century.  I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKett" hpid="Mr. Kett Mr. Kett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kett</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to empower local authorities as road authorities through compulsory purchase to acquire a stratum or underground slice for the construction and maintenance of a road tunnel as part of their powers under the Roads Act, 1993.  This will allow projects such as Luas to proceed to planning level underground, something I am totally in favour of.</P>
      <P>I am also satisfied that this Bill will facilitate progress on the port tunnel, although it does not allow for it to be built.  There was ambiguity about this in the overall context of the Bill.  There is ongoing debate and consultation on the port tunnel and a decision has not yet been made.  I favour port tunnel access because it is vital to the economy of Dublin and to the viability of the port.  The port tunnel, as envisaged by Dublin Corporation and the National Roads Authority, may be the way forward but many questions have yet to be answered before it can get the go ahead. The residents of places such as Marino, Whitehall and Santry are extremely worried about the foundations of their homes and have voiced their opinions on the northern portals.  I am happy that the Bill deals with the proposal to go ahead with the tunnel and that it is not entirely committed to anything.</P>
      <P>In the course of planning this project legal doubts arose over the powers Dublin Corporation had to compulsorily purchase land as it required it.  The Government has considered this matter and has come to the correct conclusion that there should be no legal uncertainty in this regard.  Accordingly, a section of the Bill amends the Roads Act, 1993.  I am happy to note, however, that this new legislation will not remove the statutory procedures which must be followed before any project can proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1079" /> As legislators, we have a duty to uphold the rights of the majority while protecting the rights of the individual.  A balance must be struck between the two in all democracies.  The individual's entitlement to appeal should not be limited but limits must be imposed on the entitlements if any progress is to be made.  An increasing number of people now have their day in court so a line must be drawn to ensure that reason prevails and progress is unhindered.  Once a project has moved from the planning stage a halt must be called to the consultation process.  The Minister must examine the recommendations and make his order.  While democracy must prevail, a decision must be made in the name of progress.  We cannot allow individuals to hold up the planning process <i>ad infinitum.</i>  The common good must be allowed to prevail in the final analysis.</P>
    <P>The Bill also amends the Transport (Dublin Light Rail) Act, 1996, to allow for the compulsory acquisition of land for the construction and maintenance of a tunnel in connection with the light rail development.  This development, which I support, will now go underground.  The decision on Luas was courageous and farseeing and its benefits will be realised long after we have departed this House.</P>
    <P>The streets and infrastructure of Dublin are unable to cope with traffic developments.  One has only to listen to the &ldquo;Eye in the Sky&rdquo; reports on the radio in the morning to hear about traffic jams in Drumcondra and Phibsboro and on the M50 and the south side of the city.  This is caused to a large degree by the number of heavy trucks going to and from the port.  If we encourage people to use the light rail transport and if heavy duty trucks use the port tunnel when it is built, the situation will be greatly improved.  However, progress is being impeded.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will clear the way for the planning process to commence and move forward. We all know from coming to work each morning that traffic in this city is growing at an enormous pace.  The port tunnel, Luas, quality bus corridors, the new rolling stock CIE says it will introduce and this Bill will bring about a significant improvement.  I commend and thank the Minister for bringing this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHenry" hpid="Dr. Henry Dr. Henry">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Henry</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill because anything which improves the traffic situation in Dublin will be a great help.  I am eternally grateful that I am within walking distance of Leinster House because the traffic reports each morning seem to suggest that the situation is getting worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Luas tunnel, which will run from the north to the south of the city, will be underground but the line from the east to the west will be on the surface.  When the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke, was in the House I asked her if these two systems would meet.  She said they would meet at an escalator somewhere in O'Connell <Col N="1080" /> Street.  Surely the east west tunnel should go underground as well?  I know this matter is not part of the Minister's brief today, but I hope cognisance will be taken of it.</P>
    <P>Is it significant that the Bill does not specify how deep one can dig to acquire subsoil and substrata of land?  When does tunnelling for a road become mining?  Will this infringe on mining rights?  This Bill will also apply to other motorways. I do not suspect that once we start digging under Grafton Street there will be pots of gold around Brown Thomas or Marks and Spencer. However, if precious metals are found in rock which is not far from the surface, will mining rights be infringed?  I am not an expert on this but I was struck by the lack of detail in the Bill on how deep one can dig underground.  I presume there is a good reason for that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because it is necessary to ensure progress is made on improving traffic flow in the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  All road users, particularly those who drive through Dublin or any of our major cities on a daily basis, will welcome any measures which ease traffic problems and delays.</P>
      <P>There has been a huge increase in traffic on our roads in recent years due to increased prosperity and economic activities.  As our economy grows, the infrastructure must be in place to assist the future development of our country.  The cost of transporting goods, particularly if drivers are caught in traffic jams, is adding to their price.  I do not want to think what it will be like in the future.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill gives local authorities the power to compulsorily acquire lands for these much needed developments.  That will help to ease traffic delays on our main routes and particularly in Dublin where they have become a major problem for Dubliners.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister and the Government on their work in this area.  Serious and genuine efforts are being made to implement proposals to ensure we have an infrastructure in place for the 21st century.  I compliment the Minister, the Government and those involved in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which, as the Minister said, is technical and will facilitate the clarification of powers in relation to the functions of local authorities under the 1993 and 1996 legislation concerning the port tunnel and the amended light rail proposals, with which none of us could disagree.  The Minister made it clear it does not interfere with the various schemes which must be drawn up in relation to the environmental impact study and the submissions of the public inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to raise a number of issues relating to the two proposals, the port tunnel and the light <Col N="1081" /> rail projects.  As many other Senators indicated, there is a sense of urgency in getting proposals up and running and in implementing the schemes about which we have spoken.  Unfortunately, the funding agreed for the light rail project will be lost because of the delay in putting a final scheme in place.  The port tunnel project is, in many ways, up in the air as well because of problems in agreeing the final scheme.  There is also a danger European money for that project could be lost.</P>
    <P>These matters are important when considered in the context of the gridlock and the traffic problems in this city.  The ongoing economic boom will quickly make these problems worse.  There is a great urgency in drawing down money which has already been earmarked.  We will see whether we will get further money in the next tranche of funds for the light rail project.</P>
    <P>As regards the light rail proposal, I am not displeased there is an underground element.  I am also pleased the light rail project will extend to the northside as well as the southside and that the plan will be considered as one, although that raises problems.  Much of the preparatory design, planning and engineering work has been done and there is concern that there will be further delays in putting the scheme together given that it is more complex.  It will require much complex drilling and examination of the substrata and the subsoil for its suitability and the depth to which we will have to tunnel.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about the exact interpretation of subsoil and substrata.  How far down does one go before one goes below the substrata? What is the difference between mining, drilling and tunnelling?  A tunnel is presumably a parallel route which runs underground but if one must go down a long distance, is one legally covered by the definition?  Does the legislation cover us adequately?  It would be a shame, having sought to clarify the situation, if further clarification was required.</P>
    <P>The north-south line from St. Stephen's Green to Broadstone will require a significant amount of tunnelling &mdash; 2.5 kilometres.  I am glad the Broadstone line has been included in the proposal. I have problems with the fact that the east-west line is not included in an underground scheme.  There is a contradiction as to why in the centre of the city, from north to south, the proposal is to go underground but there is no such proposal from east to west.  The route from Heuston Station to Connolly Station, which will go through the heart of the city and will run parallel to the Liffey, will not be underground.</P>
    <P>How did the Minister and the Government come up with a proposal to alleviate obstruction and disruption to business by having the line from the northside to southside underground while failing to do the same with the line from east to west, which is in the heart of the city?  The mind boggles as to how such a proposal was devised. The logical proposal would have been to go <Col N="1082" /> underground, north to south and east to west. That was the proposal the constituency of Dublin Central, which I represent, would have wanted.</P>
    <P>I am sure Senator Kett would agree because we both attended many meetings with residents, particularly those in Arran Quay West, which will totally be demolished to make way for an overground line.  This line will go directly through the market area, which is congested.  The local authority has major plans in the context of the Harp project to develop and revamp the fish and fruit and vegetable market.  This line will travel alongside the market which will mean St. Mary's Terrace will have to be moved back a number of meters.  An entire streetscape will be moved to facilitate this process and that will cause maximum disruption.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not come up with an underground plan for the line from Heuston Station to O'Connell Street and on to Connolly Station?  Because the Minister did not go ahead with an underground line, I have no doubt it will further delay to the plan as the residents and business community will be up in arms.  While the business community on the southside, around St. Stephen's Green and Grafton Street to O'Connell Street, was successful in its campaign in getting the line to go underground, the business community on the northside has not been treated with the same respect and tolerance.  There should be a rethink in this regard.  I raised this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who agreed to look again at the matter. I would appreciate if the Minister put forward my view in the context of an overall proposal for a north-south and east-west underground line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Private funding is available for the east-west line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems this project can only be undertaken if substantial private funding is added.  There is no guarantee at this stage that we will get European funding.  The extended project will cost well in excess of £600 million, although the Minister has failed to put a figure on it.  It will be well in excess of that figure if we consider that the original funding was £114 million with a likely cost of £220 million overall.  The cost of the project has trebled because we are going underground and extending the line to the airport, Broadstone, Ballymun and Finglas.  If the Minister is prepared to embark on such substantial new development at such substantial cost, why can she not also bring that extra cost to bear on the northside?  The extra money will largely be spent on the first underground tunnel.  The Minister should take on board the full set of proposals and finalise the matter satisfactorily rather than leave this hanging and, in the process, cause further extended delay of the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to the port tunnel, which is the second area covered by this legislation.  It <Col N="1083" /> is another major and essential project for the city. When completed, it will contribute considerably to removing articulated vehicles from the city streets and allow them to travel directly with their goods to the port.  However, the proposed port tunnel has been extended past Whitehall towards the airport to facilitate residents who live adjacent to the northern entrance to the tunnel.  Why can the tunnel not also be extended at the other end?</P>
    <P>The proposed location for the entrance to the tunnel is just past Alfie Byrne Road so there will be a spaghetti junction of toll booths opposite St. Joseph's primary school in East Wall.  Only a short distance further would be required to bring the tunnel into the port, thus avoiding all residential areas on that side of the tunnel.  The Minister appears to be willing to facilitate residential areas on the northern entrance to the tunnel but not to do the same for areas at the entrance to the port.</P>
    <P>An extra section of tunnel in that location would be most desirable to ensure that pupils of the primary school are not afflicted by pollution caused by lead emissions and carbon monoxide emanating from the large vehicles which will be obliged to stop and start at the toll booths.  I hope the Minister of State will convey my remarks to the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.  I am merely expressing the concerns of people who live in the constituency about the unfinished aspects of the proposals and other issues which might infringe on our ability to deliver these proposals.  The last thing we need is further delay which simply means further congestion, traffic gridlock and more poisonous emissions for the local communities.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to support the Bill.  However, I would be grateful if the Minister of State would define what is meant by substrata and subsoil.  I also hope he will take my suggestions on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government (Mr. D. Wallace)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Senators for their contributions. This Bill addresses a number of important matters.  The Roads Act, 1993, is the legal basis for much of the infrastructural work being undertaken to meet the economic and social aspirations of the Irish people.  It is important, therefore, that when difficulties arise with the operation of that legislation, they are brought to the Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration and appropriate action.  That is the objective of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to focus on a number of key issues raised, although there will be another opportunity to consider the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I welcome the generous support of the House for the measures in the Bill.  These measures will significantly enhance the statutory basis for road development and will do it in a way <Col N="1084" /> which fully respects the concerns that can arise in relation to major road infrastructure projects.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the support of Senators for the proposal to clarify and put beyond doubt the powers of local authorities to acquire the substratum of land to facilitate the provision and maintenance of road tunnels.  This is one of the key aims of the Bill and is particularly relevant to the proposed Dublin port tunnel project.  It was inevitable that reference would be made to that proposal during the debate.  Senator Kett outlined the concerns of residents in the Marino area. These concerns are genuine and the residents are entitled to have their views and objections considered before any decision is taken on the proposal.</P>
    <P>With a view to allaying these concerns I wish to stress that this Bill does not authorise the construction of the Dublin port tunnel.  It does not even mention the proposal.  Whether the project goes ahead and in what form will be decided through the statutory motorways scheme and environmental impact assessment procedures set out in the Roads Act, 1993.  A full motorway scheme and a comprehensive environmental impact statement will have to be prepared by the corporation and submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.  The public will have to be given adequate opportunity to make submissions on the project and on its environmental impact.  A public inquiry will have to be held at which all views will be heard and a report will be prepared on the inquiry and submitted for decision.  The final decision on the proposed port tunnel will, therefore, be made on another day and is part of a different process.</P>
    <P>Senator Henry asked about the depth of the proposed port tunnel.  The Bill covers the substratum of land required for the purpose of a tunnel. The depth of any tunnel proposed to be constructed is to be decided not in the Bill but in the planning of the project involved, including the relevant statutory procedures.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to the proposal for the provision of a light rail system in Dublin.  This is an essential element of the integrated transport strategy set out in the DTI report and the Government remains committed to its provision, together with all other elements of the strategy. As with the proposed Dublin port tunnel, the proposed light rail network will be the subject of a public inquiry at which the public will have an opportunity to express its views on the route options proposed.  The purpose of this Bill is solely to provide a statutory basis for the acquisition of a substratum of land for any underground section of light rail.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to the points raised by Senator Costello and I will ensure that they are brought to the attention of the Minister for Public Enterprise, Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>During the debate, views were expressed in support of the proposed judicial review provisions. <Col N="1085" /> The rights of objectors are well protected under legislation and the Constitution.  However, there must be a cut off point where we can move away from consultation towards implementation. It is also important to stress that section 5 does not limit the consultation or public inquiry process. Judicial review is not a further consideration of objections, it is not about second guessing the Minister's decision.  The role of the courts in judicial review is to consider whether the road authority or the Minister exercised their powers and functions in accordance with the law.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on some of the main issues during this debate.  No doubt we will return to these and other issues on Committee Stage.  I thank the Senators for their contributions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Davern)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate Members of the Seanad for this timely debate on the Middle East peace process. In recent weeks the process has reached a most serious impasse.  The Government, together with our partners in the European Union, is most concerned at this development.  This debate is, accordingly, very opportune.</P>
      <P>Before exploring the current situation, however, I would first like to set this debate in its historic context.  As Senators may recall, the Middle East peace process saw the light of day in November 1991 at Madrid when a multilateral conference, co-chaired by the US and the then USSR, was opened.  The purpose of this conference was to inaugurate two separate yet parallel negotiating tracks &mdash; a bilateral one aimed at resolving problems between Israel and each of its immediate neighbours and a multilateral one designed to address regional problems on subjects such as arms control and economic development.</P>
      <P>In October 1994 the bilateral track saw a major success with an agreement between Israel and Jordan.  However, the multilateral track discussions have produced no real result to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Shortly after the Madrid Conference got under way secret talks were initiated, under the auspices of the Government of Norway, between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  These resulted in <Col N="1086" /> what has become known as the Oslo Agreement of September 1993.  This agreement was truly historic. In signing it, Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation had moved beyond their previous positions.  Israel recognised the PLO and accepted the principle of &ldquo;Land for Peace&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>For its part, the PLO recognised Israel, renounced terrorism and reaffirmed that those articles of the PLO charter which deny Israelis the right to exist were inoperative and no longer valid.  The Oslo accord, therefore, contained the essential ingredients for a just and durable settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict.</P>
    <P>We, in Ireland, and the international community generally were greatly heartened and fully supported what was seen as a major step forward. The Oslo Agreement and the secondary agreements, which came later, contained provisions which envisaged a series of Israeli redeployments from the Occupied Territories &mdash; the West Bank and Gaza &mdash; overrun by Israeli forces during the 1967 war.</P>
    <P>These redeployments were to take place simultaneously with the growth of local Palestinian self-government in the evacuated territories.  It was intended that once these redeployments were completed &mdash; and the Palestinians were hoping that by then they would have upwards of 80 per cent of the Occupied Territories under their jurisdiction &mdash; what are known as the Final Status Talks would begin to address the remaining highly contentious outstanding issues, such as water, refugees and above all the status of Jerusalem. The entire process was to be concluded by May 1999.</P>
    <P>Given the history of the Middle East since 1948 and the extremely strong and deeply rooted emotions on both sides, it was not surprising that the Oslo Agreement faced many obstacles in its implementation.  Nonetheless, progress was being made.  These obstacles were gradually being surmounted when, in November 1995, there took place the tragic murder of the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Rabin, one of the co-signatories of the Oslo Agreement.</P>
    <P>This was followed a few weeks later by a series of appalling suicide bombings in Israel with very heavy loss of civilian lives.  These events contributed to the election in May 1996 of a new government in Israel led by the more right wing Likud Party of Mr. Nethanyahu.  Prime Minister Nethanyahu, who was elected on a strong security platform, took a very different approach to the agreements than his predecessors.  Discussions with Syria about a possible Israeli-Syrian peace agreement were halted.  A number of high profile unilateral Israeli actions, such as the building of new Israeli settlements at Har Homa and Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem which were seen as particularly provocative by the Palestinian inhabitants of the occupied territories, were undertaken.  What was perceived as the relentless <Col N="1087" /> efforts of the Israeli authorities to reduce the number of Palestinians living in Jerusalem continued unabated.  The situation was further exacerbated by a number of suicide bombings undertaken by Hamas terrorists with serious loss of life.  The result was that negotiations came to a very definite halt.</P>
    <P>With the virtual collapse of dialogue between the two parties most affected, the US Administration has since last summer been making strenuous efforts, which Ireland and other European Union member states have fully supported, to restart the process.  The basis of this approach has been to link progress in redeployment by Israel with progress by the Palestinians in tackling terrorism.</P>
    <P>During a visit to the region last September, the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, tried to persuade the Israeli authorities to freeze settlement expansion but her request was, by and large, ignored.  Her visit did lead to talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Washington but these achieved very little.</P>
    <P>In recent months the US has mounted a major diplomatic effort to persuade Israel to accept proposals which it put forward with the aim of breaking the deadlock.  The US has concentrated its attempts on achieving agreement on the terms of a second redeployment.  The key element of this was that Israel would redeploy from an additional 13 per cent of the land in the occupied territories; the Palestinian Authority is currently responsible for only 3 per cent of these territories.  However, Mr. Nethanyahu is vehemently opposed to considering any redeployment exceeding 9 per cent of the territory in question.  The Palestinians, for their part, originally sought a redeployment of 30 per cent but eventually and reluctantly accepted the US figure.</P>
    <P>During the talks last month in London, the US Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright, held direct negotiations with the Israeli Prime Minister. When agreement was not reached in London, negotiations were once again resumed in Washington the following week but failed to reach a result.  Since then the US has sent a number of negotiators to the region in an attempt to keep the talks on its proposal alive.</P>
    <P>The Israeli Government recently announced it was prepared to implement Security Council Resolution 425, passed in 1978 following the first Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  This resolution called for Israel's immediate withdrawal from Lebanon at that time.  However, in the meantime the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon has become coupled with the issue of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which is Syrian territory.  There is no indication that the Israelis are yet prepared to discuss withdrawal from the Golan Heights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> The EU has played a complementary role to that of the US in supporting and promoting the peace process.  The EU remains constantly seized of the issues raised in the process which directly affect its interests, both political and economic, in the region and the subject is discussed at virtually every meeting of the General Affairs and European Council.  The Luxembourg Council of last December issued a detailed and balanced declaration calling on both sides to implement the agreements which they had entered into.  Each Presidency involves a visit to the region of the current Chairperson of the Council of Ministers. The current EU Presidency has, with the backing of the member states, been particularly active on the issue.  There were, for example, separate visits to the region by Prime Minister Blair and the British Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, since the end of February.</P>
    <P>The European Union has also made significant contributions of 700 million ECU to the Palestinian economy in terms of aid since 1993.  Indeed, the EU is the biggest contributor to the funds of the United Nations body responsible for running Palestinian refugee camps &mdash; the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA.  It has provided direct assistance to the Palestinians in the field of combating terrorism.  The EU has been particularly active in the economic sphere.  It has endeavoured to promote several projects of importance to the Palestinian side such as the development of an airport and seaport at Gaza. However, both these projects are currently being held up due to the lack of progress in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The EU role in the peace process was also enhanced when, in late 1996, during the Irish Presidency, Ambassador Moratinos was appointed EU Special Envoy.  Since then Ambassador Moratinos has endeavoured to promote a stronger EU role in the peace process and has had a series of talks with all the main parties in the region with some significant results to show for his efforts.</P>
    <P>For its part, Ireland has taken a very active interest in the Middle East situation.  We have not hesitated to speak out on issues such as the new settlements at Har Homa and Abu Ghneim or to condemn the horrific suicide attacks last year. The Irish aid programme for Palestinians offers support in the educational sector as well as providing assistance for economic and rural development. We also make a significant contribution to UNRWA.  Since its inception, we have been one of the main troop contributors to UNIFIL, the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, where nearly 40 Irish soldiers have lost their lives.</P>
    <P>Ireland also plays an active part in the internal deliberations of the EU.  The Middle East was one of the priorities of Ireland's Presidency of the EU in the second half of 1996 and we are supportive of the current active role being played by <Col N="1089" /> the UK Presidency in this context.  Ireland has, in its frequent contacts with representatives of both sides, endeavoured to encourage a spirit of greater compromise.</P>
    <P>We are conscious that time is running out for a settlement under the Oslo Agreement.  It is very clear that in spite of vigorous efforts by the US and the EU Presidency, the necessary common ground has not been found between the Israelis and the Palestinians.  Indeed, rather than having confidence that progress is being made, I am concerned that the Middle East peace process is facing its most severe crisis to date, a crisis which affects its very foundations.  There is a real and growing danger that the men of violence will again endeavour to seize their chance.  It would be tragic if the small measure of achievement made since 1993 were to be swept away by more bloodshed.</P>
    <P>Efforts are still underway to rescue the process at this eleventh hour; France and Egypt have proposed an international conference on the matter. It is too early to be optimistic about the outcome of this proposal but we are of course willing to discuss and support every effort at progress.  It is clear that progress in the Middle East peace process has been depressingly meagre.  However, it is equally clear that ultimately the final decision on the peace process will be made by the representatives of the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.  To date, the insistence on short term advantage has bedevilled the evolution of that process and the chance of longer term agreement.  In spite of the dismal record of progress to date, I am sure Members will agree that we, both nationally and with our partners in Europe, must continue to remain involved and continue to support the search for peace in the Middle East.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister of State to the House.  His speech outlined the difficulties experienced in the Middle East in recent years and the current state of affairs there. Ireland is possibly in a better position than any other EU member state to appreciate the particular difficulties surrounding a peace process and is in a unique position within the EU to adopt a more proactive role in regard to the Middle East. The Minister did not outline what the Government has done within the EU or the United Nations in recent months in this regard.  In view of the mandate the Irish people have given to the Irish peace process, we could use platforms such as the EU and the United Nations very successfully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that politicians outside of the country in which difficulties are being experienced are careful about what they say.  Sometimes politicians from other countries making statements can create difficulties.  It is important that people are prudent in what they say about any side in a situation with which they are not totally <Col N="1090" /> familiar.  On this side of the world we have certain knowledge but we are not 100 per cent familiar with the fine detail.</P>
    <P>The Oslo Agreement was the perfect formula through which peace could be achieved.  It provided an opportunity from the Israeli point of view to end the terrible loss of life in that part of the world.  From the Palestinian point of view, this agreement provided them with their homeland. Unfortunately difficulties have arisen and governments and personnel have changed.  It is easy to say that the government has taken a different approach but it is the people on the ground who elect the government.  They changed the government because they were not happy with the previous administration.  If a change of heart occurred it reflected the views of the people.  This must be recognised.</P>
    <P>The situation cannot be analysed in a simplistic manner.  There has been terrible loss of life in cities such as Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.  Equally, the Israelis have not withdrawn from the West Bank as agreed.  There may be security reasons for that. We are not in a position to make a judgment but we are in a position to make a constructive contribution.</P>
    <P>The American Government has appointed Dennis Ross as special envoy.  Hopefully, he will be as successful as Senator Mitchell was here. Eventually the people on both sides will have the opportunity to consider a proposal put to them for consideration.</P>
    <P>It is easy for the EU to castigate either side but that should not happen.  We must realise that their row is not just about land or security, it is also about tradition and symbolism.  It is important that the parties concerned talk directly. Mr. Nethanyahu and Mr. Arafat talk through intermediaries, not directly.  That is unsatisfactory because it means they receive second hand information. Senator Lanigan may find this difficult to appreciate but the reality is that Mr. Nethanyahu and Mr. Arafat should be talking directly and taking a responsible approach.  While those discussions are taking place they should ensure that no serious incident is perpetrated by either side.</P>
    <P>EU and world opinion can direct them to engage in such discussions.  It is important that this engagement starts immediately because people are being killed and the situation is intolerable. There is, however, a difficulty there.  Some of us have had the privilege of visiting Lebanon, the Syrian border, the Golan Heights and various parts of Israel.  There is inherent fear there about security.  The Golan Heights is a very strategic area.  Agreements were made in the past but not carried through.  The Israelis have not pulled back from certain points.  If you talk to them you find they are extremely concerned about incursions by Hamas from Lebanon into Israel.  These issues must be addressed but they can only be addressed by the parties themselves with the negotiator. <Col N="1091" /> Until they sit down and treat the issue seriously, it is pointless for us to talk about it in this House.</P>
    <P>However, there are problems.  In Palestine there were calls by members of the Palestinian Authority for Mr. Arafat to sack half of his Cabinet because of corruption.  There are concerns within Palestine about human rights and the judicial system.  These are realities but they are issues which should be addressed in a sensible manner by the parties concerned in the course of negotiation.</P>
    <P>As a member state of the EU we should take a more proactive role in making the EU put pressure on these two gentlemen to sit down together to discuss these issues.  We are in a position to do that.  I urge the Government to take that approach within the EU.  We have the moral responsibility to do so at this time.</P>
    <P>I welcome this discussion but it is important that we do not stick to one line of attack.  We should use our experience of the peace process here to assist the situation in the Middle East and to support and encourage the process there.  The United States Government is actively facilitating the process.  It has put forward various proposals, some of which are acceptable and others are not. It is a matter of getting round the table and thrashing out a deal because people being killed indiscriminately by all sides is intolerable.  We should not stand idly by.  I ask the Minister to speak to the Minister for Foreign Affairs about this and to be more proactive on the issue now that he has brought the peace process on this island to a successful conclusion.  His possession of the high moral ground enables him to take a more proactive position in the EU.  I look forward to the Minister returning to the House with a positive report from Minister Andrews.</P>

      <P>I asked for this debate because Israel is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> While they celebrate their 50th year, the Palestinians have experienced 50 years of catastrophe. They are the dispossessed of the Middle East and of the world.  Not so long ago people from the Ballingarry area came to the Minister and me and they were able to show us maps of the lands which were taken from them in the 1840s and 1850s.  They did not forget the dispossession which had taken place.  How can we expect the Palestinians, who have been dispossessed within the past 50 years, to do so?  No doubt an historic injustice has been perpetrated upon the Palestinians. They have suffered enormous national, social and psychological damage and lost.</P>

      <P>Half were up-rooted from their homes and went into exile while the other half remained in their homeland under a hostile Government.  In 1948 some were partially saved from the full brunt of Israeli occupation, but the aggression multiplied in 1967 when anybody who had been spared the problems of 1948 now had to face them.</P>
      <P>United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181-(II) suggested that there should be two states in the area.  This has not happened.  There is only one statelet in the area.  I acknowledge the rights of the Israelis to have a state, but the Palestinians should not suffer as a result.</P>
      <P>There are a number of things which could be said in this debate but time is limited.  If Ireland is to pursue the peace process within the EU, we must look at the trade agreement between the EU and Israel.  That agreement was made at the time of the Oslo Agreement because it was thought it might help the resolution of problems in the Middle East.  That trade agreement is a <i>de facto</i> agreement without legal standing because Belgium and France have not yet ratified it.  It should be put to the EU by the Government that unless there is a change of attitude by Israel towards what was the peace process, because there is no peace process at present, we should deny Israel its favourable trade relations with the EU.  It is about time we realised that fruit which is being grown in the settlements in the occupied territories at present is entering the EU under that trade agreement with &ldquo;Made in Israel&rdquo; written on the containers.  This is totally illegal.  It is against every principle of international trade and against the principle of the EU/Israel trade agreement. The goods enter from the settlements and no duty is paid on them.  However, if the Palestinians want to export goods, they cannot do so as was suggested in the peace accord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> The Minister mentioned in his speech the amount of money which the EU has contributed to the peace process and, in particular, to the airport and port at Gaza.  The EU has contributed 100 per cent of the moneys for the airport at Gaza which is ready for operation.  However, it cannot be made operational because the Israelis will not allow it.  This is a total waste of EU money and again it is the Israelis who are responsible.</P>
    <P>At present the peace process is going nowhere and anybody who thinks othewise is a fool.  The situation since the peace process started has been traumatic for the Palestinians.  The Palestinian people who depended on work in Israel are 33 per cent worse off than they were before the peace process started.  There has been no benefit to the Palestinian people who were migrant workers in Israel.  Since the Oslo accord the borders have been virtually closed to immigrant workers to Israel.  There were over 200,000 Palestinians working in menial low-paid jobs, for which they had to leave home at 4 a.m. and be back before the 8 p.m. curfew.  If Palestinians work in Israel they pay Israeli taxes but they get no benefits from these taxes.</P>
    <P>In and around Jerusalem settlements are increasing at an enormous rate.  In a recent television programme, Mr. Edward Said, one of the best Palestinian writers, who has been living in America for years and is terminally ill, returned to visit his homeland.  He came across some Israeli soldiers knocking down farm buildings on the outskirts of Jerusalem and the demolition of Bedouin settlements.  When he asked the army officers why they were doing it, they said they were doing it because they were told to do it.  If we go back to the history of the founding of the state of Israel and the genocide which occured in Europe against the Jews, what was the excuse always put forward by the Nazis throughout Europe, whether in Poland, Hungary or Germany? They said that they were told to do it, that they were obeying the law, and this is the excuse which is being given by the Israelis at present.</P>
    <P>Yesterday the headline to Mr. Robert Fiske's article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> was &ldquo;Middle East Faces a Summer of Hate&rdquo;.  That is a terrible headline, but unfortunately I believe it to be true. There is no point in pretending that Prime Minister Nethanyahu will sit down and deal with the problem of the Middle East and the Palestinians in a fair and equitable way.  He will not do so. The 13 per cent of the land which was supposed to be given back to the Palestinians has now been diluted.  Prime Minister Nethanyahu wants it reduced below 9 per cent and after the settlement is completed it might rise to 13 per cent. However, it is 13 per cent of land which was owned by the Palestinians, not land which was owned by the Israeli state.  This land was taken from the indigenous people of the area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Unfortunately, the Palestinians are paying the price for what was done to the Jews in Europe. We must not forget that.  If there is to be peace in the area, it is about time realism entered the debate.  The 1948 UN suggestion of two states should be implemented.  If I were the Palestinians, this year, on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, I would declare a state of Palestine.  I expect that state would be recognised internationally because if a vote of the UN set up the state of Israel, it equally set up the state of Palestine.  It is about time the Palestinians rejected all this rubbish about a peace process which is going nowhere and sat down and declared their state.  Then the world will look more favourably on the situation there.</P>
    <P>There is a second solution, that a fully democratic state should be set up on the territory which is now Israel and the West Bank in which the Palestinians and Israelis would live in harmony. Obviously, it would be hard to do.  However, if they do not do that there will be a series of cantons in the West Bank and to get from one town to another will involve crossing the Israeli border. The area is not as big as Ireland; it is only as big as two Irish provinces.  If one must leave the territory to get from one canton to another, as is the case at present, and one is stopped every ten miles to go through a border post, it is a nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State correctly stated that Israel recognised the PLO and accepted the principle of land for peace.  However, Israel now wants land and peace.  The principle of land and peace is not acceptable.  The people of the area must be able to participate in statehood.  Whether or not that is within separate Palestinian and Israeli states, it has to be built on mutual respect and ensure that the catastrophe which the Palestinians have suffered over the past 50 years will not continue for another 50 years.</P>
    <P>Since 1948, 418 villages have disappeared from Palestine.  People have keys to houses on these sites and still talk of going home.  They have the keys and the deeds but they cannot go home because of the illegal occupation.</P>
    <P>The way forward will be very difficult.  We are at a crucial point at which many would ask &ldquo;Why Palestine now&rdquo;?  The question should be &ldquo;Why not Palestine now&rdquo;?  Kosovo is not too far away and there are other areas of conflict.  However, just because a new catastrophe emerges we should not forget the Palestinians or the plight of those in Israel who want to live in peace.  These people want a future for their children and grand-children and do not want the burden of the past placed on the next generation and to continue into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>The EU-Israeli trade agreement is illegal as it has not been sanctioned.  It was introduced at the time of the Oslo Agreement to help the situation. We must ensure that Belgium and France do not <Col N="1095" /> sign this agreement until Israel recognises that the Oslo Agreement was a step into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidNorris" hpid="Mr. Norris Mr. Norris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norris</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important debate at a sensitive time.  There are many predictions of gloom but I hope that the prophecies prove unjustified.  Yesterday's <i>Irish Independent</i> included an interesting article by Robert Fisk, who is always a shrewd observer although not sympathetic to the state of Israel.  He states that some sources in Jordan and Egypt predict an explosion by the autumn but in the Lebanon they are suggesting that this will come in the summer. Perhaps these predictions are right and we must do everything possible to avoid such an explosive situation.</P>
      <P>There is no point in my attacking or denigrating Mr. Netanyahu.  I would not have voted for him had I been a citizen of Israel with voting rights.  Tragically, a man of vision &mdash; Shimon Peres &mdash; was removed from the driving seat.  If he had still been in office we would have moved much more rapidly.  However, we are stuck with Mr. Netanyahu.  Mr. Peres had a vision whereas Mr. Netanyahu is an extremely astute politician who is able to manoeuvre and has saved his neck in a number of extremely tight domestic political situations.  It looks like we are stuck with him until the natural end of this Government.  For that reason there is no point in denigrating him as that would only alienate whatever relationship exists.</P>
      <P>For practical reasons a unilateral declaration of statehood by the Palestinians, backed by the UN, might not be the most advisable development, even in the terms suggested by Senator Lanigan, who knows the region as well as I do.  When the state of Israel was called into being in 1948 by the heroic attitudes of the people of Israel and supported by the UN they were on the brink of the legitimate possession of a coherent territory and a united people.  That is not the case for Mr. Arafat.  Many would say this is unfortunate, but it is not the case.  The demography of the rump of Palestinian he now controls is such as to make the establishment of any such state unrealistic. The Gaza Strip is separated from the administrative headquarters in Jericho, sections of east Jerusalem and so on and it is not very coherent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Senator Lanigan's proposals for the reunification of the whole territory of Israel-Palestine and the creation of a fully democratic, secular state.  That is the way forward and it is what we also found to be the case in Northern Ireland.  People have to be included &mdash; one cannot keep splitting them.  However, there are great difficulties with this proposal.  First, there is the awful history of the Jewish people.  Although I intensely dislike any confessional state, I suspend some of my reservations on Israel because of that history.  I read with a degree of agreement an argument in Golda Meir's autobiography that <Col N="1096" /> after the treatment of the Jews all over the world for 19 centuries it was clear that there was no country in which they could be safe and therefore they had to have their own state.  It is regrettable that this happened.  Certain rights were abrogated among the Palestinians.  However, we cannot reverse history.  We must look at Israel; the international community has accepted its right to exist. We must start from that complex situation.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, one of the problems is that there is fundamentalism on both sides.  The Palestinians regard the 50th anniversary of the state of Israel as &ldquo;the disaster&rdquo; and have named it so in Arabic.  They do not feel able to celebrate this event and it is very difficult when these tensions exist.  The Minister of State stated:</P>
    <P>For their part, the PLO recognised Israel, renounced terrorism and reaffirmed that those articles of the PLO Charter which deny Israelis the right to exist were inoperative and no longer valid.</P>
    <P>However, has this been removed from the PLO Charter?  Perhaps this could be done.</P>
    <P>Senator Lanigan mentioned France and Belgium's ratification of the EU-Israeli trade agreement. However, look at the record of these two countries.  Their records in foreign policy and trade are as unpolluted by principle as that of any other European country and I doubt if they will take a principled stand on this matter; nor am I convinced that a hostile attitude to trade would be beneficial.  Such measures further excite the Israelis.  I agree with Senator Lanigan's comments that at least 13 per cent of territory should be ceded and that the Oslo principles must be put back on track.  If I thought that trade pressure would lead to such a result I would say yes but I do not believe that that would occur.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made to suicide bombings and this is an important element.  Invariably, Israeli extremists are uncannily parallel to republican terrorism, which is largely funded from the USA.  Any time there is a massacre of innocent Palestinians my initial reaction is to ask from what part of New York the culprits came.  It will often be the case that they are Americans who had a dream which went sour.</P>
    <P>There is a development on the other side which ought to be dealt with, which is the encouragement by religious authorities of suicide bombing. They even put a new gloss on the Koran to justify the bombings.  I greatly regret that because there are many beautiful and wise things in Islam and the Koran.  One of the leading religious commentators, Sheikh Al Azhar Muhammad Sa'ad Tantawi, said: &ldquo;One who blows himself up among enemies, in order to defend his land, is considered a martyr&rdquo;.  That was reported in the Egyptian newspaper <i>Alwafd</i> on 27 April 1996.  The same gentleman said at a widely reported meeting at the University of Alexandria that those who carry <Col N="1097" /> out suicide attacks are in a &ldquo;situation of self defence against their attacker and therefore do not regard him as an old person, child or woman&rdquo;.  These are categories of people against whom such attacks are particularly heinous.  In response to a question about the verdict of the Sharia on someone who blows himself up, he said:</P>
    <P>To those who say that this is prohibited, you must first ask what motivated the act, and why the youth are compelled to sacrifice themselves. What can we expect from the Palestinians when the Prime Minister repeats, every morning and evening, that Jerusalem is the eternal capital of Israel, when this statement contradicts logic, religion and the law? Oppression gives birth to the attack and a person on whom the oppression weighs is liable to sacrifice himself: for those with dignity prefer death to a life of submission.</P>
    <P>He further stated:</P>
    <P>.. the youth of the Islamic resistance who blow themselves up in order to cause casualties, are considered the greatest of those who die, because they die as martyrs.</P>
    <P>This view from those at the top seems to affect &mdash; not infect &mdash; young, idealistic people who undoubtedly have been the subject of discrimination in their own land and feel very bitter.</P>
    <P>According to the members of the Islamic Action Front in the Jordanian Parliament as well as several Islamic religious scholars:</P>
    <P>.. the Jews occupying today the entire land of Palestine are infidels, enemies, fighters and thieves who robbed the entire land of Palestine, including Jerusalem, and built on it their predatory entity.  Therefore it makes no difference whether they are soldiers, civilians, men or women, or to which party they belong.  The Jews are a foreign implant in Palestine who arrived there on the basis of the &ldquo;Promised Land&rdquo; ideology and they have no alternative but to destroy the Al-Aqsa mosque and build the temple in its place, and to conquer the land of the Moslems from the Nile to the Euphrates. According to religious law, it is our duty to kill these Jews, to rout them from Palestine and to imprison their supporters.</P>
    <P>It goes on to indicate that those who engage in suicide bombings merit the title of &ldquo;shahid&rdquo;, a glorious martyr.  That is an extreme and it is paralleled on the Jewish side, something I must accept.  It is a pity that when liberal rabbis appeal to the Moslem leaders not to endorse such views, they are ignored.</P>
    <P>It is important to monitor the situation.  Both Senator Lanigan and I are on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and I do not believe I am breaching confidence by saying that a visit to Palestine is contemplated.  I welcome that because it is important we go there and see the <Col N="1098" /> situation at first hand.  I was part of a delegation which visited Israel 18 months ago and it was extremely useful.  We met with Shimon Peres and realised what a tragic loss he was to the Israeli people and to the peace process.  We subsequently had a meeting with Mr. Arafat, which was the second time I met him.  He looked under considerable strain.  We could see the problem with the harbour and fully appreciate the difficulties he had in terms of both commercial and diplomatic life with the absence of a proper port and airport.  When I raised it with the Israelis, they stated that they had security concerns.  I am not expert enough to say whether those are justified but pressure could be brought to bear on the Israelis in this area.</P>
    <P>When we visited an army camp north of Tel Aviv, we met with Brigadier General Mordechai Tzur who came by helicopter from an operational command post.  We had a useful briefing with him and it was absolutely frank.  Both sides said what they wanted.  Members of the delegation published a report on which, regrettably, a spin was put by people who were not at the meeting.  It suggested that the brigadier general spent his entire time maliciously attacking and impugning the honour of the Irish troops.  This led to a hysterical outburst in the Irish press and was undoubtedly deeply embarrassing for the general. While we may not worry too much about his feelings, it is important there is this kind of open and honest discussion.  However, that will not happen if we do not treat such discussions with the respect to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that President Clinton is viewed in the Middle East as being in a weak position because he ought to be able to apply pressure.  We should also be aware that, under pressure from various sources, the Palestinian authorities have violated people's human rights. Twelve people have died in mysterious circumstance because they were arrested on suspicion of terrorist involvement.  I am not in favour of terrorism but I am in favour of human rights being extended.  I have raised issues such as detention and interrogation with the Israeli Ambassador and have received a courteous and detailed reply.</P>
    <P>The Norwegians played a crucial role in the Oslo accord.  Could we, using the resources of people in the public eye who are well disposed to the Israeli situation, discreetly attempt as a small, neutral country to initiate dialogue between the parties in the Middle East and offer the people involved a location here which would be far away from the oven-type situation in which they live? Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien has a long standing relationship with Mr. Netanyahu and it might be useful to make use of such a contact to see if we can play a small role in resolving a situation which, as Senator Lanigan said, is to the prejudice of the majority of decent people and their children. <Col N="1099" /> I felt this when I listened to the remarks about the bombing of Mahane Jehudah, the old market to which I go every Friday when I am in Israel.</P>
    <P>I often sit in Ben Yehudah Street.  A friend was sitting in a solicitor's office at the time of the last bombing.  He heard something and did not know what it was.  He saw what he thought was a football rolling down the street into the gutter.  It turned out to be a human head which belonged to one of those misguided Palestinian bombers, <Col N="1100" /> people for whom I feel compassion.  I am returning there in September.  I hope the predictions by Robert Fiske do not come true and that there will be a peaceful Middle East in the autumn.</P>
